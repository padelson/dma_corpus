simultaneously, and no such actions will be considered to be completed until
all such actions have been completed. All documents and instruments to be
delivered at Closing (including Seller's delivery of the Shares) have been
deposited with and will be held in escrow by (a) counsel for Buyer, with
respect to the Shares and other Closing deliveries of Seller, and (b) counsel
for Seller, with respect to all Closing deliveries of Buyer (other than as
contemplated by Section 2.2(b)), in each case until the Escrow Release Time.

2.4 Purchase Price Adjustments.

  

  

(a) Seller has delivered to Buyer (i) a certificate of KCC's Chief Financial
Officer (the "Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment Certificate") setting forth
the Estimated Shareholder Equity and (ii) a pro forma consolidated balance
sheet of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing Date (the "Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet"), which balance sheet sets forth Seller's good faith estimates
of each of the items presented thereon and has been prepared in accordance
with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with KCC's past practices and fairly
presents the consolidated financial position as of the Closing Date; provided,
however, that the Shareholder Equity Exclusions have not been included
therein. Buyer has reviewed and accepted the Estimated Purchase Price
Adjustment Certificate and Estimated Closing Balance Sheet for purposes of
Closing, without waiving its rights pursuant to this Section 2.4.

  

  

(b) Within five Business Days of Buyer's receipt of the audited consolidated
financial statements of KCC as of the Closing Date (but in any event no later
than 90 days after the Closing), Buyer shall deliver to Seller a certificate
setting forth, in reasonable detail, (i) the Shareholder Equity and (ii) the
Working Capital, in each case as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Purchase
Price Adjustment Certificate"), together with an audited consolidated balance
sheet of KCC as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet"), which shall
be prepared by McGladrey (which firm shall be engaged by Buyer for such
purpose), at the expense of Seller, in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis
consistent with the Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment Certificate and the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, respectively, and shall fairly present the
consolidated financial position of KCC as of the Closing Date, as adjusted to
exclude the Shareholder Equity Exclusions and, without duplication, any asset
transferred out of the Acquired Companies prior to Closing. The Closing
Purchase Price Adjustment Certificate and the Closing Balance Sheet shall be
substantially in the forms of the Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment
Certificate and the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, respectively, and shall
be prepared using the same principles, policies, procedures and methodologies
that were used in preparing the Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment
Certificate and the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, respectively.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 16 -  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(c) Seller shall have 30 days from the date on which the Closing Balance Sheet
and Closing Purchase Price Adjustment Certificate have been delivered to
Seller to raise any objection(s) to the Closing Purchase Price Adjustment
Certificate or the Closing Balance Sheet, by delivery of written notice to
Buyer setting forth such objection(s) in reasonable detail (the "Disputed
Items"). Buyer will direct and use its reasonable efforts to cause McGladrey
to give Seller and its accountants reasonable access to McGladrey's work
papers for the purpose of verifying the Closing Balance Sheet. In the event
that Seller shall not deliver any such objection(s) with respect to the
Closing Purchase Price Adjustment Certificate or the Closing Balance Sheet
within such 30-day period, then the Closing Purchase Price Adjustment
Certificate shall be deemed final for purposes of this Section 2.4 (such final
Closing Purchase Price Adjustment Certificate, the "Final Purchase Price
Adjustment Certificate"). In the event that any such objection(s) are so
delivered, the Closing Purchase Price Adjustment Certificate shall be deemed
not final, and Buyer and Seller shall attempt, in good faith, to resolve the
Disputed Items and, if they are unable to resolve all of the Disputed Items
within 15 Business Days of delivery of such notice, shall, five Business Days
thereafter (or such earlier date as mutually agreed), submit the Disputed
Items to the Chicago office of Grant Thornton LLP (the "Accountant
Arbitrator") for resolution. The Accountant Arbitrator shall resolve all
remaining Disputed Items in accordance herewith within 20 Business Days from
the date of submission. In connection with the foregoing, the Accountant
Arbitrator shall be instructed to and must (i) limit its determination(s) only
to the remaining Disputed Items, (ii) make its determination(s) as to each
remaining Disputed Item based upon the application of GAAP and as required by
this Section 2.4 and (iii) not assign a value to any remaining Disputed Item
greater than the higher value for such Disputed Item claimed by either Buyer
or Seller or less than the lower value for such Disputed Item claimed by Buyer
or Seller. All determinations by the Accountant Arbitrator shall be final and
binding upon the parties for purposes of this Section 2.4 absent fraud or
manifest error. The fees and expenses of the Accountant Arbitrator shall be
allocated between Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, based
upon the extent to which each party prevailed, as determined by the Accountant
Arbitrator. Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that any adjustment made
under this Section 2.4(c) is and shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for income tax purposes. The terms "Final Shareholder Equity"
and "Final Working Capital" shall mean, respectively, the definitive
Shareholder Equity and Working Capital as of the Closing Date agreed to (or
deemed to be agreed to) by Buyer and Seller in accordance with this Section
2.4(c) or resulting from the determinations made by the Accountant Arbitrator
in accordance with this Section 2.4(c) (in addition to those items theretofore
agreed to by Buyer and Seller).

  

  

(d) At such time as the Closing Purchase Price Adjustment Certificate shall
become the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Certificate in accordance with
Section 2.4(c):

  

  

(i) the Final Shareholder Equity shall be compared to the Shareholder Equity
Target to determine the Final Shareholder Equity Adjustment. In the event that
the Final Shareholder Equity Adjustment shall be a number greater than the
Estimated Shareholder Equity Adjustment, Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount
equal to such difference. In the event that the Final Shareholder Equity
Adjustment is less than the Estimated Shareholder Equity Adjustment, Seller
shall pay Buyer an amount equal to such difference; and

  

  

(ii) the Final Working Capital shall be compared to the Working Capital Target
to determine the Final Working Capital Adjustment, if any. Seller shall pay to
Buyer the amount of the Final Working Capital Adjustment, if any.

  

  

Any payment to be made pursuant to this Section 2.4(d) shall be made within 10
Business Days from the date that the Final Purchase Price Adjustment
Certificate is finally determined pursuant to Section 2.4(c), by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the
intended recipient of such funds. In the event that any payment is required to
be made to Buyer pursuant to this Section 2.4(d), Buyer may elect, at its sole
option, to cause the Escrow Agent to release to Buyer from the Escrow Account
an amount in cash equal to the obligation of Seller under this Section 2.4(d)
and, if Buyer so elects, Seller shall execute with Buyer a Joint Written
Instruction (as such term is defined in the Escrow Agreement) sufficient to
cause the Escrow Agent to effectuate such release. If any amount is paid from
the Escrow Account to Buyer with respect to any obligation of Seller under
this Section 2.4(d), Seller shall be obligated to replenish the Escrow Account
with respect thereto by promptly depositing additional funds in the amount of
any such payment into the Escrow Account to be held and administered in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement. Any payment due to Seller which is not
paid by Buyer within 10 Business Days from the date that the Final Purchase
Price Adjustment Certificate is finally determined pursuant to Section 2.4(c)
shall bear interest at 10% per annum (or, if lesser, the maximum rate
permitted by applicable Law) until paid in full.

From time to time on and after the Closing Date, and without any further
consideration, the parties hereto shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, execute and deliver such other instruments of conveyance,

requesting party may reasonably request in order to evidence and effectuate
the Transactions.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 44 -

(a) The parties acknowledge that, prior to the Closing, KCC has distributed to
Seller (i) the right to receive the TrAIL Payments, (ii) the assets related to
the Excluded Joint Ventures and (iii) the Specified Receivables. Such items
will be reported by Seller on its Tax Returns and not by Buyer, KCC or any of
the Acquired Companies on their Tax Returns. After the Closing, Buyer and KCC
shall promptly forward to Seller any communication either of them receives
with respect to any matter related to the Excluded Assets or the Excluded
Contracts and shall follow the reasonable directions of Seller with respect to
responding to such communications.

  

  

(b) If KCC receives any TrAIL Payment, it shall act as nominee and agent for
Seller and promptly remit such amount to Seller (when reasonably possible by
endorsing and delivering the same to Seller without first depositing it in
KCC's bank account), without, except as may be required by applicable Law,
withholding for Taxes; provided, however, that Seller shall be responsible for
the unreimbursable costs (i) approved by Seller in writing and associated with
satisfying the TrAIL Project scope of work conditions (but not any change
orders, costs for FAA lighting, new work orders, contingent Liabilities or
unapproved costs), (ii) approved by Seller in writing to collect such TrAIL
Payment, and (iii) arising or resulting from or relating to the matters set
forth on Schedule 6.2 (collectively, the "TrAIL Costs")). If any TrAIL Cost is
not paid by Seller within 10 Business Days of notice by KCC or Buyer to
Seller, KCC may offset such amounts against the TrAIL Payment. Any costs of
the type described in clauses (i) through (iii) above shall be deemed for
purposes of this Section 6.2(b) to be unreimbursable until such time as KCC
shall have received reimbursement therefor and to the extent that KCC does not
fully offset any TrAIL Costs against the TrAIL Payments, such unreimbursed
costs shall constitute "Unsatisfied TrAIL Costs" for purposes of this
Agreement. KCC may also offset against the TrAIL Payment any portion thereof
to which Karl Miller is entitled pursuant to any profit sharing arrangement
relating thereto entered into by Seller or KCC prior to the Closing if Seller
has not paid or made appropriate arrangements to pay such amounts.

to, and shall assist Seller in its efforts to, (i) transfer ownership of the
Excluded Life Insurance Policies to Seller or its designees and (ii) assign
the Excluded Contracts to Seller or its designees. If Buyer or any of the
Acquired Companies receives any money or other asset with respect to the
Excluded Life Insurance Policies, Buyer and KCC shall act as nominee and agent
for Seller and promptly remit such amount to Seller (when reasonably possible
by endorsing and delivering the same to Seller without first depositing it in
such recipient's bank account), or otherwise confer custody of such other
asset to Seller or its designees. Prior to the assignment of the Excluded
Contracts to Seller or its designees as contemplated by this Section 6.2(c),
Seller shall pay or cause to be paid all amounts due pursuant to such Excluded
Contracts through the date of assignment.

  

  

(d) KCC shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Excluded
Joint Ventures sponsored by KCC to maintain insurance coverage consistent with
past practice, in each case to the extent that Seller agrees in advance to the
cost of such insurance, and (ii) provide evidence of such insurance to Seller.
KCC shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all Losses
related to the Excluded Joint Ventures and (ii) cause each Excluded Joint
Venture that is sponsored by KCC to convene an in-person meeting at least once
every six months and permit Patrick Kenny (or another individual designated by
Seller) to attend such meeting.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 45 -  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(e) If Buyer or any of the Acquired Companies receives any money or other
asset with respect to the Excluded Joint Ventures, Buyer and KCC shall cause
the recipient to act as nominee and agent for Seller and promptly remit such
amount to Seller (when reasonably possible by endorsing and delivering the
same to Seller without first depositing it in such recipient's bank account),
or otherwise confer custody of such other asset to Seller or its designees,
without, except as may be required by applicable Law, withholding for Taxes;
provided, however, KCC shall have the right to retain any such money or other
asset with respect to the Excluded Joint Ventures such that, after KCC remits
such payment to Seller, the aggregate net asset value with respect to the
Excluded Joint Ventures held by KCC shall be an amount equal to the product of
(i) two multiplied by (ii) the aggregate negative partnership capital of such
Excluded Joint Ventures held by KCC (the "Permitted Retention"). If the amount
of the Permitted Retention declines at any time, KCC shall promptly remit such
excess to Seller, without, except as may be required by applicable Law,
withholding for Taxes.

  

  

(f) KCC shall provide Seller with access to records and personnel sufficient
to permit Seller to prepare the tax returns for the KMMK joint venture and the
KCC-sponsored Excluded Joint Ventures (the "JV Tax Returns"). To the extent
that Buyer or any Acquired Company reasonably incurs any out-of-pocket expense
after the Closing in connection with any Excluded Asset or the preparation of
the JV Tax Returns, which are not paid by Seller within 10 Business Days of
notice by KCC or Buyer, Buyer or such Acquired Company shall have the right to
offset such expense against any payments otherwise owing to Seller pursuant to
this Section 6.2.

  

  

(g) All amounts to be delivered by KCC to Seller under this Section 6.2 shall
be delivered to Seller within 30 days after receipt or, with respect to
Permitted Retention amounts, the date on which such amount is no longer
Permitted Retention. Any such amounts not delivered to Seller within such
30-day period shall bear interest at 10% per annum (or, if lesser, the maximum
rate permitted by applicable Law). The parties agree that all amounts
allocated to any Acquired Company as nominee and agent for Seller pursuant to
this Section 6.2 shall be included only in Seller's Tax Returns.

(and permit Seller and its authorized Representatives to make copies thereof)
to the extent relating to (i) the Business of the Acquired Companies prior to
the Closing Date, (ii) the preparation of the Closing Purchase Price
Adjustment Certificate or (iii) the defense of any pending or threatened
litigation, investigation or proceedings, in connection with operations of the

making such personnel available being reimbursed by Seller, but no
reimbursement being required for the salaries, wages, bonuses or other
compensation of such personnel during such periods;

  

  

(c) until the seven-year anniversary of the Closing Date, in the event that
Buyer or any of the Acquired Companies desires to destroy such records, Buyer
or KCC shall first give 90 days prior written notice to Seller of such desire
and Seller shall have the right at its option and expense, upon prior written
notice given to Buyer or KCC within that 90 day period, to take possession of
the records within 180 days after the date of such notice;

  

  

(d) during the six-month period beginning on the Closing Date, KCC shall give
Seller and its authorized Representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours and under reasonable circumstances to all accounting and
business records of Seller and its Affiliates located on KCC's premises or
under its control, at no charge to Seller, and permit Seller and its
authorized Representatives to make copies thereof or, to the extent they
relate to Seller and its Affiliates, to remove the same; and

  

  

(e) Seller shall and shall cause its 401(k) Plan recordkeeper and trustee to
take all actions necessary to process the rollover distributions from the
Kenny 401(k) Plan contemplated by Section 4.29(d).

  

  

6.4 Release.

  

  

(a) Effective as of the Closing, Seller hereby irrevocably waives, releases
and discharges on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (other than the Acquired
Companies), and shall cause its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies)
not to assert, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any claims,
or take or bring any Legal Proceedings, against the Acquired Companies in
relation to any and all Liabilities, including any Liabilities relating to the
Excluded Assets, of whatever kind or nature, in law, equity or otherwise,
arising from, connected or related to, caused by or based on any facts,
conduct, activities, agreements, transactions, events or occurrences known or
unknown, of any type that existed, occurred, happened, arose or transpired
from the beginning of time through the Closing (collectively, the "Released
Liabilities"); provided, however, the Released Liabilities shall not include
any Liabilities arising out of or under this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document or arising under any Employee Benefit Plan or, with
respect to Patrick Kenny, any right to indemnification for actions taken in
his capacity as an officer or director of the Acquired Companies.

6.5 Replacement of Bonds, Letters of Credit and Guarantees on Current
Projects.

  

  

(a) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall use reasonable efforts, which will
not include the payment of any consent fee or similar amount, but which will
include the provision of substitute security of like character, quality and
amount, to obtain the release of Seller and its Affiliates from their
obligations under those bonds, letters of credit, surety arrangements,
guarantees and assurances that are identified on Schedule 6.5(a)
(collectively, the "Buyer Transitional Support Agreements"). Buyer will
consult with Seller from time to time concerning the progress made with
respect to any such releases, and will permit Seller reasonable participation
in such process. Seller shall cause each of the Buyer Transitional Support
Agreements to remain in effect in accordance with its terms until its
scheduled expiration or such earlier time as Buyer shall have obtained the
release of Seller and its Affiliates from their obligations thereunder
pursuant to this Section 6.5(a). Until such time as Buyer shall have obtained
the release of Seller and its Affiliates from their obligations under the
Buyer Transitional Support Agreements pursuant to this Section 6.5(a), Buyer
will reimburse Seller and its Affiliates for all premiums, maintenance fees
and similar carrying costs of Buyer Transitional Support Agreements that are
attributable to post Closing periods promptly after receipt of invoices
therefor and shall indemnify Seller and its Affiliates for any Losses
associated with such Buyer Transitional Support Agreements to the extent such
Losses are attributable to post-Closing periods.

  

  

(b) From and after the Closing, Seller shall use reasonable efforts, which
will not include the payment of any consent fee or similar amount, but which
will include the provision of substitute security of like character, quality
and amount, to obtain the release of KCC from its obligations under those
bonds, letters of credit, surety arrangements, guarantees and assurances that
are identified on Schedule 6.5(b) (collectively, the "Seller Transitional
Support Agreements"). Seller will consult with KCC from time to time
concerning the progress made with respect to any such releases, and will
permit KCC reasonable participation in such process. KCC shall cause each of
the Seller Transitional Support Agreements to remain in effect in accordance
with its terms until its scheduled expiration or such earlier time as Seller
shall have obtained the release of KCC from its obligations thereunder
pursuant to this Section 6.5(b). Until such time as Seller shall have obtained
the release of KCC from its obligations under the Seller Transitional Support
Agreements pursuant to this Section 6.5(b), Seller will reimburse KCC for all
premiums, maintenance fees and similar carrying costs of Seller Transitional
Support Agreements that are attributable to post-Closing periods promptly
after receipt of invoices therefor and shall indemnify KCC for any Losses
associated with such Seller Transitional Support Agreements to the extent such
Losses are attributable to post-Closing periods.

  

  

6.6 Medical Coverage.

  

  

Buyer agrees to provide continuation coverage under Buyer's group medical plan
to John E. Kenny, Jr., James C. Kenny, Phillip B. Kenny and Joan Kenny Rose
(and those of their eligible dependents under the Kenny Industries Inc.
Medical Plan who are covered under such plan as of the Closing Date)
(collectively, the "Kenny Participants") for a period not to exceed 18 months
following the Closing, in each case subject to the timely payment by such
person of premiums in an amount equal to the corresponding premium for COBRA
Coverage under Buyer's group medical plan. In addition, Buyer agrees to offer
continuation medical coverage under Buyer's group medical plan to each
individual (other than any Kenny Participant) who is a current or former
employee of an Acquired Company (or a dependent of such an individual) and who
either (a) is receiving COBRA Coverage under the Kenny Industries, Inc.
Medical Plan as of the Closing Date, or (b) is, as of the Closing Date,
eligible to elect COBRA Coverage under the Kenny Industries Inc. Medical Plan,
in each case for the applicable remaining period of COBRA Coverage and subject
to the timely payment by such individual of premiums in an amount equal to the
corresponding premium for COBRA Coverage under Buyer's group medical plan.

ARTICLE VII 
 CERTAIN TAX MATTERS

  

  

7.1 Tax Indemnification.

  

  

Seller hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the Buyer Indemnified
Parties (as hereinafter defined) harmless for any and all Losses incurred or
sustained by a Buyer Indemnified Party (as hereinafter defined) in connection
with any claim or any action or proceeding between a Buyer Indemnified Party
and Seller or between a Buyer Indemnified Party and any third party whether or
not involving a third-party claim, relating to or arising out of (a) all Taxes
of or imposed on the Acquired Companies for all taxable periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date and the portion of the taxable period through the
end of the Closing Date for any taxable period that includes (but does not end
on) the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Tax Period") including, without
limitation, any Taxes imposed under Section 1374 of the Code (and any state or
local statutes that are comparable or equivalent to Section 1374 of the Code)
that are the liability of Seller to the extent any of the Acquired Companies
may be held liable for such Taxes by any Taxing Authority as a transferee or
successor, or pursuant to applicable Law; (b) all Taxes of any member of an
affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which any of the
Acquired Companies or Seller (or any predecessor of such Company or Seller) is
or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar Law; or (c)
any liability for the payment of any Taxes of any other Person for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period arising (i) under any tax sharing or indemnity agreement or
(ii) as a successor or as a transferee by operation of law.

  

  

7.2 Straddle Period.

  

  

In the case of any taxable period that includes, but does not end on, the
Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), subject to Section 7.7, (a) the amount of
any Taxes based on or measured by income or receipts of the Acquired
Companies; employment, social security or other similar Taxes; and any sales,
use and other similar Taxes for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined
based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the
Closing Date, and (b) the amount of other Taxes of the Acquired Companies for
a Straddle Period that relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to
be the amount of such Tax for such entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of days in the taxable
period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which shall be the
total number of days in such Straddle Period.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 49 -  

  

 

 

  

 

  

7.3 Asset Acquisition and Allocation of Purchase Price for Tax Purposes.

  

  

(a) Seller is a validly electing S corporation within the meaning of Code
Section 1361(a)(1) (and any corresponding or similar provision of state or
local Tax Law) and the Acquired Companies (other than wholly-owned domestic
limited liability companies or joint ventures or partnerships the interests in
which are being sold hereunder and are treated as either "disregarded
entities" or partnerships for income Tax purposes) are "qualified subchapter S
subsidiaries" of Seller or an Acquired Company within the meaning of Code
Section 1361(b)(3) (and any corresponding or similar provision of state or
local Tax Law). Therefore, the parties hereto acknowledge that, as required by
Code Section 1361(b)(3)(C)(ii) and the Treasury Regulations issued thereunder
(and any corresponding or similar provisions of state or local Tax Law), the
purchase of the Shares by Buyer from Seller will be treated for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes (and, as applicable, state and local income Tax purposes)
as the taxable sale by Seller to Buyer of the Acquired Assets and the
assumption by Buyer from Seller of all of the assumed liabilities, rather than
the sale of the Shares.

  

  

(b) Attached as Schedule 7.3(b) (the "Seller's Acquisition Allocation
Schedule") is Seller's allocation of the portions of Purchase Price and the
projected amount of assumed liabilities ("Allocable Amount") among the
Acquired Assets as of the Closing Date in accordance with Code Section 1060
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder that is allocable to assets resulting
in ordinary income to Seller and its shareholders (including, but not limited
to, fixed assets, backlog, and non-competition agreements) (the "Specified
Assets"). Except as provided below, each of Buyer, KCC, and Seller agrees to
report (and to cause its Affiliates to report) the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement as a taxable sale and purchase of the Acquired Assets and
assumption of the assumed liabilities and to allocate the Allocable Amount
among the Acquired Assets in accordance with Seller's Acquisition Allocation
Schedule and agree not to take any position inconsistent with the treatment of
the transactions contemplated hereunder as a taxable sale and purchase of the
Acquired Assets and assumption of the assumed liabilities or the allocation of
the Allocable Amount according to Seller's Acquisition Allocation Schedule in
any Tax Return (including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 and any
comparable forms for state, local and foreign Tax purposes), in any Tax refund
claim or in any administrative or judicial proceeding related thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, on or prior to the date that is 120 days after
Closing, (i) Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a statement (the
"Buyer's Acquisition Allocation Schedule") on Internal Revenue Service Form
8594 (or successor form), reasonably allocating the Allocable Amount among the
Acquired Assets (including the Specified Assets) as of the Closing Date in
accordance with Code Section 1060 and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (and
any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law),
and (ii) Buyer shall make the payments specified in Section 7.3(c) to Seller
to compensate Seller and its shareholders for additional Taxes payable by them
as a result of Buyer's (or the appraiser's) purchase price allocation related
to the Specified Assets. Subject to the following two sentences, each of
Buyer, KCC, and Seller shall report (and to cause its Affiliates to report)
the Transactions as a taxable sale and purchase of the Acquired Assets and to
allocate the Allocable Amount among the Acquired Assets in accordance with
Buyer's Acquisition Allocation Schedule, and agree not to take any position
inconsistent with such treatment of the transactions contemplated hereunder as
a taxable sale and purchase of the Acquired Assets and assumption of the
assumed liabilities or the allocation of the Allocable Amount according to
Buyer's Acquisition Allocation Schedule in any Tax Return (including Internal
Revenue Service Form 8594 and any comparable forms for state, local and
foreign Tax purposes), in any Tax refund claim or in any administrative or
judicial proceeding related thereto. If within 30 days of receipt of the
Buyer\'s Acquisition Allocation Schedule, the Seller provides written notice
indicating that it disagrees with any amounts allocated to "fixed assets"
(commonly known as plant, property and equipment) thereon, the parties will
discuss such disagreements in good faith in an effort to agree upon the proper
such amounts, and if the parties cannot reach agreement within 30 days of such
notice, the disputed items will be referred to an accredited firm of valuation
experts (selected by Seller, subject to the consent of Buyer, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Buyer\'s Allocation
Schedule shall be amended to conform to any agreement of the parties or
determination of the valuation experts under the preceding sentence. Each of
Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with the valuation experts and provide the
valuation experts with such information relevant to the valuation experts'
determinations as the valuation experts may reasonably request or such party
may otherwise deem to be appropriate. In the event the Allocable Amount is
adjusted in accordance with any provision of this Agreement after the Closing,
the Seller's Acquisition Allocation Schedule or Buyer's Acquisition Allocation
Schedule, as applicable, shall be appropriately adjusted to take into account
such adjustment and the parties shall cooperate in the filing and preparation
of any supplemental Forms 8594 (and any comparable forms for state, local and
foreign Tax purposes) as may be required to report such adjustments.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 50 -  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(c) For purposes of Section 7.3(b), the payment by Buyer to Seller shall be
equal to the sum of the following: (i) if the amounts allocated on the Buyer's
Acquisition Allocation Schedule to fixed assets listed on Schedule 7.3(c) that
are not associated with a joint venture exceed the amounts allocated to such
assets on the Seller's Acquisition Allocation Schedule, 51.25% of such excess
up to $521,316, plus 25% of any remaining excess; (ii) if the amounts
allocated on the Buyer's Acquisition Allocation Schedule to fixed assets
listed on Schedule 7.3(c) not described in clause (i) exceed the amounts
allocated to such assets on the Seller's Acquisition Allocation Schedule, 25%
of such excess; (iii) if the amounts allocated on the Buyer's Acquisition
Allocation Schedule to fixed assets of non-sponsored joint ventures exceed the
tax basis of such fixed assets, 25% of such excess; and (iv) if the amounts
allocated on the Buyer's Acquisition Allocation Schedule to inventory,
backlog, non-competition agreements or any other intangible assets the sale of
which would give rise to ordinary income for Seller exceed the amounts
allocated to such assets on the Seller's Acquisition Allocation Schedule, 25%
of such excess. It is the intent of the parties that amounts paid under this
Section 7.3(c) shall represent an adjustment to the Purchase Price, which
shall be allocated to goodwill on Buyer's Acquisition Allocation Schedule, and
the parties will report such payments consistent with such intent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the first sentence of this Section
7.3(c), Buyer shall not have to make a payment to Seller related to a purchase
price allocation to fixed assets under clauses (i) and (ii) above until and
unless the amounts allocated to the fixed assets listed on Schedule 7.3(c)
exceed (x) for assets described in clause (i), $10,650,000; or (y) for fixed
assets described in clause (ii), an amount corresponding to a total value for
such assets to the sponsored joint ventures holding such assets of $33,950,000
(of which Seller's share is $21,847,048). In addition, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the first sentence of this Section 7.3(c), Buyer
shall have no obligation to make a payment to Seller related to a purchase
price allocation to fixed assets under clause (iii) to the extent the
cumulative amounts due under such clause would exceed $500,000 in the
aggregate, except to the extent of (and at the time of the receipt of) the net
proceeds to Buyer and Buyer's Affiliates from the sale of the assets described
in clause (iii) in excess of $500,000. For example, if Buyer's Acquisition
Allocation Schedule allocates $600,000 in excess of Seller's allocation on
Seller's Acquisition Allocation Schedule to assets described in clause (i),
and if the portion of such excess over the threshold described in clause (x)
of $10,650,000 equals $500,000, then Buyer's payment under this Section 7.3(c)
shall equal 51.25% of $500,000, or $256,250. If Buyer's Acquisition Allocation
Schedule allocates $900,000 in excess of Seller's allocation on Seller's
Acquisition Allocation Schedule to assets described in clause (ii) related to
sponsored joint ventures, and if the portion of this excess corresponding to
the Seller's share of the total value for such assets over the threshold
described in clause (y) of $21,847,048 equals $600,000, then Buyer's payment
under this Section 7.3(c) shall equal 25% of $600,000, or $150,000.

7.4 Tax Periods Ending on or before the Closing Date.

  

  

Seller shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and file (or cause to be filed)
all Tax Returns for the Acquired Companies or in which the Acquired Companies
are required to be included for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing
Date that are filed after the Closing. Seller shall be able to use employees
of the Acquired Companies free of charge to help with the preparation of such
Tax Returns, but Seller shall bear any expenses for any third parties that
Seller contracts to help in the preparation of such Tax Returns. Seller shall
use reasonable efforts to deliver each such Tax Return, in a form ready to be
filed, to Buyer, for review and comment, at least 20 Business Days before the
due date (including extensions) of any such Tax Return. Buyer at its expense
shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and file (or cause to be filed) all
Straddle Period Tax Returns for the Acquired Companies, and such Straddle
Returns shall be prepared consistent with prior practices of the Acquired
Companies if such prior practices are consistent with applicable Law,
provided, however, any Straddle Period Tax returns for any joint venture which
is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income Tax purposes (or any
corresponding or similar provision of state or local Tax Law) shall be filed
in accordance with the terms of each applicable joint venture agreement in
accordance with prior practices and otherwise applicable Tax Law. Buyer shall
use reasonable efforts to deliver each such Straddle Period Tax Returns, in a
form ready to be filed, to Seller for review and comment, at least 20 Business
Days before the due date (including extensions) of any such Straddle Period
Tax Returns. Buyer shall make any changes suggested by Seller to the extent
such changes are in accordance with the prior practice of the Companies and
are in accordance with applicable Law. For all Tax Returns for which it is
responsible under this Section 7.4, (a) Seller shall notify Buyer of any
respect in which such Tax Returns will be not consistent with prior practice
of the Acquired Companies, and (b) shall consider in good faith all comments
submitted by Buyer. For all returns for which it is responsible under this
Section 7.4, Buyer shall notify Seller of any respect in which such Tax
Returns will be not consistent with prior practice of the Acquired Companies,
and (b) shall consider in good faith all comments submitted by Seller.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 52 -  

  

 

 

  

 

  

7.5 Post-Closing Actions.

  

  

Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, make any
election under Treasury Regulation 301.7701-3 (or any analogous or similar
state or local, or foreign law or regulation) for any of the Acquired
Companies effective on or before the Closing Date. Except as required by
applicable law determined by a court, Buyer shall not, and shall not permit
the Acquired Companies to, (i) take any action on or after the Closing Date
other than in the Ordinary Course of Business, including but not limited to
the sale of any assets or the payment of any dividend or distribution or the
effectuation of any redemption, that could give rise to any Tax liability of
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller, or indemnification obligation of Seller
under Article VII or Article VIII, or (ii) make or change any material Tax
election, amend any Tax Return, take any Tax position on any Tax Return, or
compromise or settle any Tax liability, in each case if such action could have
the effect of increasing the Tax liability or reducing any Tax benefit of
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller, without the prior written permission of
Seller, which may be withheld in Seller's sole discretion. Seller shall be
entitled to retain, or receive prompt payment from Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) of, any refund or credit with
respect to Taxes (including refunds and credits arising by reason of amended
Tax Returns filed after the Closing Date or otherwise) with respect to any Tax
period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date related to
the Acquired Companies, actually received by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies).

  

  

7.6 Tax Proceedings.

  

  

Within a reasonable time (but not more than 10 Business Days) after Buyer
receives written notice of any Tax contest, audit or other proceeding relating
to a taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date or to a Straddle
Period (a "Pre-Closing Tax Contest"), Buyer will notify or cause the Acquired
Companies to notify Seller in writing of such Pre-Closing Tax Contest. Any
failure or delay on the part of Buyer to give such notice shall not affect
whether Seller is liable hereunder except and to the extent that Seller is
prejudiced thereby. If such Tax Contest relates solely to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period (or if such Tax Contest relates to the 2012 calendar year), Seller will
have the right, at Seller's expense, to control the defense of such Pre-
Closing Tax Contest, and Buyer shall have the right to cooperate at its own
expense. Otherwise, with respect to a Straddle Period, Seller shall have the
right to participate, at its own expense.

  

  

7.7 Transfer and Other Taxes.

  

  

Buyer and Seller shall each bear 50% of any sales, use, transfer, real estate
transfer, controlling interest transfer, value added, gross receipts,
recording, stamp, documentary and other similar Taxes, if any, arising out of
the Transactions ("Transfer Taxes"). In addition, all personal property, ad
valorem or other similar Taxes (other than and excluding income Taxes)
("Property Taxes") levied with respect to the Acquired Assets for a taxable
period which includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date shall be
apportioned between Buyer and Seller based on the number of days included in
such period through (and which includes) the Closing Date and the number of
days included in such period after the Closing Date, and Buyer and Seller
shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns with respect to Taxes
addressed in this Section 7.7. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, Seller shall be solely responsible for any Transfer Taxes or Property
Taxes attributable to the distribution of the Excluded Assets.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 53 -  

  

 

 

  

 

  

7.8 Cooperation on Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Buyer and Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and
any audit, litigation or other administrative or judicial proceeding with
respect to Taxes pursuant to this Section 7.8(a). Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the other party's request) the provision of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit,
litigation or such other proceeding and making employees or Representatives
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any materials provided hereunder. Buyer (after the Closing)
shall retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to
the Acquired Companies, and will cause each of the Acquired Companies to
retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to such
Acquired Company, relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing
Date until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (or, if
there is no such limitation, for at least seven years) for the respective
taxable periods, and shall abide by all record retention agreements entered
into with any Taxing Authority.

  

  

(b) Buyer and Seller will cooperate with each other and will take all such
actions and steps as are mutually satisfactory to the parties to reduce or
minimize applicable state and local sales, transfer or other comparable Taxes
in connection with the Transactions, provided that any such request will not
unduly delay the Transactions. Buyer will provide to Seller such records and
information as Seller reasonably requests for the preparation of any Tax
Returns for the Acquired Companies or in which the Acquired Companies are
required to be included, for any taxable period ending on the Closing Date or
the 2012 tax year, or for Seller's 2012 taxable year.

  

  

7.9 Treatment of Certain Payments.

  


  Buyer, KCC and Seller agree that, for avoidance of doubt, the Miller
Deferred Compensation Amount, the Closing Retention Bonus Amount and the
bonuses paid by KCC to employees prior to or at Closing in accordance with
Section 4.29(f) shall be reflected on Seller's tax return that includes the
Acquired Companies through the Closing Date.

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Article VIII, Seller hereby agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Acquired Companies), and each of their respective
Representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified
Parties") against and in respect of any and all losses, liabilities, damages,
actions, suits, proceedings, claims, demands, orders, assessments, amounts
paid in settlement, fines, costs or deficiencies, including, without
limitation, interest, penalties and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs
(collectively, "Losses"), caused by or resulting or arising from, or otherwise

(v) the Company Indebtedness or Transaction Expenses, in each case to the
extent not given effect in the calculation of the Purchase Price.

  

  

provided, however, that Seller shall only be responsible for indemnifying any
Buyer Indemnified Party for 50% of Losses caused by or resulting or arising
from, or otherwise with respect to, the Acura Matter.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Seller shall
not be liable to Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect to a claim for
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(i): (i) unless and until, and only
to the extent that, the aggregate amount of all Losses otherwise indemnifiable
exceeds an aggregate threshold amount hereunder of $1,000,000 (the "Basket

or punitive damages paid by an Indemnified Party to a third party in
connection with the resolution of a Third-Party Claim) and (ii) the amount of
indemnity payable pursuant to this Section 8.1 with respect to any Losses

such Loss amount has already been taken into account in determining the
Purchase Price.

  

  

(d) The Escrow Amount shall remain in escrow and subject to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement until termination or expiration in accordance with the terms
thereof. At any time and from time to time that Buyer shall be entitled to

from the Escrow Amount in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

(i) failure of any of the representations and warranties made by Buyer in this
Agreement to be true and correct as of the Closing (or an earlier date
specified therein); or

  

  

(ii) the breach by Buyer of any covenant or other agreement made by Buyer in
this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Buyer shall not
be liable to Seller Indemnified Parties with respect to a claim for
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i): (i) unless and until, and only
to the extent that, the aggregate amount of all Losses otherwise indemnifiable
exceeds the Basket Amount, up to an aggregate maximum indemnity amount
hereunder equal to the Cap, except that the foregoing limitations shall not
apply to claims respecting the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 5.1 (Approval of Agreement and Transactions), Section 5.2 (Buyer's
Existence and Good Standing; Authority; Binding Obligation; No Conflicts or
Restrictions), Section 5.3 (No Governmental Authority Restrictions) and
Section 5.5 (No Investment Banker's, Broker's or Finder's Fees) or fraud; and
(ii) unless such claim is asserted in writing on or prior to the Survival
Expiration Date.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 56 -  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Losses shall not include any consequential
damages that are not reasonably foreseeable or special, indirect or punitive
damages (other than any consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages
paid by an Indemnified Party to a third party in connection with the
resolution of a Third-Party Claim).

  

  

8.3 Indemnification Procedure.

  

  

All claims for indemnification under Sections 8.1 and 8.2 hereof shall be
asserted and resolved as set forth in this Section 8.3:

  

  

(a) Except with respect to any matters related to Taxes, which shall be
governed by Section 7.6 of this Agreement, in the event that any claim for
which a party (the "Indemnifying Party") may be liable to the other party (the
"Indemnified Party") hereunder is asserted against an Indemnified Party by a
third party (a "Third-Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall with
reasonable promptness notify the Indemnifying Party of such Third-Party Claim,
specifying the nature of such Third-Party Claim and the amount or the
estimated amount thereof to the extent then feasible (which estimate shall not
be conclusive of the final amount of such Third-Party Claim) (the "Claim
Notice"); provided, however, that failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party
shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the Indemnifying Party's
obligations with respect thereto, except to the extent that such failure
prejudices the Indemnifying Party's ability or right to defend the claim or
otherwise results in actual loss. The Indemnifying Party, if the Indemnifying
Party so elects, shall assume and control the defense of the Third-Party
Claim; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right
to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim that involves criminal
allegations or in any manner involves any injunctive relief against an
Indemnified Party that, if successful, would reasonably be expected to
materially adversely affect the Indemnified Party or the operations of the
Acquired Companies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnified Party shall
have the right to employ separate counsel, reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnifying Party, and to participate in the defense of any claim, but the
fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified
Party unless (i) such Indemnified Party shall have been advised by counsel
that a conflict of interest is likely to exist if the same counsel were to
represent such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, or (ii) the
Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense or, after electing to
defend such claim, has failed to actively defend the Third Party Claim, in
which case the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of
one separate firm of attorneys for the Indemnified Party. In no event shall
the Indemnified Party pay or enter into any settlement of any claim or consent
to any judgment with respect to any claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) if such settlement or judgment would require the
Indemnifying Party to pay any amount. Except with respect to claims relating
to the Acura Matter, the Indemnifying Party may enter into a settlement or
consent to any judgment without the consent of the Indemnified Party so long
as (i) such settlement or judgment involves monetary damages only and (ii) a
term of the settlement or judgment is that the Person or Persons asserting
such claim unconditionally release all Indemnified Parties from all liability
with respect to such claim; otherwise the consent of the Indemnified Party
shall be required in order to enter into any settlement of, or consent to the
entry of a judgment with respect to, any claim, which consent shall to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 57 -  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(b) In the event the Indemnified Party should have a claim against the
Indemnifying Party hereunder which is not a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party shall with reasonable promptness send a Claim Notice with respect to
such claim to the Indemnifying Party; provided, however, that failure to so
notify the Indemnifying Party shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the
Indemnifying Party's obligations with respect thereto, except to the extent
that such failure prejudices the Indemnifying Party's ability or right to
defend the claim or otherwise results in actual loss.

  

  

(c) In connection with any claim hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall give
the Indemnifying Party reasonable access to the books, records and assets of
the Indemnified Party which relate to the act, omission or occurrence giving
rise to such claim and the right, upon prior notice during normal business
hours, to interview any appropriate personnel of the Indemnified Party with
respect thereto, and the Indemnified Party otherwise shall cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party (and with its insurance company, if applicable) in
defending a claim.

  

  

8.4 Survival of Representations and Warranties and Covenants.

  

  

The representations and warranties of the parties contained herein shall
survive for a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the date
that is 20 months after the Closing Date and shall not survive beyond such
period; provided that (i) the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 3.1 (Approval of Agreement and Transactions), Section3.2 (Seller's
Existence and Good Standing; Authority; Binding Obligations; No Conflicts or
Restrictions), Section 3.3 (Ownership of Shares), Section4.1 (Approval of
Transaction Documents), Section4.2 (Companies' Existence and Good Standing;
Authority; Binding Obligations; No Conflicts or Restrictions), Section 4.3
(Capital Structure; No Liens), Section4.22 (No Investment Banker's, Broker's
or Finder's Fees), Section 5.2 (Buyer's Existence and Good Standing;
Authority; Binding Obligation; No Conflicts or Restrictions), Section5.3 (No
Governmental Authority Restrictions) and Section5.5 (No Investment Banker's,
Broker's or Finder's Fees) shall survive until the seventh anniversary of the
Closing Date, and (ii) the representations and warranties of Seller set forth
in Section 4.13 (Taxes), Section 4.18 (Employee Benefits) and Section 4.23
(Environmental Matters) shall survive the Closing until 90 days after the
expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the statute, regulation
or other authority on which the claim for indemnification under any such
representation or warranty is based (after giving effect to any waiver or
extension thereof). Each of the covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing and continue in full force and effect
until the earlier of the date on which the applicable covenant or agreement
shall have been performed in accordance with its terms and date that the
statute of limitations with respect to any breach of any such covenant or
agreement shall have expired. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any obligations
under Sections 8.1 and 8.2 shall not terminate with respect to any Losses as
to which the Person to be indemnified shall have given notice to the
Indemnifying Party in accordance with Section 8.3 before the applicable
Survival Expiration Date.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 58 -  

  

 

 

  

 

  

8.5 Calculation of Losses

  

  

(a) The amount of any Losses payable under this Article VIII by the
Indemnifying Party shall be net of any Loss Tax Benefit inuring to the
Indemnified Party on account of such Loss. If the Indemnified Party receives
any amounts under applicable insurance policies, or from any other Person
alleged to be responsible for any Losses, then (i) if no indemnification
payments by or on behalf of an Indemnifying Party have been made with respect
to such Losses, the amount of such Losses shall be reduced by such amounts
received under insurance policies or from another Person, net of any costs and
expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys), deductibles,
retentions, or increase in premiums incurred in connection with or as a result
of collecting such proceeds or other recoveries, and (ii) if an
indemnification payment by or on behalf of an Indemnifying Party has been made
with respect to such Losses, and such amounts received under such insurance
policies or from another Person together with such indemnification payment are
collectively in excess of the amount of such indemnifiable Losses, then such
Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party who made
such payment the lesser of (A) the amount of such excess, net of any costs and
expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys), deductibles,
retentions, or increase in premiums incurred in connection with or as a result
of collecting such proceeds or other recoveries, and (B) the amount paid by
such Indemnitor to the Indemnitee with respect to such Losses. The Indemnified
Party shall use reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under such
insurance coverage. If the Indemnified Party receives a Loss Tax Benefit after
an indemnification payment is made to it, the Indemnified Party shall promptly
pay to the Person or Persons that made such indemnification payment the amount
of such Loss Tax Benefit at such time or times as and to the extent that such
Loss Tax Benefit is actually received or realized by the Indemnified Party and
has not been previously applied to reduce the amount of the related Loss. No
Indemnifying Party shall have any right to subrogate to any claim any
Indemnified Party may have against any third party.

  

  

(b) The Indemnified Parties shall take, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to take, all reasonable steps required by applicable Law to
mitigate and otherwise minimize their Losses to the extent reasonably possible
upon and after becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected
to give rise to any Losses.

  

  

8.6 Treatment of Indemnity Payments.

  

  

It is the intent of the parties that amounts paid under this Article VIII
shall represent an adjustment to the Purchase Price and the parties will
report such payments consistent with such intent.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 59 -  

  

 

 

  

 

  

8.7 Exclusive Remedy.

  

  

After the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy of each Buyer Indemnified
Party and Seller Indemnified Party with respect to any and all claims arising
out of this Agreement and the Transactions (other than claims of, or causes of
action arising from, fraud or intentional misrepresentation) shall be pursuant
to the indemnification provisions set forth in Article VII and this Article
VIII. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence of this
Section 8.7, each Buyer Indemnified Party and each Seller Indemnified Party
hereby waives any and all statutory rights of contribution or indemnification
that it might otherwise be entitled to assert against any Seller Indemnified
Party or any Buyer Indemnified Party, respectively, under any federal, state,
local or foreign law, regulation or ordinance or any similar rules of law
embodied in the common law; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
apply to Patrick Kenny's rights to indemnification in his capacity as an
officer and director of the Acquired Companies. This Article VIII shall not
affect the rights of Buyer to obtain specific performance of the covenants in
Article X.

ARTICLE X 
 NON-COMPETITION; CONFIDENTIALITY.

  

  

10.1 Non-Competition.

  

  

To induce Buyer to enter into this Agreement, Seller hereby agrees that,
following the Closing Date and for a period of five years thereafter (the
"Restricted Period"), Seller shall not, directly or indirectly, nor shall its
shareholders own, manage, operate, join, control or participate in the
ownership, management, operation or control of, or be employed or retained by
or render services to, any business that at any time competes with the
Business anywhere in North America, Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands
or American Samoa; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall
prevent (a) the purchase or ownership by Seller, its shareholders or
Affiliates of less than five percent of the outstanding equity securities of
any class of securities of a company registered under Section 12 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (b) Kenny International from

During the Restricted Period, Seller shall not, directly or indirectly, nor
shall any of its shareholders offer to hire, divert, entice away, solicit or
in any other manner persuade or attempt to persuade any Person who is, at the
time of such solicitation, an officer, director, employee, customer, or
supplier of one or more of the Acquired Companies to discontinue, terminate or
adversely alter his or her or its relationship therewith; provided, that such
restrictions shall not apply to or prevent Seller or its shareholders from (a)
conducting a general solicitation of employees not directly aimed at such
Person or (b) from and after the one-year anniversary of the Closing, offering
to hire, diverting, enticing away or soliciting an immediate family member of
John E. Kenny, Jr., James C. Kenny, Philip B. Kenny, Patrick B. Kenny or Joan
Kenny Rose.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 61 -  

  

 

 

  

 

  

10.3 Remedies upon Breach.

  

  

Seller acknowledges and agrees that: (a) Buyer (and the Acquired Companies
after the Closing) could be irreparably injured in the event of a breach by
Seller of any of the obligations under this Article X; (b) monetary damages
may not be an adequate remedy for such breach; and (c) Buyer (and the Acquired
Companies after the Closing) shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief, in
addition to any other remedy that they may have, in the event of any such
breach. Notwithstanding the definition of Restricted Period, if Seller
breaches Section 10.1 or 10.2 and Buyer seeks and obtains an injunction,
restraining order or other equitable relief from any court of competent
jurisdiction, the Restrictive Period shall be computed from the date relief is
granted to Buyer instead of from the Closing Date and reduced by any time
following the Closing Date during which Seller complied with its obligations
thereunder.

  

  

10.4 Acknowledgment by Buye.

  

  

Buyer acknowledges that it has conducted to its satisfaction, an independent
investigation and verification of the financial condition, results of
operations, assets, liabilities, properties and projected operations of the
Acquired Companies and, in making its determination to proceed with the
Transactions, Buyer has relied on the results of its own independent
investigation and verification and the representations and warranties of
Seller expressly and specifically set forth in this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents, including the Disclosure Schedules. SUCH
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES BY SELLER CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER TO BUYER IN CONNECTION WITH THE
TRANSACTIONS, AND BUYER UNDERSTANDS, ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ALL OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
(INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY RELATING TO THE FUTURE FINANCIAL
CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, ASSETS OR LIABILITIES OF THE ACQUIRED
COMPANIES OR ANY RELATING TO MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE) ARE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMED BY SELLER.

  

  

10.5 Seller's Post-Closing Confidentiality Obligation.

  

  

Seller acknowledges that (a) during the course of its affiliation with the
Acquired Companies, it has produced and had access to Confidential Information
and (b) the unauthorized use or disclosure of any Confidential Information at
any time may deprive Buyer of benefits of this Agreement and the Transactions.
Seller shall (and shall cause its Representatives to) hold in confidence the
Confidential Information and will not, directly or indirectly, disclose,
publish, or otherwise make available any of the Confidential Information to
the public or to any Person. In the event that Seller or any of its
Representatives reasonably believes that he, she or it is compelled by Law to
disclose any Confidential Information, such Person will (i) if permitted by
Law, provide Buyer with prompt written notice before such disclosure and (ii)
at Buyer's cost and expense use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate
with Buyer as Buyer may reasonably request in connection with such compelled
disclosure and any attempt by Buyer to seek an appropriate protective order or
other appropriate remedy. In the event that a protective order or other remedy
is not obtained, Seller and its Representatives, as applicable, shall furnish
only that portion of such information which, in the opinion of its counsel, it
is legally compelled to disclose and shall exercise commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded any such information so disclosed.

11.3 Entire Agreement.

  

  

This Agreement together with each Schedule and Exhibit thereto and the
Transaction Documents, constitute the entire agreement by and among the
parties concerning the purchase of the Shares by Buyer and supersedes any
prior understandings, agreements or representations by or between the parties,
written or oral, to the extent they have related in any way to the subject
matter hereof, including, without limitation, that certain Letter of Intent
dated July 25, 2012, by and between Buyer and Seller. Any and all duties and
obligations which Seller may have to Buyer or which Buyer or KCC may have to
Seller with respect to or in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions are limited to those set forth in or entered into in connection
with this Agreement, the Transaction Documents and the Transactions. Neither
the duties nor obligations of any party, nor the rights of any party hereto,
shall be expanded beyond the terms of this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document on the basis of any legal or equitable principle or on any other
basis whatsoever. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither
Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall have any right of indemnification or
contribution against an Acquired Company with respect to any breach of any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document, whether by virtue of any contractual or statutory
right of indemnity or otherwise, and all claims to the contrary are hereby
waived and released. Neither any equitable nor legal principle nor any implied
obligation of good faith or fair dealing nor any other matter requires any
party hereto to incur, suffer or perform any act, condition or obligation
contrary, or in addition, to the terms of this Agreement, whether or not
existing and whether foreseeable or unforeseeable.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 64 -  

  

 

 

  

 

  

11.4 Amendments and Modifications.

  

  

No amendment, modification or discharge of this Agreement, and no waiver
hereunder, shall be valid or binding unless set forth in writing and duly
executed by the party against whom enforcement of the amendment, modification,
discharge or waiver is sought. Any such waiver shall constitute a waiver only
with respect to the specific matter described in such writing and shall in no
way impair the rights of the party granting such waiver in any other respect
or at any other time. The failure of either party hereto to exercise any
rights or privileges hereunder shall not be construed as a waiver of any such
rights or privileges hereunder. The rights and remedies herein provided are
cumulative and, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, none
is exclusive of any other or of any rights or remedies that any party may
otherwise have at law or in equity.

  

  

11.5 Successors and Assigns.

  

  

All the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to
the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective successors and permitted
assigns of the parties hereto. No party may assign any of its rights,
benefits, interests or obligations under this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the other party hereto, provided, however, that Buyer may
assign any of its rights and obligations hereunder to any Person that is an
Affiliate of Buyer, provided, that, any such assignment shall not release
Buyer from any of its obligations under this Agreement.

  

  

11.6 No Third Party Beneficiaries; Binding Effect.

  

  

Except as otherwise specifically provided herein (including, without
limitation, Article VIII), nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to confer upon any party other than the parties hereto or their
respective successors and assigns any rights, remedies, obligations, or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement. This Agreement shall inure
to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the parties and their respective
heirs, legal representatives, successors and permitted assigns.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 65 -  

  

 

 

  

 

  

11.7 Arbitration; Governing Law.

  

  

(a) Buyer and Seller agree to use reasonable efforts to resolve between
themselves any dispute they have with respect to the matters covered hereby.
Accordingly, and without limiting any rights hereunder, the parties will try
to resolve in a friendly manner all disagreements and misunderstandings
connected with their respective rights and obligations under this Agreement.
If, following the Closing, there shall be a dispute arising from or relating
in any way to this Agreement, one of Seller's shareholders (who shall be
selected by Seller's shareholders as Seller's representative), on the one
hand, and an executive of Buyer (who shall be selected by Buyer as its
representative), on the other hand, shall meet (by telephone or in person) no
later than three Business Days after receipt of notice by a party of a request
for resolution of any such dispute. Such designated representatives of Seller
and Buyer shall attempt in good faith to resolve any such dispute. If, within
10 Business Days after receipt of notice of any such dispute, such designated
representatives are unable to resolve the dispute, then either Buyer or Seller
may take any other action permitted by this Agreement, including requesting
arbitration for such dispute pursuant to Section 11.7(b).

  

  

(b) From and after the Closing, the parties agree that all disputes arising
from or relating in any way to this Agreement, including but not limited to,
all disputes arising from or relating to the negotiation, execution and
delivery, validity, interpretation, construction and enforcement of this
Agreement or any portion hereof, and including any dispute between the parties
as to whether a particular dispute is subject to arbitration, shall be decided
exclusively through binding arbitration, to be conducted at JAMS, at its
Denver location, pursuant to the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures
("JAMS Rules"). Each party shall appoint one arbitrator, who shall be non-
neutral, and the two party-appointed arbitrators shall then designate a third
arbitrator, and the three arbitrators shall hear the dispute. The parties
agree to permit ex parte communications between each party and its non-neutral
appointed arbitrator as permitted by law and applicable ethical rules, as
contemplated by Rule 14(c) of the JAMS Rules. In the event the two party-
appointed arbitrators are unable to agree on the selection of the third
arbitrator, the third arbitrator shall be selected in accordance with Rule 15
of the Rules. The prevailing party in the arbitration shall be entitled to
recover from the other party its reasonable costs, attorneys' fees, expert
witness fees and all other reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the
arbitration, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. Nothing in
this Section 11.7(b) shall prevent Buyer from exercising its rights under
Section 11.13.

  

  

(c) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Illinois without regard to the law of the conflicts of
law of such State.

  

  

(d) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (iii) IT MAKES
SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
SECTION 11.7(D).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 66 -  

  

 

 

  

 

  

11.8 Severability.

  

  

If one or more provisions of this Agreement are held to be unenforceable under
applicable Law, such provision shall be excluded from this Agreement and the
balance of the Agreement shall be interpreted as if such provision were so
excluded and shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms.

  

  

11.9 Titles and Subtitles.

  

  

The titles and subtitles used in this Agreement are used for convenience of
reference only and are not to be considered in construing or interpreting this
Agreement.

  

  

11.10 Expenses.

  

  

Except as the parties may otherwise agree in writing or as otherwise provided
herein, Buyer and Seller shall bear their own respective fees, costs and
expenses in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions.

  

  

11.11 Counterpart; Facsimile or PDF Signatures.

  

  

This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall
be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the
same instrument. This Agreement may be delivered by facsimile or pdf, and such
facsimile and pdf signatures shall be treated as original signatures for all
applicable purposes and shall be considered to have the same binding legal
effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.
At the request of any party hereto, each other party hereto shall re-execute
original forms thereof and deliver them to the other party. No party hereto
shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or electronic transmission to
deliver a signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument
was transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or
electronic transmission, as a defense to the formation or enforceability of a
contract and each such party forever waives any such defense.

11.12 Limitation on Recourse.

  

  

No claim shall be brought or maintained by Buyer or any of its Affiliates or
their respective successors or permitted assigns against any officer,
director, employee (present or former) or Affiliate of a Seller which is not
otherwise expressly identified as a party hereto, and no recourse shall be
brought or granted against any of them, by virtue of or based upon any alleged
misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations,
warranties or covenants of any party hereto set forth or contained in this
Agreement or any exhibit or schedule hereto or any certificate delivered
hereunder.

  


 

  

11.13 Specific Performance.

  

  

Seller acknowledges that the breach of this Agreement could cause irreparable
damage to Buyer and that money damages or other legal remedies may not be an
adequate remedy for any such damages. Therefore, Buyer may apply for
appropriate injunctive relief in connection with the obligations of Seller to
be performed by it at or prior to Closing under this Agreement, including
Seller's obligation to sell the Shares to Buyer. Such remedies shall, however,
be cumulative and not exclusive and shall be in addition to any other such
remedies which Buyer may have under this Agreement or otherwise.
