                      ("Parent"), METRONOME ACQUISITION SUB INC., a Delaware
                      corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
                      ("Sub"), and MP3.COM, INC., a Delaware corporation (the
                      "Company").

               WHEREAS the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and the
Company have approved, and the Boards of Directors of Sub and the Company have
declared advisable, this Agreement and the merger of the Company with and into
Sub (the "Merger"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, whereby each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock"), other than
shares owned by Parent, Sub or the Company, or any wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent, Sub or the Company, will be converted into, at the option of the holder
thereof (upon the terms and subject to the limitations set forth herein), either
(i) the right to receive ordinary shares, nominal value (U)5.50 per share, of
Parent (the "Parent Shares"), which shares will be issued in the form of
American depositary shares representing Parent Shares, each American depositary
share representing one Parent Share (the "Parent ADSs"), or (ii) the right to
receive cash;

               WHEREAS simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Sub
to enter into this Agreement, Parent and certain principal stockholders of the
Company (collectively, the "Company Stockholders") are entering into an
agreement (the "Stockholder Agreement") pursuant to which the Company
Stockholders will agree to vote to adopt and approve this Agreement and to take
certain other actions in furtherance of the Merger upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in the Stockholder Agreement;

               WHEREAS simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement and
as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Sub to enter into

subject to certain non-compete and non-solicitation obligations, in each case
upon the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Employment Agreement;

               WHEREAS for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that

rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and (b) this Agreement constitutes
a plan of reorganization; and

               WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

               SECTION 1.02. Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing")

soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, the parties shall prepare and

Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable law.

               (b) The by-laws of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the

               SECTION 1.06. Directors. The directors of Sub immediately prior

action on the part of the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any
shares of capital stock of Sub:

               (a) Capital Stock of Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of

        consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

               (c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Except as otherwise
        provided in Section 2.05 and subject to Sections 2.01(d) and 2.03(e),
        each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
        prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in

        receive, at the election of the holder thereof, one of the following (as
        adjusted pursuant to Section 2.05, the "Merger Consideration"):

                        (i) for each such share of Company Common Stock with
               respect to which an election to receive Parent Shares has been
               effectively made, and not revoked or lost, pursuant to Section
               2.04 (a "Share Election"), the right to receive a number of fully
               paid and nonassessable Parent Shares equal to the Exchange Ratio
               (the "Share Consideration"); and

                       (ii) for each such share of Company Common Stock with
               respect to which an election to receive cash has been effectively
               made, and not revoked or lost, pursuant to Section 2.04 (a "Cash
               Election"), and for each such share of Company Common Stock with
               respect to which a Cash Election is deemed to have been made
               pursuant to Section 2.04(d), the right to receive $5.00 in cash
               (the "Cash Consideration").

        The Parent Shares to be issued in the Merger shall be registered in the
        name of The Bank of New York, as depositary (the "Depositary") under the
        Deposit Agreement dated as of April 19, 1995, as amended and restated as
        of September 11, 2000 and as further amended and restated as of December
        8, 2000, among

        Parent, The Bank of New York, a New York banking corporation, and all
        owners and beneficial owners from time to time of the American
        depositary receipts issued thereunder (the "Deposit Agreement"), and
        then delivered in the form of Parent ADSs, and such Parent ADSs shall be
        issued in accordance with the Deposit Agreement. At the Effective Time,
        all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding
        and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each
        holder of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the
        Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (the
        "Certificates") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
        except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, certain dividends
        or other distributions in accordance with Section 2.03(c) and cash in
        lieu of any fractional Parent ADS in accordance with Section 2.03(e)
        upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section
        2.03(b), without interest. "Exchange Ratio" means the quotient (rounded
        to the fourth decimal place) obtained by dividing $5.00 by the Average
        Closing Price. "Average Closing Price" means an amount equal to the
        average per share closing price of Parent ADSs on the New York Stock
        Exchange (the "NYSE"), as reported in The Wall Street Journal,
        Northeastern edition (or, if not reported therein in another
        authoritative source selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the
        Company), for the five consecutive trading days ending on the trading
        day immediately preceding the date on which the Stockholders Meeting
        occurs.

               (d) Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
        to the contrary, shares ("Appraisal Shares") of Company Common Stock
        that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that
        are held by any person who is entitled to demand and properly demands
        appraisal of such Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all
        respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be
        converted into Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but
        rather the holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment of
        the fair market value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with
        Section 262; provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to
        perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
        appraisal under Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid
        the fair value of such holder's Appraisal Shares shall cease and such
        Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the
        Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the
        right to

                                                                               6


        receive, the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c) and in
        accordance with 2.04(d). The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent
        of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of
        Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in
        and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
        demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the
        prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or
        settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
        foregoing.

               SECTION 2.02. Anti-Dilution Provisions. In the event Parent
changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the number of Parent Shares
issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split,
stock dividend, recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding Parent
Shares and the record date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Time, the
Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted to reflect such stock split,
stock dividend, recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or similar transaction.

               SECTION 2.03. Exchange of Certificates. (a) Exchange Agent. As of
the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide, to the Depositary the Parent Shares being issued in the form of Parent
ADSs in accordance with this Article II, and the Depositary shall deposit with
such bank or trust company as may be designated by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article
II, through the Exchange Agent, receipts issued in accordance with the Deposit
Agreement evidencing the Parent ADSs issuable pursuant to Section 2.01 in
exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall take
all steps necessary to enable and cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to
the Exchange Agent, on a timely basis, as and when needed after the Effective
Time, cash necessary to pay for the shares of Company Common Stock converted
into the right to receive cash pursuant to Section 2.01 (such receipts
evidencing Parent ADSs and cash, together with any dividends or other
distributions with respect thereto in accordance with Section 2.03(c) and any
cash in lieu of any fractional Parent ADS in accordance with Section 2.03(e),
being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). At the time of such
deposit, Parent shall irrevocably instruct the Exchange Agent to deliver the
Exchange Fund to the Company's stockholders after the Effective Time in
accordance with the

<PAGE>   12

                                                                               7


procedures set forth in this Section 2.03, subject to Sections 2.03(f) and
2.03(g).

               (b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate whose shares were converted into the right to receive the applicable
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01, (i) a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in customary form and have such
other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use
in surrendering the Certificates in exchange for the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancelation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably
be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a receipt evidencing that number of
whole Parent ADSs (together with cash in lieu of any fractional Parent ADS in
accordance with Section 2.03(e)), if any, and the amount of cash, if any, that
the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by
such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.01 into the
right to receive, together with certain dividends or other distributions in
accordance with Section 2.02(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common
Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a receipt
evidencing the proper number of Parent ADSs may be issued and/or the proper
amount of cash may be paid, as appropriate, in exchange therefor to a person
other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered
if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and the person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the issuance of Parent ADSs to a person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction
of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.03(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration that the holder thereof has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, certain dividends or
other distributions in accordance with Section 2.03(c) and cash in lieu of any
fractional Parent ADS in accordance with

<PAGE>   13

                                                                               8


Section 2.03(e).  No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable
upon surrender of any Certificate.

               (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Shares
with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the Parent ADSs represented thereby,
if any, and all such dividends and other distributions shall be paid by Parent
to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund, until the
surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the
effect of applicable escheat or similar laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate there shall be paid to the holder of the receipt evidencing whole
Parent ADSs issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of
such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole Parent
ADSs and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such whole Parent ADSs.

               (d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All
receipts evidencing Parent ADSs issued and cash paid upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II
(including any dividends or other distributions paid pursuant to Section 2.03(c)
and any cash in lieu of any fractional Parent ADS paid pursuant to Section
2.03(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
by such Certificates, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation's
obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record
date prior to the Effective Time which may have been declared or made by the
Company with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock which remain unpaid
at the Effective Time. At the close of business on the day on which the
Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed,
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II.

                                                                               9


               (e) No Fractional Shares. (i) No certificates or scrip
representing, or receipts evidencing, fractional Parent ADSs shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution
with respect to Parent Shares shall relate to such fractional shares interests
and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote
or to any rights of a stockholder of Parent.

               (ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each
        holder of shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the
        Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a
        Parent ADS (after taking into account all such shares held by such
        holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an
        amount, less the amount of any withholding taxes that may be required
        thereon, equal to such fractional part of a Parent ADS (rounded to the
        fourth decimal place) multiplied by the Average Closing Price.

               (f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for 12 months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article
II shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and, subject to Section 2.03(g),
Parent shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for the Merger
Consideration, certain dividends and other distributions in accordance with
Section 2.03(c) and any cash in lieu of any fractional Parent ADS in accordance
with Section 2.03(e).

               (g) No Liability. None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any receipts
evidencing Parent ADSs (or any dividends or distributions with respect thereto)
or cash from the Exchange Fund, in each case delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any
Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to three years after the
Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any amounts
payable pursuant to this Article II would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity), any such amounts shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled
thereto.

               (h) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis;
provided that no

<PAGE>   15

                                                                              10


such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to the
Company's stockholders pursuant to this Article II. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be the property of, and shall be
paid to, Parent, and Parent shall be responsible for paying all taxes with
respect to such interest and other income.

               (i) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent
may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with
respect thereto, certain dividends and other distributions in accordance with
Section 2.03(c) and any cash in lieu of any fractional Parent ADS in accordance
with Section 2.03(e).

               (j) Withholding Rights. Parent, Sub or the Exchange Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such
amounts as Parent, Sub or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and
paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, Sub or the Exchange
Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Sub or the
Exchange Agent.

               SECTION 2.04. Elections. (a) Each person who, on or prior to the
Election Date referred to in Section 2.04(b), is a record holder of shares of
Company Common Stock (which for this purpose shall be deemed to include an
authorized representative of the persons entitled to receive the 2,500,000
shares of Company Common Stock reserved for issuance pursuant to the Stipulation
of Settlement in the Company's class action and derivative lawsuits) shall be
entitled, with respect to all or any portion of such shares, to make an
unconditional Share Election or an unconditional Cash Election, in each case
specifying that number of shares of Company Common Stock such holder desires to
have converted into the Share Consideration and that number of shares of Company
Common Stock such holder desires to have converted into the Cash

<PAGE>   16

                                                                              11


Consideration, as applicable, on or prior to such Election Date, on the basis
hereinafter set forth.

               (b) Parent shall prepare a form of election, which form shall be
subject to the reasonable approval of the Company (the "Form of Election") and
shall be mailed with the Proxy Statement to the record holders of Company Common
Stock as of the record date for the Stockholders Meeting, which Form of Election
shall be used by each record holder of shares of Company Common Stock who wishes
to elect to receive the Share Consideration or the Cash Consideration, as
applicable, for any or all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder.
The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to make the Form of Election and
the Proxy Statement available to all persons who become record holders of
Company Common Stock during the period between such record date and the Election
Date and to the authorized representative of the persons entitled to receive the
2,500,000 shares of Company Common Stock reserved for issuance pursuant to the
Stipulation of Settlement in the Company's class action and derivative lawsuits.
Any such holder's (and such authorized representative's) election to receive the
Share Consideration or the Cash Consideration, as applicable, shall have been
properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have received at its designated
office, by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the business day immediately
preceding the date of the Stockholders Meeting (the "Election Date"), a Form of
Election properly completed and signed and (other than in the case of such
authorized representative) accompanied by Certificates for the shares of Company
Common Stock to which such Form of Election relates, duly endorsed in blank or
otherwise in a form acceptable for transfer on the books of the Company (or
accompanied by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such Certificates as set
forth in such Form of Election from a firm that is a member of a registered
national securities exchange or of the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. or a commercial bank or trust company having an office or
correspondent in the United States).

               (c) Any Form of Election may be revoked, by the stockholder who
submitted such Form of Election to the Exchange Agent, only by written notice
received by the Exchange Agent (i) prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on
the Election Date or (ii) after such time, if (and only to the extent that) the
Exchange Agent is legally required to permit revocations and only if the
Effective Time shall not have occurred prior to such date. In addition, all
Forms of Election shall automatically be revoked if the Exchange Agent is
notified in writing by Parent and the Company that the Merger has been
abandoned. If a Form of Election is revoked, the Certificate or Certificates (or

<PAGE>   17

                                                                              12


guarantees of delivery, as appropriate) for the shares of Company Common Stock
to which such Form of Election relates shall be promptly returned to the
stockholder that submitted the same to the Exchange Agent.

               (d) The determination of the Exchange Agent in its sole
discretion shall be binding as to whether or not elections to receive the Share
Consideration or the Cash Consideration have been properly made or revoked
pursuant to this Section 2.04 with respect to shares of Company Common Stock and
when elections and revocations were received by it. If no Form of Election is
received with respect to shares of Company Common Stock, or if the Exchange
Agent determines that any election to receive the Share Consideration was not
properly made with respect to shares of Company Common Stock, the holder of such
shares shall be treated by the Exchange Agent as having submitted a Cash
Election with respect to such shares and, subject to Section 2.05, such shares
shall be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration. The Exchange Agent shall also make all computations as to the
proration contemplated by Section 2.05, and absent manifest error any such
computation shall be conclusive and binding on the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock. The Exchange Agent may, with the mutual agreement of Parent and
the Company, make such rules as are consistent with this Section 2.04 for the
implementation of the elections provided for herein as shall be necessary or
desirable fully to effect such elections and the provisions of this Section
2.04.

               SECTION 2.05. Proration. (a) As is more fully set forth below,
the maximum aggregate number of Parent Shares to be issued to holders of Company
Common Stock pursuant to this Article II (the "Share Cap") shall be equal to
that number of Parent Shares having a value (calculated based on the Average
Closing Price) equal to the product of (x) 0.5 and (y) the aggregate Merger
Consideration (calculated by multiplying the aggregate number of outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock as of the Effective Time (excluding any shares of
Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.01(b)) by the Cash
Consideration).

               (b) As is more fully set forth below, the maximum aggregate
amount of cash to be paid to holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to this
Article II (the "Cash Cap") shall be equal to the product of (x) 0.5 and (y) the
aggregate Merger Consideration (calculated by multiplying the aggregate number
of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock as of the Effective Time
(excluding any shares of

<PAGE>   18

                                                                              13


Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.01(b)) by the Cash
Consideration).

               (c) In the event that the aggregate number of Parent Shares
subject to Share Elections received by the Exchange Agent (the "Requested Share
Amount") exceeds the Share Cap, each holder of Company Common Stock that has
made a Share Election shall receive, for each share of Company Common Stock for
which a Share Election has been made, (x) a number of Parent Shares (in the form
of Parent ADSs) equal to the product of the Exchange Ratio and the Share
Proration Factor (such product, the "Prorated Share Amount") and (y) cash in an
amount equal to the product of (A) the Exchange Ratio minus the Prorated Share
Amount and (B) the Average Closing Price. The "Share Proration Factor" shall be
a fraction, the numerator of which is the Share Cap and the denominator of which
is the Requested Share Amount.

               (d) In the event that the aggregate amount of cash subject to
Cash Elections received (or deemed to have been received in accordance with
Section 2.04(d)) by the Exchange Agent (the "Requested Cash Amount") exceeds the
Cash Cap, each holder making a Cash Election (and each holder who is deemed to
have made a Cash Election pursuant to Section 2.04(d)) shall receive, for each
share of Company Common Stock with respect to which a Cash Election has been
made, (x) cash in an amount equal to the product of the Cash Consideration and a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Cash Cap and the denominator of which is
the Requested Cash Amount (such product, the "Prorated Cash Amount") and (y) a
number of Parent Shares (in the form of Parent ADSs) equal to a fraction, the
numerator of which is equal to the Cash Consideration minus the Prorated Cash
Amount and the denominator of which is the Average Closing Price.

                                   ARTICLE III

                         Representations and Warranties

               SECTION 3.01. Representations and Warranties of the Company.
Except as set forth on the disclosure schedule (each section of which qualifies
the correspondingly numbered representation and warranty or covenant to the
extent specified therein and such other representations and warranties or
covenants to the extent a matter in such section is disclosed in such a way as
to make its relevance to the information called for by such other representation
and warranty or covenant reasonably apparent) delivered by the Company to Parent
prior to the execution of this

<PAGE>   19

                                                                              14


Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), the Company represents and
warrants to Parent and Sub as follows:

               (a) Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. The Company and
        each of its subsidiaries is a corporation or other legal entity duly
        organized, validly existing and in good standing (with respect to
        jurisdictions which recognize such concept) under the laws of the
        jurisdiction in which it is organized and has the requisite corporate or
        other power, as the case may be, and authority to carry on its business
        as now being conducted. The Company and each of its subsidiaries is duly
        qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing (with
        respect to jurisdictions which recognize such concept) in each
        jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership,
        leasing or operation of its assets makes such qualification or licensing
        necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so
        qualified or licensed or to be in good standing individually or in the
        aggregate has not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a
        material adverse effect on the Company. The Company has made available
        to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement complete and correct
        copies of its certificate of incorporation and by-laws, as amended to
        the date of this Agreement.

               (b) Subsidiaries. Section 3.01(b) of the Company Disclosure
        Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of each of the Company's
        subsidiaries. All the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other
        equity interests in, each subsidiary of the Company have been validly

        warrants, calls, options or other rights to acquire from the Company or
        any of its subsidiaries, and no obligation of the Company or any of its
        subsidiaries to issue, any capital stock or other voting securities of,
        or other ownership interests in, or any securities convertible into or
        exchangeable or exercisable for any capital stock or other voting

        is not a party to any voting agreement with respect to the voting of any
        such securities. As of the date of this Agreement, the Subject Shares
        (as such term is defined in the Stockholder Agreement) represent more
        than 50% of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding.

        Section 3.01(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete

        indirectly, by the Company, other than the capital stock of, or other

               (d) Authority; Noncontravention. The Company has all requisite
        corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and, subject
        to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, to consummate the transactions
        contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this
        Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
        transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by
        all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and no other
        corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to
        authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated
        by this Agreement, subject, in the case of the Merger, to obtaining the
        Stockholder Approval. This Agreement has been duly executed and
        delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution
        and delivery by Parent and Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
        obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance
        with its terms. The Board of Directors of the Company formed a special
        committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, composed of Thomas
        A. Heymann, Lawrence F. Probst III and Justice Howard B. Wiener (the
        "Special Committee"), to consider this Agreement and the Stockholder
        Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and to
        make a recommendation with respect thereto to the entire Board of
        Directors of the Company. The Special Committee, at a meeting duly
        called and held at which all members of the Special Committee were
        present either in person or by telephone, duly and unanimously (and
        without any abstentions) adopted resolutions (i) approving and declaring
        advisable this Agreement, (ii) declaring that it is in the best
        interests of the Company's stockholders that the Company enter into this
        Agreement and consummate the Merger on the terms and subject to the
        conditions set forth in this Agreement, (iii) declaring that the
        consideration to be paid to the Company's stockholders in the Merger is
        fair to such stockholders, (iv) approving the Stockholder Agreement and
        the transactions contemplated thereby and (v) recommending that the
        Board of Directors of the Company approve this Agreement and the
        Stockholder Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
        thereby and that the Board of Directors of the Company

        declare the advisability of this Agreement. After receiving and
        considering such resolutions of the Special Committee, the Board of
        Directors of the Company, at a meeting duly called and held at which all
        directors of the Company were present either in person or by telephone,
        duly and unanimously (and without any abstentions) adopted resolutions
        (i) approving and declaring advisable this Agreement, (ii) declaring
        that it is in the best interests of the Company's stockholders that the
        Company enter into this Agreement and consummate the Merger on the terms
        and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, (iii)
        declaring that the consideration to be paid to the Company's
        stockholders in the Merger is fair to such stockholders, (iv) directing
        that this Agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of the Company's
        stockholders to be held as promptly as practicable following the date of
        this Agreement, (v) recommending that such stockholders adopt this
        Agreement and (vi) approving the Stockholder Agreement and the
        transactions contemplated thereby, which resolutions have not been
        subsequently rescinded, modified or withdrawn in any way. The execution
        and delivery of this Agreement do not, and the consummation of the
        transactions contemplated by this Agreement and compliance by the
        Company with the provisions of this Agreement will not, conflict with,
        or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or without
        notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
        termination, cancelation or acceleration of any obligation or to the
        loss of a benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any
        of the properties or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
        under, (i) the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or
        the comparable organizational documents of any of its subsidiaries, (ii)
        any loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease or
        other contract, agreement, obligation, commitment, arrangement,

        similar authorization (each, a "Contract") to which the Company or any
        of its subsidiaries is a party or otherwise applicable to the Company or
        any of its subsidiaries or their respective properties or assets or
        (iii) subject to the governmental filings and other matters referred to
        in the following sentence, (A) any judgment, order or decree or (B) any
        statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation, in each case applicable to
        the Company or any of its subsidiaries or their respective properties or
        assets, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), any such
        conflicts, violations, breaches,

        could not reasonably be expected to (x) have a material adverse effect
        on the Company, (y) impair in any material respect the ability of the
        Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement or (z) prevent
        or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation

        Entity") is required to be obtained or made by or with respect to the
        Company or any of its subsidiaries in connection with the execution and

               (e) SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities. The Company has filed
        all required reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents
        (including exhibits and all other information incorporated therein) with
        the SEC since July 20, 1999 (together with the Company's Registration
        Statement on Form S-1 (Registration No. 333-78545), the "Company SEC
        Documents"). As of their respective dates, the Company SEC Documents
        complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
        Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") or the Exchange Act, as
        the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
        thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Documents, and none of the
        Company SEC Documents when filed contained any untrue statement of a
        material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
        therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
        of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Except
        to the extent that information contained in any Company SEC Document has
        been revised or superseded by a later filed Company SEC Document, none
        of the Company SEC Documents contains any untrue statement of a material
        fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein
        or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
        circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The financial
        statements of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents comply
        as to form, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all
        material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
        published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto (the
        "Accounting Rules"), have been prepared in accordance with generally
        accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") (except, in the case of
        unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a
        consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
        in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the
        consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
        subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of
        their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in
        the case of unaudited statements, to normal recurring year- end audit
        adjustments). Except (i) as reflected in the most recent financial
        statements contained in the Company Filed SEC Documents or in the notes
        thereto or (ii) for liabilities incurred in connection with this
        Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, neither the Company
        nor any of its subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any
        nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) which,

                                                                              21


        individually or in the aggregate, have had or could reasonably be
        expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

               (f) Information Supplied. (i) None of the information supplied or
        to be supplied by the Company specifically for inclusion or
        incorporation by reference in (i) the registration statement on Form F-4
        to be filed with the SEC by Parent in connection with the issuance of
        Parent Shares in the Merger (the "Form F-4") will, at the time the Form
        F-4 is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented and
        at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any
        untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
        required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
        therein not misleading or (ii) the Proxy Statement will, at the date it
        is first mailed to the Company's stockholders or at the time of the
        Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
        omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
        necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
        circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy
        Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the
        requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
        promulgated thereunder. No representation or warranty is made by the
        Company with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference in
        the Proxy Statement based on information supplied by Parent specifically
        for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement.

               (ii) The information set forth in Section 3.01(f)(ii) of the
        Company Disclosure Schedule is true and correct.

               (g) Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except for liabilities
        incurred in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
        contemplated hereby and except as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents
        filed and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement (the
        "Company Filed SEC Documents"), since the date of the most recent
        audited financial statements included in the Company Filed SEC
        Documents, the Company and its subsidiaries have conducted their
        business only in the ordinary course, and since such date there has not
        been (1) any material adverse change with respect to the Company, (2)
        any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or other
        distribution (whether in cash, stock or property) with

        principles or practices by the Company or any of its subsidiaries
        materially affecting their respective assets, liabilities or businesses,

        judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity
        or arbitrator which the Company or any of its subsidiaries has entered
        into or become bound by since December 31, 1998. Section 3.01(h) of the
        Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list of
        all legal fees in excess of $1,000,000 owed by the Company as of the
        date of this Agreement.

               (i) Compliance with Applicable Laws. (i) The Company and its
        subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders,
        registrations and approvals of all Governmental Entities (collectively,
        "Permits") that are required for them to own, lease or operate their
        assets and to carry on their businesses as now conducted, except for
        failures to hold Permits that individually or in the aggregate have not
        had and could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
        effect on the Company. The Company and its subsidiaries are in
        compliance with the terms of the Permits and all applicable statutes,
        laws, ordinances, rules and regulations, except for instances of
        noncompliance or possible noncompliance that individually or in the
        aggregate have not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a
        material adverse effect on the Company. The Merger, in and of itself,
        would not cause the revocation or cancelation of any Permit that
        individually or in the aggregate could reasonably be expected to have a
        material adverse effect on the Company. Section 3.01(i) of the Company
        Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the date of this Agreement, a
        complete and accurate list of all actions, demands, requirements or
        investigations by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Company or
        any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective properties. Other
        than the matters set forth on Section 3.01(i) of the Company Disclosure
        Schedule, as of the Closing Date there will not be any action, demand,
        requirement or investigation by any Governmental Entity with respect to
        the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective
        properties pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened that
        individually or in the aggregate has had or could reasonably be expected
        to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

               (ii) To the Company's knowledge, there have been no Releases of
        any Hazardous Materials at, on or under any facility or property
        currently or formerly owned, leased, or operated by the Company or any
        of its subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or
        could reasonably be expected to have a

                                                                              24


        material adverse effect on the Company. Neither the Company nor any of
        its subsidiaries is the subject of any pending or, to the Company's
        knowledge, threatened investigation or proceeding under Environmental
        Law relating in any manner to the off-site treatment, storage or
        disposal of any Hazardous Materials generated at any facility or
        property currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by the Company
        or any of its subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its
        subsidiaries has assumed or otherwise agreed to be responsible for any
        liabilities arising under Environmental Law. The term "Environmental
        Law" means any and all applicable laws or regulations or other
        requirements of any Governmental Entity concerning the protection of
        human health or the environment. The term "Hazardous Materials" means
        all explosive or regulated radioactive materials, hazardous or toxic
        substances, wastes or chemicals, petroleum (including crude oil or any
        fraction thereof) or petroleum distillates, asbestos or
        asbestos-containing materials, and all other materials or chemicals
        regulated under any Environmental Law. The term "Release" means any
        spill, emission, leaking, pumping, injection, deposit, disposal,
        discharge, dispersal, leaching, emanation or migration in, into, onto,
        or through the environment.

               (j) Absence of Changes in Benefit Plans. Except as disclosed in
        the Company Filed SEC Documents, since the date of the most recent
        audited financial statements included in the Company Filed SEC
        Documents, there has not been any adoption or amendment by the Company
        or any of its subsidiaries of any collective bargaining agreement or any
        bonus, pension, profit sharing, deferred compensation, incentive
        compensation, stock ownership, stock purchase, stock option, phantom
        stock, retirement, thrift, savings, stock bonus, restricted stock,
        cafeteria, paid time off, perquisite, fringe benefit, vacation,
        severance, disability, death benefit, hospitalization, medical, welfare
        benefit or other plan, arrangement or understanding (whether or not
        legally binding) maintained, contributed to or required to be maintained
        or contributed to by the Company, any of its subsidiaries, or any other
        person or entity that, together with the Company, is treated as a single
        employer under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (a "Commonly
        Controlled Entity") providing benefits to any current or former
        employee, officer, consultant or director of the Company or any of its
        subsidiaries (collectively, the "Benefit Plans"), or any change in the
        manner in which contributions to any Benefit Plans of the Company are
        made or the basis on which such contributions are

                                                                              25


        determined. Except as disclosed in the Company Filed SEC Documents,
        there are no currently binding (1) employment, consulting, deferred
        compensation, indemnification, severance or termination agreements or
        similar arrangements or understandings between the Company or any of its
        subsidiaries and any current or former employee, officer, consultant or
        director of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or (2) agreements
        between the Company or any of its subsidiaries and any current or former
        employee, officer, consultant or director of the Company or any of its
        subsidiaries, the benefits of which are contingent, or the terms of
        which are materially altered, upon the occurrence of a transaction
        involving the Company of a nature contemplated by this Agreement
        (collectively, the "Benefit Agreements").

               (k) ERISA Compliance; Excess Parachute Payments. (i) Section
        3.01(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a list of each
        Benefit Plan that is an "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in
        Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
        amended ("ERISA")) (sometimes referred to herein as a "Pension Plan"),
        "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA)
        and all other Benefit Plans and Benefit Agreements. The Company has made
        available to Parent true, complete and correct copies of (a) each
        Benefit Plan and Benefit Agreement (or, in the case of any unwritten
        Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement, a description thereof), (b) the two
        most recent annual reports on Form 5500 filed with the Internal Revenue
        Service with respect to each Benefit Plan (if any such report was
        required), (c) the most recent summary plan description for each Benefit
        Plan for which such summary plan description is required and (d) each
        trust agreement and insurance or group annuity contract relating to any
        Benefit Plan.

               (ii) Each Benefit Plan has been administered in accordance with
        its terms in all material respects. The Company, its subsidiaries and
        each Benefit Plan are in compliance in all material respects with the
        applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code, and all other applicable
        laws, including laws of foreign jurisdictions. All Pension Plans
        intended to be tax-qualified have either received a favorable
        determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect
        that such Pension Plans are qualified and exempt from Federal income
        taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, or
        the remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code has not
        expired, and no such determination letter has been

<PAGE>   31

                                                                              26


        revoked nor, to the knowledge of the Company, has revocation been
        threatened, nor has any event occurred since the date of its most recent
        determination letter, application therefor or Pension Plan's adoption
        that would adversely affect its qualification or materially increase its
        costs. All Pension Plans required to have been approved by any foreign
        Governmental Entity have been so approved; no such approval has been
        revoked (or, to the knowledge of the Company, has revocation been
        threatened) nor has any event occurred since the date of the most recent
        approval or application therefor relating to any such Pension Plan that
        would materially affect any such approval relating thereto or materially
        increase the costs relating thereto. The Company has delivered to Parent
        a true and complete copy of the most recent determination letter
        received with respect to each Pension Plan, as well as a true and
        complete copy of each pending application for a determination letter, if
        any.

               (iii) No Pension Plan is a "multiemployer plan" within the
        meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a "Multiemployer Pension Plan")
        or is subject to the provisions of Title IV of ERISA, and neither the
        Company nor any Commonly Controlled Entity could have any liability
        under Title IV of ERISA. None of the Company, any of its subsidiaries,
        any officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of the
        Benefit Plans which are subject to ERISA, including the Pension Plans,
        any trusts created thereunder or any trustee or administrator thereof,
        has engaged in a "prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in
        Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) or any other breach of
        fiduciary responsibility that could subject the Company, any of its
        subsidiaries or any officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to
        the tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by such Section
        4975 or to any liability under Section 502(i) or 502(l) of ERISA. None
        of such Benefit Plans and trusts has been terminated. All contributions
        and premiums and benefit payments required to be made under the terms of
        any Benefit Plan as of the date hereof have been timely made or have
        been reflected on the most recent consolidated balance sheet included in
        the Company Filed SEC Documents.

               (iv) All material reports, returns and similar documents with
        respect to all Benefit Plans required to be filed with any Governmental
        Entity or distributed to any Benefit Plan participant have been duly and
        timely filed or distributed. None of the Company or any of its
        subsidiaries has received notice of, and to the

<PAGE>   32

                                                                              27


        knowledge of the Company, there are no investigations by any
        Governmental Entity with respect to, termination proceedings or other
        claims (except claims for benefits payable in the normal operation of
        the Benefit Plans), suits or proceedings against or involving any
        Benefit Plan or asserting any rights or claims to benefits under any
        Benefit Plan that could give rise to any liability, and, to the
        knowledge of the Company, there are not any facts that could give rise
        to any liability in the event of any such investigation, claim, suit or
        proceeding.

               (v) The Company and its subsidiaries, with respect to each
        Benefit Plan that is a "group health plan" (as such term is defined in
        Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code), comply in all material respects with
        the applicable requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the Code. Neither the
        Company nor any of its subsidiaries has any obligations for retiree
        health or life insurance benefits under any Benefit Plan or Benefit
        Agreement.

               (vi) Except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or as set
        forth in any Employment Agreement, none of the execution and delivery of
        this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger or any other transaction
        contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement (including
        as a result of any termination of employment following the Effective
        Time) will (x) entitle any employee, officer, consultant or director of
        the Company or any of its subsidiaries to severance or termination pay,
        (y) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or
        funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or
        benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other
        material obligation pursuant to, any of the Benefit Plans or Benefit
        Agreements or (z) result in any breach or violation of, or a default
        under, any of the Benefit Plans or Benefit Agreements.

               (vii) Other than payments or benefits that may be made or
        provided to the persons listed in Section 3.01(k)(vii) of the Company
        Disclosure Schedule (the "Primary Company Executives"), no amount or
        other entitlement or economic benefit that could be received (whether in
        cash or property or the vesting of property) as a result of the Merger
        or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement or the
        Stockholder Agreement (including as a result of termination of
        employment on or following the Effective Time) by or for the benefit of
        any employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or any of
        its

<PAGE>   33

                                                                              28


        affiliates who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined
        in proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any Benefit Plan
        or Benefit Agreement or otherwise would be characterized as an "excess
        parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code), and
        no disqualified individual is entitled to receive any additional payment
        from the Company or any of its subsidiaries, the Surviving Corporation
        or any other person in the event that the excise tax under Section 4999
        of the Code is imposed on such disqualified individual. Set forth in
        Section 3.01(k)(vii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule is (a) the
        estimated maximum amount that could be paid to each Primary Company
        Executive as a result of the Merger and the other transactions
        contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement based upon
        the assumptions set forth therein (including as a result of a
        termination of employment on or following the Effective Time) under all
        Benefit Plans and Benefit Agreements and (b) the "base amount" (as
        defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) for each Primary Company
        Executive calculated as of the date of this Agreement.

               (viii) The Company and its subsidiaries are in compliance in all
        material respects with all Federal, state and local requirements
        regarding employment. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is
        a party to any collective bargaining or other labor union contract
        applicable to persons employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries
        and no collective bargaining agreement is being negotiated by the
        Company or any of its subsidiaries. As of the date of this Agreement,
        there is no labor dispute, strike or work stoppage against the Company
        or any of its subsidiaries pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
        threatened which may interfere with the respective business activities
        of the Company or its subsidiaries. As of the date of this Agreement, to
        the knowledge of the Company, none of the Company, any of its
        subsidiaries or any of their respective representatives or employees has
        committed an unfair labor practice in connection with the operation of
        the respective businesses of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and
        there is no charge or complaint against the Company or any of its
        subsidiaries by the National Labor Relations Board or any comparable
        governmental agency pending or threatened in writing.

               (ix) None of the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has any
        material liability or obligations, including under or on account of a
        Benefit Plan,

<PAGE>   34

                                                                              29


        arising out of the hiring of persons to provide services to the Company
        or any of its subsidiaries and treating such persons as consultants or
        independent contractors and not as employees of the Company or any of
        its subsidiaries.

               (l) Taxes. (i) Each of the Company and its subsidiaries has
        timely filed all tax returns and reports required to be filed by it, and
        all such returns and reports are true, complete and correct in all
        material respects. Each of the Company and its subsidiaries has timely
        paid all taxes required to be paid by it and withheld and timely paid to
        the proper taxing authority all taxes required to be withheld. The most
        recent financial statements included in the Company Filed SEC Documents
        reflect an adequate reserve for all taxes payable by the Company and its
        subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof accrued
        through the date of such financial statements.

               (ii) No deficiencies for any taxes have been assessed or, to the
        knowledge of the Company, proposed or asserted against the Company or
        any of its subsidiaries that are not adequately reserved for in the most
        recent financial statements included in the Company Filed SEC Documents.
        All assessments for taxes due with respect to any concluded litigation
        have been fully paid or have been adequately reserved for in the most
        recent financial statements included in the Company Filed SEC Documents.
        The statute of limitations for the assessment or collection of tax
        liability has not expired with respect to any income tax returns of the
        Company or any of its subsidiaries. There is no currently effective
        agreement or other document extending, or having the effect of
        extending, the period of assessment or collection of any taxes of the
        Company or any of its subsidiaries and no power of attorney with respect
        to taxes has been executed or filed with any taxing authority. No tax
        returns of the Company or any of its subsidiaries are currently under
        audit or examination by any taxing authority.

               (iii) There are no material Liens for taxes (other than for taxes
        not yet due and payable) on the assets of the Company or any of its
        subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is bound
        by any agreement with respect to taxes.

               (iv) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has been a
        United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of
        Section

<PAGE>   35

                                                                              30


        897(c)(2) of the Code during the applicable period specified in Section
        897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code.

               (v) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has taken any
        action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance that
        is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
        reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

               (vi) The Benefit Plans and other employee compensation
        arrangements in effect as of the date of this Agreement have been
        designed so that the disallowance of a material deduction under Section
        162(m) of the Code for employee remuneration will not apply to any
        amounts paid or payable by the Company or any of its subsidiaries under
        any such plan or arrangement and, to the knowledge of the Company, no
        fact or circumstance exists that is reasonably likely to cause such
        disallowance to apply to any such amounts.

               (vii) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has
        constituted either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled
        corporation" (within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in
        a distribution of stock qualifying for tax-free treatment under Section
        355 of the Code (x) in the two years prior to the date of this Agreement
        or (y) in a distribution which could otherwise constitute part of a
        "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the meaning of
        Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with the Merger.

               (viii) As used in this Agreement, "taxes" shall include all (x)
        U.S. Federal, state, local or foreign income, property, sales, excise
        and other taxes or similar governmental charges, including any interest,
        penalties or additions with respect thereto, (y) liability for the
        payment of any amounts of the type described in (x) as a result of being
        a member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group, and
        (z) liability for the payment of any amounts as a result of being party
        to any tax sharing (or similar) agreement or as a result of any express
        or implied obligation to indemnify any other person with respect to the
        payment of any amounts of the type described in clause (x) or (y).

               (m) Voting Requirements. The affirmative vote of the holders of a
        majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock at the
        Stockholders Meeting to

<PAGE>   36

                                                                              31


        adopt this Agreement (the "Stockholder Approval") is the only vote of
        the holders of any class or series of the Company's capital stock
        necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement and the transactions
        contemplated hereby.

               (n) State Takeover Statutes. The approval of this Agreement and
        the Merger and the Stockholder Agreement and the transactions
        contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement by the
        Special Committee and the Board of Directors of the Company referred to
        in Section 3.01(d) constitutes approval of this Agreement and the Merger
        and the Stockholder Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
        Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement by the Special Committee and the
        Board of Directors of the Company under the provisions of Section 203 of
        the DGCL and represents all the action necessary to ensure that the
        restrictions contained in Section 203 of the DGCL do not apply to Parent
        or Sub in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
        contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement. To the
        knowledge of the Company, except for Section 203 of the DGCL (which has
        been rendered inapplicable), no state takeover statute is applicable to
        the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
        by the Stockholder Agreement.

               (o) Brokers; Schedules of Fees and Expenses. No broker,

        the business of the Company and its subsidiaries.

        subsidiaries has received any written charge, complaint, claim, demand
        or notice alleging any such infringement or misappropriation (including

        presently conducted and proposed to be conducted without giving effect
        to any change with respect thereto that may be made by Parent, to the

        Property Rights which are material to the conduct of the business of the
        Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole will not infringe upon or

the correspondingly numbered representation and warranty or covenant to the
extent specified therein and such other representations and warranties or
covenants to the extent a matter in such section is disclosed in such a way as
to make its relevance to the information called for by such other representation
and warranty or covenant reasonably apparent) delivered by Parent to the Company
prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Parent Disclosure Schedule"),
Parent and Sub represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

        good standing under the DGCL, and each of Parent and Sub has the
        requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its business as now
        being conducted. Each of Parent and Sub is duly qualified or licensed to
        do business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions which
        recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
        business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets makes such
        qualification or licensing necessary, except for those jurisdictions
        where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good
        standing individually or in the aggregate has not had and could not
        reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Parent.
        Parent has made available to the Company prior to the execution of this
        Agreement complete and correct copies of its certificate of
        incorporation and by-laws and the certificate of incorporation and

        requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and

        consummation by Parent and Sub of the transactions contemplated by this
        Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
        the part of Parent and Sub and no other corporate proceedings on the
        part of Parent or Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
        consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. This

                                                                              39


        Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and Sub and,
        assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company,
        constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and Sub,

        execution and delivery of this Agreement do not, and the consummation of
        the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and compliance by Parent
        and Sub with the provisions of this Agreement will not, conflict with,
        or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or without
        notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
        termination, cancelation or acceleration of any obligation or loss of a
        benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
        properties or assets of Parent or Sub under, (i) the Restated Corporate

        statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation, in each case applicable to
        Parent or Sub or any of their respective properties or assets, other
        than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), any such conflicts,
        violations, breaches, defaults, rights, losses or Liens that
        individually or in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to (x)
        have a material adverse effect on Parent, (y) impair in any material
        respect the ability of Parent or Sub to perform its obligations under
        this Agreement or (z) prevent or materially impede, interfere with,
        hinder or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
        this Agreement. No consent, approval, order or authorization of, action

        Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by or with
        respect to Parent or Sub in connection with the execution and delivery
        of this Agreement by Parent and Sub or the consummation by Parent and
        Sub of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for (1)

        Parent ADSs that are to be issued in the Merger to be listed on the
        NYSE; and (5) such other consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
        registrations, declarations and filings the failure of which to be made
        or obtained individually or in the aggregate could not reasonably be
        expected to (x) have a material adverse effect on Parent, (y) impair in

        respective dates, the Parent SEC Documents complied in all material
        respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange
        Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
        promulgated thereunder applicable to such Parent SEC Documents, and none
        of the Parent SEC Documents when filed contained any untrue statement of
        a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be
        stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
        light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
        Except to the extent that information contained in any Parent SEC
        Document has been revised or superseded by a later filed Parent SEC
        Document, none of the Parent SEC Documents contains any untrue statement
        of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be
        stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
        light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
        The financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents
        comply as to form, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC,
        in all material respects with the Accounting Rules, have been prepared
        in accordance with French GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the
        periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and
        fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial
        position of Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates
        thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows
        for the periods then

                                                                              41


        ended. The notes to the financial statements of Parent included in the
        Parent SEC Documents reconciling to U.S. GAAP the consolidated net
        income and shareholders' equity of Parent comply in all material
        respects with the Accounting Rules applicable to such reconciliation.

                (d) Absence of Material Adverse Change. Since the date of the
        most recent audited financial statements included in Parent SEC
        Documents filed and publicly available prior to the date of this
        Agreement, there has not been any material adverse change with respect
        to Parent.

                (e) Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to
        be supplied by Parent specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
        reference in (i) the Form F-4 will, at the time the Form F-4 is filed
        with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented and at the time
        the Form F-4 becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any
        untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
        required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
        therein not misleading or (ii) the Proxy Statement will, at the date it
        is first mailed to the Company's stockholders or at the time of the
        Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
        omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
        necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
        circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Form F-4
        will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of
        the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. No
        representation or warranty is made by Parent or Sub with respect to
        statements made or incorporated by reference in the Form F-4 based on
        information supplied by the Company specifically for inclusion or
        incorporation by reference in the Form F-4.

                (f) No Parent Stockholder Vote Required. This Agreement and the
        transactions contemplated hereby, including the issuance of Parent
        Shares pursuant to Article II hereof, do not require the approval of the
        holders of any shares of capital stock of Parent.

                (g) Parent Shares. All outstanding Parent Shares, Parent ADSs
        and receipts evidencing Parent ADSs are, and all Parent Shares, Parent
        ADSs and receipts evidencing Parent ADSs which may be issued pursuant to
        this Agreement shall when issued in accordance with this Agreement be,
        duly authorized, validly issued,

        fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to preemptive rights.

                (h) Tax Matters. Neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries has
        taken any action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or other
        circumstance that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger from
        qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
        the Code.

                (i) Interim Operations of Sub. Sub was formed solely for the
        purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby, has engaged
        in no other business activities and has conducted its operations only as
        contemplated hereby.

For purposes of this Agreement, "Non-Litigation Liabilities" means all

accordance with GAAP, other than (i) liabilities pertaining to the line item
"Reserve for litigation and copyright matters" (or any similar line item) on any

               (b) Advice of Changes; Filings. The Company and Parent shall
promptly advise the other party orally and in writing to the extent it has
knowledge of (i) any representation or warranty made by it (and, in the case of

                                                                              47


qualified as to materiality becoming untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any
such representation or warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect, (ii) the failure by it (and, in the case of
Parent, by Sub) to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement and (iii) any change or event having, or which could reasonably be
expected to have, a material adverse effect on such party or on the ability of
the conditions set forth in Article VI to be satisfied; provided, however, that
no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions
to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement. The Company and Parent
shall promptly provide the other copies of all filings made by such party with
any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, other than the portions of such filings that include
confidential information not directly related to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

               SECTION 4.02. No Solicitation by the Company. (a) The Company
shall not, nor shall it permit any of its subsidiaries to, nor shall it
authorize or permit any of its or any of its subsidiaries' directors, officers
or employees or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant
or other representative retained by it or any of its subsidiaries to, directly
or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage
(including by way of furnishing information), or take any other action intended
to, or which could reasonably be expected to, facilitate, any inquiries or the
making of any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead
to, any Takeover Proposal or (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate
in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any
information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any
Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that,
notwithstanding compliance with the preceding sentence, the Company receives a
bona fide written Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, the Company may, to the extent
that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel) that it is required to do so in order to
comply with its fiduciary duties, participate in discussions or negotiations
regarding such Takeover Proposal in order to inform itself in a manner required
to comply with its fiduciary duties with respect to such Takeover

<PAGE>   53

                                                                              48


Proposal so that it may make any determination permitted pursuant to Section
4.02(b)(i) and meet its fiduciary duties of full disclosure to the stockholders
of the Company. In such event, the Company shall, (i) no less than 48 hours
prior to participating in any such discussions or negotiations, inform Parent of
the material terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal, including the
identity of the person making such Takeover Proposal, (ii) promptly inform
Parent of the substance of any discussions or negotiations relating to such
Superior Proposal and (iii) promptly keep Parent fully informed of the status,
including any change to the details of, any such Takeover Proposal. Without
limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation in any material
respect of the restrictions set forth in the first sentence of this Section
4.02(a) by any director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant
or other representative of the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall be
deemed to be a breach of this Section 4.02(a) by the Company.

               For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means any
offer not solicited by the Company made by a third party to consummate a tender
offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation, share exchange or similar
transaction which would result in such third party (or its shareholders) owning,
directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the shares of Company Common Stock then
outstanding (or of the surviving entity in a merger) or 50% or more of the
assets of the Company and its subsidiaries and otherwise on terms which the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (following receipt of
the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be
more favorable to the Company's stockholders from a financial point of view than
the Merger.

               For purposes of this Agreement, "Takeover Proposal" means any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any person relating to any direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase of 20% or more of the assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 20% or more of any class or series of equity
securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, any tender offer or
exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person beneficially
owning 20% or more of any class or series of equity securities of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries, or any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to which any person
(or its shareholders) would beneficially own 20% or more of any class or series
of

<PAGE>   54

                                                                              49


equity securities of the Company (or any resulting parent or surviving entity),
other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

               (b) Neither the Company nor the Board of Directors of the Company
nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw
or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the approval or recommendation by such
Board of Directors or such committee of the Merger or this Agreement, except to
the extent that such Board of Directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel) that it is required to do so in order to
comply with its fiduciary duties, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to
approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal or (iii) approve or recommend, or
propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other similar agreement or propose or agree to do any of the
foregoing constituting or related to, or which is intended to or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal.

               (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 4.02, the Company shall immediately (and
no later than 48 hours) advise Parent orally and in writing of any request for
information or of any inquiry with respect to a Takeover Proposal, the material
terms and conditions of such request, inquiry or Takeover Proposal and the
identity of the person making such request, inquiry or Takeover Proposal. The
Company shall promptly keep Parent informed of the status and details (including
amendments or changes or proposed amendments or changes) of any such request,
inquiry or Takeover Proposal.

               (d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 shall prohibit the
Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated
by Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any
disclosure to the Company's stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the
Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation with outside counsel,
failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under
applicable law; provided, however, that, subject to Section 4.02(b)(i), neither
the Company nor its Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall withdraw
or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, its position with respect to this
Agreement or the Merger or approve or recommend, or propose to approve or
recommend, a Takeover Proposal.

the Proxy Statement and Parent and the Company shall prepare and Parent shall
file with the SEC the Form F-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as
a prospectus. Parent shall use all reasonable efforts to have the Form F-4
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after
such filing. The Company will use all reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the Company's stockholders as promptly as practicable
after the Form F-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall
also take any action (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction
in which it is not now so qualified or to file a general consent to service of
process) required to be taken under any applicable state securities laws in
connection with the issuance of Parent Shares in the Merger, and the Company
shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders of Company
Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action
and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement. No filing
of, or amendment or supplement to, or correspondence to the SEC or its staff
with respect to, the Form F-4 will be made by Parent, or the Proxy Statement
will be made by the Company, without providing the other party a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon. Parent will advise the Company,
promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Form F-4 has
become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of
any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Shares
issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction,
or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Form F-4 or comments thereon and
responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. The Company
will advise Parent, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by
the SEC for the amendment of the Proxy Statement or comments thereon and
responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. If at any
time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the Company or
Parent, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be
discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to any of the Form F-4 or the Proxy Statement, so that any of such
documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact necessary

to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and,
to the extent required by law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

               (b) The Company shall, as soon as practicable following the date
of this Agreement, establish a record date (which will be as soon as practicable
following the date of this Agreement) for, duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Stockholders Meeting") solely for
the purpose of obtaining the Stockholder Approval. The Company shall cause the
Stockholders Meeting to be held as promptly as practicable after the date of
this Agreement. Subject to Section 4.02(b)(i), the Company shall, through its
Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders that they adopt this Agreement
and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations
pursuant to this Section 5.01(b) shall not be affected by (i) the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company or any other
person of any Takeover Proposal or (ii) the withdrawal or modification by the
Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof of such Board of
Directors' or such committee's approval or recommendation of the Merger or this
Agreement.

               SECTION 5.02. Access to Information; Confidentiality. Upon
reasonable notice and subject to the Confidentiality Agreement dated as of March
14, 2001, between Parent and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), the
Company shall, and shall cause each of its subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and
to its officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
representatives (including insurance providers and consultants), reasonable
access during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective
Time to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records
(including electronic databases) and, during such period, the Company shall, and
shall cause each of its subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent (a) a copy
of each report, schedule, form, statement and other document filed by it during
such period pursuant to the requirements of Federal or state securities laws and
(b) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as
Parent may reasonably request (including the Company's outside accountants' work
papers). The Company shall not be required to provide access to or disclose
information where such access or disclosure would contravene

                                                                              52


any law, rule, regulation, order or decree of any Governmental Entity. No review
pursuant to this Section 5.02 shall have an effect for the purpose of
determining the accuracy of any representation or warranty given by the Company
to Parent and Sub. Parent will hold, and will cause its officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives and
affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information in accordance with the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement.

               SECTION 5.03. Reasonable Efforts. (a) Upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing,
all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in
the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement, including using
reasonable efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all reasonable
acts necessary to cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as
practicable; (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers,
consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all
necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental
Entities, including under the HSR Act) and the taking of all steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Entity; (iii) the obtaining of all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties; (iv) the defending of any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the Stockholder Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Stockholder Agreement,
including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any
court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed; and (v) the execution
and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement; provided, however, that Parent will not
be required to agree to, or proffer to, (i) divest or hold separate, or enter
into any licensing or similar arrangement with respect to, any assets (whether
tangible or intangible) or any of Parent's, the Company's or any of their
respective affiliates' businesses or (ii) cease to conduct business or
operations in any jurisdiction in which Parent, the Company or any of their
respective subsidiaries conducts business or operations as of the date of this

               (b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the
Company and its Board of Directors shall (i) take all action necessary to ensure
that no state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes
applicable to the Merger, this Agreement, the Stockholder Agreement or any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Stockholder
Agreement and (ii) if any state takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement, the Stockholder
Agreement or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement or the
Stockholder Agreement, take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholder
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement.

               SECTION 5.04. Stock Options. (a) As soon as practicable following
the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Stock Plans) shall adopt
such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to effect the
following:

               (i) adjust the terms of all outstanding Stock Options granted
        under the Company Stock Plans, whether vested or unvested, as necessary
        to provide that, at the Effective Time, each Stock Option outstanding
        immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended and converted
        into an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were
        applicable under such Stock Option, the number of Parent Shares (rounded
        down to the nearest whole share) equal to (A) the number of shares of
        Company Common Stock subject to such Stock Option immediately prior to
        the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise
        price per Parent Share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to
        (x) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock otherwise
        purchasable pursuant to such Stock Option immediately prior to the
        Effective Time divided by (y) the Exchange Ratio (each, as so adjusted,
        an "Adjusted Option"); and

               (ii) make such other changes to the Company Stock Plans as the
        Company and Parent may agree are appropriate to give effect to the
        Merger.

               (b) The adjustments provided in this Section 5.04 with respect to
any Stock Option to which Section 421(a) of

<PAGE>   59

                                                                              54


the Code applies shall be and are intended to be effected in a manner which is
consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the holders of Stock Options appropriate
notices setting forth such holders' rights pursuant to the respective Company
Stock Plans and the agreements evidencing the grants of such Stock Options and
that such Stock Options and agreements shall be assumed by Parent and shall
continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments
required by this Section 5.04 after giving effect to the Merger).

               (c) A holder of an Adjusted Option may exercise such Adjusted
Option in whole or in part in accordance with its terms by following procedures
to be communicated by Parent with the notice contemplated by Section 5.04(b),
together with the consideration therefor and the Federal withholding tax
information, if any, required in accordance with the related Company Stock Plan
or Stock Option Agreement.

               (d) Except to the extent required under the respective terms of
the Stock Options, all restrictions or limitations on transfer and vesting with
respect to Stock Options awarded under the Company Stock Plans or any other
plan, program or arrangement of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, to the
extent that such restrictions or limitations shall not have already lapsed, and
all other terms thereof, shall remain in full force and effect with respect to
such options after giving effect to the Merger and the assumption by Parent as
set forth above.

               (e) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all necessary
action to assume as of the Effective Time all obligations undertaken by Parent
under this Section 5.04, including the reservation, issuance and listing of a
number of Parent ADSs at least equal to the number of Parent Shares subject to
the Adjusted Options. No later than one business day after the Effective Time,
Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8
(or another appropriate form) registering a number of Parent ADSs representing
the number of Parent Shares subject to the Adjusted Options and shall maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus contained therein) for so long as such Adjusted Options
remain outstanding. The Company shall cooperate with, and assist Parent in the
preparation of, such registration statement.

               SECTION 5.05. Employee Matters. (a) For a period ending not
earlier than December 31, 2002, employees of the Company and its subsidiaries
who continue their

<PAGE>   60

                                                                              55


employment after the Effective Time (the "Affected Employees") shall receive
employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
employee benefits provided to the Affected Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time; provided, that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall have any obligation to issue, or adopt any plans or arrangements providing
for the issuance of, shares of capital stock, warrants, options, SARs or other
rights in respect of any shares of capital stock of any entity or any securities
convertible or exchangeable into such shares pursuant to any such plans or
arrangements; provided, further, that no plans or arrangements of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries providing for such issuance shall be taken into account
in determining whether employee benefits are substantially comparable in the
aggregate. Affected Employees shall be given credit under each employee benefit
plan, program, policy or arrangement of Parent or any of its affiliates in which
the Affected Employees are eligible to participate for all service with the
Company or any predecessor employer (to the extent such credit was given by the
Company) for purposes of eligibility, vesting, severance and vacation
entitlement.

               (b) With respect to the ESPP, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to provide that (i) no offerings that would commence on a date
following the date of this Agreement shall be permitted, (ii) with respect any
offering thereunder that is in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each participant's accumulated payroll deductions shall be used to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time in
accordance with the terms of the ESPP and (iii) the ESPP shall terminate at the
Effective Time.

               (c) Parent and the Company agree to implement the arrangements
described in Section 5.05(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. In addition,
Parent agrees that, if it offers a one-year written employment agreement to any
employee of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, such employment agreement
will be in the form previously agreed to by Parent and the Company.

               (d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.05 or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall be construed to prevent the termination of employment of any
individual Company Employee or any change in the employee benefits available to
any individual Company Employee or the amendment or termination of any
particular Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement to the extent permitted by its
terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

               SECTION 5.06. Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance. (a)
Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the
Company and its subsidiaries as provided in their respective articles of
organization or by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) and any
indemnification agreements of the Company (as each is in effect on the date
hereof), the existence of which does not constitute a breach of this Agreement,
shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further
action, as of the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall continue
in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to honor all such rights.

               (b) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and
is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, or Parent otherwise dissolves the Surviving
Corporation, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to
be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 5.06.

               (c) The Surviving Corporation shall, at its option, for a period
of not less than six years after the Effective Time, either (i) maintain the
Company's current directors' and officers' liability insurance covering acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time ("D&O Insurance") with
respect to those persons who are currently covered by the Company's directors'
and officers' liability insurance policy on terms with respect to such coverage
and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date
hereof or (ii) cause to be provided coverage no less favorable to such directors
or officers, as the case may be, than the D&O Insurance, in each case so long as
the annual premium therefor would not be in excess of 200% of the last annual
premium paid for the D&O Insurance prior to the date of this Agreement (such
200% amount the "Maximum Premium"); provided that if the annual premium for such
coverage exceeds the Maximum Premium, Parent shall be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum
Premium. If the existing or substituted directors' and officers' liability
insurance expires, is terminated or canceled during such six-year period, the
Surviving Corporation will obtain as much D&O Insurance as can be

                                                                              57


obtained for the remainder of such period for an annualized premium not in
excess of the Maximum Premium. The Company represents that the Maximum Premium
is $3,874,800.

               (d) The provisions of this Section 5.06 (i) are intended to be
for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or
her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have by contract or otherwise.

               SECTION 5.07. Fees and Expenses. All fees and expenses incurred
in connection with the Merger, this Agreement, the Stockholder Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement shall
be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger
is consummated, except that each of Parent and the Company shall bear and pay
one-half of the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the filing,
printing and mailing of the Form F-4 and the Proxy Statement (including SEC
filing fees).

               SECTION 5.08. Public Announcements. Parent and the Company will
consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity
to review, comment upon and concur with, any press release or other public
statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger and the Stockholder Agreement, and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation,
except as either party may determine is required by applicable law, the SEC or
any similar foreign regulatory authority, court process or by obligations
pursuant to any listing or similar foreign regulatory authority or quotation
agreement with any national securities exchange or national trading system. The
parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement shall
be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties.

               SECTION 5.09. Affiliates. The Company shall deliver to Parent at
least 15 days prior to the Closing Date a letter identifying all persons who
are, at the time this Agreement is submitted for adoption by the stockholders of
the Company, "affiliates" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act. The Company shall use reasonable efforts to cause each such
person who makes or proposes to make a Share Election to deliver to Parent prior
to the Closing Date a written agreement substantially in the form attached as
Exhibit A hereto.

                                                                              58


               SECTION 5.10. NYSE Listing. Parent shall use reasonable efforts
to cause the Parent ADSs issuable in the Merger and issuable upon exercise of
the Adjusted Options to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official
notice of issuance, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, and in any
event prior to the Closing Date.

               SECTION 5.11. Litigation. (a) The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any litigation
against the Company and/or its directors relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement, and no such
settlement shall be agreed to without Parent's prior written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

               (b) The Company shall keep Parent fully informed of the status
and details of any discussions, negotiations or litigation relating to any of
the matters set forth in Section 3.01(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (and
shall promptly provide Parent with copies of any relevant documents or materials
related thereto), and shall give Parent and its counsel the opportunity to
participate in any such discussions or negotiations and in the defense of any
litigation in respect of any such matters. The Company shall also inform Parent
promptly of the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding (whether or not
relating to any matter set forth in Section 3.01(h) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule) against the Company, and of the assertion or threatened assertion of
any claim against, or demand made upon, the Company by any person (and promptly
provide Parent with copies of all complaints, briefs, claims, demands,
correspondence and other documents relating thereto), shall keep Parent fully
informed of the status and details of all such litigation claims and demands and
of any settlement discussions or negotiations relating thereto and shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense thereof and in any such
discussions or negotiations. The Company shall not enter into any agreement that
has the effect of settling, releasing or otherwise disposing of any such
litigation, claim or demand (or enter into any licensing agreement relating
thereto) without Parent's prior written consent.

               SECTION 5.12. Tax Treatment. Each of Parent and the Company shall
use reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization under
the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code and to obtain the tax opinions
referred to in Sections 6.02(c) and 6.03(c), including the execution of the
letters of representation referred to therein. Neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall take any action after the Effective Time that is reasonably
likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a

inscribe upon any certificate representing Subject Shares (as defined in the
Stockholder Agreement) tendered by the Company Stockholders in connection with
any proposed transfer of any Subject Shares by the Company Stockholders in

Stockholders within three business days following the Company's receipt thereof.

               SECTION 5.14. Termination of Agreements. The Company shall cause
all provisions of all purchase agreements, stockholder agreements, registration
rights agreements, investors' rights agreements, co-sale agreements, rights of
first refusal and similar agreements between any stockholder of the Company and
the Company to terminate and be of no further force and effect upon consummation
of the Merger. A list of all of such agreements is set forth in Section 5.14 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule.

               SECTION 5.15. Resignation of Directors of the Company. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall cause each member of its Board of
Directors to execute and deliver a letter effectuating his or her resignation as
a director of such Board effective immediately prior to the Effective Time.

        though made on the Closing Date (except to the extent such
        representations and warranties expressly speak as of an earlier date, in
        which case as of such earlier date), except to the extent that the facts
        or matters as to which such representations and warranties are not so
        true and correct as of such dates, individually or in the aggregate,
        have not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a material
        adverse effect on the Company. Parent shall have received a certificate
        signed on behalf of the Company by the chief executive officer of the
        Company to such effect.

               (b) Performance of Obligations of the Company. The Company shall
        have performed in all material respects all obligations required to be
        performed by it under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date.

        by the chief executive officer of the Company to such effect.

               (c) Tax Opinion. Parent shall have received from Cravath, Swaine
        & Moore, counsel to Parent, an opinion dated as of the Closing Date,
        stating that the Merger will qualify for U.S. Federal income tax
        purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
        Code. The issuance of such opinion shall be conditioned upon the receipt
        by such tax counsel of customary representation letters from each of the
        Company and Parent, in each case, in form and substance reasonably
        satisfactory to such tax counsel.

               SECTION 6.03. Conditions to Obligations of the Company. The
obligation of the Company to effect the Merger is further subject to
satisfaction or waiver of the following conditions:

               (a) Representations and Warranties. Each of the representations
        and warranties of Parent and Sub contained in this Agreement,
        disregarding all qualifications and exceptions contained therein
        relating to materiality or material adverse effect, shall be true and
        correct as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as
        though made on the Closing Date (except to the extent such
        representations and warranties expressly speak as of an earlier date, in
        which case as of such earlier date), except to the extent that the facts
        or matters as to which such representations and warranties are not so
        true and correct as of such dates, individually or in the aggregate,
        have not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a material
        adverse effect on Parent. The Company shall have received a certificate
        signed on

        behalf of Parent by an authorized signatory of Parent to such effect.

               (b) Performance of Obligations of Parent and Sub. Parent and Sub
        shall have performed in all material respects all obligations required
        to be performed by them under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing
        Date. The Company shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of
        Parent by an authorized signatory of Parent to such effect.

               (c) Tax Opinion. The Company shall have received from Ernst &
        Young LLP, tax advisors to the Company, an opinion dated as of the
        Closing Date, stating that the Merger will qualify for U.S. Federal
        income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
        368(a) of the Code. The issuance of such opinion shall be conditioned
        upon the receipt by such tax advisor of customary representation letters
        from each of the Company and Parent, in each case, in form and substance
        reasonably satisfactory to such tax advisor.

               SECTION 6.04. Frustration of Closing Conditions. None of Parent,
Sub or the Company may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Section
6.01, 6.02 or 6.03, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was
caused by such party's failure to use reasonable efforts to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Stockholder Agreement, as required by and subject to Section 5.03.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                        Termination, Amendment and Waiver

               SECTION 7.01. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at
any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after receipt of the

               (a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

               (b) by either Parent or the Company:

                        (i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated by
               November 30, 2001; provided, however, that the right to terminate
               this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(b)(i) shall not be
               available to any party whose failure to perform any of its
               obligations under this

               Agreement results in the failure of the Merger to be consummated
               by such time;

                      (ii) if the Stockholder Approval shall not have been
               obtained at the Stockholders Meeting duly convened therefor or at
               any adjournment or postponement thereof; or

                      (iii) if any Restraint having any of the effects set forth
               in Section 6.01(c) shall be in effect and shall have become final
               and nonappealable; provided that the party seeking to terminate
               this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(b)(iii) shall have
               used reasonable efforts to prevent the entry of and to remove
               such Restraint;

               (c) by Parent, if the Company shall have breached or failed to
        perform in any material respect any of its representations, warranties,
        covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach
        or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition
        set forth in Section 6.02(a) or (b), and (B) is incapable of being or
        has not been cured by the Company within 30 calendar days after giving
        written notice to the Company of such breach or failure to perform; or

               (d) by the Company, if Parent shall have breached or failed to
        perform in any material respect any of its representations, warranties,
        covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach
        or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition
        set forth in Section 6.03(a) or (b), and (B) is incapable of being or
        has not been cured by Parent within 30 calendar days after giving
        written notice to Parent of such breach or failure to perform.

               SECTION 7.02. Effect of Termination. In the event of termination
of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 7.01,
this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of Parent or the Company, other than the
provisions of Section 3.01(o), the last sentence of Section 5.02, Section 5.07,
this Section 7.02 and Article VIII, which provisions survive such termination,
and except to the extent that such termination results from the willful and
material breach by a party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements set forth in this Agreement.

               SECTION 7.03. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the
parties at any time prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that after
the Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall not be made any
amendment that by law requires further approval by the stockholders of the
Company without the further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may
not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
the parties.

               SECTION 7.04. Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, a party may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies
in the representations and warranties of the other parties contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) subject
to the proviso to the first sentence of Section 7.03, waive compliance by the
other party with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this
Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its
rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights.

               SECTION 7.05. Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or
Waiver. A termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01, an amendment
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.03 or an extension or waiver pursuant to
Section 7.04 shall, in order to be effective, require, in the case of Parent or
the Company, action by its Board of Directors or, except with respect to a
termination of this Agreement, the duly authorized committee of its Board of
Directors to the extent permitted by law.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

               SECTION 8.01. Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties. None
of the representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time. This
Section 8.01 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties which by
its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time.

               SECTION 8.02. Notices. All notices, requests, claims, demands and
other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be
deemed given if

interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation". The words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and

defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to
the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as
well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any agreement,

               SECTION 8.05. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties.

               SECTION 8.06. Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries.
This Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein), the
Stockholder Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement (a) constitute the
entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both

Agreement and (b) except for the provisions of Article II and Section 5.06, are
not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties any rights or
remedies.

               SECTION 8.07. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless
of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflict
of laws thereof.

               SECTION 8.08. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in
whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto
without the prior written consent of the other parties. Any assignment in
violation of the preceding sentence shall be void. Subject to the preceding two
sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

               SECTION 8.09. Enforcement. Each of the parties hereto agrees that
irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate
remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It
is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any Federal court located in the
State of Delaware or in Delaware state court, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. In addition, each
of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction
of any Federal court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state
court in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt
to deny or defeat such

personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court,
(c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than a
Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware or a Delaware state court and (d)
waives any right to trial by jury with respect to any claim or proceeding
related to or arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated by
this Agreement.

               SECTION 8.10. Severability. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

                            Form of Affiliate Letter

Dear Sirs:

        The undersigned, a holder of shares of common stock, par value $0.001
per share ("Company Common Stock"), of MP3.com, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the "Company"), is entitled to receive in connection with the merger (the
"Merger") of the Company with and into a subsidiary of Parent, a societe anonyme
organized under the laws of France ("Parent"), securities of Parent, as the
parent of the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Parent Securities"). The
undersigned acknowledges that the undersigned may be deemed an "affiliate" of
the Company within the meaning of Rule 145 ("Rule 145") promulgated under the
Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC"), although nothing contained herein should be construed as
an admission of such fact.

        If in fact the undersigned were an affiliate under the Securities Act,
the undersigned's ability to sell, assign or transfer the Parent Securities
received by the undersigned in exchange for any shares of Company Common Stock
in connection with the Merger may be restricted unless such transaction is
registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is
available. The undersigned understands that such exemptions are limited and the
undersigned has obtained or will obtain advice of counsel as to the nature and
conditions of such exemptions, including information with respect to the
applicability to the sale of such securities of Rules 144 and 145(d) promulgated
under the Securities Act. The undersigned understands that Parent will not be
required to maintain the effectiveness of any registration statement under the
Securities Act for the purposes of resale of Parent Securities by the
undersigned.

        The undersigned hereby represents to and covenants with Parent that the
undersigned will not sell, assign or transfer any of the Parent Securities
received by the undersigned in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock in
connection with the Merger except (i) pursuant to an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act, (ii) in conformity with the volume and other
limitations of Rule 145 or (iii) in a transaction which, in the opinion of
counsel to Parent or the undersigned reasonably acceptable to Parent or as
described in a "no-action" or interpretive letter from the Staff of the SEC
specifically issued with respect to a transaction to be engaged in by the
undersigned, is not required to be registered under the Securities Act.

        In the event of a sale or other disposition by the undersigned of Parent
Securities pursuant to Rule 145, the undersigned will supply Parent with
evidence of compliance with such Rule, in the form of a letter in the form of
Annex I

<PAGE>   78

                                                                               2


hereto or the opinion of counsel or no-action letter referred to above. The
undersigned understands that Parent may instruct its transfer agent to withhold
the transfer of any Parent Securities disposed of by the undersigned, but that
(provided such transfer is not prohibited by any other provision of this letter
agreement) upon receipt of such evidence of compliance, Parent shall cause the
transfer agent to effectuate the transfer of the Parent Securities sold as
indicated in such letter.

        Parent covenants that it will take all such actions as may be reasonably
available to it to permit the sale or other disposition of Parent Securities by
the undersigned under Rule 145 in accordance with the terms thereof.

        The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that the legends set forth below
will be placed on certificates representing Parent Securities received by the
undersigned in connection with the Merger or held by a transferee thereof, which
legends will be removed by delivery of substitute certificates upon receipt of
an opinion in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent from
independent counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent to the effect that such
legends are no longer required for purposes of the Securities Act.

        There will be placed on the certificates for Parent Securities issued to
the undersigned, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:

        "The shares represented by this certificate were issued in a transaction
   to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 (the
   "Securities Act") applies. The shares have not been acquired by the holder
   with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof
   within the meaning of the Securities Act. The shares may not be sold, pledged
   or otherwise transferred except (i) pursuant to an effective registration
   under the Securities Act, (ii) in conformity with the volume and other
   limitations of Rule 145 or (iii) in accordance with an exemption from the
   registration requirements of the Securities Act."

        The undersigned acknowledges that (i) the undersigned has carefully read
this letter and understands the requirements hereof and the limitations imposed
upon the distribution, sale, transfer or other disposition of Parent Securities
and (ii) the receipt by Parent of this letter is an inducement to Parent's
obligations to consummate the Merger.

Very truly yours,


Dated:

                                                                    TO EXHIBIT A


[Name]                                                                    [Date]


        On ________________, the undersigned sold the securities of Parent,
a societe anonyme organized under the laws of France ("Parent"), described below
in the space provided for that purpose (the "Securities"). The Securities were
received by the undersigned in connection with the merger of MP3.com, Inc., a
Delaware corporation, with and into a subsidiary of Parent.

        Based upon the most recent report or statement filed by Parent with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the Securities sold by the undersigned were
within the prescribed limitations set forth in paragraph (e) of Rule 144
promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act").

        The undersigned hereby represents that the Securities were sold in
"brokers' transactions" within the meaning of Section 4(4) of the Securities Act
or in transactions directly with a "market maker" as that term is defined in
Section 3(a)(38) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The
undersigned further represents that the undersigned has not solicited or
arranged for the solicitation of orders to buy the Securities, and that the
undersigned has not made any payment in connection with the offer or sale of the
Securities to any person other than to the broker who executed the order in
respect of such sale.


                                    Very truly yours,



            [Space to be provided for description of the Securities.]
