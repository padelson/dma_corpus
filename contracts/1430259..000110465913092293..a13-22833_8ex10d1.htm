update to the Title Commitment dated and effective as of a date following the

reasonable discretion) on or prior to the Closing Date, or (B) Seller fails to
deliver Sellers Objection Response Notice within five (5) Business Days of
Sellers receipt of Purchasers Objection Notice, then Purchaser may (as its
sole and exclusive remedy) terminate this Agreement by delivering notice
thereof in writing to Seller within five (5) Business Days after (1)
Purchasers receipt of Sellers Objection Response Notice or (2) Sellers
failure to deliver Sellers Objection Response Notice within the time frame
provided in this Section 4.1.2(a). Such five (5) Business Day period following
the contingencies described in items (1) and (2) of the immediately prior
sentence shall, if necessary, automatically extend the Closing Date so that
Purchaser shall have a full five (5) Business Days in which to respond to
Sellers Objection Notice or Sellers failure to deliver the same in
accordance with this _Section 4.1.2(a_), provided, that in no even shall the
Closing Date be extended beyond December 31, 2013. Upon Purchasers delivery
to Seller of a notice of termination under this _Section 4.1.2(a)_, (I) this
Agreement shall immediately terminate, (II) the Earnest Money, together with
all interest accruing thereon, shall immediately be returned to Purchaser and
(III) neither party shall have any obligations hereunder other than the
Surviving Obligations.

 



 

(b) **_Permitted Encumbrances_**. The term " ** _Permitted Encumbrances_** "
as used herein means: (i) those items listed on **__Exhibit I__** attached
hereto, and (ii) if Purchaser elects not to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 4.1.2(a)_, any Purchasers Objection that remains uncured, for
whatever reason, five (5) Business Days after Purchasers receipt of Sellers
Objection Response Notice (or, if earlier, on or before the Closing Date)
(excluding any Monetary Encumbrance, Sellers obligations, if any, as to which
shall be as set forth below in this _Section 4.1.2(b)_ and in _Section
4.1.2(d)_). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Seller
expressly acknowledges and agrees that in no event shall any monetary lien on
the Property or other encumbrance upon the Property that can be cured by the
payment of money (each, a " ** _Monetary Encumbrance_** ", and collectively,
the " ** _Monetary Encumbrances_** ") constitute a "Permitted Encumbrance"
hereunder.

 



 

(c) **_Title Policy_**. At Closing, Seller shall cause the Title Company to

that Title Company has irrevocably agreed to issue an Owners Policy of Title
Insurance in 2006 ALTA standard form in the form thereof, in either case
naming Purchaser as insured, in the amount of the Purchase Price, insuring
that Purchaser owns good and indefeasible leasehold title to (i) the Hotel
Parcel pursuant to the Hotel Ground Lease, and (ii) the Hotel Service Area
Parcel pursuant to the Hotel Service Area Lease, in each case subject only to
the Permitted Encumbrances (except as hereafter provided), with "extended
coverage" and such other title insurance coverage or endorsements as are
available in the State of Illinois which Purchaser may reasonably require,
including, without limitation, (1) an ALTA form 3.1 zoning endorsement with
parking and loading docks, (2) removing the survey exception listed as
Permitted Encumbrance number 1 on **_Exhibit I_** and/or replacing the same
with a specific survey exception, and (3) an ALTA form 34-06 Identified Risk
endorsement with respect to the Developers Agreement listed as Permitted
Encumbrance number 10 on **_Exhibit I_**, all in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser (collectively , the " ** _Owner s
Policy_**")). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligation of Purchaser to close hereunder is conditioned upon delivery of the
Owners Policy to Purchaser at Closing. If the Seller has not so caused the
Title Company to deliver such Owners Policy (and extended coverage, unless
the failure to deliver same is the result of Purchasers failure to pay for
any such extended coverage or endorsements as required herein) to Purchaser,
Purchaser shall have the right, as its sole and exclusive remedy, to terminate
this Agreement and, in such event, the Earnest Money shall promptly be
refunded to Purchaser, and neither party shall have any obligations hereunder
other than the Surviving Obligations. The Owners Policy shall be at Sellers
cost to the extent required under _Section 6.5_ hereof, provided, however the
"extended coverage" or other title insurance coverage or endorsements shall be
at Purchasers sole expense.

 



 

(d) **_Limitations of Seller s Obligations_**. Seller shall have no
obligation to take any steps or bring any action or proceeding or otherwise to
incur any effort or expense whatsoever to eliminate, modify or cure any matter
affecting title to the Property that is not a Permitted Encumbrance (the " **
_Non-Permitted Encumbrances_** "). In the event Seller is unable or unwilling
to eliminate or modify any Non-Permitted Encumbrance to the satisfaction of
Purchaser, in Purchasers reasonable discretion, on or before the Closing
Date, Purchaser may (as its sole and exclusive remedy) terminate this
Agreement, at which time the Earnest Money, together with all interest
accruing thereon, shall immediately be returned to Purchaser and neither party
shall have any obligations hereunder other than the Surviving Obligations.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall eliminate, modify or cure, to
Purchasers satisfaction (in Purchasers reasonable discretion) at or prior to
Closing any and all (i) Monetary Encumbrances caused or incurred by Seller or
any affiliate of Seller, (ii) all other Monetary Encumbrances not described in
clause (i) above or clause (iii) below, in an aggregate amount not to exceed
$1,000,000 and (iii) any Purchasers Objection which Seller has agreed to
eliminate, modify or cure, whether monetary or non-monetary, in Sellers
Objection Response Notice. Sellers failure to eliminate, modify or cure such
matters in accordance herewith shall constitute a breach of this Agreement by
Seller. In the event Seller fails to eliminate, modify or cure such matters
described in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of the previous sentence, Purchaser
may choose (as its sole and exclusive remedy) either (A) to pursue the remedy
of specific performance of Sellers obligations pursuant to and in accordance
with Section 8.1 of this Agreement, or (B) to terminate this Agreement, at
which time the Earnest Money, together with all interest accruing thereon,
shall immediately be returned to Purchaser and neither party shall have any
obligations hereunder other than the Surviving Obligations, and, in addition
Purchaser shall also reimburse to Seller all of Sellers actual, reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred from the time that Purchaser
received such Sellers Objection Response Notice until the termination of this
Agreement.

Purchaser and subject to the confidentiality provisions of _Section 10.19_
hereof. Purchaser shall restore the Property to its condition existing
immediately prior to Purchasers inspection thereof, and Purchaser shall be
liable for all damage or injury to any person or property resulting from,
relating to or arising out of any such inspection, whether occasioned by the
acts of Purchaser or any of its employees, agents, representatives or
contractors, and Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its
agents, employees, officers, directors, affiliates and asset managers from any
liability resulting therefrom, except to the extent caused by or arising from
(A) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Seller or its agents,
employees, officers, directors, affiliates or asset managers and/or (B) any
circumstances or condition existing upon the Property prior to the date of
such inspection. Purchasers physical inspection shall not unreasonably
interfere with the use or operation of the Property by Seller or its tenants

without obtaining Sellers prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed with respect to tenants only)
and shall take commercially reasonable steps to minimize disruption of
Sellers or Sellers tenants or guests activities on the Property. This
indemnification by Purchaser shall survive the Closing or the termination of
this Agreement, as applicable.

and its principals and to effectuate Sellers assignment of the Management
Agreement to Purchaser (in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
Management Agreement). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the obligations of the Seller and Purchaser to close hereunder are
conditioned upon Manager (i) having consented in writing (pursuant to the
terms of the Management Agreement), prior to Closing, to the assignment of the
Management Agreement to Purchaser (the " ** _Manager Consent_** ") or, if
required by Manager, to the execution of a New Management Agreement between
Manager and Purchaser, and (ii) having delivered a Managers Estoppel (" **
_Manager s Estoppel_**") in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser, Seller and Manager, and which shall be attached hereto as
**_Exhibit J_** prior to Closing. If Purchaser shall have mortgage financing

to Purchasers obligations under this Agreement. Seller and Purchaser shall
cooperate reasonably with each other in connection with Sellers efforts to
obtain the Manager Consent, Managers Estoppel and, if applicable, Managers
SNDA. If either the Managers Consent or the Managers Estoppel is not
obtained by the Closing Date, each of Seller and Purchaser shall be entitled,
at its respective election, to terminate this Agreement. The failure of
Manager to deliver a Managers SNDA shall not in and of itself result in
either party being in default under this Agreement and shall not give either
party the right to terminate this Agreement. Without limiting any right of
such terminating party may have by reason of any default by the other party
under this Agreement, the mere failure of Manager to deliver the Managers
Consent or the Managers Estoppel (notwithstanding Purchaser and Seller having
complied with their respective obligations under this Agreement), shall not in
and of itself result in either party being in default under this Agreement but
shall only give each party the right to terminate this Agreement. If either
party terminates this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 4.7_, the Earnest
Money, in the amount then held by the Title Company, shall be immediately
returned to Purchaser and the parties shall have no further obligations
hereunder except for the Surviving Obligations.

Ground Lease (which information, documents and materials shall then be
delivered to Hotel Ground Lease Lessor) in connection with Sellers request
for Hotel Ground Lease Lessors consent to the intended sale of the Property
to Purchaser. Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser shall use good faith,

Lessor with such additional non-confidential information as Hotel Ground Lease
Lessor reasonably requires to assess the business reputation of Purchaser and
its principals and to effectuate Sellers assignment of the Hotel Ground Lease
to Purchaser (in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Hotel
Ground Lease). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations of the Seller and Purchaser to close hereunder are conditioned
upon Hotel Ground Lease Lessor (i) having consented in writing (pursuant to
the terms of the Hotel Ground Lease), prior to Closing, to the assignment of
the Hotel Ground Lease to Purchaser (the " ** _Hotel Ground Lease Lessor

Estoppel (" ** _Hotel Ground Lease Lessor s Estoppel_**") in form and

may have by reason of any default by the other party under this Agreement, the
mere failure of Hotel Ground Lease Lessor to deliver the Hotel Ground Lease
Lessor Consent or the Hotel Ground Lease Lessor Estoppel (notwithstanding
Purchaser and Seller having complied with their respective obligations under
this Agreement), shall not in and of itself result in either party being in
default under this Agreement but shall only give each party the right to
terminate this Agreement. If either party terminates this Agreement pursuant
to this _Section 4.8_, the Earnest Money, in the amount then held by the
Title Company, shall be immediately returned to Purchaser and the parties
shall have no further obligations hereunder except for the Surviving
Obligations.

request of Seller, Purchaser shall deliver to the landlord under the Hotel
Service Area Lease (" ** _Hotel Service Area Lease Lessor_** ") such non-

Sellers interest in the Hotel Service Area Lease (which information,
documents and materials shall then be delivered to Hotel Service Area Lease
Lessor) in connection with Sellers request for Hotel Service Area Lease
Lessors consent to the intended sale of the Property to Purchaser. Without
limiting the foregoing, Purchaser shall use good faith, commercially
reasonable efforts otherwise to provide Hotel Service Area Lease Lessor with
such additional non-confidential information as Hotel Service Area Lease
Lessor reasonably requires to assess the business reputation of Purchaser and
its principals and to effectuate Sellers assignment of the Hotel Service Area
Lease to Purchaser (in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
Hotel Service Area Lease). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the obligations of the Seller and Purchaser to close hereunder are
conditioned upon Hotel Service Area Lease Lessor (i) having consented in
writing (pursuant to the terms of the Hotel Service Area Lease), prior to
Closing, to the assignment of the Hotel Service Area Lease to Purchaser (the "
** _Hotel Service Area Lease Lessor Consent_** "), and (ii) having delivered a
Hotel Service Area Lease Lessors Estoppel (" ** _Hotel Service Area Lease
Lessor s Estoppel_**") in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser, Seller and Hotel Service Area Lease Lessor, and which shall be
attached hereto as **_Exhibit L-2_** prior to Closing. Seller and Purchaser
shall cooperate reasonably with each other in connection with Sellers efforts
to obtain the Hotel Service Area Lease Lessor Consent and the Hotel Service
Area Lease Lessors Estoppel. If such condition precedent to Closing is not
met by the Closing Date, each of Seller and Purchaser shall be entitled, at
its respective election, to terminate this Agreement. Without limiting any
right of such terminating party may have by reason of any default by the other
party under this Agreement, the mere failure of Hotel Service Area Lease
Lessor to deliver the Hotel Service Area Lease Lessor Consent or the Hotel
Service Area Lease Lessor Estoppel (notwithstanding Purchaser and Seller
having complied with their respective obligations under this Agreement), shall
not in and of itself result in either party being in default under this
Agreement but shall only give each party the right to terminate this
Agreement. If either party so terminates this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 4.9_, the Earnest Money shall be immediately returned to Purchaser
and the parties shall have no further obligations hereunder except for the
Surviving Obligations.

 



 

4.10 **_Existing Renovation_**. Notwithstanding anything in this agreement to
the contrary, the obligation of Purchaser to close hereunder is conditioned

without limitation, the ongoing work described on **_Exhibit R_** attached
hereto (collectively, the " ** _Existing Renovation_** "), in a form
reasonably satisfactory to the Title Company for purposes of issuing the
Owners Policy, executed by the general contractor and all subcontractors
performing work or providing materials in connection with the Existing
Renovation, evidencing that each contractor has been paid in full for all work
performed on and/or materials provided to the Property in connection with the
Existing Renovation (collectively, the " ** _Renovation Lien Releases_** "),

form reasonably satisfactory to the Title Company for purposes of issuing the
Owners Policy without exception for any lien, or right to lien, for services,
labor, or material with respect to the Existing Renovation (collectively, the
" ** _Renovation Title Clearance_** ").

 



 

4.11 **_Zoning Matters_**. Notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the
contrary, the obligation of Purchaser to close hereunder is conditioned upon
Sellers delivery to Purchaser, at or prior to Closing a "PZR Report" with
respect to the Property issued by The Planning and Zoning Resource Corp (the "
**Zoning Report** ") acceptable to Purchaser in Purchasers reasonable
discretion.

 



 

4.12 **_Failure of Purchaser Closing Condition_**. If any one or more of the
Purchaser Closing Conditions are not satisfied at Closing, then Purchaser
shall have the right to (a) terminate this Agreement by providing written
notice thereof to Seller, in which case the Earnest Money shall be promptly
returned to Purchaser, and the parties shall have no further obligations
hereunder except for the Surviving Obligations, or (b) provided all conditions
precedent to Sellers obligation to close its sale of the Property pursuant
hereto have been satisfied or waived by Seller, waive any such Purchaser
Closing Conditions at or prior to Closing and proceed to Closing without
abatement of the amount of the Purchase Price, it being acknowledged and
agreed that Purchasers payment of the Purchase Price at Closing shall be
evidence of such waiver and upon payment of the Purchase Price all Purchaser
Closing Conditions shall be deemed satisfied.

_Closing Date_** "), unless the parties mutually agree in writing upon another
place, time or date.

 



 

6.1.1 **_Acceleration_**. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall have
the right, to be exercised in Purchasers sole and absolute discretion to
accelerate the Closing Date to any date specified by Purchaser upon written
notice to Seller (the " ** _Acceleration Notice_** ") delivered at least seven
(7) days prior to such accelerated Closing Date specified by Purchaser in the
Acceleration Notice; provided, however, in no event shall Seller have any
obligation to close unless all conditions precedent to such obligation set

" ** _Extension Notice_** "), specifying the extended Closing Date chosen by
Purchaser and (ii) depositing with the Title Company, substantially
concurrently with Purchasers delivery of the Extension Notice, the amount of
$1,000,000 (the " ** _Extension Deposit_** "). The Extension Deposit shall
become a part of the Earnest Money, shall be applied to the Purchase Price at
the Closing and will be non-refundable to Purchaser except as otherwise set
forth herein. Notwithstanding any such extension of the Closing Date by
Purchaser (x) Purchaser, in its sole and absolute discretion, may elect to
consummate the Closing on any date within such fifteen (15) day extension
period by delivering written notice of such election at least two (2) days
prior to the Closing Date specified by Purchaser in such written notice, and
(y) notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, in no event
shall Seller have any obligation to close unless all conditions precedent to
such obligation set forth in this Agreement have been satisfied including,
without limitation, receipt by Seller of the Manager Consent, the Hotel Ground
Lease Lessor Consent and the Hotel Service Area Lease Lessor Consent.

 



 

6.2 **_Possession_**. Possession of the Property shall be delivered to
Purchaser at the Closing.

 



 

6.3 **_Proration_**. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,

utilities and all other operating expenses with respect to the Property for
the month in which the Closing occurs, and real estate and personal property
taxes and other assessments with respect to the Property for the year in which
the Closing occurs, shall be prorated to the Closing Date, with Purchaser
receiving the benefits and burdens of ownership on the Closing Date. Not later
than seven (7) days prior to the then-scheduled Closing Date, Seller shall
prepare a proforma of the accounting for the transaction that reflects how
items subject to proration and/or adjustment will be accounted for under this
_Section 6.3_ or under any other provisions of this Agreement (the " **
_Preliminary Closing Statement_** "), a copy of which shall be delivered to
Purchaser for Purchasers review, with such supporting documentation as
Purchaser may reasonably require being attached thereto. On the day prior to
Closing, Purchaser and Seller will conduct inventories, examinations and
audits of the Property as may be necessary to verify and/or make revisions to
the Preliminary Closing Statement based on such audits, examinations and
inventories, and on the night preceding the Closing immediately after Night
Audit Cut-Off (as defined below), Purchaser and Seller will make all final
adjustments necessitated by such nights operations and prepare a final
statement of prorations and adjustments required under this _Section 6.3_
with such supporting documentation as the Parties hereto may reasonably
require being attached thereto (the " ** _Closing Statement_** "). All
prorations reflected on the Preliminary Closing Statement and on the Closing
Statement shall be made on the basis of the actual number of days in the year
and month in which the Closing occurs or in the period of computation. No
prorations shall be made in relation to insurance premiums.

 



 

(a) If the Closing shall occur before rents and all other amounts payable by
the tenants under the Leases and all other income from the Property have
actually been paid for the month in which the Closing occurs, the
apportionment of such rents and other amounts and other income shall be upon
the basis of such rents, other amounts and other income actually received by
Seller. Subsequent to the Closing, if any such rents and other income are
actually received by Purchaser, all such amounts shall first be applied to
post-closing rents due to Purchaser which are past due and the balance shall
be immediately paid by Purchaser to Seller, net of any cost of collection
incurred by Purchaser in connection therewith. Purchaser shall make a good
faith effort and attempt to collect any such rents and other amounts and other
income not apportioned at the Closing for the benefit of Seller, however,
Purchaser shall not be required to expend any funds or institute any
litigation in its collection efforts.

 



 

(b) Ad valorem real estate taxes and assessments for the Hotel Parcel for
calendar year 2013 (payable in 2014) shall be prorated to the Closing Date
based upon an estimated total calendar year tax amount equal to the total
actual 2012 (payable in 2013) tax amount. The 2013

taxes (payable in 2014) for the Hotel Parcel shall be reprorated upon issuance
of the final bills therefor (and any necessary adjustment payment be made by
the applicable party). Ad valorem real estate taxes and assessments for the
Hotel Service Area Parcel are paid by the Hotel Service Area Lease Lessor and
Seller is obligated to pay Sellers proportionate share thereof in accordance
with the Hotel Service Area Lease, and the same shall not be prorated
hereunder except as provided in _Section 6.4_ below. Except for the foregoing
prorations and reprorations (including without limitation the prorations and
reprorations described above in this _Section 6.3(b)_) and the prorations and
reprorations described in _Section 6.4_ below, Seller shall not have any
liability or responsibility for any portion of any ad valorem real estate tax
bill related to the Property issued after the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) If the Closing shall occur before the actual amount of utilities and all
other operating expenses with respect to the Property for the month in which
the Closing occurs are determined, the apportionment of such utilities and
other operating expenses shall be upon the basis of an estimate by Seller and
Purchaser of such utilities and other operating expenses for such month.
Subsequent to the Closing, when the actual amount of such utilities and other
operating expenses with respect to the Property for the month in which the
Closing occurs are determined, the parties agree to adjust the proration of
such utilities and other operating expenses and, if necessary, to refund or
repay such sums as shall be necessary to effect such adjustment.

 



 

6.4 **_Hotel Credits and Prorations_**. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, the following items shall be prorated between Seller and Purchaser
as of 12:01 a.m. Chicago time (based on the posting of all revenue and
receipts for the prior day including room revenue for the guests in occupancy)
on the Closing Date (the " ** _Night Audit Cut-Off_** ") with all items of
income received and expense incurred prior to the Closing Date for the
Property being allocated to the Seller and with all items of income received
and expense incurred on or after the Closing Date being allocated to the
Purchaser. Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, a post-closing
"true-up" shall take place (and any necessary adjustment payment be made by
the applicable party) for all such credits and prorations set forth below and
provided under this Agreement.

 



 

(a) **_Hotel Ground Lease_**. All pre-paid rents applicable to the Hotel
Ground Lease shall be prorated as of the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) **_Hotel Service Area Lease_**. All pre-paid rents applicable to the Hotel
Service Area Lease (including, without limitation, any "Tax Adjustment Amount"
(as defined therein)) shall be prorated as of the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) **_Guest Ledger_**. Seller shall receive a credit in an amount equal to:
(i) all amounts charged to the guest ledger for the Property (the " ** _Guest
Ledger_** ") for all room nights up to (but not including) the night during
which the Night Audit Cut-Off occurs, and (ii) one-half (½) of all amounts
charged to the Guest Ledger for the room night which includes the Night Audit
Cut-Off (other than any restaurant, bar or parking charges or any other
charges other than room revenues on the Guest Ledger which shall be prorated
in accordance with _Section 6.3_), and Purchaser shall be entitled to retain
all deposits made and amounts collected with respect to such Guest Ledger.

 



 

(d) **_Prepaid Expenses or Revenues_**. The Seller shall receive a credit at

accounts receivable payable as of the Night Audit Cut-Off, for which Purchaser
shall be obligated to pay to Seller in the form of a credit received at

face value of all accounts receivable that are not more than thirty (30) days
past due and (ii) ninety percent (90%) of the face value of all accounts

agents, representatives and employees (together with Purchaser, collectively,
the " **Purchaser Related Parties** ") to the fullest extent provided by law,

default by Seller of this Agreement including, without limitation, the
representations and warranties of Seller contained in, and as limited under,

of the Closing): (i) obligations or liabilities arising out of acts or
omissions of Seller or any of its affiliates occurring during Sellers
Ownership Period; and (ii) to the extent covered by insurance maintained by
Seller, liabilities arising from any claims by third parties arising out of
events occurring prior to the Closing, provided, however, that Sellers sole
obligation with respect to this clause (ii) shall be to tender a claim with

Related Party any proceeds of such claim to the extent of the applicable
Purchaser Related Partys loss with respect thereto.

 



 

8.1.3 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any of the Purchaser Related Parties
is entitled to defense or indemnification under _Section 8.1.2_ above (an "
**Indemnification Claim** "), Seller shall not be obligated to defend,
indemnify and hold harmless such Purchaser Related Party unless and until such
Purchaser Related Party provides written notice (a " **Claim Notice** ") to
Seller promptly after

such Purchaser Related Party has actual knowledge of any facts or
circumstances on which such Indemnification Claim is based, describing in
reasonable detail such facts and circumstances with respect to such
Indemnification Claim. If any Purchaser Related Party delivers a Claim Notice,
Purchaser shall cause such Purchaser Related Party to diligently pursue, in
good faith, the resolution of the underlying Indemnification Claim in a timely
fashion.

 



 

8.1.4 At Closing, Seller shall fund the amount of Two Million Dollars
($2,000,000) into an escrow account to be held by the Title Company (the " **
_Holdback Escrow_** ") pursuant to a post-closing escrow agreement between
Purchaser, Seller and the Title Company, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser, Seller and the Title Company. Seller hereby
covenants and agrees, after Closing, to maintain a minimum balance in the
Holdback Escrow of not less than the Required Amount (as defined below). As
used herein, the term " **Required Amount** " shall mean, as of any date of
determination (i) during the period from the Closing Date to the date that is
six (6) months after the Closing Date, an amount equal to (x) Two Million
Dollars ($2,000,000), minus (y) the aggregate amount actually paid by Seller
to any Purchaser Related Parties on account of any Seller Indemnity
Obligations on or before such date of determination, (ii) during the period
from the date that is six (6) months after the Closing Date to the date that
is nine (9) months after the Closing Date (the " **Indemnification Termination
Date** "), an amount equal to (x) One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), minus (y)
the aggregate amount actually paid by Seller to any Purchaser Related Parties
on account of any Seller Indemnity Obligations on or before such date of
determination, and (iii) from and after the Indemnification Termination Date,
an amount equal to (x) if no Claim Notice has been delivered by any Purchaser
Related Party to Seller prior to the Indemnification Termination Date, Zero
Dollars ($0), or (y) if a Claim Notice has been delivered by any Purchaser
Related Party to Seller prior to the Indemnification Termination Date, the
lesser of (I) an amount equal to (1) One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), minus
(2) the aggregate amount actually paid by Seller to any Purchaser Related
Parties on account of any Seller Indemnity Obligations on or before such date
of determination, and (II) the amount necessary to pay the Indemnification
Claim giving rise to such Claim Notice in full; provided further, however,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Claim Notice has been delivered by
any Purchaser Related Party to Seller prior to the Indemnification Termination
Date, the Required Amount shall be reduced to Zero Dollars ($0) on the date
(the " **Holdback Requirement End Date** ") that the applicable statute of
limitations with respect to the related Indemnification Claim expires in
accordance with applicable law. If at any time the amount on deposit in the
Holdback Escrow exceeds the Required Amount as of such date, Seller and
Purchaser shall direct Title Company to disburse to Seller funds from the
Holdback Escrow in the amount of such excess.

 



 

8.2 **_Breach by Purchaser_**.

 



 

(a) If this Agreement has not been terminated prior to Closing pursuant to any
right of Seller or Purchaser to so terminate under the provisions hereof, all
conditions precedent to Purchasers obligation to consummate the Closing which
are set forth in this Agreement have been satisfied or waived by Purchaser at
or prior to closing and Purchaser fails to consummate the purchase of the
Property pursuant to this Agreement for any reason (other than Sellers
default), Seller may terminate this Agreement and thereupon shall be entitled
to the Earnest Money as liquidated damages (and not as a penalty), and neither
party shall have any further right or obligation hereunder other than the
Surviving Obligations. Seller and Purchaser have made the provision in this
_Section 8.2(a)_ for liquidated damages because it would be difficult to
calculate, on the date hereof, the amount of actual damages for such breach,
and Seller and Purchaser agree that these sums represent reasonable
compensation to Seller for such breach.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 8.2(a)_ above, the foregoing
shall not in any way limit, affect or impair any of Purchasers indemnities as
provided in _Sections 4.2_ , _4.5_ ,

(ii) Seller will perform all of Sellers material obligations under the
Contracts, Leases and Management Agreement;

 



 

(iii) Seller will not, without the prior written consent of Purchaser (which
Purchaser shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay), modify, enter

(vi) Seller shall not cause Manager to (A) transfer or cancel any Bookings
scheduled to occur on or after the Closing Date, other than in the ordinary
course of business, or (B) accept any Bookings scheduled to occur on or after

(b) **_Leasing of Space_**. From the Effective Date until the Closing or
earlier termination of this Agreement, Seller will not lease any space in the

not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). For avoidance of
doubt, the foregoing limitation upon Seller shall apply with respect to Lease
renewals and Lease extensions with respect to Leases existing as of the
Effective Date (other than any renewals or extensions exercised as of right by
a party other than the Seller under such Lease), but shall not apply with

Effective Date with Purchasers approval (or deemed approval as hereafter
provided) and (ii) any extension, renewal or modification of an existing Lease
entered into after the Effective Date pursuant to rights of the tenant
contained in the Lease or otherwise with Purchasers approval (or deemed
approval as hereafter provided), shall be paid by Purchaser in accordance with
_Section 6.4(b)_ of this Agreement. Said costs and expenses shall include,
but not be limited to, costs incurred and paid by Seller for tenant
improvements, leasing commissions, capital improvements, and reasonable
attorneys fees. If Purchaser does not deliver written notice to Seller of its
approval or disapproval of any matters for which Seller seeks Purchasers
approval as set forth above within five (5) Business Days after Purchasers
receipt of Sellers request for such approval, Purchaser shall be deemed to
have approved such matters and to have agreed to assume all obligations with
respect thereto.

10.2 **_Real Estate Commissions_**. Seller shall pay to Jones Lang LaSalle
Americas (Illinois), L.P. (hereinafter called " ** _Agent_** " whether one or
more) upon the Closing of the transaction contemplated hereby, and not
otherwise, a cash commission in the amount agreed on in a separate listing
agreement between Seller and Agent. Said commission shall in no event be
earned, due or payable unless and until the transaction contemplated hereby is
closed and fully consummated strictly in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and Seller has received the Purchase Price in immediately available
funds; if such transaction is not closed and fully consummated for any reason,
including, without limitation, failure of title or default by Seller or
Purchaser or termination of this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof, then
such commission will be deemed not to have been earned and shall not be due or
payable. Except as set forth above with respect to Agent, neither Seller nor
Purchaser has authorized any broker or finder to act on such partys behalf in
connection with the sale and purchase hereunder and neither Seller nor
Purchaser has dealt with any broker or finder purporting to act on behalf of
any other party. Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller from
and against any and all claims, losses, damages, costs or expenses of any kind
or character arising out of or resulting from any agreement,

arrangement or understanding alleged to have been made by Purchaser or on

Agreement or any interest herein without the prior written consent of Seller,

this Agreement. Except as set forth in _Sections 5.3_ , _10.18_ and _10.19_
hereof, this Agreement is solely for the benefit of Seller and Purchaser;
there are no third party beneficiaries hereof. Any assignment of this

contained herein, each partys obligations under this _Section 10.19_ shall
survive the Closing or any earlier termination of this Agreement.

 



 

10.20 Real Estate Tax Appeal.

 



 

10.20.1 From and after Closing, with respect to the 2011 and 2012 real estate
taxes (payable in 2012 and 2013, respectively), Seller shall be entitled to
control, commence, continue or settle any proceeding to contest the real
estate taxes for such 2011 and 2012 real estate taxes with respect to the
Property or any portion thereof (the " **2011 Tax Contest** " and " **2012 Tax
Contest** ", respectively) and to any refund or abatement of such 2011 or 2012
real estate taxes awarded in any proceedings; provided, however, that Seller
shall not agree to settle the 2011 Tax Contest or the 2012 Tax Contest in a
manner that will (i) increase the assessment of the Property or decrease any
settlement relating to real estate taxes for 2013 (except as provided below)
or for any taxable periods subsequent to 2013 (" **Other Taxable Periods** "),
or (ii) decrease the amount of any reduction or refund that would otherwise be
payable for any Other Taxable Periods, without Purchasers prior written
consent. With respect to the 2013 real estate taxes (payable in 2014), Seller
alone shall continue to have the right to control, commence, continue or
settle any proceeding to contest such 2013 real estate taxes with respect to
the Property or any portion thereof (" **2013 Tax Contest** "); provided,
however, that Seller shall not agree to settle the 2013 Tax Contest in a
manner that will (1) increase the assessment of the Property or decrease any
settlement relating to real estate taxes for any Other Taxable Periods, or (2)
decrease the amount of any reduction or refund that would otherwise be payable
for any Other Taxable Periods, without Purchasers prior written consent. Any
refunds or abatements awarded in the 2013 Tax Contest shall be used first to
reimburse the Seller for the reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Seller
in undertaking the 2013 Tax Contest, and the remainder of such refunds or
abatements shall be prorated between Seller and Purchaser as of the Closing
Date, and the Party receiving such refunds or abatements promptly shall pay
such prorated amount due to the other Party.

 



 

10.20.2 Seller has already filed a 2011 Tax Contest and Seller shall make
reasonable efforts to keep Purchaser apprised of the status of the 2011 Tax
Contest, including the provision of any tax contest results (initial, non-
final or final) or proposed settlements or refunds in a timely manner such
that the Purchaser has a meaningful opportunity to provide input on the 2011
Tax Contest after Closing. Should Seller elect to undertake a 2012 Tax Contest
or a 2013 Tax Contest, Seller shall make reasonable efforts to keep Purchaser
apprised of the status of the 2012 Tax Contest or 2013 Tax Contest, as
applicable, including the provision of any tax contest results (initial, non-
final or final) or proposed settlements or refunds in a timely manner such
that the Purchaser has a meaningful opportunity to provide input on the 2012
Tax Contest and/or 2013 Tax Contest, as applicable, to the Seller.

 



 

10.20.3 Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
the Seller in connection with any such 2011 Tax Contest, 2012 Tax Contest
and/or 2013 Tax Contest, as applicable (at no cost or expense to the Purchaser
other than any de minimis cost or expense or any cost or expense which Seller
agrees in writing to reimburse) and to execute and deliver any documents and
instruments reasonably requested by Seller in furtherance of the contest of
such real estate taxes, so long as such documents and instruments to not
impose any material additional costs, liabilities or obligations on Purchaser
including, without limitation, paying over (or, if applicable, use reasonable
efforts to cause Manager to pay over) to Seller any settlement, refund or
other proceeds thereof received by Purchaser or Manager and/or, if requested
by Seller, endorsing (or, if applicable, use reasonable efforts to cause
Manager to endorse) any check or other instrument evidencing any such
settlement, refund or other proceeds to the extent made payable to Seller,
Manager or the Property to the extent Seller is entitled to same in accordance
with this _Section 10.20_, net of amounts, if any, owed

by Seller to any tenant pursuant to any lease in effect during the applicable
tax year (e.g. 2011 in the case of the 2011 Tax Contest).

 



 

10.20.4 The provisions of this _Section 10.20_ shall survive Closing.

 



 

10.21 **_3-05 Audit_**. Seller acknowledges that, if the Closing occurs,
Purchaser will be required to prepare audited financial statements of the
hotel located at the Property (the " ** _Hotel_** ") for full-year 2012 and
for the first nine months of 2013 in compliance with Rule 3-05 of Regulation
S-X of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the " ** _SEC_** "), which
audit is required to be completed and filed with the SEC within seventy-five
(75) days after the Closing (the " ** _Audit_** "). Seller agrees to use
reasonable good faith efforts to promptly deliver to Purchaser all of the
audit request materials listed on **_Exhibit T_** to the extent in Sellers
possession or control; provided, however, that, to the extent in Sellers
possession or control, Seller shall deliver such materials not later than ten
(10) Business Days prior to the Closing; and provided, further, Seller
acknowledges and agrees to use its good faith efforts to also provide such
additional information which is deemed material and reasonably necessary (as
determined by Auditor (as defined below) in its good faith discretion) to
enable Purchaser and its accountants to conduct the Audit. Upon Purchasers
request after the Effective Date, Seller shall engage (at Purchasers sole
cost and expense) McGladrey LLP or another nationally recognized audit firm
selected by Seller and approved by Purchaser (" ** _Auditor_** ") to commence
and complete the Audit. In order to complete the Audit, the auditor will
require a representation from the owners of the Hotel during the period of the
Audit. Seller acknowledges that the indirect owner of the Hotel during the
period of January 1, 2012 through June 28, 2012, WSRH Chicago Mezz, L.L.C., a
Delaware limited liability company (" ** _Walton_** ") (i.e., the predecessor-
in-interest to the current member of Seller as owner of the direct membership
interests in Seller), has denied Sellers request to provide the
representation that Auditor would require to complete an audit of such period.
On November 14, 2013, Purchaser submitted to the SEC a request to complete
alternative audit procedures (the " ** _SEC Relief Request_** "), a copy of
which is attached hereto as **_Exhibit V_**. If, prior to Closing, Purchaser
receives written notification (the " ** _SEC Denial Notice_** ") from the SEC
denying the SEC Relief Request (a copy of which SEC Denial Notice Purchaser
shall promptly deliver to Seller) or otherwise has not obtained approval from
the SEC as it relates to the SEC Relief Request, and Seller cannot obtain an
agreement from Walton to provide the representation that would be required by
the Auditor in order to complete the Audit, Purchaser may terminate this
Agreement by delivering notice thereof in writing to Seller on or before the
date that is the earlier of (a) three (3) Business Days after Purchaser
receives the SEC Denial Notice, if applicable, or (b) the Closing Date; in
which event, the Earnest Money at that time held by the Title Company,
together with all interest accruing thereon, shall immediately be returned to
Purchaser and neither party shall have any obligations hereunder other than
the Surviving Obligations; provided, however, that in such event, in addition
to Purchasers receipt of the Earnest Money, Seller shall reimburse Purchaser
in an amount equal to one-half (1/2) of all of Purchasers actual reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Purchaser in connection with the
transaction contemplated under this Agreement, including but not limited to,
costs incurred in connection with Purchasers due diligence activities and
Purchaser legal fees (less any amount owed to the Auditor for the Audit, to
the extent such amounts remain unpaid by Purchaser); and provided further,
however, that in no event will Sellers liability with respect to such
reimbursement obligation exceed $150,000 in the aggregate. In connection with
and in furtherance of the foregoing, to the extent required by Auditor to
perform the Audit, Seller covenants and agrees to execute and deliver to
Auditor an audit representation letter for the period of time since the
current holders of direct and indirect ownership interests in Seller have held
such interests (i.e. from June 29, 2012 through September 30, 2013) in the
form attached hereto as **_Exhibit T_** (the " ** _Audit Representation
Letter_** "), as may be modified in a manner reasonably acceptable to Seller
and the Auditor to account for any issues identified during the Audit.

Ladies and Gentlemen: 

 



 

Reference is made to that certain Purchase and Sale Agreement dated November

limited liability company (hereinafter referred to as " _Seller_ ") and **CWI
CHICAGO HOTEL, LLC** , a Delaware limited liability company (hereinafter
referred to as " _Purchaser_ ").

 



 

Purchaser and Seller have agreed to select you to serve as "Escrow Agent" with
respect to the initial earnest money deposit of TWO MILLION AND NO/100 DOLLARS
($2,000,000.00) to be made by Purchaser pursuant to the Agreement (such
deposit and any additional deposit deposited with Escrow Agent pursuant to the
Agreement, together with all accrued interest thereon, being hereinafter

1. Purchaser and Seller hereby engage you to serve as Escrow Agent with respect to the Deposit made by Purchaser pursuant to the Agreement, and Escrow Agent hereby accepts such engagement.

 



 

2. Upon receipt of the Deposit (or any portion thereof) from Purchaser, Escrow Agent shall acknowledge said receipt in writing to Purchaser and Seller and invest the proceeds thereof in the "permitted investments" described below.

 



 

3. For the purposes hereof, " _permitted investments_ " refers to investments in either: (i) U.S. government or government guaranteed securities with a maturity date no greater than thirty (30) days; or (ii) account(s), or certificate(s) of deposit with a maturity of no greater than thirty (30) days, opened with or issued by a bank or other recognized institutional depository whose accounts are insured by the FDIC.

[LETTER DATE]

 



 

McGladrey LLP

 

1 South Wacker Drive

 

Suite 800

 

Chicago, IL 60606

 



 

This representation letter is provided in connection with your audits of the
financial statements of Renaissance Chicago Downtown(the Hotel) which comprise
the statement of revenues and certain direct expenses and the related notes to
the financial statements for the period from June 29, 2012 through December
31, 2012 and January 1, 2013 through September 30, 2013. We confirm that we
are responsible for the fair presentation in the statement of revenues and
certain direct expenses in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP).

 



 

The financial statements were prepared in connection with the acquisition of
the Hotel by Carey Watermark Investors Incorporated (CWI) for the purpose of
complying with the rules and regulations as required by the Securities and
Exchange Commissions (SEC) Rule 3.05 of Regulation S-X as described in Note 2
of the financial statements and are not intended to be a complete presentation
of the Hotels revenues and expenses.

 



 

We confirm, to the best of our knowledge and belief, the following
representations made to you during your audits:

 

Financial Statements

 

We have fulfilled our responsibilities, as set out in the terms of the audit
arrangement letter dated [ARRANGEMENT LETTER DATE], for the preparation and
fair presentation of the financial statements referred to above in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

 

We acknowledge that the Marriott manager has not informed us of any changes in
the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to
the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

 

We acknowledge that the Marriott manager has not informed us of any changes in
the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control to prevent and
detect fraud.

 

Significant assumptions used by us in making accounting estimates, including
those measured at fair value, are reasonable and reflect our judgment based on
our knowledge and experience about past and current events and our assumptions
about conditions we expect to exist and courses of action we expect to take.

 

Related party relationships and transactions have been appropriately accounted
for and disclosed in accordance with the requirements of U.S. GAAP.

 

All events subsequent to the date of the financial statements for which U.S.
GAAP requires adjustment or disclosure have been adjusted or disclosed.

 



 

    
 

 



 

The effects of all known actual or possible litigation and claims have been
accounted for and disclosed in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

 

We are not aware of any uncorrected misstatements in the accounting records
underlying the financial statements.

 

Information Provided

 

We have provided you with:

 

Access to all information, of which we are aware that is relevant to the
preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements such as records,
documentation, and other matters;

 

Additional information that you have requested from us for the purpose of the
audit;

 

Unrestricted access to persons within the Hotel from whom you determined it
necessary to obtain audit evidence.

 

All transactions have been recorded in the accounting records and are
reflected in the financial statements.

 

We have disclosed to you the results of our assessment of risk that the
financial statements may be materially misstated as a result of fraud.

 

We have no knowledge of allegations of fraud or suspected fraud, affecting the
Hotels financial statements involving:

 

Management.

 

Employees who have significant roles in the internal control.

 

Others where the fraud could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

 

We have no knowledge of any allegations of fraud or suspected fraud affecting
the Hotels financial statements received in communications from employees,
former employees, analysts, regulators, short sellers, or others.

 

We have no knowledge of noncompliance or suspected noncompliance with laws and
regulations whose effects should be considered when preparing financial
statements.

 

We are not aware of any pending or threatened litigation and claims whose
effects should be considered when preparing the financial statements and we
have not consulted legal counsel concerning litigation or claims.

 

We have disclosed to you the identity of the Hotels related parties and all
the related-party relationships and transactions of which we are aware.

 

We are aware of no significant deficiencies, including material weaknesses, in
the design or operation of internal controls that could adversely affect the
Hotels ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial data.

 

There have been no communications from regulatory agencies concerning
noncompliance with, or deficiencies in, financial reporting practices.

 

We have complied with all aspects of contractual agreements that would have a
material effect on the financial statements in the event of noncompliance.

 



 

    
 

 



 

During the course of your audit, you may have accumulated records containing
data that should be reflected in our books and records. All such data have
been so reflected. Accordingly, copies of such records in your possession are
no longer needed by us.
