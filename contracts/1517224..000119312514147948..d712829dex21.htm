the Representative) and (ii) provide the Representative and its
representatives reasonable access to the employees and accountants of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation as reasonably requested by the Representative.
If the Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders and Optionholders)
disagrees with any part of the Surviving Corporations calculation of the
Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment, the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing
Cash or the Closing Transaction Expenses as set forth on the Post-Closing
Adjustment Statement, the Representative shall, within forty-five (45) days
after the Representatives receipt of the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement,
notify Parent in writing of such disagreement (an " _Objection Notice_ "). The
Objection Notice shall specify which aspects of the Post-Closing Adjustment
Statement are being disputed and describe the basis for such dispute by
setting forth the Representatives own calculation of the Closing Net Working
Capital Adjustment, the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Cash or the

 



17  Closing Transaction Expenses, as applicable. If the Representative does not
deliver an Objection Notice within such forty-five (45) day period, then the
Post-Closing Adjustment Statement shall be conclusive, final and binding on
all of the parties (in such instance, a " _Final Statement_ "). If an
Objection Notice is delivered to Parent, then Parent and the Representative
(on behalf of the Stockholders and Optionholders) shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve their disagreements with respect to the computation of the
Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash
and/or Closing Transaction Expenses and any such resolution shall be
conclusive and binding on all of the parties (in such instance, a " _Final
Statement_ "). In the event that Parent and the Representative are unable to
resolve all such disagreements within thirty (30) days after Parents receipt
of such Objection Notice, Parent or the Representative may submit such
remaining disagreements to any nationally recognized certified public
accounting firm other than PricewaterhouseCoopers or Ernst and Young as
is reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Representative (the " _Accounting
Firm_ ").

(c) Parent and the Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Accounting Firm to resolve all remaining disagreements with
respect to the computation of the Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment,
Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Closing Transaction Expenses
identified in the Objection Notice as soon as practicable, but in any event
shall direct the Accounting Firm to render a determination within forty-five
(45) days after its retention. The Accounting Firm shall consider only those
items and amounts in the Surviving Corporations and the Representatives
respective calculations of the Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Closing Transaction Expenses that are
identified as being items and amounts to which Parent and the Representative
have been unable to agree. In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Firm
may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such
item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such item
claimed by either party. The Accounting Firms determination of the Closing
Net Working Capital Adjustment, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or
Closing Transaction Expenses, as applicable, shall be based solely on written
materials submitted by Parent and the Representative ( _i.e._ , not on
independent review) and on the definitions set forth in this Agreement. The
determination of the Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon the
parties hereto and shall not be subject to appeal or further review (other
than with respect to errors in arithmetic calculations) (in such instance, a "
_Final Statement_ ").

 

(d) The costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm in determining the Closing
Net Working Capital Adjustment, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and
Closing Transaction Expenses shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation, on
the one hand, and the Representative, on behalf of the Stockholders and the
Optionholders (which amount shall be treated as a Representative Expense and
paid from the Escrow Account as provided in _Section 11.12_), on the other
hand, based upon the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not
awarded to each party bears to the amount actually contested by such party (by
way of illustration only, if Parent claims the Closing Net Working Capital
Adjustment is $5,000 less than the amount determined by the Representative,
and the Representative contests only $4,000 of the amount claimed by Parent,
and if the Accounting Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding Parent
$3,000 of the $4,000 contested, then the costs and expenses of the Accounting
Firm will be allocated 75% ( _i.e._ , 3,000 ÷ 4,000) to the Representative (on
behalf of the Stockholders) and 25% ( _i.e._ , 1,000 ÷ 4,000) to Parent.

 



18 (e) The Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment, Closing Indebtedness, Closing
Cash and Closing Transaction Expenses set forth on any Final Statement as
determined in accordance with this _Section 4.2_ is the " _Final Net Working
Capital Adjustment_ ", " _Final Indebtedness_ ", " _Final Closing Cash_ " and
" _Final Transaction Expenses_ ". For purposes of this Agreement, " _Final
Closing Consideration_ " means, without duplication, (i) two billion four
hundred fifty million dollars ($2,450,000,000),  _less_ (ii) Final
Indebtedness, _plus_ (iii) Final Closing Cash, _less_ (iv) Final Transaction
Expenses, _plus_ (v) the Final Net Working Capital Adjustment, _less_ (vi) the
Escrow Amount,  _less_ (vii) the Representative Expense Amount. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall any amount constituting Indebtedness
Prepayment Expenses be taken into account in the calculation of Final
Indebtedness or Final Transaction Expenses for purposes of calculating the
Final Closing Consideration or any component thereof. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Post-Closing Adjustment Amount_ " means (x) the Final Closing
Consideration _less_ (y) the Closing Consideration (which may be a positive
or negative number). Within five (5) Business Days after the Final Closing
Consideration and the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount are finally determined
pursuant to this _Section 4.2_:

 

(i) If the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is a positive amount, (A) Parent
will promptly pay to, or at the direction of, the Representative, for payment
to the Stockholders and Optionholders holding Options, other than Out-of-the-
Money Options, such positive amount by wire transfer or delivery of other
immediately available funds and (B) Parent and the Representative shall
provide joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release all amounts
remaining in the Escrow Account to, or at the direction of, the
Representative, for payment to the Stockholders and Optionholders holding
Options other than Out-of-the-Money Options, in each case, by wire transfer
or delivery of other immediately available funds.

(ii) If the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is a negative amount, Parent and
the Representative will promptly instruct the Escrow Agent to (A) pay to
Parent an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the absolute value of the Post-
Closing Adjustment Amount and (y) the amount in the Escrow Account, and (B)
release all amounts, if any, remaining in the Escrow Account to, or at the
direction of, the Representative for payment to the Stockholders and
Optionholders holding Options other than Out-of-the-Money Options, in each
case, by wire transfer or delivery of other immediately available funds.

(iii) If the Stockholders and Optionholders holding Options, other than Out-
of-the-Money Options, are entitled to receive any distributions under this
_Section 4.2_, the Representative shall distribute or direct funds (A) to
each Stockholder such Stockholders Per Share Escrow Release Amount and the
Per Share Positive Adjustment Amount for each share of Common Stock held by
such Stockholder immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) to the
Surviving Corporation for payroll processing and distribution at the next
administratively practicable payroll date to each Optionholder holding
Options, other than Out-of-the-Money Options, the Per Share Escrow Release
Amount and the Per Share Positive Adjustment Amount, as applicable, for each
share of Common Stock underlying such Options (other than Out-of-the-Money
Options) held by such Optionholder immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



19 _SECTION 4.3_ _Other Post-Closing Payments_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that, on the one year anniversary of the Closing Date (or
next Business Day thereafter if such date shall not be a Business Day),
Parent shall pay to Stockholders and Optionholders holding Options immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than Out-of-the-Money Options, as
additional Closing Consideration, an aggregate amount of fifty million dollars
($50,000,000) (the " _Post-Closing Consideration_ "). On such date, Parent
shall pay or cause to be paid (A) to each Stockholder such Stockholders Per
Share Post-Closing Consideration for each share of Common Stock held by such
Stockholder immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) to the Surviving
Corporation for payroll processing and distribution at the next
administratively practicable payroll date to each Optionholder holding
Options, other than Out-of-the-Money Options, the Per Share Post-Closing
Consideration, for each share of Common Stock underlying such Options (other
than Out-of-the-Money Options) held by such Optionholder immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Such payment shall be made without setoff, counterclaim
or any deduction whatsoever. The parties acknowledge that the payment referred
to in this Section is intended as an estimate of the value of certain tax
benefits that the Company should realize from payments made by or on
behalf of the Company in connection with the transactions described in this
Agreement, but, for the avoidance of doubt, the amount of such payment is a
sum certain and shall not be adjusted regardless of whether the actual tax
benefits realized by the Company are greater than or less than such estimate.

(b) Promptly following any determination by the Representative that the amount
then remaining of the Representative Expense Amount will no longer be needed
to pay any Representative Expenses, the Representative shall pay to the
Stockholders and the Optionholders such remaining amount (the " _Unused
Representative Expense Amount_ "). On such date, the Representative shall pay
or cause to be paid (A) to each Stockholder such Stockholders Per Share
Unused Representative Expense Amount for each share of Common Stock held by
such Stockholder immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) to the
Surviving Corporation for payroll processing and distribution at the next
administratively practicable payroll date to each Optionholder holding
Options, other than Out-of-the-Money Options, the Per Share Unused
Representative Expense Amount, for each share of Common Stock underlying such
Options (other than Out-of-the-Money Options) held by such Optionholder
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

 _SECTION 4.4_ Any payment to be made pursuant to _Section 4.2(e)_ or
_Section 4.3_ shall be treated by all parties for tax purposes as an
adjustment to the purchase price, unless otherwise required under applicable
Law.

Parent may replace or amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add Financing
Sources which have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date

Agreement). Parent has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all
commitment fees or other fees under the Debt Commitment Letter that are due
and payable on or prior to the date hereof. No event has occurred which, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or
breach on the part of Parent, nor to the knowledge of Parent, any other party
thereto, under the Debt Commitment Letter, and Parent does not believe that it
will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of closing
to be satisfied by it under the Debt Commitment Letter (and for the avoidance
of doubt, Parent possesses the financial statements of Dakota Growers Pasta
Company, Inc. required to be provided to the financing sources under the
Debt Commitment Letter pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter)

and acknowledges that under the terms of this Agreement, Parents
obligation to consummate the acquisition is not in any way contingent upon or
otherwise subject to Parents consummation of any financing arrangements
(including the amendment or other modification of the Credit Agreement or any
other existing financing arrangement), or Parents obtaining any financing or
the availability, grant, provision or extension of any financing to Parent.
Parent has, or can derive from information it will have access to, all
information required to be delivered pursuant to by Sections 2, 7 and 8 of
Annex D of the Debt Commitment Letter (except to the extent that the

Agreement (but in no event later than five (5) Business Days from the
execution of this Agreement), and any filing fees associated therewith shall
be paid by Parent and such initial filings from Parent and the Company
shall request early termination of any applicable waiting period under the

respect of such Antitrust Filings, this Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (v) promptly notify the other party of any material
communication between that party and the FTC, the DOJ, or any other

the other party (and its counsel) to review in advance, and consider in good

39  Body or, in connection with any Proceeding by a private party to any other

hereby, (vii) not participate or agree to participate in any substantive
meeting, telephone call or discussion with the FTC, the DOJ, or any other
Governmental Body in respect of any Antitrust Filing, investigation or

unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Body, gives the other party the opportunity to

subject to applicable Law, furnish the other party promptly with copies of all

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent shall take
any and all steps necessary to (i) resolve, avoid or eliminate impediments or
objections, if any, that may be asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law or (ii) avoid the entry of,
effect the dissolution of, and have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned,
any decree, order or judgment that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, so as to enable the
parties hereto to close the transactions contemplated hereby expeditiously.
Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall propose, negotiate, commit to and
effect, by consent decree, hold separate orders or otherwise, the sale,
divesture, disposition, or license, or otherwise take or commit to take
actions that after the Closing Date would limit Parents freedom of action
with respect to, or its or their ability to retain, one or more of
the assets, properties, businesses, product lines, or services of Parent, the
Company, and Parents Subsidiaries or any interest or interests therein. In
addition, Parent shall defend through litigation on the merits any claim
asserted in court by any Governmental Body in order to avoid entry of, or to
have vacated, lifted, reversed, overturned or terminated, any decree, order or
judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would restrain,
prevent, or delay the Closing prior to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including by pursuing all available avenues of
administrative and judicial appeal and all available legislative action.

 

 _SECTION 7.5_ _Further Assurances_. Each of Parent and the Company shall use
(and the Company shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use) commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) take all actions necessary or appropriate to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) cause the
fulfillment at the earliest practicable date of all of the conditions to
their respective obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Closing to occur.

 



40 _SECTION 7.6_ _Confidentiality_. Parent acknowledges that the information
provided to it in connection with this Agreement and the other agreements
contemplated hereby and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby is
subject to the terms of Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of which are
incorporated herein by reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing,
the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate.

_SECTION 7.7_ _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who
at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an "
_Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all
claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs
(including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses (including
fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any claim, suit,
action, proceeding or investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative), whenever asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or
in part, (A) the fact that an Indemnitee was a director or officer of the
Company or such Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions by an Indemnitee in the
Indemnitees capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company
or such Subsidiary or taken at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary
(including in connection with serving at the request of the Company or such
Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of
another Person (including any employee benefit plan)), in each case under (A)
or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time (including any claim,
suit, action, proceeding or investigation relating in whole or in part to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, and (ii) assume all obligations of the
Company and such Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of indemnification
and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time as provided in (x) the Companys certificate of
incorporation and by-laws and the organizational documents of such
Subsidiaries as currently in effect and (y) the indemnification agreements
listed on _Section 7.7_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, which agreements
shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
respective terms. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, from and after the
Effective Time, shall cause the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of
the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable to the
Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and
officers and indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this
Agreement in the Companys certificate of incorporation and by-laws, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees. In
addition, from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Company and the Surviving Corporation to, pay any expenses (including fees and
expenses of legal counsel) of any Indemnitee under this _Section 7.7_
(including in connection with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations
referred to in this _Section 7.7_) as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, provided that the person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances to the extent required
by applicable Law.

 



41 (b) An Indemnitee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assume and
control the defense of any litigation, claim or proceeding relating to any
acts or omissions covered under this _Section 7.7_ (each, a " _Claim_ ") with
counsel selected by the Indemnitee, which counsel shall be reasonably
acceptable to Parent;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall be
permitted to participate in the defense of such Claim at its own expense. Each
of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnitees shall
cooperate in the defense of any Claim and shall provide access to properties
and individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be furnished
records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith.

(c) For the six (6)-year period commencing at the Effective Time, Parent shall
maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability
insurance covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time with respect to those persons who are currently (and any additional
persons who prior to the Effective Time become) covered by the Companys
directors and officers liability insurance policy on terms and scope with
respect to such coverage, and in amount, not less favorable to such
individuals than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof (or Parent
may substitute therefore policies, issued by reputable insurers, of at least
the same coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective
Time). In no event will Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend for each covered year an amount in excess of 300% of the current annual
premium for such insurance (the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If such insurance
coverage is terminated, cancelled, cannot be obtained at all, or can only be
obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, the Surviving
Corporation will maintain such insurance as can be obtained for the remainder
of the six-year period for a premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 7.7_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such Person may have by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 7.7_ shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee
to whom this _Section 7.7_ applies unless (x) such termination or
modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee
shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being
expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this _Section 7.7_ applies
shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.7_).

(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation or the transferee of such
properties and assets shall expressly assume and be responsible for all of
the obligations thereof set forth in this _Section 7.7_.

_SECTION 7.8_ _Publicity_. Neither the Company nor Parent, nor any of their
respective Affiliates, shall issue any press release or public announcement
concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without
obtaining the prior written approval of the other party hereto, which
approval will not be unreasonably withheld, unless, in the judgment of the
Company or Parent, as applicable, public disclosure is otherwise required by
applicable Law 

 



42  or by the applicable rules of any stock exchange on which Parent lists
securities, provided that, to the extent required by applicable Law or the
applicable rules of any such exchange, the party intending to make such
disclosure shall use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with
applicable Law to consult with the other party with respect to the text
thereof. The Company and Parent agree that the initial press release to be
issued in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall be in a
form mutually agreed.

_SECTION 7.9_ _Employment and Employee Benefits_.

(a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
provide employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Company
Employees_ ") (i) for the period of twelve months immediately following the
Closing Date, (x) the same level of base salary and hourly wages as in effect
on the Closing Date, (y) employee benefit and incentive plans, programs,
contracts and arrangements that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than
similar employee benefit plans, programs, contracts and arrangements
(excluding stock-based compensation and all change of control bonuses and/or
severance payments payable solely as a result of the Merger and not as a
result of any events occurring post-Closing) provided by the Company and its
affiliates to Company Employees prior to the Closing Date, and (z)
continued coverage under the Companys severance plans or policies on the
same terms and conditions of such plans or policies immediately prior to the
Closing Date; and (ii) for the period immediately following the Closing Date
until December 31, 2014 (it being acknowledged that payments related to the
Companys 2013 fiscal year incentive plans are payable on or before March 15,
2014), the same level of cash incentive bonus opportunity as in effect on the
Closing Date. From and after the Closing Date, Parent or one of its
affiliates shall honor, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, in
accordance with their terms, all employment, retention and severance
agreements and all severance, incentive and bonus plans, programs and
arrangements (excluding with respect to stock-based compensation) as in effect
on the Closing Date that are applicable to any current or former employees or
directors of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, or any other
provision of this Agreement, nothing in this _Section 7.9(a)_ is intended to
preclude Parent from causing Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
to terminate the employment of any employee of the Company or
its Subsidiaries. Parent or one of its affiliates shall recognize the service
of the Company Employees with the Company and its affiliates prior to the
Closing Date as service with Parent and its affiliates in connection with any
pension or welfare benefit plans and policies (including vacations, paid
time-off, and holiday policies) maintained by Parent or one of its affiliates
which is made available following the Closing Date by Parent or one of its
affiliates for purposes of any waiting period, vesting, eligibility and
benefit entitlement (but excluding benefit accrual). Parent shall (i) waive,
or cause its insurance carriers to waive, all limitations as to pre-existing
and at-work conditions, if any, with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to Company Employees under any welfare benefit plan
(as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) which is made available to Company
Employees following the Closing Date by Parent or one of its affiliates, and
(ii) provide credit to Company Employees for any co-payments, deductibles and
out-of-pocket expenses paid by such employees under the employee benefit
plans, programs and arrangements of the Company and its Subsidiaries
during the portion of the relevant plan year including the Closing Date. The
parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this _Section
7.9(a)_ are included for the sole benefit of the parties hereto, and that
nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied,

 



43  shall create any third party beneficiary or other rights (x) in any other
Person, including any employees or former employees of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, any participant in any Company Benefit Plan, or any
dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (y) to continued employment with the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates.

 

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to (i)
credit each of the Company Employees with an amount of paid vacation and sick
leave days following the Closing Date equal to the amount of vacation time and
sick leave days each such Company Employee has accrued but not yet used or
cashed out as of the Closing Date under the Companys vacation and sick leave
policies as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, _provided_ that
such amounts are accrued for purposes of Closing Net Working Capital, and (ii)
allow each of the Company Employees to use such accrued vacation and
sick leave days at such times as each would have been allowed under the
Companys vacation and sick leave policies as in effect immediately prior to
the Closing Date.

 

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company will (i) if applicable, use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, from each "disqualified
individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) (a " _Disqualified
Individual_ ") who is entitled to receive any payment or benefit to be paid in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are
reasonably likely to, separately or in the aggregate, without regard to the
measures described herein, constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning
of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code and applicable rulings and final
regulations thereunder (" _Section 280G Payments_ ") a waiver by such
individual of all such Section 280G Payments in excess of 2.99 times the
Disqualified Individuals "base amount" (calculated in accordance with
Section 280G of the Code) and (ii) submit to a stockholder vote (in compliance
with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations thereunder) the
right of any Disqualified Individual to receive Section 280G Payments. The
Company shall prepare, and cause to be mailed promptly after the date hereof,
to the Stockholders, a disclosure document including relevant information with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(the " _Company Disclosure Document_ "), intended to satisfy the requirements
of the Code. The Company shall deliver a draft of the Company Disclosure
Document to Parent as promptly as practicable after the date hereof (but shall
not be required to deliver such draft prior to the delivery by Parent to the
Company of the Parent 280G Statement (as defined below) and, promptly
following such delivery, Parent shall provide the Company its comments, if
any, regarding the Company Disclosure Document, including those portions
relating to Section 280G Payments, and the Company shall take into
consideration the reasonable comments of Parent. Promptly after the date
hereof, Parent shall disclose to the Company in writing for inclusion in the
Company Disclosure Document any potential Section 280G Payments that may
result from payments or other benefits to be provided under any agreements or
arrangements established or entered into by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation with or for the benefit of any Disqualified Individual
other than agreements previously entered into between any Disqualified
Individual and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or confirm in writing
that there are no such agreements or arrangements (such disclosure or
confirmation, as applicable, the " _Parent 280G Statement_ "), it being
understood that the Company Disclosure Document shall be prepared, and any
vote taken pursuant to this _Section 7.9_ shall be taken, in reliance on the
accuracy of the Parent 280G Statement.

 



44 _SECTION 7.10_ _Supplementation and Amendment of Schedules_. From time to time
after the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company may supplement or
amend the Company Disclosure Schedules which were delivered pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to any matter first existing or occurring after the
date hereof which, if existing or occurring at or prior to the date hereof,
would have been required to be set forth or described in such Company
Disclosure Schedules or which is necessary to correct any information in such
Company Disclosure Schedules which has been rendered inaccurate thereby. No
such supplement or amendment shall have any effect on the determination as to
whether the conditions to closing set forth in _Section 8.1(a)_ or _Section
8.1(b)_ have been satisfied. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver
to Parent any change to the information set forth in the first sentence to
Section 5.4(a) as of the Closing Date.

 

 _SECTION 7.11_ _No Shop_. From the date hereof until the Closing Date, the
Company will not and will not permit its Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, representatives or agents to

negotiate, undertake, authorize, recommend, propose or enter into
any transaction involving a merger, consolidation, business combination,
purchase or disposition of any material assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than in the Ordinary Course of Business) or any capital
stock or other equity interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (an
" _Acquisition Transaction_ "), (ii) facilitate, encourage, solicit or
initiate discussions, negotiations or submissions of proposals or offers in
respect of an Acquisition Transaction, (iii) furnish or cause to be
furnished, to any Person, any information concerning the business, operations,
properties or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with an
Acquisition Transaction, or (iv) otherwise cooperate in any way with, or
assist or participate in, facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt by
any other Person to do or seek any of the foregoing. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall (and shall cause their respective representatives to)
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or
negotiations with any Persons (other than Parent and Merger Sub) conducted
heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing.

 

 _SECTION 7.12_ _Notice of Current Events_. The Company shall keep Parent
informed, on a current basis, of any events, discussions, notices or changes
with respect to any Tax, criminal or regulatory investigation or action
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than in each case
ordinary course events, discussions, notices and changes which are not
material to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and shall reasonably
cooperate with Parent and its Affiliates in an effort to avoid or mitigate any
cost or regulatory consequences to them that might arise from such
investigation or action (including by reviewing written submissions in
advance, attending meetings with authorities and coordinating and providing
assistance in meetings with regulators). Parent agrees to notify the Company
and Representative in writing promptly upon Parents, Merger Subs, any of
their respective Affiliates or any of their respective representatives
discovery of any information on or prior to the Effective Time which
constitutes (or would be reasonably likely to constitute) or indicates (or
would be reasonably likely to indicate) a material breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant of the Parent or Merger Sub contained
herein. The Company agrees to notify the Parent in writing promptly upon the
Companys or any of its Subsidiaries discovery of any information on or
prior to the Effective Time which constitutes (or would be reasonably likely
to constitute) or indicates (or would be reasonably likely to indicate) a
material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of the Company
contained herein.

 



45 _SECTION 7.13_ _Interim Financial Statements and Inventory_. Within
fifteen (15) days after the end of each fiscal month, the Company shall
deliver to Parent and Merger Sub an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of
the Michael Foods Group, Inc. and its Subsidiaries as of the end of the most
recently completed fiscal month and unaudited consolidated statements of
earnings and comprehensive income of Michael Foods Group, Inc. and its
Subsidiaries for the most recently completed fiscal month and for the period
from December 28, 2013 to the end of the most recently completed fiscal
month. Prior to Closing, the Company shall assist Parent as Parent may
reasonably request so that promptly following the Closing, Parent may perform
cycle counts of the finished goods inventory of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries and cycle counts or other inventory procedures of the raw
materials inventory of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries.

 

 _SECTION 7.14_ _Financing_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange and obtain the Debt Financing at Closing on the terms and conditions,
when taken as a whole (including the "flex" provisions"), as described in the
Debt Commitment Letter and to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, or proper or
advisable in Parents good faith judgment in connection therewith, including
using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment
Letter in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof
until the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or this
Agreement is terminated, (ii) satisfy in all material respects all conditions
and covenants applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in the Debt Commitment
Letter and otherwise comply in all material respects with their respective
obligations thereunder, (iii) enter into definitive agreements with respect
thereto on the terms and conditions consistent in all material respects with
the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter, (iv) consummate the
Debt Financing at or prior to Closing and (v) subject to the last sentence of
this _Section 7.14(a)_, enforce their rights under the Debt Commitment
Letter. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger
Sub shall give the Company prompt notice: (A) of any material breach or
default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any material
breach or default) by any party to any Debt Commitment Letter or definitive
document related to the Debt Financing of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes
aware; (B) of the receipt of any written notice or other written
communication from any party to the Debt Commitment Letter with respect to
any actual or potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any
party to any Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the
Debt Financing; and (C) if for any reason Parent or Merger Sub believes in
good faith that it is reasonably likely that they will not be able to obtain
all or any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms, in the manner or from
the sources contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive
documents related to the Debt Financing. Unless this Agreement has terminated,
Parent and Merger Sub shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Company, enter into any amendment or modification to, replacement of, or
grant any waiver of any provision or remedy under, or exercise its right to
terminate any commitment under, the Debt Commitment Letter,

 



46  if such amendment, modification, replacement, waiver or termination would or
would reasonably be expected to impose new or additional conditions or
otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the
Debt Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (x) adversely
affect the ability or likelihood of Parent or Merger Sub to timely consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (y) make the timely
funding of the Debt Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining
the Debt Financing less likely to occur. As soon as reasonably practicable,
but in any event within three (3) Business Days after the date the Company
delivers to Parent or Merger Sub a written request, Parent and Merger Sub
shall provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to
any circumstance referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C) of the
immediately preceding sentence. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions)
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing from alternative
sources (the " _Alternative Financing_ ") on terms not materially less
favorable when taken as a whole, together with other sources of funds
available to Parent, sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event. In the event that Alternative Financing is arranged in accordance with
this _Section 7.14(a)_, the term " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " shall mean the
commitment letter and term sheet for such Alternative Financing (as amended,
replaced, supplemented or modified in accordance with this Section). In the
event that Alternative Financing shall be obtained pursuant to this _Section
7.14(a)_, the parties shall comply with the covenants in this _Section
7.14(a)_ with respect to such Alternative Financing mutatis mutandis. Parent
shall furnish correct and complete copies of all definitive agreements
relating to the Alternative Financing to the Company promptly upon their
execution (redacted in a customary manner). Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in
reasonable detail of all material activity concerning the status of its
efforts to obtain and consummate the Alternative Financing. In the event that
the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1_ and the conditions to the funding
of the Debt Commitment Letter have been satisfied or, upon funding would be
satisfied, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Financing
Sources to fund the full amount of the Debt Financing at or prior to the
Closing and, for the avoidance of doubt, (A) in the event that on the final
day of the Marketing Period (x) any portion of the Debt Financing to be issued
as contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter pursuant to a Rule 144A
transaction has not been issued or sold, and (y) all conditions precedent to
Parents obligations hereunder shall have been satisfied or waived (other than
those conditions which by their nature will not be satisfied until the
Closing), Parent shall draw upon the commitments of the Financing Sources
under the Debt Commitment Letter to provide the bridge financing contemplated
by and on the terms and conditions (including any applicable "flex"
provisions) set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and (B) Parent shall
comply with any "securities demand" or similar provisions included in the Debt
Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter. Parent shall provide the Company, on May
1, 2014, a reasonably detailed schedule of all Required Financial Information
not yet received as of such date. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall require or cause Parent or Merger Sub to
bring any action, suit or claim against any Financing Source.

 



47 (b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
accountants, consultants, legal counsel, officers and employees to use their
reasonable best efforts to, provide to Parent and the Merger Sub (at Parents
sole expense), all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection
with the arrangement of the financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter
(together with the offering or private placement of debt securities under Rule
144A of the Securities Act contemplated thereby and the engagement letters
referred to therein (the " _Debt Financing_ ")), including the equity
financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, including using
reasonable best efforts to (i) cause, upon reasonable advance notice by
Parent and on a reasonable number of occasions, appropriate officers and
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries to participate in meetings,
presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and
sessions with rating agencies and to assist with the preparation of materials
for rating agency presentations, offering documents, roadshow presentations,
private placement memoranda, offering memoranda, bank information memoranda,
prospectuses and similar documents required in connection with the Debt
Financing or any equity financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
and otherwise assist in the marketing efforts related to the Debt Financing or
any equity financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) provide
its accountants with appropriate representations in connection with the
preparation of, and furnish Parent and Merger Sub and their Financing Sources
as promptly as practical with, financial and other pertinent information
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by
Parent and that is customary to be included in an offering document relating
to an underwritten offering of high-yield debt securities under Rule 144A of
the Securities Act (including the Required Financial Information) but
excluding the information required by Rules 3-10 and 3-16 of Regulation S-X
and compensation discussion and analysis, (iii) before the Closing Date,
provide appropriate representations in connection with the preparation of
financial statements and other financial data of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and obtain accountants consents in connection with the use of
the Companys financial statements in offering documents, prospectuses and
similar documents which are filed with the SEC, (iv) obtain customary
accountants comfort letters (including "negative assurance" comfort on any
pro forma or other financial data referenced above), legal opinions, surveys
and title insurance as reasonably requested by Parent; (v) execute and deliver
and cause its Subsidiaries to execute and deliver, effective as of the
Effective Time and on the Closing Date, one or more credit or other
agreements on terms satisfactory to Parent in connection with the Debt
Financing as well as any guaranty, pledge and security documents, currency or
interest hedging arrangements, other definitive financing documents, or other
certificates or documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent (including
a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company or any Subsidiary
with respect to solvency matters) and otherwise reasonably facilitate the
pledging of collateral and take all necessary corporate or other entity
actions to facilitate all of the foregoing (it being understood that the
Company shall not be required to execute any Contracts prior to the Closing
Date), (vi) at least five days prior to the Closing Date, provide all
documentation and other information about the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries as is reasonably requested in writing by Parent with respect to
applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations including without limitation the USA PATRIOT Act; (vii) arrange
for the repayment on the Closing Date of all of the Companys existing secured
bank and unsecured notes facilities from the proceeds of the Debt Financing
contemplated hereby, including by providing the lenders and holders of notes
thereunder with such notices of the transactions contemplated hereby and the
closing thereof as may be required under such facilities (subject to the
occurrence of the Closing), by obtaining customary pay-off letters, lien
terminations, title transfers, and instruments of discharge or transfer
relating to any collateral to be delivered at the

 



48  Closing Date and by taking such other actions as may be required by _Section
7.15_ hereof; (viii) obtain any authorization or consent from the Company or
any of its representatives reasonably necessary or required in connection
with the financing, including (A) customary authorization letters to the
lenders and agents in respect of any bank financing authorizing the
distribution of information to prospective lenders and containing a
representation to such Financing Sources that the public side versions of such
documents, if any, do not include material non-public information about the
Company or any of its Affiliates and (B) consent from the Companys
independent auditors to the inclusion of their report or the financial
statements in any offering document or registration statement or prospectus,
and (ix) assist Parent in obtaining any corporate credit and family ratings
from any ratings agencies contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter. The
Company hereby consents to the use of the Companys logos in connection with
the Debt Financing or any equity financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter in a form and manner mutually agreed with the Company; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended,
or reasonably likely, to harm or disparage the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. In connection with any offering document, prospectus or similar
documents prepared by Parent and used to market any debt or equity securities
contemplated pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter prior to Closing, the
Company will, upon request of Parent, use its reasonable best efforts to
periodically update any Required Financial Information included in such
offering document, prospectus or similar document so that Parent may ensure
that such Required Financial Information, when taken as a whole, does not
contain as of the time provided, giving effect to any supplements, any untrue
statement of material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements contained therein not materially misleading. The
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, keep confidential the
terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter and the Debt Financing and
any equity financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter. The Company
shall not be required, under the provisions of this _Section 7.14(b)_ or
otherwise in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter (x) to pay any
commitment or other similar fee prior to the Effective Time or (y) to incur
any expense unless such expense is reimbursed by Parent or Merger Sub on the
earlier of the Effective Time or termination of this Agreement in accordance
herewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no obligation of the Company under
any certificate, document or instrument delivered in connection with the Debt
Financing shall be effective until the Effective Time and the Company shall
not be required to take any action under any such certificate, document or
instrument that is not contingent upon the Closing. Parent shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Company and its Affiliates and their respective officers,
directors, employees, investment bankers, attorney, accountants, consultants
and other authorized agents, advisors or representatives from and against any
and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest,
awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection
with the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (other than to
the extent such losses arise from the gross negligence or willful breach of
the Company). Whether or not the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall, promptly
upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable
documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Company in connection with
this _Section 7.14(b)_, including reasonable legal fees, reasonable
accounting fees and other reasonable fees and expenses. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the Company shall in good faith reasonably believe that it has
delivered the Required Financial Information, it may deliver to Parent a
written notice to that effect, in which case the Required
Financing Information shall be deemed to have been delivered on the date such
notice is received by Parent, and the Marketing Period shall be deemed

 



49  to have commenced on the date such notice is received by Parent, in each
case, unless Parent in good faith reasonably believes that the Company has not
completed delivery of the Required Financial Information and, within three
(3) Business Days after the receipt of such notice from the Company, Parent
delivers a written notice to the Company to that effect (stating with
reasonable specificity the Required Financing Information that has not been
delivered).

_SECTION 7.15_ _Redemption of Notes_.

 

(a) With respect to the Notes, the Company shall cause the respective issuers
of such Notes to (i) issue conditional notices of redemption of such Notes in
accordance with the respective Indentures governing such Notes and in a form
reasonably acceptable to the Company and the Parent, at least 30 days but not
more than 60 days before June 2, 2014 (or such later redemption date agreed
with Parent) for all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of such
Notes pursuant to the requisite provisions of such Indenture (including
Article 3 thereof) or other governing documents; _provided_ , that if the
Company reasonably determines that the Closing will not occur on such
redemption date, the Company shall cause the respective issuers of such Notes
to rescind such notices of redemption and issue new conditional notices of
redemption of such Notes, in substantially the same form as the initial
notices, at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the first Business
Day of the subsequent calendar month, which procedure shall be repeated as
necessary until the Closing has occurred or this Agreement has been
terminated, (ii) take such other actions that are reasonably necessary or
customary to facilitate the redemption of all such Notes pursuant to the
applicable sections of each such Indenture and (iii) redeem such Notes
in accordance with the terms of such Indentures and governing documents at
the Closing; _provided_ , that the Companys counsel shall provide such legal
opinions as may be reasonably requested by Parent that are customary or
necessary in connection with any such redemption.

(b) At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall fund or cause to be funded to, or
as directed by, the Company an amount sufficient to satisfy in full all
amounts due in connection with the redemption of the Notes pursuant to Section
7.15(a) in full (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any redemption or
"make whole" premium payable in respect of such redemption).

its reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent a copy of a payoff letter, in
customary form, from the Administrative Agent (as defined in the Credit
Agreement) under the Credit Agreement (the " _Credit Agreement Payoff Letter_
"), which Credit Agreement Payoff Letter shall (i) state the total amount
required to be paid to fully satisfy all principal, interest, prepayment
premiums, penalties, breakage costs or similar obligations and all fees, costs
and expenses under the Credit Agreement and the Loan Documents (as defined in
the Credit Agreement) as of the anticipated Closing Date (and the daily
accrual thereafter) (the " _Credit Agreement Payoff Amount_ ") together with
appropriate wire instructions, (ii) state that upon

 



50  receipt of the Credit Agreement Payoff Amount, the Credit Agreement and all
related Loan Documents shall be irrevocably terminated, and (iii) state that
all Liens and all guarantees in connection therewith relating to the assets
and properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries securing any Credit
Agreement Payoff Amount shall be, upon the payment of the Credit Agreement
Payoff Amount on the Closing Date, released and terminated.

_SECTION 7.18_ _Regulation S-X_. Between the date hereof and the Closing Date,
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries will enter into any binding
agreement to acquire a business (other than the Company) that is significant
for purposes of Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X, unless otherwise permitted by the
Lead Arrangers (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter).

_SECTION 7.19_ _Preservation of Books and Records_. For a period of seven (7)
years after the Closing Date or such longer time as may be required by Law:

(a) Parent shall not and shall cause its Affiliates not to dispose of or
destroy any of the material books and records of the Company relating to
periods prior to the Closing (the " _Books and Records_ ") without first
offering to turn over possession thereof to the Representative by written
notice to the Representative at least thirty (30) days prior to the proposed
date of such disposition or destruction.

(b) Parent shall and shall cause its Affiliates to allow any of the
Stockholders and their agents access to all Books and Records on reasonable
notice and at reasonable times at Parents principal place of business or at
any location where any Books and Records are stored, and any of
the Stockholders shall have the right, at their own expense, to make copies
of any Books and Records; provided, that (i) and such Stockholder shall have a
legitimate regulatory need for any such access or copying and (ii) any such
access or copying shall be had or done in such a manner so as not to unduly
interfere with the normal conduct of Parents business.

(c) Any Stockholder that accesses or copies Books and Records pursuant to
this Section shall keep such information confidential and shall not disclose
such information to any other third party.

 

 _SECTION 7.20_ _Management Agreement and Other Certain Affiliate Agreements_.
Prior to the Closing, the Company shall take all action required to terminate
the Management Agreement, the Stockholders Agreement and all side letters
thereto, the Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of June 29, 2010, by and

CLOSING AND TERMINATION

 

 _SECTION 10.1_ _Closing Date_. Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in _Sections 8.1_ and _8.2_  hereof (or the waiver thereof by the
party entitled to waive that condition), the closing of the transactions
contemplated hereby (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of
Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and Jacobson LLP, One New York Plaza, New York,
NY 10004 (or at such other place as Parent and the Company may designate in
writing) (a) at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern time) on the date that is the first
Business Day of the calendar month immediately following the calendar month
in which the satisfaction or waiver of each condition to the Closing set forth
in _Article VIII_ shall have occurred (other than conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions). Notwithstanding the immediately preceding
sentence, if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Sections 8.1_ and
_8.2 _ (other than those conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied
until the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those
conditions), then the Closing shall occur instead on the first Business Day of
the calendar month that falls on or after the final day of the Marketing
Period. The date on which the Closing shall occur is referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ". All deliveries and payments required to
be made at the Closing shall be deemed to have been made simultaneously as of
the Effective Time, and no such deliveries or payments shall be deemed
completed and no document, instrument or certificate shall be deemed to have
been delivered until all such deliveries and payments are made and all
documents delivered. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in _Sections 8.1_ and _8.2_ hereof (or the waiver
thereof by the party entitled to waive that condition), (A) if the Marketing
Period ends on or prior to June 2, 2014, the Closing shall occur on June 2,
2014; (B) if the Marketing Period ends after June 2, 2014 but on or prior to
July 1, 2014, the Closing shall occur on July 1, 2014; and (C) if the
Marketing Period ends after July 1, 2014 but on or prior to August 1, 2014,
the Closing shall occur on August 1, 2014.

 

 _SECTION 10.2_ _Termination of Agreement_. This Agreement may be terminated
and the Merger may be abandoned any time prior to the Effective Time as
follows:

(a) by the Company or Parent on or after August 1, 2014, if the Effective Time
shall not have then occurred by the close of business on such date;
_provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 10.2(a)_ shall not be available to the Company or Parent, as
applicable, if the principal reason the Merger shall not have been
consummated by such time is the breach by such party of its obligations under
this Agreement;

(b) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

 



54 (c) by the Company or Parent if there shall be in effect a final nonappealable
Order of a Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction restraining, enjoining
or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, it being agreed that the parties hereto shall promptly appeal any
adverse determination which is not nonappealable (and pursue such appeal with
reasonable diligence); provided the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this _Section 10.2(c)_ shall not be available to the Company or Parent, as
applicable, if the issuance of such final nonappealable Order was primarily
due to the breach by such party of its obligations under this Agreement;

(d) by Parent if (i) Parent is not then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, and (ii) any of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1(a)_ or
_Section 8.1(b)_ is incapable of fulfillment, or if the breach giving rise
to the failure of any such conditions to be satisfied is incurable; and

(e) by the Company if (i) the Company is not then in material breach of any
of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, and (ii) any of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.2(a)_ or 
_Section 8.2(b)_ is incapable of fulfillment, or if the breach giving rise to
the failure of any such conditions to be satisfied is incurable.

 

 _SECTION 10.3_ _Procedure Upon Termination_. In the event of termination of
this Agreement by Parent or the Company, or both, pursuant to _Section 10.2_
hereof, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party,
and this Agreement shall terminate, and the Merger contemplated hereby shall
be abandoned, without further action by Parent or the Company.

_SECTION 10.4_ _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is validly
terminated pursuant to _Section 10.2_, this Agreement shall become void and
of no effect with no liability on the part of any party (or any stockholder,
director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative of such
party) to the other party hereto; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such
termination shall relieve Parent of any liability of Parent under _Section
7.14_ of this Agreement for reimbursement of expenses; _provided_ , _further_
, subject to the terms of this Agreement, if such termination shall result
from the (i) failure of either party to fulfill a condition to the performance
of the obligations of the other party or (ii) failure of either party to
perform an agreement or covenant contained herein, such party shall not be
relieved of any liability to the other party as a result of such failure or
breach; _provided_ _further_ , that the provisions of _Section 7.8_, this
_Section 10.4_, _Article XI_ and _Article I_  hereof and the provisions of
the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any such termination.

respective fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the

55  accounting, financial advisor and other professional fees); _provided_ that
any such fees, costs and expenses incurred or payable by the Company or any of
the Companys Subsidiaries to the extent unpaid as of the Closing Date and
not taken into account in calculating the Closing Net Working Capital shall be
treated as Transaction Expenses and all Indebtedness Prepayment Expenses shall
be paid by Parent. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall pay and be
solely responsible for all filing fees payable under the HSR Act and any other
Antitrust Laws applicable to the Merger.

_Section 11.14_ (and any other provision of this Agreement to the extent an
amendment, supplement, waiver or other modification of such provision would
modify the substance of such Sections) and the definition of "Material
Adverse Effect" may not be amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified
without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources. No action taken
pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of
any party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such
action of compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision
of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a further or
continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent
breach. No failure on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay in
exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such right, power or
remedy by such party preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

(b) Any litigation against any party to this Agreement arising out of or in
any way relating to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware (unless the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, in
which case, in any state or federal court within the State of Delaware)
(together with the appellate courts thereof, the " _Chosen Courts_ ") and each
of the parties hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Chosen Courts for the purpose of any such litigation. Each party irrevocably
and unconditionally agrees not to assert (a) any objection which it may ever
have to the laying of venue of any such litigation in any Chosen Court, (b)
any claim that any such litigation brought in any Chosen Court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum and (c) any claim that any Chosen Court
does not have jurisdiction with respect to such litigation. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not, and it will
cause its Affiliates not to, bring or support any action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, in any way
relating to the Financing Sources, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt
Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum other than any state or
Federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan within the State of New
York. To the extent that service of process by mail is permitted by
applicable Law, each party irrevocably consents to the service of process in
any such litigation in such courts by the mailing of such process by
registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, at its address for notices
provided for herein.

_SECTION 11.7_ _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any law or
public policy, all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby
are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 



58 _SECTION 11.8_ _Binding Effect; Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. Except as contemplated by
_Section 3.3_ (with respect to (i) the Stockholders right to receive the Per
Share Closing Consideration, and (ii) the right of the Optionholders holding
Options other than Out-of-the-Money Options to receive the Closing Option
Cancellation Amount), _Section 4.2_ (with respect to the right of the
Stockholders and the Optionholders holding Options other than Out-of-the-
Money Options to receive the Per Share Escrow Release Amount and the Per Share
Positive Adjustment Amount), _Section 4.3_ (with respect to the right of the
Stockholders and the Optionholders holding Options other than Out-of-the-
Money Options to receive the Per Share Post-Closing Consideration and the Per
Share Unused Representative Expense Amount), _Section 7.6_, _Section 7.8_, 
_Section 11.5_, and _Section 11.10_ (each of which provisions is intended to
be for the benefit of the Persons referred to therein and may be enforced by
any such Person), and except that the Financing Sources shall be third party
beneficiaries of clause (ii) of _Section 11.4_, _Section 11.5_, this
sentence of this _Section 11.8_, _Section 11.10_ and _Section 11.14_,
nothing in this Agreement shall create or be deemed to create any third party
beneficiary rights in any person or entity not a party to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall have the
right to enforce the rights of the Stockholders and the Optionholders to
pursue damages in the event of Parents or Merger Subs willful and material
breach of this Agreement. In addition, the Representative shall have the
right, but not the obligation to enforce any rights of the Stockholders or
the Optionholders under this Agreement. No assignment of this Agreement or of
any rights or obligations hereunder may be made by any party, directly or
indirectly (by operation of Law or otherwise), without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto and any attempted assignment without the
required consents shall be void; _provided_ , _however_ , following the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation may (i) assign any or all of its rights and
interests hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates and/or any of their
Affiliates financing sources and (ii) designate one or more of its Affiliates
to perform its obligations hereunder; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ ,
that in any such case, no assignment or delegation of any obligations
hereunder shall relieve the assigning party of any its obligations hereunder.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or
implied, shall create any third party beneficiary or other rights (i) in any
employees or former employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any
participant in any Company Benefit Plan, or any dependent beneficiary thereof
or (ii) to continued employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

_SECTION 11.9_ _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this
Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute
one and the same agreement.

 

 _SECTION 11.10_ _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto hereby waives to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a
trial by jury in respect of any Proceeding directly or indirectly arising out
of, under or in connection with this Agreement, any Company Documents or
Parent Documents, or any transaction contemplated hereby or 

 



59  thereby (including the Debt Commitment Letter and the Debt Financing). Each
party hereto (i) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any
other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party
would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver
and (ii) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced
to enter into this Agreement and the Company Documents or Parent Documents,
as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications
in this _Section 11.10_.

 

 _SECTION 11.11_ _Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached, and that monetary damages or legal remedies, even if available,
would not be an adequate remedy therefor. Therefore, it is accordingly agreed
that, in addition to any other remedies, each party shall be entitled to
equitable relief, including an injunction or injunctions to prevent or
restrain any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by any other party
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of any other party, in the Chosen Courts, and
appropriate injunctive relief may be applied for and granted in connection
therewith. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives: (i) any defenses in any
action for specific performance, including the defense that a remedy at law
would be adequate; and (ii) any requirement to post a bond or other security
as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

_SECTION 11.12_ _Representative_.

 

(a) GS Capital Partners VI Fund, L.P. shall be the agent and attorney-in-fact
for each of the Stockholders and the Optionholders to act as Representative
under this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby in
accordance with the terms of this _Section 11.12_. In the event of the
resignation, death or incapacity of the Representative, a successor
Representative reasonably satisfactory to Parent shall thereafter be
appointed by an instrument in writing signed by Parent and such successor
Representative.

 

(b) The Representative is hereby authorized and empowered to act for, and on
behalf of, any or all of the Stockholders and the Optionholders (with full
power of substitution in the premises) in connection with such matters as are
reasonably necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated in
this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby including,
without limitation, (i) to receive all payments owing to the Stockholders or
the Optionholders under this Agreement, (ii) to terminate, amend, waive any
provision of, or abandon, this Agreement or the other agreements contemplated
hereby, (iii) to act as the representative of the Stockholders to review and
authorize all claims and disputes or question the accuracy thereof, (iv) to
negotiate and compromise on their behalf with Parent any claims asserted
thereunder and to authorize payments to be made with respect thereto, (v) to
take such further actions as are authorized in this Agreement or the other
agreements contemplated hereby, and (vi) in general, do all things and perform
all acts, including, without limitation, executing and delivering all
agreements (including the Escrow Agreement and the other agreements
contemplated in this Agreement), certificates, receipts, consents, elections,
instructions and other documents contemplated by, or deemed by the
Representative to be necessary or desirable in connection with, this
Agreement, the other agreements contemplated hereby and the transactions
contemplated herein or therein. Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to
rely on such 

 



60  appointment and to treat the Representative as the duly appointed attorney-
in-fact of each Stockholder and Optionholder. Notices given to the
Representative in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement shall
constitute notice to the Stockholders and Optionholders for all purposes under
this Agreement.

(c) The appointment of the Representative is an agency coupled with an
interest and is irrevocable and any action taken by the Representative
pursuant to the authority granted in this _Section 11.12_ shall be effective
and absolutely binding on each Stockholder and Optionholder notwithstanding
any contrary action of or direction from such Stockholder or Optionholder. The
death or incapacity, or dissolution or other termination of existence, of any
Stockholder or Optionholder shall not terminate the authority and agency of
the Representative. Parent, Merger Sub and any other party to any document
contemplated by this Agreement in dealing with the Representative may
conclusively and absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon any act of
the Representative as the act of the Stockholder or Optionholder and shall be
relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by them in
accordance with such act of the Representative.

 

(d) The Representative shall not be liable to any Stockholder, Optionholder or
to any other Person (other than Parent or Merger Sub), with respect to any
action taken or omitted to be taken by the Representative in its role as
Representative under or in connection with this Agreement, unless such action
or omission results from or arises out of willful misconduct or gross
negligence on the part of the Representative, and the Representative shall
not be liable to any Stockholder or Optionholder in the event that, in the
exercise of its reasonable judgment, the Representative believes there will
not be adequate resources available to cover potential costs and expenses to
contest a claim made by Parent or Merger Sub against the Stockholders or
Optionholders.

(e) The Representative shall be entitled to use the funds constituting the
Representative Expense Amount, for any and all expenses, charges and
liabilities, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys fees,
incurred by the Representative in the performance or discharge of its duties
pursuant to this _Section 11.12_ (the " _Representative Expenses_ ").

 

(f) Each Letter of Transmittal shall provide that the Representative shall be
the agent and attorney-in-fact for each of the Stockholders and the
Optionholders with full power and authority to act as Representative under and
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 

 _SECTION 11.13_ _Legal Representation_.

 

(a) In any dispute or proceeding arising after the Effective Time under or in
connection with this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby,
the parties agree that any of the Stockholders or the Optionholders shall have
the right, at their election to retain the firm of Fried, Frank, Harris,
Shriver and Jacobson LLP (" _Fried Frank_ ") to represent them in such matter,
and Parent and the Surviving Corporation (on behalf of themselves, their
respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees and representatives and
their respective successors and assigns) hereby irrevocably waive and consent
to any such representation in any such matter.

 



61 (b) Each of the parties further agrees that, as to all privileged
communications among Fried Frank, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries and
any Stockholder and any Optionholder, as to which any of them was a client of
Fried Frank, each of them retains all rights to any evidentiary privileges,
subject to the privilege law of the applicable jurisdiction related to joint
representation.

(c) If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
agreements contemplated hereby are consummated,

(i) the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall have no right of
access to or control over any of Fried Franks records related to such
transactions; and

(ii) it would be impracticable to remove from the records (including emails
and other electronic files) of the Company and its Subsidiaries any
privileged communications with Fried Frank. The Company and its Subsidiaries,
Parent and Merger Sub agree that no waiver of any applicable attorney-client,
work product or other privilege shall result if such material is allowed to
remain in the files of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

(d) In the event of a claim brought by any third party, it is the intention
of the parties that all applicable attorney client, work product and other
privileges continue to inure to the benefit of all persons and entities who
held such privileges at the time any privileged communications occurred, and
that any such privileged communication may be disclosed to third parties only
with the consent of all parties entitled to invoke privilege at the time the
communication was made. The Surviving Corporation shall be deemed the
successor in interest to the Company for this purpose. If any party receives a
formal or informal demand for a communication which that party reasonably
believed to subject to a claim of privilege in favor of any other party, the
party that receives the demand shall promptly notify any other party
reasonably believed to have a right to claim such a privilege and the parties
shall use best efforts to resist any attempt by the third party to breach such
claim of privilege.

 

 _SECTION 11.14_ _No Recourse Against Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding
anything that may be expressed or implied in this Agreement to the contrary,
neither the Company, the Representative nor any of their respective Affiliates
or their respective Affiliates stockholders, partners, members, officers,
directors, employees, controlling persons, agents and representatives shall
have any recourse (directly or indirectly), rights or claims in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Financing Commitments and the Debt Financing) or any documents or instruments
delivered in connection herewith or therewith against any Financing Source in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement including the
Financing Commitments and the Debt Financing), whether by the enforcement of
any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise. In
addition, in no event will any Financing Source be liable for consequential,
special, exemplary, punitive or indirect damages (including any loss of
profits, business or anticipated savings) or damages of a tortious nature.
For avoidance of doubt, (i) in no event shall this _Section 11.14_ apply to
Parent, whether before or after the Closing, and (ii) from and after the
Closing, the foregoing shall not modify or alter in any respect any provision
of any definitive loan documentation between or among Parent, the Company (or
the Surviving Corporation), and any of their subsidiaries and any Financing
Source entered into in connection with or as 

 



62  contemplated by this Agreement, and in the event of a conflict between the
foregoing and any provision in any such definitive loan documentation, the
provisions of such definitive loan documentation shall govern and control
