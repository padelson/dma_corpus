 THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the "Agreement"), dated as of June 17, 2007, is by and among The Finish Line, Inc. ("Parent"), an Indiana corporation, Headwind, Inc. ("Merger Sub"), a newly-formed Tennessee corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, and Genesco Inc. (the "Company"), a Tennessee corporation. 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board of Directors") has (i) determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and the shareholders of the Company, and has approved and declared it advisable for the Company, to enter into this Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub providing for the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company in accordance with the Tennessee Business Corporation Act (the "TBCA"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, and (ii) resolved to recommend adoption of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company; 

  

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub have each approved and declared it advisable to enter into this Agreement providing for the Merger in accordance with the Indiana Business Corporation Law and the TBCA, upon the terms and conditions set forth herein;

and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities

 (c) The charter of the Company in effect at the Effective Time shall be the charter of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein, by the TBCA or pursuant to any amendment approved by the shareholders of the Company at the Company Shareholders Meeting, consistent with the obligations set forth in Section 6.5. 

   

 (d) The bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, except as to the name of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended as provided by the TBCA, the charter of the Surviving Corporation and such bylaws, consistent with the obligations set forth in Section 6.5. 

   

 Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on a date to be specified by the parties, such date to be no later than the second business day after satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Section 7 capable of satisfaction prior to the Closing (it being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at Closing), at the offices of Bass, Berry and Sims PLC, 315 Deaderick Street, Suite 2700, Nashville, Tennessee 37238, unless another time, date and/or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date."

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 2\. _Conversion of Securities_. 

  

 Section 2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the holders of any shares of outstanding common stock of the Company, par value $1.00 per share ("Company Common Stock"), or the other securities described below: 

  

 (a) _Conversion of Shares of Company Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(d)), together with the associated Company Rights, shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive $54.50 in cash, without interest (the "Per Share Price"), payable to the holder thereof (the "Merger Consideration"), upon the surrender in accordance with Section 2.4 of the certificate that formerly evidenced such shares, or as otherwise specified for Book-Entry Shares. From and after the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock, including the associated Company Rights, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Book-Entry Shares or a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock, including the associated Company Rights, shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right, subject to Section 2.4 and Section 2.5, to receive the applicable Merger Consideration therefor. 

   

 (b) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into, be exchanged for and become 1,000,000 validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. 

   

 (c) _Preferred Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of Company Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, including those subject to a Company redemption notice with a redemption date after the Effective Time, shall remain issued and outstanding with the same designation, rights, privileges and preferences as set forth in the Surviving Corporations charter. 

   

 (d) _Cancellation of Company and Parent-Owned Stock_. All shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock that are owned by the Company or any Company Subsidiary as treasury stock and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   

 (e) _Adjustments_. So long as such transaction is otherwise permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Per Share Price shall be appropriately adjusted for any stock dividend (other than the payment or accrual of regular quarterly cash dividends), stock split, recapitalization, reclassification or like transaction affecting the Company Common Stock after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. 

      ##### 

  

     

 (f) _Convertible Debentures_. The 4.125% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2023 (the "Convertible Debentures") issued by the Company and under that certain indenture dated as of June 24, 2003, between the Company and The Bank of New York (the "Indenture"), and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and the terms of the Indenture and a supplemental indenture required to be entered into upon the Merger under the terms of the Indenture (the "Supplemental Indenture"), will not be convertible at or after the Effective Time into shares of Company Common Stock, and following the Effective Time, the Convertible Debentures will be convertible, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture, into cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the Per Share Price times (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock into which the Convertible Debentures could have been converted as of the Effective Time, including fractional shares. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, at all times from and after the Effective Time maintain sufficient funds to satisfy its obligations to holders of Convertible Debentures upon the conversion thereof as described in this Section 2.1(f). 

   

 Section 2.2 _Dissenting Shares_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Preferred Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by holders of shares of Company Preferred Stock who are entitled to demand and who have properly demanded and perfected their rights to be paid the "fair value" of such shares in accordance with Title 48, Chapter 23 of the TBCA (the "Dissenting Shares") shall be entitled to only such rights, if any, as are granted by Title 48, Chapter 23 of the TBCA; provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or shall effectively waive, withdraw or lose such holders rights under Title 48, Chapter 23 of the TBCA, such holders shares of Company Preferred Stock shall thereupon cease to be Dissenting Shares. 

   

 (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any appraisal demands received by the Company, withdrawals thereof and any other instruments served pursuant to the applicable section of the TBCA and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights under the TBCA. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent or as otherwise required by applicable Law, make any payment with respect to or settle or offer to settle any such demands. 

   

 (c) Dissenters rights under the TBCA are not available to the holders of Company Common Stock for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 Section 2.3 _Company Options, Restricted Shares and ESPP_. Except to the extent otherwise agreed in writing by the Company and Parent prior to the Effective Time: 

  

 (a) The Company shall take all action necessary to ensure that, (i) immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding option to acquire shares of Company Common Stock ("Company Options") granted under the Companys Amended and Restated 1996 Stock Incentive Plan and 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (collectively, the "Equity Incentive Plans"), shall become fully vested and exercisable (without regard to whether the Company Options are then vested or exercisable), (ii) at the Effective Time, all Company Options not 

    ##### 

  

    

theretofore exercised shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, converted
into the right to receive a cash payment from the Surviving Corporation in an
amount equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Per Share
Price over the exercise price of each such Company Option and (y) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such option to the extent not
previously exercised (such payment, if any, to be net of applicable Taxes
withheld pursuant to Section 2.5), and (iii) after the Effective Time,
any such cancelled Company Option shall no longer be exercisable by the
former holder thereof, but shall only entitle such holder to the payment
described in subsection (ii) without interest. 

   

 (b) The Company shall take all action necessary to ensure that, (i) immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock granted subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions pursuant to any Equity Incentive Plan (collectively, "Restricted Shares") which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest and become free of such restrictions (without regard to whether the Restricted Shares are then vested or the applicable restrictions have then lapsed) and (ii) at the Effective Time, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the Per Share Price with respect to each such Restricted Share, less any applicable Taxes withheld pursuant to Section 2.5. 

   

 (c) The Company shall take all action necessary to ensure that, (i) the Companys Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP" and, together with the Equity Incentive Plans, the "Equity Plans") is, and that all offering periods in progress under the ESPP are, terminated immediately prior to the Effective Time (or another date prior to the Effective Time date designated by the Company for administrative convenience), (ii) with respect to persons participating in the ESPP on the date on which the offering periods cease and the ESPP terminates (and who have not withdrawn from or otherwise ceased participation in the ESPP prior to such date), accumulated contributions will be deemed to have been applied on such date to the purchase of Company Common Stock in accordance with the ESPPs terms (treating the date of termination as the last day of the relevant offering period), and each such share of Company Common Stock will be deemed to have been cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, such that, as of the Effective Time, on a net basis, each participant shall be entitled to receive, without interest and less any applicable Taxes withheld pursuant to Section 2.5, (A) a refund by the Company of all deferrals made to the ESPP by the participant during the applicable existing salary deferral periods, to the extent such deferrals have not been applied to the purchase of Company Common Stock in accordance with the ESPPs terms, and (B) an amount in cash equal to the excess of (1) the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that the participant is deemed to have acquired pursuant to the terms of the ESPP and (y) the Per Share Price, over (2) the aggregate amount of the participants purchase price deemed to have been paid in connection with the deemed purchase, and (iii) there are no outstanding rights of participants under the ESPP following the Effective Time. The aggregate amount specified in Sections 2.3(a), (b) and (c) with respect to the Company Options, Restricted Shares and "Options" pursuant to the ESPP ("ESPP Options") is referred to herein as the "Cash Out Amount." 

   

 (d) The Company shall take all action necessary to ensure that, as of the Effective Time, the Equity Plans shall terminate and that no person shall have any right under the Equity Plans, except as set forth herein. 

     ##### 

  

     

 (e) At or promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, deliver the applicable Cash Out Amount to the holders of Company Options, Restricted Shares and ESPP Options, without interest and less any applicable withholding Taxes. If for any reason the Surviving Corporation does not have adequate freely available and unrestricted cash to pay the aggregate Cash Out Amount, (i) Parent shall promptly fund the Surviving Corporation with additional cash sufficient to make all required payments to the holders of Company Options, Restricted Shares and ESPP Options in respect of the Cash Out Amount and (ii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall in any event be liable for payment thereof. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, at all times from and after the Effective Time maintain sufficient funds to satisfy its obligations to holders of Company Options, Restricted Shares and ESPP Options in respect of the Cash Out Amount pursuant to this Section 2.3. 

   

 Section 2.4 _Exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares_. 

  

 (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Company to act as paying agent for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, including associated Company Rights, in connection with the Merger (the "Paying Agent") and to receive the funds to which holders of shares of Company Common Stock will become entitled pursuant to Section 2.1. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to the Paying Agent cash necessary to pay for the shares of Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). If for any reason the Exchange Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall be entitled under Section 2.1, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly deposit additional cash with the Paying Agent sufficient to make all payments of Merger Consideration, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall in any event be liable for payment thereof. 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each (i) record holder, as of the Effective Time, of an outstanding certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of the Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") or (ii) holder, as of the Effective Time, of shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry ("Book-Entry Shares"), a form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such person shall pass, only, subject to Section 2.4(c), upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and/or instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for payment of the Merger Consideration therefor. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and/or such other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, and such Certificate or applicable book-entry shall then be canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. 

    ##### 

  

    

Until surrendered for cancellation as contemplated by this Section 2.4(b),
each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender

 (e) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.7(c), and further assuming that Parent conducts the Employee Preferred Stock Tender Offer in accordance with the terms set forth in Section 5.4 and it otherwise meets the requirements of Section 48-103-102(10)(B)(v) of the Tennessee Investor Protection Act, the Company Board of Directors has taken or will take (prior to the commencement of the Employee Preferred Stock Tender Offer) such action as is necessary (including recommending in favor of the Employee Preferred Stock Tender Offer to the holders of the Employee Preferred Stock) to assure that none of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger and the Employee Preferred Stock Tender Offer, will, to the Companys knowledge, be a "takeover offer" under the Tennessee Investor Protection Act. 

   

 (f) As of the date of this Agreement, Dissenters rights under the TBCA are not available to the holders of Company Common Stock for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger.

 (b) No consent of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any third party or Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by or with respect to Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, other than (i) filing of a pre-merger notification report under the HSR Act, (ii) the filing with the SEC of such reports under Section 13 of the Exchange Act as may be required in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) the filing of the Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Tennessee and any appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of the other jurisdictions in which Parent or Merger Sub is qualified to do business, (iv) compliance with and filings under the merger control, competition or fair trade Laws of any foreign jurisdiction, if and to the extent required, (v) as set forth in Section 4.3 of the Parent Disclosure 

    ##### 

  

    

Schedule and (vi) such items that have not had and are not reasonably likely
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. 

   

 Section 4.4 _Information in the Proxy Statement_. The information supplied in writing by Parent and Merger Sub expressly for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will not contain at the time it is first mailed to the shareholders of the Company or at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting, any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 

  

 Section 4.5 _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no Action pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, against Parent or any of its affiliates before any Governmental Entity that would or seeks to delay or prevent the consummation of the Merger. As of the date hereof, neither Parent nor any of its affiliates is subject to any continuing order of, consent decree, settlement agreement or other similar written agreement with, or, to the knowledge of Parent, continuing investigation by, any Governmental Entity, or any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award of any Governmental Entity that would or seeks to delay or prevent the consummation of the Merger. 

  

 Section 4.6 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of the Debt Commitment Letter, dated as of the date hereof (the "Commitment Letter"), made by UBS Loan Finance LLC and UBS Securities LLC (together, the "Lender"), and accepted by Parent, pursuant to which the Lender has committed to provide the debt financing (the "Financing") to Parent that is necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The Commitment Letter is, as of the date of this Agreement, in full force and effect in the form so delivered. The Commitment Letter has not been amended in any respect that could reasonably be expected to impair or delay the availability of the financing contemplated thereby on the Closing Date. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than as set forth in or contemplated by the Commitment Letter (the "Disclosed Conditions"), and no Person (including, without limitation, the Lender) has any contractual right to impose (i) any condition precedent to such funding other than the Disclosed Conditions or (ii) any reduction to the aggregate amount available under the Commitment Letter on the Closing Date (or any term or condition which would have the effect of reducing the aggregate amount under the Commitment Letter on the Closing Date). Parent has fully paid all commitment fees required to be paid prior to the Closing Date in connection with the Commitment Letter. The aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Commitment Letter, together with other sources of capital available to Parent, will be sufficient when funded for Parent and the Surviving Corporation to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (including any applicable Merger Consideration in consideration of the conversion of the Company Preferred Stock and the Convertible Debentures) and the Cash Out Amount, to refinance any outstanding indebtedness of the Company contemplated hereby to be so refinanced, to redeem the Company Preferred Stock (if applicable), to consummate the Employee Preferred Stock Tender Offer (if applicable), and to pay all fees and expenses payable by Parent in connection with the Financing, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or that the Financing will not be available to Merger Sub on the 

   ##### 

  

 

Closing Date. For avoidance of doubt, it shall not be a condition to Closing
for Parent or Merger Sub to obtain the Financing or any alternative
financing.

There are no Contracts between Parent, Merger Sub or any affiliate thereof, on the one hand, and any member of the Companys management or directors, on the other hand, as of the date hereof that relate in any way to the Company or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Prior to the Company Board of Directors approving this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby for purposes of the applicable provisions of the Tennessee Business Combination Act, neither Parent nor Merger Sub, alone or acting together with any other person as a group, was at any time, or became, an "interested shareholder" of the Company thereunder or has taken any action that would cause any anti-takeover statute under the Tennessee Business Combination Act to be applicable to this Agreement. 

   

 (d) Parent has filed all forms, reports, registrations, statements, certifications and other documents required to be filed by it with, or furnished by Parent to, the SEC for all periods beginning on or after January 1, 2004, including each document required to be filed by Parent with the SEC in connection with the Merger and the related transactions (the "Parent SEC Reports"). The Parent SEC Reports were prepared in accordance with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act, and did not, as of their respective dates, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC.

For purposes of this Section 4.9, the term "Solvent" with respect to the Surviving Corporation and Parent means that, as of any date of determination, (a) the amount of the fair saleable value of the assets of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, exceeds, as of such date, each of (i) the value of all liabilities of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, including contingent and other liabilities, as of such date, as such terms are generally determined in accordance with the applicable Tennessee, Indiana and federal Laws governing determinations of the solvency of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, on their existing debts (including contingent liabilities) as such debts become absolute and matured; (b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which they are engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date; (c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be able to pay their respective liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature in the ordinary course of business; and (d) the satisfaction of any other solvency requirement set forth in the TBCA or pursuant to Indiana or federal Laws applicable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation. It is agreed and understood that Parent will obtain an opinion or opinions of a firm experienced in rendering such opinions as to the solvency of Parent following the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent will make available to the Company (for the Companys reference but not reliance) a true, complete and correct copy of the solvency opinions referred to in the immediately preceding sentence promptly after delivery thereof to Parent. 

  

 Section 4.10 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the representations and warranties contained in this Section 4, and any certificate delivered by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with Closing, the Company acknowledges and agrees that none of Parent, Merger Sub or any other person on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub makes, nor has the Company relied upon or otherwise been induced by, any other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to Parent or Merger Sub or with respect to any other information provided to or made available to the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder. Except as provided in Section 6.8, neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any other person will have or be subject to any liability or indemnification obligation to the Company or any other person resulting from the distribution to the Company, or the Companys use of, any such information, including any information, documents, projections, forecasts or other material made available to the Company in certain data rooms or management presentations in expectation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, unless any such information is expressly included in a representation or warranty contained in this Section 4 or in the corresponding section of the Parent Disclosure Schedule.

 (a) The Company has ceased and caused to be terminated all existing solicitations, discussions, contacts and negotiations with any persons with respect to any inquiry, offer or proposal from any person or group other than Parent or any of its affiliates relating to any transaction or proposed transaction or series of related transactions involving: (A) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase by any person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of a twenty percent (20%) interest or more in either the total outstanding shares of equity or voting securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or the total outstanding shares of any class of equity securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person or "group" beneficially owning twenty percent (20%) or more of the total outstanding shares of equity or voting securities of the Company or the total outstanding shares of any class of equity securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (B) any sale or disposition of consolidated assets of the Company (including for this purpose the outstanding assets, rights and equity securities of the Company Subsidiaries) to any person or "group" for consideration equal to fifteen percent (15%) or more of the aggregate fair market value of all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, or (C) any consolidation, merger, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary (any of the foregoing inquiries, offers or proposals being an "Acquisition Proposal"). Except as provided in Section 5.2(b), (c) or (d), from the date hereof, until the earlier of the 

     ##### 

  

    

termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time, the Company shall not
and shall not authorize or permit its officers, directors, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants, financial or
other advisors or other agents or those of any Company Subsidiary
(collectively, "Representatives") to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage or take any other action to knowingly
facilitate the submission of an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement, option agreement or
any agreement or arrangement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
enter into, continue, participate, engage or knowingly assist in any manner

Proposal, or grant any waiver, amendment or release under any standstill, or
(iv) take any action to, other than as contemplated by this Agreement in
connection with the Merger, render the Company Rights issued pursuant to the
terms of the Company Rights Agreement inapplicable to an Acquisition Proposal
or the transactions contemplated thereby, exempt or exclude any person from

the Company Rights Agreement. For purposes of this Section 5.2 only,
"Company Subsidiary" means any Subsidiary of the Company whose business

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company (i) may (and may authorize and permit its Representatives to), pursuant to a confidentiality agreement, which shall contain provisions no less favorable in any material respect to the Company than the Confidentiality Agreement (except for such changes as are necessary to allow the Company to comply with the terms of this Agreement), furnish information concerning, and provide access to, its business, properties, employees and assets to any Person (and its Representatives acting in such capacity) that has made an Acquisition Proposal, provided that any such information must be provided to Parent prior to or substantially concurrent with the time of its provision to such third party to the extent not previously made available to Parent, and (ii) may participate, engage or assist in any manner in negotiations and discussions with any Person (and its Representatives acting in such capacity) that has made an Acquisition Proposal with respect to such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry if, but only if, in the case of both clause (i) and (ii): (x) such Acquisition Proposal provides for any Person or group to acquire, directly or indirectly, a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (or a majority of the voting securities of any surviving corporation in a merger or consolidation with the Company) or provides for the acquisition of all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company (a "Takeover Proposal"); (y) such Takeover Proposal was not solicited or initiated in violation of Section 5.2(a) by the Company or by any of its Representatives, and the Company Board of Directors (or any committee thereof authorized to act in such capacity) determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel, that such Takeover Proposal is more favorable than the Merger, from a financial point of view, to the Companys shareholders taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any binding written and complete proposal (including all schedules and exhibits) to amend the terms of this Agreement) and for which financing, to the extent required, is, or is reasonably likely to be, committed on 

     ##### 

  

    

terms and conditions that the Company Board of Directors (or any committee
thereof authorized to act in such capacity) determines, after consultation
with its financial advisor, are reasonably likely to result in disbursement
sufficient for consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Takeover
Proposal; and (z) in the good faith opinion of the Company Board of Directors
(or any committee thereof authorized to act in such capacity), after
consultation with outside legal counsel, providing such information or access
or participating, engaging or assisting in such negotiations or discussions
is or would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders and
that the failure to take such action is or would be inconsistent with the
Company Board of Directors fiduciary duties to the Companys
shareholders under applicable Law (a Takeover Proposal which satisfies
clauses (x), (y) and (z) being referred to herein as a "Superior Proposal").
The Company shall promptly, and in any event within 48 hours after receipt of
any bona fide inquiries, proposals or offers received by, any request
for information from, or any negotiations sought to be initiated or continued
with, either the Company or its Representatives concerning an Acquisition
Proposal, notify Parent orally and in writing and disclose the material terms
of such inquiry, offer, proposal or request and, in the case of written
materials provided to the Company, provide Parent copies or written summaries
of such materials as promptly as reasonably practicable. The Company will
keep Parent informed on a reasonably prompt basis of the status and any
discussions or negotiations (including amendments and proposed
amendments) relating to any Takeover Proposal or other bona fide inquiry,
offer, proposal or request. 

   

 (c) Except as set forth in this subsection (c), neither the Company Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the approval or recommendation of the Company Board of Directors of this Agreement or the Merger or publicly announce that it has resolved to take such action (any such action under this clause (i), a "Change in Recommendation"), (ii) approve, recommend or adopt or publicly propose to approve, recommend or adopt any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) approve, recommend, adopt or allow the Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, option agreement or similar arrangement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in response to a Takeover Proposal that did not arise from a breach by the Company of Section 5.2(a), prior to the Company Shareholder Approval (x) the Company Board of Directors (or any committee thereof authorized to act in such capacity) shall be permitted to make a Change in Recommendation if it determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company Board of Directors fiduciary duties to the Companys shareholders under applicable Law and (y) the Company may enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Takeover Proposal if the Company Board of Directors (or a committee thereof authorized to act in such capacity) has made the determination in clause (x), has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and, concurrently with entering into such definitive agreement, terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(g) and immediately pays the applicable termination fee as a condition to such termination. The Company shall not be entitled to terminate pursuant to Section 8.1(g), effect a Change in Recommendation or enter into an agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal unless and until (A) after the third business day following Parents receipt of a written notice (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") from the Company advising Parent that the Company intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor, including the material terms and 

     ##### 

  

    

conditions of the Superior Proposal that is the basis of such action in such
Notice of Superior Proposal and stating that the Company intends to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(g) or effect a Change
in Recommendation, as applicable (it being understood and agreed that (1) in
determining whether to cause or permit the Company to so terminate this
Agreement, the Company Board of Directors (or a committee thereof authorized
to act in such capacity) shall take into account any changes to the financial
terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent to the Company in any binding
written and complete proposal (including all schedules and exhibits and any
necessary amendments to the terms of this Agreement) in response to a Notice
of Superior Proposal or otherwise, and (2) any material amendment to the
financial terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of
Superior Proposal and a new three business day period), (B) the Company has
complied in all material respects with this Section 5.2 and (C) in the case
of a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(g) or entrance into an agreement for
a Superior Proposal, the Company has paid, or caused to be paid to, Parent
all amounts due Parent pursuant to Section 8.2 of this Agreement as a result
of a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(g). 

   

 (d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 or any other provision of this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board of Directors (or any committee thereof authorized to act in such capacity) from making a Change in Recommendation, or from taking and disclosing to the Companys shareholders a position with respect to any tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any similar disclosure to the Companys shareholders with respect to any Takeover Proposal, if in any such case the Companys Board of Directors (or any committee thereof authorized to act in such capacity) determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that it is required to do so under applicable Law, provided that any such disclosure (other than a recommendation of rejection of such tender or exchange offer or other Takeover Proposal or a "stop, look and listen" letter or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Change in Recommendation if it satisfies the definition thereof under Section 5.2(c)(i), unless the Company Board of Directors expressly reaffirms its recommendation of the Merger at least two business days prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting. 

   

 Section 5.3 _Employee Matters_. 

  

 (a) Except as provided in Section 5.3(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, from the Effective Time to the date that is twelve (12) months after the Effective Time (the "Benefits Continuation Period"), the Surviving Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid to each employee who continues as an employee of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation during the Benefits Continuation Period (the "Continuing Employees") salary, wages, cash incentive opportunities, severance, medical benefits and other welfare benefit plans programs and arrangements which are at least comparable in the aggregate to those provided prior to the Closing Date under the Plans or otherwise (including the bonus programs previously approved for fiscal 2008), excluding any equity-based plans; provided, that with respect to Continuing Employees who are subject to employment and/or change in control agreements or arrangements that have not been superseded by agreements with Parent (the "Employment Agreements"), the Surviving Corporation shall expressly assume such Employment Agreements and fulfill all obligations thereunder; provided, further, that, except for those Continuing Employees that are party to the Employment Agreements, neither this Section 

    ##### 

  

    

5.3(a) nor any other provision of this Agreement shall be deemed a
guarantee of employment for such Continuing Employees with the Company or any
Company Subsidiary. The Surviving Corporation shall expressly assume the
Companys Deferred Income Plan dated as of July 1, 2000, as amended, and
fulfill all obligations thereunder. During the Benefits Continuation
Period, the Surviving Corporation shall pay, subject to such terms and
conditions as it shall establish and the terms of applicable Employment
Agreements, any such Continuing Employee whose employment is involuntarily
terminated by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries
without cause an amount of severance pay in cash equal to the amount of cash
severance pay that would have been payable to such Continuing Employee under
the terms of the severance policy maintained by the Company and applicable
to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the date of this Agreement
or, if applicable, such Continuing Employees Employment Agreement. 

   

 (b) The Surviving Corporation shall (i) waive any applicable pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements in any replacement or successor welfare benefit plan of the Surviving Corporation that a Continuing Employee is eligible to participate in following the Effective Time to the extent such exclusions or waiting periods were inapplicable to, or had been satisfied by, such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time under the relevant Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated, (ii) provide each such Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductible paid prior to the Effective Time (to the same extent such credit was given under the analogous Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements and (iii) to the extent that any Continuing Employee is allowed to participate in any employee benefit plan of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their subsidiaries following the Effective Time, cause such plan to recognize the service of such Continuing Employee with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and benefit accrual (but not for benefit accrual under any defined benefit, retiree welfare or similar plan) to the extent of such service. Parent will make arrangements with its insurance carriers prior to Closing to ensure the results specified in this Section 5.3(b). 

   

 (c) Parent and Company acknowledge and agree that the provisions contained in this Section 5.3 shall not interfere with the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend, modify or terminate any Plan (subject to the provisions of Section 5.3(a) and (b) above) or to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee for any reason, subject to the terms of applicable Employment Agreements. 

   

 (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such steps as may be reasonably necessary (to the extent permitted under applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of the Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to the Company Common Stock) resulting from the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by Section 2 of this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

   

 (e) Nothing in this Section 5.3 shall give any Company Employee any right under this Agreement. 

    ##### 

  

     

 Section 5.4 _Employee Preferred Stock Tender Offer_. 

  

 (a) The Company agrees to provide all reasonable cooperation reasonably requested by Parent, at Parents sole expense, in connection with a tender offer and consent solicitation (the "Employee Preferred Stock Tender Offer") conducted by Parent in respect of the outstanding shares of the Companys Employees Subordinated Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Employee Preferred Stock"). If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (or shall cause Merger Sub to), promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives for and against any and all losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the Employee Preferred Stock Tender Offer. 

   

 (b) The Employee Preferred Stock Tender Offer shall provide for a per share offer at an amount of cash equal to the Per Share Price and shall provide, as conditions, (i) the prior or simultaneous consummation of the Merger and (ii) that the holders of Employee Preferred Stock grant their proxies to vote in favor of approval of (A) this Agreement, (B) the transactions contemplated hereby including the Merger, (C) an amendment to the Companys charter to allow for the redemption of the Employee Preferred Stock following the consummation of the Merger at an amount of cash equal to the Per Share Price, and (D) any other matters included by the Company in the Proxy Statement for the Company Shareholders Meeting, (the "Employee Preferred Stock Consents"). The Employee Preferred Stock Tender Offer shall be made pursuant to an Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement and related letters of transmittal and similar ancillary agreements prepared by Parent in connection with the Employee Preferred Stock Tender Offer in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and in compliance as to form in all material respects with applicable SEC requirements and in accordance with all requirements under the Tennessee Investor Protection Act as applicable. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any materials that are to be provided holders of Employee Preferred Stock in connection with the Employee Preferred Stock Tender Offer, and Parent shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. Parent will not waive the conditions regarding the prior or simultaneous consummation of the Merger or the Employee Preferred Stock Consents to the Employee Preferred Stock Tender Offer without the prior written consent of the Company. 

   

 (c) If at any time prior to the acceptance of Employee Preferred Stock pursuant to the Employee Preferred Stock Tender Offer any event should occur that is required by applicable Law to be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Employee Preferred Stock Tender Offer Documents, Parent will prepare and disseminate such amendment or supplement; provided, however, that prior to such dissemination, Parent shall consult with Parent with respect to such amendment or supplement and shall afford the Company and its counsel reasonable opportunity to comment thereon. Parent will notify the Company at least 48 hours prior to the dissemination of the Employee Preferred Stock Tender Offer documents, or 24 hours prior to the mailing of any amendment or supplement thereto, to the Employee Preferred Stockholders. 

     ##### 

  

     

 (d) For avoidance of doubt, neither the making nor consummation of the Employee Preferred Stock Tender Offer, nor the approval of the Company shareholders of the amendment to the Companys charter referred to in Section 5.4(b)(C), shall be a condition to Closing for the Company, Parent or Merger Sub. 

   

 Section 6\. _Additional Agreements_. 

  

 Section 6.1 _Proxy Statement_. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following the date hereof, prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement in preliminary form, and each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect thereto. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys shareholders as promptly as practicable after filing with the SEC. If at any time prior to receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval there shall occur any event that should, upon the advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the Company shall promptly prepare, file with the SEC and mail to its shareholders such an amendment or supplement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or any other SEC filing required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (or, in each case, any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the party responsible for filing or mailing such document shall provide the other party an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and shall include in such document or response comments reasonably proposed by the other party. At the request of Parent, the Company shall include in the Proxy Statement a proposal to amend the Companys charter to allow for the redemption of the Employee Preferred Stock following the consummation of the Merger at an amount of cash equal to the Per Share Price. 

  

 Section 6.2 _Company Shareholders Meeting_. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following the date hereof, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the "Company Shareholders Meeting") for the purpose of seeking the Company Shareholder Approval. Subject to Section 5.2(c), the Companys Board of Directors (or any committee thereof authorized to act in such capacity) shall recommend adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the shareholders of the Company and include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Unless such recommendation shall have been modified or withdrawn in accordance with Section 5.2(c), the Company shall take all action that is both reasonable and lawful to solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt and approve this Agreement and the Merger and shall take all other reasonable actions necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the shareholders of the Company that are required by the NYSE or CHX rules or the TBCA. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding sentence and for avoidance of doubt, at any time prior to the Company Stockholder 

   ##### 

  

 

Approval, the Company may adjourn, postpone or cancel the Company
Stockholders Meeting following a Change in Recommendation or in response to
an Acquisition Proposal if the Company Board of Directors (or any
committee thereof authorized to act in such capacity) determines in good
faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel that there is a
reasonable likelihood that such Acquisition Proposal could lead to a Superior
Proposal and that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or, in any event, if this Agreement
is terminated before that meeting is held. 

   

 Section 6.3 _Access to Information, Confidentiality_. Prior to the Effective Time, except as otherwise prohibited by applicable Law or the terms of any Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, as would materially interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or as would be reasonably expected to violate the attorney-client privilege of the Company or a Company Subsidiary (it being agreed that the parties shall use their reasonable efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner that does not cause such violation), the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent, Merger Sub and their directors, employees, representatives, financial advisors, consultants, lenders, legal counsel, accountants and other advisors and representatives, to have such access to the books and records, financial, operating and other data, assets, properties, facilities, plants, offices, auditors, authorized representatives, business and operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as is reasonably necessary or appropriate in connection with Parents investigation of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. Any such investigation and examination shall be conducted at reasonable times upon reasonable advance notice and under reasonable circumstances so as to minimize disruption to or impairment of the Companys business. In order that Parent may have a full opportunity to make such investigation and, provided such persons are bound by the confidentiality agreement, dated as of May 7, 2007 between Parent and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), or have otherwise agreed to be bound to the provisions of such agreement applicable to representatives, the Company shall furnish the representatives of Parent during such period with all such information and copies of such documents concerning the affairs of the Company as such representatives may reasonably request. The information and documents so provided shall be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. 

  

 Section 6.4 _Regulatory Filings; Reasonable Efforts_. 

  

 (a) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to make and shall cause their affiliates to use reasonable best efforts to make all filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, application or submission of other documents required by any Governmental Entity or any foreign labor organization or works council in connection with the Merger, including: (i) the filings identified on Section 3.17 of the Company Disclosure Schedule that are required to be made with a Governmental Entity, (ii) pre-merger notification reports to be filed with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ") as required by the HSR Act, (iii) filings required by the merger notification or control Laws, and any other applicable antitrust or fair trade Law, of any applicable foreign jurisdiction or filings required by any foreign labor organization or works council, (iv) any filings required under the Securities Act, the Exchange 

     ##### 

  

    

Act, any applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws and the securities
laws of any foreign country, or (v) any other applicable Laws or rules and
regulations of any Governmental Entity relating to, and material to the
consummation of, the Merger. 

   

 (b) Subject to restrictions required by Law, each of Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company shall promptly supply, and shall cause their affiliates or owners promptly to supply, the others with any information which may be reasonably required in order to make any filings or applications pursuant to Section 6.4(a). 

   

 (c) Subject to applicable confidentiality restrictions or restrictions required by Law, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will notify the others promptly upon the receipt of: (i) any comments or questions from any officials of any Governmental Entity in connection with any filings made pursuant hereto or the Merger itself and (ii) any request by any officials of any Governmental Entity for amendments or supplements to any filings made pursuant to any applicable Laws and rules and regulations of any Governmental Entity or answers to any questions, or the production of any documents, relating to an investigation of the Merger by any Governmental Entity. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any filing made pursuant to Section 6.4(a), Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be, will promptly inform the others of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the applicable Governmental Entity such amendment or supplement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party shall provide to the other parties (or their respective advisors) copies of all correspondence between such party and any Governmental Entity relating to the Merger. The parties may, as they deem advisable and necessary, designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to the other under this Section as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without the advance written consent of the party providing such materials. In addition, to the extent reasonably practicable, all discussions, telephone calls, and meetings with a Governmental Entity regarding the Merger shall include representatives of Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company. Subject to applicable Law, the parties will consult and cooperate with each other in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, and proposals made or submitted to any Governmental Entity regarding the Merger by or on behalf of any party. 

   

 (d) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, agrees to use its reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the Merger, including using its reasonable efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the causing of all of the conditions set forth in Section 7 to the other parties obligations to consummate the Merger to be satisfied and to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or non-actions, expirations of all necessary waiting periods, waivers, consents, clearances, approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities required by it and the making of all necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental Entities, if any) required by it, (iii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties (provided, however, in no event 

    ##### 

  

    

shall obtaining any such consent, approval, or waivers be required as a
condition to Closing hereunder), (iv) the defending of any suits, claims,
actions, investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger to which it is a
party, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order
entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and
(v) the execution or delivery of any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the Merger, and to carry out fully the purposes of, this
Agreement. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the
proper officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall
use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all such necessary
actions. Without limiting the foregoing, the parties shall request and
shall use reasonable efforts to obtain early termination of the waiting
period provided for in the HSR Act. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Parent agrees to take, and to cause its affiliates and owners to
take, whatever action may be necessary to resolve as promptly as possible any
objections relating to the consummation of the Merger as may be asserted under
the HSR Act or any other applicable merger control, antitrust, competition or
fair trade Laws with respect to the Merger.

 Section 6.5 _Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) The charter and/or bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions with respect to indemnification not less favorable than those set forth in the charter and bylaws of the Company as of the date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at, or prior to, the Effective Time were directors or officers of the Company. 

   

 (b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Company, to the fullest extent permitted and not otherwise prohibited under applicable Law or under the Companys charter, bylaws or any applicable indemnification agreements, and regardless of 

     ##### 

  

    

whether the Merger becomes effective, shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, and, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to the extent indemnified as
of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the Companys
charter, bylaws and/or indemnification agreements in effect on the date
hereof or under applicable Law, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, each
present and former director or officer of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against any costs or
expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out
of or pertaining to (x) the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was
an officer, director, employee, agent or other fiduciary of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time or (y) this Agreement or
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether in
any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, if any Indemnified Party becomes
involved in any actual or threatened Action with respect to which such
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.5
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted as of the
date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the Companys charter,
bylaws and/or indemnification agreements in effect on the date hereof or
under applicable Law, advance to such Indemnified Party within twenty (20)
days after receipt by the Surviving Corporation of a written request for such
advance, his or her legal expenses (including the cost of any investigation
and preparation incurred in connection therewith); provided that any person
to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, to the extent then
required by the TBCA, to repay such advances if it is finally judicially
determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.
Any determination required to be made, for purpose of this Section 6.5 in
advance of final judicial determination, with respect to whether an
Indemnified Partys conduct complied with the standards set forth under
Tennessee Law, the Companys charter, bylaws or indemnification agreements, as
the case may be, shall be made by independent counsel mutually acceptable to
Parent and the Indemnified Party. 

   

 (c) Parent shall and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to indemnification agreements with the Companys directors, officers, employees or agents existing at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law or, subject to Section 6.5(a), under the relevant charter or bylaws. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual claim for which indemnification could be sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such claim or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent. The Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with an Indemnified Party in the defense of any matter for which such Indemnified Party could seek indemnification hereunder. 

   

 (d) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a "tail" insurance policy from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability insurance that provides coverage for the six years following the Effective Time at least comparable in amount and scope to the coverage provided under the Companys directors and officers 

     ##### 

  

    

insurance policy in effect as of the Effective Time for the individuals who
are or were directors and officers of the Company for claims arising from
facts or events occurring prior to the Effective Time, provided, however,
that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in
excess of 200% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such
coverage. If the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the "tail"
insurance described in the first sentence of this Section 6.5(d) for an
amount equal to or less than the maximum premium specified in the preceding
sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain as much comparable "tail"
insurance as possible for an amount equal to such maximum premium. 

   

 (e) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers or directors, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.5 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies. 

   

 (f) This Section shall survive the consummation of the Merger at the Effective Time, is intended to benefit the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties. In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall expressly assume and succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 6.5. 

   

 Section 6.6 _Director Resignations_. The Company shall obtain and deliver to Parent at the Closing evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the resignation, effective as of the Effective Time, of those directors of the Company or any Company Subsidiary designated by Parent to the Company in writing at least ten (10) business days prior to the Closing. 

  

 Section 6.7 _Conduct of Business of Parent and Merger Sub Pending the Merger_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees that, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, it will not, directly or indirectly, take any action (a) to cause its representations and warranties set forth in Section 4 to be untrue in any material respect or as would constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect; or (b) that would, or would reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, (i) to prevent, materially delay or impede the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to borrow under the Commitment Letter in connection with the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) to prevent, materially delay or impede the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (iii) to constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Merger Sub agrees that, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, it shall not engage in any business activities and will incur no liabilities or obligations other than as expressly contemplated by this Agreement.

 Section 6.8 _Financing_. 

  

 (a) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter, including using reasonable best efforts to: (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter, (ii) satisfy, on a timely basis, all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub to obtaining the Financing set forth therein (including the payment of any commitment, engagement or placement fees required as a condition to the Financing), (iii) enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letter (including the flex provisions related to the Financing) or on other terms reasonably acceptable to Parent (to the extent the other terms would not adversely affect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby), and (iv) consummate the Financing at or prior to Closing. In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on terms and conditions not materially less favorable to Parent in the aggregate (as determined in the good faith reasonable judgment of Parent) than the Financing as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event but in all cases at or prior to Closing. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any material breach by any party to the Commitment Letter of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware or any termination of the Commitment Letter. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing. 

   

 (b) The Company agrees to provide all reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Financing as is customary and may be reasonably requested by Parent (provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries), including (i) participation in meetings and marketing presentations at times reasonably acceptable to the Company, (ii) furnishing customary information (including financial statements) reasonably required to be included in the preparation of offering memoranda, private placement memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents in connection with financings similar in scope and nature to the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter (provided such memoranda or documents need not be issued by the Company or any Company Subsidiaries), (iii) cooperation in the preparation of any pledge and security documents, other definitive financing documents, including customary comfort letters of accountants and legal opinions as may be reasonably requested by Parent, and (iv) execution of a customary representation letter in respect of information provided by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in writing expressly for use in connection with the Financing or the syndication thereof, for the benefit of the arrangers of the Financing and lenders and proposed lenders to Parent and Merger Sub in the Financing; provided that Parent and Merger Sub may not and hereby disclaim any reliance by either of them upon such a representation letter; provided further that none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability (other than in respect of such representation letter) in connection with the Financing prior to the Effective Time except for any liabilities that are conditioned on the Effective Time having occurred. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs 

    ##### 

  

    

incurred by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in connection with such
cooperation. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any materials that are to be presented
during any road shows conducted in connection with the Financing to the
extent such materials include or are derived from information provided by the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries for use in connection with the Financing
or the syndication thereof, and Parent shall give due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company
and its counsel. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time,
Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives for and against any and all losses suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing or any alternative
financing and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than
information provided by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries expressly for
use in connection therewith). The Company hereby consents to the reasonable
use of its and the Company Subsidiaries logos in connection with the
Financing, provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not
intended to nor reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries and its or their marks. 

   

 Section 6.9 _Public Disclosure_. The initial press release concerning the Merger shall be a joint press release and, thereafter, so long as this Agreement is in effect, neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Company will disseminate any press release or other public announcement concerning the Merger or this Agreement or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to any third party, except as may be required by Law or by any listing agreement with the Nasdaq National Market, NYSE or CHX, without the prior consent of each of the other parties hereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that Parents consent will not be required, and the Company need not consult with Parent, in connection with any press release or public statement to be issued or made with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or with respect to any Change in Recommendation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without prior consent of the other parties, the Company and Parent (a) may communicate with customers, vendors, suppliers, financial analysts, investors and media representatives in the ordinary course of business in a manner consistent with its past practice and in compliance with applicable Law and (b) may disseminate the information included in a press release or other document previously approved for external distribution by the other parties hereto. 

   

 Section 6.10 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each party shall give prompt notice to the other parties of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would reasonably be expected to cause any representation or warranty made by such party in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at the Closing, or would reasonably be expected to cause any condition set forth in Section 7 not to be satisfied in any material respect at the Closing, and (ii) any material failure of such party or any of its representatives to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided however that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or the remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement. 

    ##### 

  

     

 Section 6.11 _Non-USRPHC Certificate_. On or prior to the Closing, the Company will provide Parent a statement pursuant to Treasury Regulations Sections 1.897-2(h)(1) and 1.1445.2(c)(3) certifying that as of the Closing Date an interest in the Company does not constitute a U.S. real property interest (as that term is defined in Section 897(c) of the Code).

there has been a breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation, warranty,

herein shall relieve a party from liability for any breach hereof occurring
prior to such termination. 

   

 (b) If Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f) or Section 8.1(g), respectively, the Company shall pay to Parent by wire transfer in immediately available funds a termination fee of $46,000,000 concurrently with the termination of this Agreement by the Company or no later than two business days after such termination by Parent, as applicable. In addition, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(f) or Section 8.1(g), then, concurrently with the payment of the termination fee specified in the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall pay to Parent by wire transfer in immediately available funds all of Parents reasonable, actual and documented out-of-pocket expenses and fees (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by Parent on or prior to the termination of this Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in an amount not to exceed $10,000,000. 

   

 (c) If Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or if Parent or Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(h), and (i) if prior to the date of such termination (but on or after the date hereof) a bona fide Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced, and (ii) within twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall pay to Parent a termination fee of $46,000,000 concurrently with the execution of such definitive agreement; provided, that solely for purposes of this Section 8.2(c) and Section 8.1(f)(ii), the term Acquisition Proposal shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in Section 5.2(a), except that all references to twenty percent (20%) therein shall be changed to seventy-five percent (75%).

 (d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amounts due pursuant to Sections 8.2(b) or (c), respectively, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit which results in a final non-appealable judgment against the Company, the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable attorneys fees and 

     ##### 

  

    

expenses actually incurred in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amount of the fee from the date such payment was required to

Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2(e) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Company would not enter into this Agreement, and Parent and the Company acknowledge and agree that the termination fees provided in Section 8.2(b) and 8.2(c) are reasonable and constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty. 

   

 Section 8.3 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 6.8(b) or in Sections 8.2(b) or (c), all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses whether or not the Merger is consummated, including all out-of-pocket expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers, financing sources, hedging counterparties, experts and consultants to a party hereto and its affiliates) incurred by a party or on its behalf (or, with respect to Parent, incurred by Parents stockholders or on their behalf) in connection with or related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement, the preparation, printing, filing and mailing of the Proxy Statement, the solicitation of the Company Shareholder Approval, regulatory filings and notices, the Financing and all other matters related to the closing of the Merger.

Any party may by notice given in accordance with this Section 9.4 to the
other parties designate another address or person for receipt of notices
hereunder. Rejection or other refusal to accept or the inability to deliver
because of changed address or facsimile of which no notice was given shall be
deemed to be receipt of the notice as of the date of such rejection, refusal

 Section 9.5 _Binding Effect; No Assignment; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. 

  

   (a) This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, but without relieving any party (including any assignor) hereto of any obligation hereunder, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. 

  

   (b) Other than Section 6.5 and the rights of the holders of Company Options, ESPP Options and Restricted Shares to receive the Cash Out Amount, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person other than Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and their respective successors and permitted assigns any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 9.6 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree shall remain in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable. The parties further agree to negotiate in good faith to replace such invalid or unenforceable provision of this Agreement, or invalid or unenforceable portion thereof, with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the 

   ##### 

  

 

economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable
provision or portion thereof. 

   

 Section 9.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in contract or in tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Tennessee, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of Law provision or rule (whether of the State of Tennessee or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Tennessee. 

  

 Section 9.8 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver_. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts of the State of Tennessee (or, in the case of any claim as to which the federal courts have exclusive subject matter jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of America) sitting in the City of Nashville in the State of Tennessee in any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such action may be heard and determined in such court. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Action with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure to lawfully serve process, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, that (i) the Action in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such Action is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. EACH OF THE COMPANY, PARENT AND MERGER SUB WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAWS, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT. 

  

 Section 9.9 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties recognize and agree that if for any reason any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and irreparable harm or injury would be caused for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party agrees that, in addition to other remedies, prior to any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 under circumstances where a fee or expenses are payable pursuant to Section 8.2, any other party shall be entitled to an injunction (without posting a bond or other undertaking) restraining any violation or threatened violation of the provisions of this Agreement. In the event that any action shall be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no party shall allege, and each party hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law. 

   #####

 (d) To the extent this Agreement refers to information or documents having been made available (or delivered or provided) to Parent, the Company shall be deemed to have satisfied such obligation if the Company or its Representatives made such information or document available (or delivered or provided such information or document) to any officer of Parent or any of its Representatives.

 Section 9.11 _No Waiver of Rights_. No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder will impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor will any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. 

  

 Section 9.12 _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Facsimile signatures shall be acceptable and binding.
