ARTICLE II 

   

EFFECTS OF THE MERGERS ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE 
 CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES; COMPANY 
 STOCK OPTIONS 

  

 Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub: 

    

 (a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only issued and outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Merger Sub Owned Stock_. Any shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock, and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub, shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   

 (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b)) shall be converted into the right to receive (i) 0.4556 of a share of Parent Common Stock (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") and (ii) $24.00 in cash, without interest. The number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued, together with the amount of cash to be paid, pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) is referred to herein as the " _Merger Consideration_ ". As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right 

   ##### 

  

    

to receive the Merger Consideration (and any dividends in accordance with
Section 2.2(c) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock in accordance with Section 2.2(e)). 

   

 (d) At the effective time of the Second Merger, by virtue of the Second Merger and without any action on the part of the Surviving Corporation or Merger Sub 2: 

   

 (i) each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; 

   

 (ii) each share of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation that is held as a treasury share by the Surviving Corporation immediately prior to the effective time of the Second Merger shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; and 

   

 (iii) the membership interests of Merger Sub 2 immediately prior to the effective time of the Second Merger shall continue unchanged as a result of the Second Merger as the membership interests of the Surviving LLC from and after the effective time of the Second Merger. 

  

 Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates._  

    

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. On or promptly following the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit with such bank or trust company as may be designated by Parent (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for exchange in accordance with this Article II, through the Exchange Agent, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock and cash constituting the Merger Consideration (such shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto with a record date after the Effective Time, any cash payments in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, and cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ") payable and issuable pursuant to Section 2.1 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted pursuant to Section 2.1(c) into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be in such form and shall have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with 

   ##### 

  

    

such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions (and such other customary documents as may reasonably
be required by the Exchange Agent), the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefore a certificate or certificates
representing the number of full shares of Parent Common Stock and the amount
of cash into which the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificate or Certificates surrendered
shall have been converted pursuant to this Article II. The Exchange Agent
shall accept such Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. If any certificate for
such Parent Common Stock is to be issued in, or if cash is to be remitted to,
a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered for exchange is
registered, it shall be condition of such exchange that the Certificate
so surrendered shall be properly endorsed, with signature guaranteed, or
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
exchange shall pay to Parent or its transfer agent any transfer or other
taxes required by reason of the issuance of Certificates for such Parent
Common Stock in a name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction
of Parent or its transfer agent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2(b), each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration as
contemplated by Section 2.1. No interest will be paid or will accrue on cash
payable to a holder of a Certificate pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.2(e) until the holder of record of such Certificate surrenders such Certificate. Following surrender of such Certificate, in addition to the Merger Consideration payable and issuable pursuant to Section 2.1 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificate representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. 

   

 (d) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. The Merger Consideration issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid 

   ##### 

  

    

in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common
Stock previously represented by such Certificates, and at the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates that evidenced ownership
of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares,
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable law. Subject to the
last sentence of Section 2.2(g), if, at any time after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in
this Article II. 

   

 (e) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a shareholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount, less the amount of any withholding taxes which may be required thereon, equal to such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by the arithmetic average of the average daily high and low sales prices per share of Parent Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") during the ten trading days immediately preceding the date on which the Effective Time occurs. 

   

 (f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 (g) _Termination of Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for one hundred eighty (180) days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, in accordance with this Article II. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to such date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration shall become, to the 

   ##### 

  

    

extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent, free and clear of
all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (h) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (i) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be the property of, and shall be paid to, Parent. 

   

 (j) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be treated as though they withheld from the type of consideration from which withholding is required, an appropriate amount otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock in order to provide for such withholding obligation and such withheld amounts shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of the shares of Company Common Stock. 

  

 Section 2.3 _Company Stock Options._ At the Effective Time, all then outstanding options to purchase Company Common Stock under the Companys Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended (the " _Company Option Plan_ "), will be assumed by Parent in accordance with Section 5.10. 

   

 Section 2.4 _Adjustments._ Notwithstanding any provision of this Article II to the contrary (but without in any way limiting the covenants in Section 5.2(a)), if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of the occurrence or record date of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction.

 Section 4.5 _Parent SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities._

As of their respective effective dates (in the case of Parent SEC Documents that are registration statements filed pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act) and as of their respective SEC filing dates (in the case of all other Parent SEC Documents), the Parent SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as the case may be, applicable to such Parent SEC Documents, and none of the Parent SEC Documents as of such respective dates contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Except to the extent that information contained in any Parent SEC Document has been revised or superseded by a later-filed Parent SEC Document, none of the Parent SEC Documents contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 

   

 (b) The consolidated financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case 

   ##### 

  

    

of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated in the notes thereto) applied
on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries
as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and
cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited
quarterly statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments, none of which
has been or will be, individually or in the aggregate, material to Parent and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, with respect to each Annual Report on Form 10-K and each Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q included in the Parent SEC Documents, the financial
statements and other financial information included in such reports fairly
present (within the meaning of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) in
all material respects the financial condition and results of operations of
the Company as of, and for, the periods presented in such Parent SEC
Documents. 

   

 (c) None of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, whether known or unknown) required to be reflected or reserved against on a consolidated balance sheet of Parent prepared in accordance with GAAP or the notes thereto, except liabilities (i) as and to the extent reflected or reserved against on the audited balance sheet of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 (including the notes thereto) included in the Parent SEC Documents filed by Parent and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement or (ii) incurred after December 31, 2009 in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 Section 4.6 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events._ Since December 31, 2009 there have not been any events, changes, occurrences or state of facts that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 Section 4.7 _Brokers and Other Advisors._ Except for Credit Suisse, the fees and expenses of which will be paid by Parent, no broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any brokers, finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in connection with the Merger based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. 

   

 Section 4.8 _Reorganization Treatment._ Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their Affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Integrated Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. To Parents Knowledge, there are no agreements, plans or other circumstances that would reasonably be expected to prevent the Integrated Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

     ##### 

 

   

 Section 4.9 _Financing._ Parent has available sufficient cash, cash equivalents and access to financing in the aggregate to satisfy its obligations to permit Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger, including to pay the cash portion of the Merger Consideration.

The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, cause, facilitate or encourage (including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries or proposals that constitute, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations with any third party regarding any Takeover Proposal, (iii) accept a Takeover Proposal or enter into any agreement related to any Takeover Proposal or (iv) enter into any agreement that would require the Company to abandon the Merger or terminate this Agreement; _provided, however,_  that if after the date hereof the Board of Directors of the Company receives an unsolicited, bona fide written Takeover Proposal made after the date hereof in circumstances not involving a breach of this Agreement or any standstill agreement, and the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of a financial advisor of national recognized reputation) that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, and such Board determines in good faith (after considering applicable provisions of state law and after consulting with and receiving the advice of outside counsel) that failure to take the actions specified in clauses (A) or (B) of this Section 5.3(a) is reasonably likely to constitute a breach by such Board of its fiduciary duties to the Companys shareholders under applicable Law, then the Company may, at any time prior to obtaining the 

   ##### 

  

    

Company Shareholder Approval (but in no event after obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval) and after providing Parent not less than 24 hours
written notice of its intention to take such actions (A) furnish information
with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Takeover Proposal, but only after such Person enters into a customary
confidentiality agreement with the Company (which confidentiality agreement
must be no less favorable to the Company (i.e., no less restrictive with
respect to the conduct of such Person) than the Confidentiality Agreement),
provided that (1) such confidentiality agreement may not include any
provision calling for an exclusive right to negotiate with the Company and
may not restrict the Company from complying with this Section 5.3, and (2)
the Company delivers to Parent, concurrently with its delivery to
such Person, all such non-public information delivered to such Person not
previously provided to Parent, and (B) participate in discussions and
negotiations with such Person regarding such Takeover Proposal. Without
limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the foregoing
restrictions by the Companys Subsidiaries or Representatives shall be
deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.3 by the Company. The Company shall
provide Parent with a correct and complete copy of any confidentiality
agreement entered into pursuant to this paragraph within 24 hours of the
execution thereof. 

   

 (b) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this Section 5.3, the Company shall promptly advise Parent, orally and in writing, and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt, if any proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact is received by, any information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company in respect of any Takeover Proposal, and shall, in any such notice to Parent, indicate the identity of the Person making such proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact and the terms and conditions of any proposals or offers or the nature of any inquiries or contacts (and shall include with such notice copies of any written materials received from or on behalf of such Person relating to such proposal, offer, inquiry or request), and thereafter shall promptly keep Parent fully informed of all material developments affecting the status and terms of any such proposals, offers, inquiries or requests and of the status of any discussions or negotiations. 

   

 (c) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.3(c), neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation or the approval and adoption by such Board of Directors of this Agreement and the Merger, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal or (iii) cause or authorize the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, merger, acquisition, purchase or joint venture agreement or other agreement related to any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement in accordance with Section 5.3(a)) (any action described in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company may make 

   ##### 

  

    

a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (x) following receipt of any
Takeover Proposal made after the date hereof which the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and of its outside
counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal or (y) if a Parent Material Adverse
Effect has occurred, and, in the case of either (x) or (y), the Board
of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after considering
applicable provisions of state law and after consulting with and receiving
the advice of its outside counsel) that failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to constitute a breach by the Board of Directors of the
Company of its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company under
applicable Law; _provided, however,_ that no Company Adverse
Recommendation Change may be made (i) unless in response to a Superior
Proposal and (ii) until after the third business day following Parents
receipt of written notice (unless at the time such notice is otherwise
required to be given there are less than three (3) business days prior to the
Company Shareholders Meeting, in which case the Company shall provide as much
notice as is reasonably practicable) from the Company (a " _Company Adverse
Recommendation Notice_ ") advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the
Company intends to make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change and
specifying the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or other
material terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Company
Adverse Recommendation Notice and a new three (3) business day period (unless
at the time such notice is otherwise required to be given there are less than
three (3) business days prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting, in which
case the Company shall provide as much notice as is reasonably practicable)).
In determining whether to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to a Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company shall
take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed
by Parent (in response to a Company Adverse Recommendation Notice or
otherwise) in determining whether such third party Takeover Proposal still
constitutes a Superior Proposal (and the Company shall have negotiated in
good faith with Parent during such three (3) business day period (to the
extent Parent desires to negotiate) with respect to such changes to the terms
of this Agreement proposed by Parent). The Company shall keep confidential
any proposals made by Parent to revise the terms of this Agreement. 

   

 (d) For purposes of this Agreement: 

   

 " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, relating to any (i) direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions) of assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including securities of Subsidiaries) equal to 20% or more of the Companys consolidated assets or to which 20% or more of the Companys revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable, (ii) direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of related 

   ##### 

  

    

transactions) of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Section 13 under
the Exchange Act) of 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the
Company, (iii) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
result in any Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act) beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the
Company or (iv) merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; in each case, other than
the Merger. 

   

 " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written offer, obtained after the date hereof and not in breach of this Agreement or any standstill agreement, to acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, more than 70% of the equity securities of the Company or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, made by a third party, which is on terms and conditions which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in its good faith and reasonable judgment (after considering applicable provisions of state law and after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of national reputation) to be more favorable to the Companys shareholders from a financial point of view than the Merger, taking into account at the time of determination any changes to the terms of this Agreement that as of that time had been proposed by Parent in writing, and which is reasonably likely to be completed, taking into account any approval requirements and all other financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal, and for which financing, if a cash transaction (whether in whole or in part), is then fully committed or reasonably determined to be available by the Board of Directors of the Company. 

   

 (e) Nothing in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit the Board of Directors of the Company from taking and disclosing to the Companys shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act if such Board determines in good faith, after considering applicable provisions of state law and after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to so disclose such position would constitute a violation of applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall the Company or its Board of Directors or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action prohibited by Section 5.3(c); _provided, further_ , that any such disclosure made pursuant to this Section 5.3(e) with respect to a Takeover Proposal (other than a communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Board of Directors of the Company expressly reaffirms its recommendation that the shareholders of the Company approve and adopt this Agreement in such communication. 

  

 Section 5.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts._  

    

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including Section 5.4(d)), each of the parties hereto shall cooperate with the other parties

proper or advisable to cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as
promptly as practicable and to consummate and make effective, in the most

 (c) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger (including, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, providing copies of all such documents to the outside antitrust counsel of the other parties prior to the submission of the filing or application and considering all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith) and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating to the Merger, including any proceeding 

   ##### 

  

    

initiated by a private party, and (ii) keep the other party informed in all
material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any material
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the
Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice, or any other Governmental Authority and of any
material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by
a private party, in each case regarding the Merger. The parties shall consult
with each other prior to any meetings, by telephone or in person, with any
Governmental Authority regarding the transactions contemplated hereby, and
shall provide each other the right to have a representative present at any
such meeting to the extent appropriate or permitted by the Governmental
Authority. 

   

 (d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in this Section 5.4, each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by a Governmental Authority or other Person with respect to the Merger.

Any `proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting any divestiture, sale, disposition, hold separate, or limitation on freedom of action with regard to any aspect of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be subject to and conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger.

 Section 5.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality._  

    

 (a) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and Parents Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to all of the Companys and its Subsidiaries commitments, books, Contracts, records and correspondence (in each case, whether in physical or electronic form), officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other Representatives and the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent (i) a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed or submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirements of Federal or state securities Laws to the extent not available to the public through the SECs EDGAR system (and the Company shall deliver to Parent a copy of each report, schedule and other document proposed to be filed or submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirements of Federal securities Laws not less than five (5) business days prior to such filing) and a copy of any communication (including "comment letters") received by the Company from the SEC concerning compliance with securities Laws and (ii) all other information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries businesses, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request. Except for disclosures permitted by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of April 1, 2010, between Parent and the Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), Parent and its Representatives shall hold information received from the Company pursuant to this Section 5.6 in confidence in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. 

   

 (b) Subject to the conditions in Section 5.6(a), (i) access for Parent and its Representatives shall include access to all material environmentally related audits, studies, reports, analyses and results of investigations performed with respect to the currently or previously owned, leased or operated properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) Parent and its Representatives shall have the right to conduct (or cause an environmental consultant to conduct) Phase I Environmental Site Assessments and compliance audits at any real property owned, operated or leased by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, subject to any restrictions imposed in current leases, and the Company shall cooperate in connection therewith.

      ##### 

  

    

otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the
Merger, (c) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence
or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which,
would cause any representation or warranty made by such party contained in
this Agreement (i) that is qualified as to materiality or Material
Adverse Effect to be untrue and (ii) that is not so qualified to be untrue in
any material respect, and (d) any material failure of such party to comply
with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by
it hereunder; _provided, however,_ that the delivery of any notice pursuant

any other provision of this Agreement or (B) limit the remedies available to
the party receiving such notice. Any failure to give notice pursuant to this
Section 5.7 shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 5.7
or the failure of any condition set forth in Article VI or
otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement, unless the underlying matter
requiring notice would independently result in a failure of a condition set
forth in Article VI to be satisfied. 

   

 Section 5.8 _Indemnification and Insurance._  

    

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving LLC shall indemnify the individuals who at or prior to the Effective Time were directors or officers of the Company or any its Subsidiaries or who is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of, or in any other fiduciary capacity with respect to, any Company Plan or any other Person (collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time prior to the Effective Time, to the fullest extent (i) required by the Company Charter Documents as in effect on the date of this Agreement and (ii) permitted under applicable Law. An Indemnitee shall notify Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving LLC in writing promptly upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding, investigation or other matter in respect of which such indemnification may be sought. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving LLC shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assume and control the defense of, including the investigation of, and corrective action required to be undertaken in response to, any litigation, claim or proceeding (each, a " _Claim_ ") relating to any acts or omissions covered under this Section 5.8 with counsel reasonably selected by it (and, if Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving LLC shall have assumed such defense, they shall not be liable for the fees or expenses of any separate counsel retained by the Indemnitee);  _provided, however,_ that the Indemnitee shall be permitted to participate in the defense of such Claim at his or her own expense. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event shall Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving LLC be liable for any settlement or compromise effected without its written consent. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving LLC, and the Indemnitees shall cooperate in the defense of any Claim and shall furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 (b) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the individuals serving as officers and directors of the Company or any its Subsidiaries or who is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer, or in any other fiduciary capacity with respect to, any Company Plan or any other Person immediately prior to the Effective Time who are then covered by the directors and officers liability insurance policy currently maintained by the Company (a correct and complete copy of which has heretofore been delivered to Parent) to be covered for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time by such policy (provided that Parent may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous in any material respect than such policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time that were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as such; _provided_ , that in no event shall Parent be required to expend per year of coverage more than 300% of the amount currently expended by the Company per year of coverage as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ ") to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto. If notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts to do so, Parent is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this paragraph, Parent shall obtain as much comparable insurance as available for the Maximum Amount. The Indemnitees may be required to make reasonable application and provide reasonable and customary representations and warranties to applicable insurance carriers for the purpose of obtaining such insurance. 

   

 (c) The Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.8 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.8. The provisions of this Section 5.8 are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and his or her heirs.

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as may be necessary such that at the Effective Time each option (" _Option_ ") to acquire Company Common Stock outstanding after the Effective Time under the Company Option Plan, whether or not then exercisable, shall be converted into and become a right with respect to Parent Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, (i) each Option assumed by Parent may be exercised solely for Parent Common Stock, (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) subject to each Option shall be equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously subject to such Option and (B) the amount determined by adding (y) the Exchange Ratio and (z) the quotient obtained by dividing $24.00 by the closing price per share of Parent Common Stock on the NYSE on the trading day preceding the Closing Date, rounded up to the nearest whole cent (the " _Cash Equivalent_ "), and (iii) the per share exercise price for each Option shall be equal 

   ##### 

  

    

to the exercise price per share for the shares of Company Common Stock
previously purchasable pursuant to such Option divided by the amount obtained
by adding the Exchange Ratio and the Cash Equivalent; _provided, however,_
that in the case of any Option which is an "incentive stock option," as
defined under Section 422 of the Code, the exercise price, the number of
shares purchasable pursuant to such Option and the terms and conditions
of exercise of such Option shall be determined in a manner consistent with
Section 424(a) of the Code and, in the case of all Options, a manner
satisfying the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. The Options shall be
subject to the same terms and conditions (including expiration date and
exercise provisions) as were applicable to the corresponding options with
respect to Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time. At or
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall make all necessary
arrangements with respect to the Company Option Plans and the Options to
permit the assumption of unexercised Options by Parent pursuant to this
Section 5.10. 

   

 (b) Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall assume each Option in accordance with the terms of the Company Option Plan and the stock option agreement by which it is evidenced. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of all Options assumed by it in accordance with this Section 5.10. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-3 or Form S-8 or any successor or other appropriate form with respect to the  shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such Options. Parent shall use all reasonable efforts to maintain the current status of such registration statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such Options remain outstanding. 

  

 Section 5.11 _Securityholder Litigation._ The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any securityholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the Merger, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent. 

   

 Section 5.12 _Fees and Expenses._ Except as provided in Section 7.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated. 

   

 Section 5.13 _Rule 16b-3._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall take such steps as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance with that certain No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC regarding such matters. 

       ##### 

  

     

 Section 5.14 _Reorganization Matters._ The parties hereto shall cooperate and use their commercially reasonable efforts in obtaining the opinion of tax counsel to Parent, for the benefit of Parent, and the tax counsel to the Company, for the benefit of the Companys Board of Directors, and to deliver to Parents and the Companys respective tax counsels a certificate containing representations reasonably requested by such counsels in connection with rendering of any opinion to be issued by such counsel dated as of the Closing Date to the effect that the Integrated Merger will qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. Parents and the Companys respective tax counsels shall be entitled to rely upon such representations in rendering any such opinions. None of Parent, Merger Sub, Merger Sub 2, or the Company shall take or cause to be taken any action which would cause to be untrue (or fail to take or cause to be taken any action which would cause to be untrue) any of such certificates and representations. Parent, Merger Sub, Merger Sub 2 and the Company shall, and shall cause any direct or indirect transferee of property from any of the foregoing, to agree to elect to apply the provisions of Temporary Regulations Section 1.368-IT(e)(2) as required by Notice 2010-25 and not adopt any treatment of U.S. federal income tax purposes inconsistent with such election. 

   

 Section 5.15 _Retention Pool_. Parent shall establish a retention pool in an amount of approximately $7,000,000 (the " _Retention Pool_ ") to make payments to eligible individuals set forth in Section 5.15 of the Company Disclosure Schedule who remain employees of the Surviving LLC or any Affiliate of the Surviving LLC for a period of no less than six (6) months following the Effective Time (the " _Retention Period_ "), except that an eligible individual terminated by or caused to be terminated by the Surviving LLC or any Affiliate of the Surviving LLC without cause during the Retention Period shall be eligible to retain the initial payment and receive the subsequent payment from the Retention Pool. One half of the amounts awarded under the Retention Pool shall be paid promptly after the Effective Time and one half of the amounts awarded under the Retention Pool shall be paid at the end of the Retention Period to eligible individuals, subject to the requirement that an eligible individual who ceases to be an employee of the Surviving LLC or any Affiliate of the Surviving LLC during the Retention Period, except if terminated or caused to be terminated by the Parent without cause, shall no longer be eligible to receive the payment due at the end of the Retention Period and shall repay the Parent an amount determined by multiplying the payment that eligible individual received from the Retention Pool at the Effective Time by a fraction, the numerator of which is 182 minus the number of days the eligible employee remained an employee of the Surviving LLC or any Affiliate of the Surviving LLC and the denominator of which is 182.

 Section 7.1 _Termination._ This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time: (a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent duly authorized by each of their respective Boards of Directors; or (b) by either of the Company or Parent: (i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before the Walk-Away Date;  _provided, however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b)(i) shall not be available to a party if the failure of the Merger to have been consummated on or before the Walk-Away Date was primarily due to the failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement; (ii) if any final, non-appealable Restraint having the effect set forth in Section 6.1(c) shall be in effect; or (iii) if the Company Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the Company Shareholders Meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment or postponement thereof; _provided, however,_ that the right of the Company to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b)(iii) shall not be available to it if it has failed to comply in all material respects with its obligations under Section 5.1 or 5.3; or (c) by Parent: (i) if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement (or if any of the representations or warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall fail to be true), which breach or failure (A) would (if it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or 6.2(b) and (B) is incapable of being cured, or is not cured by the Company, prior to the earlier of (x) the thirtieth (30th ) calendar day following receipt of written notice from Parent of such breach or failure and (y) the Walk-Away Date; (ii) if (A) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred, (B) the Companys Board of Directors shall have failed to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within seven (7) business days after a Takeover Proposal (or a material amendment to a Takeover Proposal) shall have been made public (or any person shall have publicly announced a bone fide intention, whether or not conditioned, to make a Takeover Proposal or material amendment thereto) and receipt of any written request to so reaffirm from Parent, or (C) prior to the Company Shareholder Approval having been obtained, a willful and material breach (x) by the Company of Section 5.3 shall have occurred, or (y) by the Company of the first sentence of Section 5.1(b) shall have occurred; or (iii) if there shall have occurred any events or changes that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; or (d) by the Company, if (i) Parent shall have breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement (or if any of the representations or warranties of Parent set forth in this Agreement shall fail to be true), which breach or failure (A) would (if it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) or 6.3(b) and (B) is incapable of being cured, or is not cured by Parent, prior to the earlier of (x) the thirtieth (30th) calendar day following receipt of written 

      ##### 

  

    

notice from the Company of such breach or failure and (y) the Walk-Away Date;
or (ii) at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval,
if the Company is simultaneously entering into a definitive agreement to
effect a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , that in order for the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(d)(ii) to be effective, (x) the
Company and its Board of Directors shall have complied with the procedures
and obligations set forth in Section 5.3(c) with respect to such Superior
Proposal and (y) the Company shall have paid the Termination Fee in
accordance with Section 7.3. 

   

 Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination._ In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, written notice thereof shall be given to the other party or parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void (other than the provisions of the first sentence of Section 3.18, the last sentence of Section 5.6(a), Section 5.13 and this Article VII, all of which shall survive termination of this Agreement), and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Merger Sub 2, or the Company or their respective directors, officers and Affiliates, except (a) the Company may have liability as provided in Section 7.3, and (b) nothing shall relieve any party from liability for fraud or any willful breach of this Agreement. 

   

 Section 7.3 _Termination Fee._  

    

 (a) In the event that: 

   

 (i) (A) a Takeover Proposal shall have been made known to the Company or shall have been made directly to its shareholders generally or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional or withdrawn) to make a Takeover Proposal and thereafter, (B) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) or Section 7.1(b)(iii), and (C) the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to or consummates a transaction contemplated by such Takeover Proposal or any other Takeover Proposal within twelve (12) months of the date this Agreement is terminated; 

   

 (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i) and the Companys breach or failure triggering such termination shall have been a material and willful breach of, or failure to comply with, the Companys obligations under Section 5.1 or 5.3; 

   

 (iii) (A) a Takeover Proposal shall have been made known to the Company or shall have been made directly to its shareholders generally or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional or withdrawn) to make a Takeover Proposal and thereafter, (B) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i) in circumstances not covered by Section 7.3(a)(ii), and the Companys breach or failure triggering such termination shall have 

   ##### 

  

    

been willful, and (C) the Company enters into a definitive agreement
with respect to, or consummates, a transaction contemplated by such Takeover
Proposal or any other Takeover Proposal within twelve (12) months of the date
this Agreement is terminated; 

   

 (iv) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii); or 

   

 (v) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii); 

   

then in any such event under clause (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of this
Section 7.3(a), the Company shall pay to Parent a termination fee of thirty-
one million dollars ($31,000,000) in cash (the " _Termination Fee_ "). 

   

 (b) Any payment required to be made pursuant to Sections 7.3(a)(i) or 7.3(a)(iii) shall be made to Parent promptly following the earlier of the execution of a definitive agreement with respect to, or the consummation of, any transaction contemplated by a Takeover Proposal (and in any event not later than two (2) business days after delivery to the Company of notice of demand for payment); any payment required to be made pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(iv) shall be made to Parent promptly following termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii) (and in any event not later than two (2) business days after delivery to the Company of notice of demand for payment); any payment required to be made pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(ii) shall be made to Parent promptly following termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i) in the circumstances described in Section 7.3(a)(ii) (and in any event not later than two (2) business days after delivery to the Company of notice of demand for payment). All such payments shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account to be designated by Parent and any payment required to be made pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(v) shall be made to Parent prior to, and as a condition precedent to the effectiveness of, such termination by the Company. 

   

 (c) In the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Termination Fee required pursuant to this Section 7.3 when due, such fee shall accrue interest for the period commencing on the date such fee became past due, at a rate equal to the rate of interest publicly announced by PNC Bank in the City of Pittsburgh from time to time during such period, as such banks Prime Lending Rate plus 5%. In addition, if the Company shall fail to pay such fee when due, the Company shall also pay to Parent all of Parents costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with efforts to collect such fee. The Company acknowledges that the Termination Fee and the other provisions of this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree that in the event of a breach of this Agreement, the payment of the Termination Fee shall not constitute the exclusive remedy 

   ##### 

  

    

available to Parent, and that Parent shall be entitled to the remedies set
forth in Section 8.8, including injunction and specific performance, and all
additional and other remedies available at law or in equity to which Parent
may be entitled; provided, however, that, in the event that the Termination
Fee becomes payable and is paid by the Company pursuant to this Section 7.3,
the Termination Fee shall be Parents, Merger Subs and Merger Sub 2s sole
and exclusive remedy under this Agreement. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company shall be obligated, subject to the terms of this Section 7.3, to pay only one Termination Fee. 

  

ARTICLE VIII 

   

MISCELLANEOUS 

  

 Section 8.1 _No Survival, Etc._ Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the representations, warranties and agreements of each party hereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any other party hereto, any Person controlling any such party or any of their officers, directors or representatives, whether prior to or after the execution of this Agreement, and no information provided or made available shall be deemed to be disclosed in this Agreement or in the Company Disclosure Schedule, except to the extent actually set forth herein or therein. The representations, warranties and agreements in this Agreement shall terminate at the Effective Time or, except as otherwise provided in Section 7.2, upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, as the case may be, except that certain of the agreements set forth in Article II and Article V and any other agreement in this Agreement which contemplates performance after the Effective Time shall survive the Effective Time indefinitely and those set forth in Sections 5.12, 7.2 and 7.3 and this Article VIII shall survive termination indefinitely. The Confidentiality Agreement shall (a) survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and (b) terminate as of the Effective Time. 

   

 Section 8.2 _Amendment or Supplement._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects, whether before or after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, by written agreement of the parties hereto, by action taken by their respective Boards of Directors; _provided, however_ , that following approval of the Merger by the shareholders of the Company, there shall be no amendment or change to the provisions hereof which by Law would require further approval by the shareholders of the Company without such approval. 

   

 Section 8.3 _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other party hereto, (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of any other party hereto or (c) waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements contained herein or, except as 

      ##### 

  

    

otherwise provided herein, waive any of such partys conditions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub or Merger Sub 2 in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as
a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right
hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of such party. 

   

 Section 8.4 _Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that Merger Sub or Merger Sub 2 may assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to any direct, wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Merger Sub or Merger Sub 2 of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this Section 8.4 shall be null and void. 

   

 Section 8.5 _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties. 

   

 Section 8.6 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries._ This Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Confidentiality Agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and (b) except for the provisions of Section 5.8, are not intended to and shall not confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. 

   

 Section 8.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial._  

    

 (a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed entirely within that State, without regard to any applicable conflicts of laws principles, except to the extent that the application of the WBCL or federal securities laws is mandatory. 

   

 (b) All actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware or any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and, in the case of appeals, appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such action or proceeding and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum to the 

   ##### 

  

    

maintenance of any such action or proceeding. The consents to jurisdiction set
forth in this paragraph shall not constitute general consents to service of
process in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose
except as provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights
on any Person other than the parties hereto. The parties hereto agree that a
final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may
be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by applicable law. 

   

 (c) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives any and all rights to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement. 

  

 Section 8.8 _Specific Enforcement._ The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware or any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, without bond or other security being required, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. 

   

 Section 8.9 _Notices._ All notices, requests and other communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally, facsimiled (which is confirmed) or sent by overnight courier (providing proof of delivery) to the parties at the following addresses:

The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". The words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.

Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein. References to a Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns.
