_Sections 5.3(c)_ and _5.3(d)_ at the times specified therein shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect the payments made pursuant to this _Section
5.3(f)_.

Power) and _Section 8.17_ (Tax Matters), and the representations
and warranties in _Section 9.1_ (Organization and Power) and _Section
9.2_ (Authorization), shall terminate when the applicable statutes of
limitations with respect to the liabilities in question expire (after giving
effect to any extensions or waivers thereof), plus ninety (90) days;

  

### 

  

### (b) the representations and warranties in _Section 8.13_ (Compliance with
Laws) and _Section 8.14_ (Environmental Matters) shall terminate on the
date that is the three year anniversary of the Closing Date; and

### (c) all other representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any
writing delivered by any party to another party in connection with this
Agreement shall terminate on the Indemnity Escrow Release Date;

 _provided_   _that_ any representation or warranty in respect of which
indemnity may be sought under _Section 11.2_ below, and the indemnity with
respect thereto, shall survive the time at which it would otherwise terminate

thereof giving rise to such right of indemnity (including a reasonable
estimate of the amount of Losses which the notifying party may suffer,
sustain or become subject to, as a result of, in connection with or by virtue
of such breach, or if the notifying party is unable to determine a reasonable
estimate thereof, a statement to such effect) shall have been given in

good faith to the party against whom such indemnity may be sought prior to
such time (regardless of when the Losses in respect thereof may actually be
incurred).

  



  

## 11.2 _Indemnification_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Each Company Shareholder, severally in proportion to its Pro Rata
Share and not jointly, agrees to and shall indemnify Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and their respective Affiliates, stockholders, officers,
directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, the "
_Buyer Parties_ ") and save and hold each of them harmless against any loss,
liability, claim, damage or expense (including interest, penalties,
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses and all reasonable amounts paid in
investigation, defense or settlement of any of the foregoing) (collectively,
" _Losses_ "), which any such Buyer Party may suffer, sustain or become
subject to, as a result of, in connection with or by virtue of: (1) any
breach by the Company of any representation or warranty made by the Company
in this Agreement or in any of the certificates or other instruments or
documents furnished by the Company pursuant to this Agreement (including the
certificate contemplated by _Section 6.1(n)(i)_ hereof); (2) any non-
fulfillment or breach by the Company of any covenant or agreement required to
be performed by the Company under this Agreement; (3) any Distribution
Errors; or (4) any of the matters set forth on the _Indemnification Schedule_
attached hereto; provided that:

  

### 

  

#### (i) the Company Shareholders shall not have any liability under clause
(1) of this _Section 11.2(a)_ (other than with respect to the Fundamental
Representations) unless the aggregate of all Losses relating thereto for
which the Company Shareholders would, but for this proviso, be liable exceeds
on a cumulative basis an amount equal to $850,000.00 (the " _Deductible
Amount_ "), and then the Company Shareholders shall only be liable for all
such Losses in excess of the Deductible Amount; _provided_ _that_ no claim
for indemnification by any Buyer Party arising under _Section 11.2(a)(1)_
(other than with respect to the Fundamental Representations) shall be
asserted where the amount that would otherwise be payable by the
Company Shareholders hereunder relating to such claim is less than $10,000;

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) the Company Shareholders aggregate liability under clause (1) of
this _Section 11.2(a)_ (other than with respect to the Fundamental
Representations or in connection with any action or claim based upon fraud)
shall in no event exceed $10,000,000.00 (with it being understood, however,
that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the maximum
aggregate liability of any Company Shareholder for any Losses arising under
this Agreement or the Related Agreement (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any Losses arising with respect to any breach of any Related
Representation) shall be the amount of the aggregate proceeds actually
received by such Company Shareholder in connection herewith); and

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) the Company Shareholders shall not have any liability under clause
(3) of this _Section 11.2(a)_ unless written notice of the events giving rise
to such right of indemnity (including a reasonable estimate of the amount of
Losses which the notifying party may suffer, sustain or become subject to, as
a result of, in connection with or by virtue of such breach, or if the
notifying party is unable to determine a reasonable estimate thereof, a
statement to such effect) is given in good faith to the Shareholders
Representative prior to the Indemnity Escrow Release Date.

  

#### 

  

Each Company Shareholder (for itself and not for any other Company
Shareholder) agrees to and shall indemnify the Buyer Parties and save and
hold each of them harmless against any Losses which any such Buyer Party may
suffer, sustain or become subject to, as a result of, in connection with or
by virtue of: (1) any breach by such Company Shareholder of any Related
Representation; or (2) any non-fulfillment or breach by such Company
Shareholder of any covenant or agreement required to be performed by him or
it under this Agreement or the Related Agreement.

  



  

### (b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation agree to and shall indemnify the
Company Shareholders and their respective Affiliates, stockholders,
officers, directors, employees, agents, successors

  

### 

  

### 28      
   

### 

  

### and assigns (collectively, the " _Seller Parties_ ") and hold them
harmless against any Losses which the Seller Parties may suffer, sustain or
become subject to, as a result of, in connection with or by virtue of: (1)
any breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any representation or warranty made by
Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement or in any of the certificates or other
instruments or documents furnished by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this
Agreement (including the certificate contemplated by _Section 6.2(f)(i)_
 hereof); or (2) any non-fulfillment or breach by Parent or Merger Sub of
any covenant or agreement required to be performed by Parent or Merger Sub
under this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (c) Any indemnification of the Buyer Parties or the Seller Parties
pursuant to this _Section 11.2_ shall be effected by wire transfer of
immediately available funds from one or more of the indemnifying parties to
an account designated by the applicable Buyer Party or Seller Party, as the
case may be, within ten days after the determination thereof. Any such
indemnification payments shall include interest at the Applicable
Rate calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over 365,
from the date any such Loss is suffered or sustained to the date of payment.
Any amounts owing from any Company Shareholder(s) pursuant to this _Section
11.2_ (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any amounts owing with respect
to Losses related to any breach of any Related Representation) or _Section
11.6_ shall first be made to the extent possible from the Indemnity Escrow
Account (but not the Purchase Price Escrow Account) and thereafter shall be
made directly by the Company Shareholder(s) in accordance with the terms of
this _Section 11.2(c)_. All indemnification payments made pursuant to this
_Section 11.2_ shall be deemed adjustments to the purchase price.

  

### 

  

### (d) Any Person making a claim for indemnification under this _Section
11.2_ (an " _Indemnitee_ ") shall notify the indemnifying party (an "
_Indemnitor_ ") of the claim in writing within fifteen (15) business days
after receiving written notice of any action, lawsuit, proceeding,
investigation or other claim against it (if by a third party), describing the
claim, the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable) and the basis thereof;
provided that the failure to so notify an Indemnitor shall not relieve the
Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that such
failure shall have caused the damages for which the Indemnitor is obligated
to be greater than such damages would have been had the Indemnitee given the
Indemnitor prompt notice hereunder. Any Indemnitor shall be entitled
to participate in the defense of such action, lawsuit, proceeding,
investigation or other claim giving rise to an Indemnitees claim for
indemnification at such Indemnitors expense, and at its option (subject to
the limitations set forth below) shall be entitled to assume the defense
thereof by appointing counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee to be
the lead counsel in connection with such defense; provided that, prior to the
Indemnitor assuming control of such defense it shall first verify to the
Indemnitee in writing that such Indemnitor shall be responsible (with no
reservation of any rights) for all liabilities and obligations relating to
such claim for indemnification (subject to the dollar limitations otherwise
set forth in _Section 11.2(a)(i)_ and _Section 11.2(a)(ii)_ herein) and that
it shall provide indemnification (subject to the dollar limitations otherwise
set forth in _Section 11.2(a)(i)_ and _Section 11.2(a)(ii)_ herein) to the
Indemnitee with respect to such action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or
other claim giving rise to such claim for indemnification hereunder; and
provided further, that:

  

### 

  

##### (A) the Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
such claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose; provided
that the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the
Indemnitee (other than any reasonable fees and expenses of such separate
counsel that are incurred prior to the date the Indemnitor effectively
assumes control of such defense which, notwithstanding the foregoing, shall
be borne by the Indemnitor, and except that the Indemnitor shall pay all of
the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel if the Indemnitee
has been reasonably advised by its counsel that a reasonable likelihood
exists of a conflict of interest between the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee);

  

##### 

  

##### (B) the Indemnitor shall not be entitled to assume control of such
defense and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by
the Indemnitee if (1) the claim for indemnification relates to or arises in
connection with any criminal or quasi-criminal proceeding, action,
indictment, allegation or investigation; (2) the claim primarily seeks an
injunction

  

##### 

  

##### 29      
   

##### 

  

##### or equitable relief against the Indemnitee; (3) the Indemnitee has been
reasonably advised by its counsel in writing that a reasonable likelihood
exists of a conflict of interest between the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee;
or (4) upon petition by the Indemnitee, the appropriate court rules that the
Indemnitor failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend such claim;
and

  

##### 

  

##### (C) if the Indemnitor shall control the defense of any such claim, the
Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitee before
entering into any settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend such claim if,
pursuant to or as a result of such settlement or cessation, injunctive or
other equitable relief will be imposed against the Indemnitee or if such
settlement does not expressly and unconditionally release the Indemnitee from
all liabilities and obligations with respect to such claim, without
prejudice.

  

##### 

  

### (e) The amount of damages for which any Person may be liable under this
_Section 11.2_ shall be the net amount of the damages suffered by the Buyer
Parties or the Seller Parties, as the case may be, after deducting (i) all
insurance proceeds, if any, actually received by the applicable Buyer Party
or Seller Party, as the case may be, less any increase in the annual premiums
to such Person as a result of such claim for insurance proceeds in the
immediately succeeding year, and (ii) any net Tax benefits actually received
by the Indemnitee with respect to Loss being indemnified.

  

### 

  

### (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, for
purposes of the indemnification provisions in this _Section 11.2_ , the
determination of (i) whether any representation or warranty has been
breached, and (ii) the amount of any Losses with respect to any such breach,
shall be made without giving effect to any "Material Adverse Effect"
qualification or any materiality qualification contained in the
representations or warranties herein, except for the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section 8.5_ (Financial Statements; Accounts
Receivable), _Section 8.7_ (No Material Adverse Effect) and _Section 8.22_
(Accuracy of Written Due Diligence Materials) for which such qualifications
shall be given effect.

  

### 

  

### (g) Subject to the terms of _Section 12.11(e)_ , except for claims of
fraud, the indemnities provided in this _Section 11.2_ shall be the exclusive
remedy of the parties (including the Buyer Parties and the Seller Parties) in
respect of the matters covered by this Agreement and the Related Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (h) The Company Shareholders and their Affiliates will have no claims or
rights to contribution or indemnity from the Surviving Corporation with
respect to any claims made by the Buyer Parties or amounts paid by any of the
Company Shareholders or their Affiliates pursuant to this Section 11.2 of the
Merger Agreement. The Company Shareholders and their Affiliates will have no
claims or rights to contribution or indemnity from the officers or directors
of the Surviving Corporation with respect to any amounts paid by any of them
pursuant to this Section 11.2 if such claims or rights would require the
Surviving Corporation to indemnify the directors or officers.

  

### 

  

## 11.3 _Press Release and Announcements_. After the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation may issue any press releases, announcements to the employees,
customers or suppliers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other
releases of information related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby as it may deem appropriate without the consent of any
other party hereto.

  

## 

  

## 11.4 _Expenses_.  Except as otherwise provided herein, Parent and Merger
Sub shall pay all of their own fees, costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the negotiation of this Agreement, the performance of their
obligations hereunder and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby (it being understood, however, that one-half of all filing and
notification fees in connection with the HSR Act have been paid by Parent,
and one-half of all filing and notification fees in connection with the HSR
Act have been paid by the Company). The Company Shareholders shall pay all
of their own, and (severally in proportion to their Pro Rata Share and not
jointly) all of the Companys and its Subsidiaries fees, costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement,
the performance of their obligations hereunder and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, "Company Expenses"). Any
Company

  



  

30      
   



  

## Expenses which are in fact paid by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including
the Surviving Corporation) from and after the Closing shall, without
duplication, be included in current liabilities for purposes of the
calculation of Net Working Capital.

  



  

## 11.5 _Further Assurances_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, the Company
Shareholders, Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their Affiliates
to, execute and deliver such further instruments of conveyance and transfer
and take such additional action as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably
request to effect, consummate, confirm or evidence the Merger.

  



  

## 11.6 _Certain Tax Matters_. The following provisions shall govern
the allocation of responsibility as between Parent and the Surviving
Corporation, on the one hand, and the Company Shareholders, on the other, for
certain Tax matters following the Closing:

  



  

### (a) The Company Shareholders, severally in proportion to their Pro Rata
Share and not jointly, shall indemnify each Buyer Party and save and hold
each of them harmless against (i) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of
the Company and its Subsidiaries for all Taxable periods ending on or before
the Closing Date and the portion through the end of the Closing Date for any
Taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (" _Pre-
Closing Tax Period_ "), (ii) any and all Taxes of any member of an Affiliated
Group of which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or was a member on
or before the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulation
§1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local, or foreign law or
regulation, and (iii) any and all Taxes of any Person (other than the Company
and its Subsidiaries) imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any law, rule
or regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring before
the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of clauses (i),
(ii) and (iii) above, the Company Shareholders shall be liable only to the
extent that such Taxes are in excess of the amount, if any, reserved for such
Taxes (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect
timing differences between book and Tax income) on the face of the Closing
Statement and taken into account in determining the final purchase price.
Subject to the penultimate sentence of Section 11.2(c) hereof, the Company
Shareholders shall reimburse Parent for any Taxes which are the
responsibility of the Company Shareholders pursuant to this  _Section 11.6(a_
) within ten (10) business days after payment of such Taxes by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation.

  

### 

  

### (b) In the case of any Taxable period that includes (but does not end on)
the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the amount of any Taxes based on
or measured by income or receipts for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date, and the amount of other Taxes for a Straddle
Period which relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire Taxable period multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days in the Taxable period ending on
the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number of days in such
Straddle Period.

  

### 

  

### (c) The Surviving Corporation shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
file or caused to be filed all Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Tax Periods for
the Company and its Subsidiaries which are filed after the Closing Date. The
Surviving Corporation shall permit Shareholders Representative a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on each such Tax Return (including any
amended Tax Return) prior to filing and shall make such reasonable revisions
to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by Shareholders
Representative.

  

### 

  

### (d) The Surviving Corporation and the Shareholders Representative (on
behalf of the Company Shareholders) shall cooperate with each other in
connection with the filing of any Tax Returns (including any amended Tax
Return) and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes.

  

### 

  

### (e) All Tax-sharing agreements or similar agreements with respect to or
involving the Company and any of its Subsidiaries shall be terminated as of
the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date,

  

### 

  

### 31      
   

### 

  

### neither Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor any of their Subsidiaries
shall be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

  

### 

  

### (f) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other
such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the Company Shareholders when
due, and the Company Shareholders shall, at their own expense, file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and
fees, and, if required by applicable law, the Surviving Corporation will, and
will cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns
and other documentation.

  

### 

  

### (g) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof to the contrary, if (x)
the Company Shareholders provide indemnification under this _Section 11.6_ in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 11.2(c)_ , and (y) Fleet National
Bank, a national banking association (" _Fleet_ "), may (in the good faith
judgment of the Shareholders Representative) be liable or responsible for
such Tax liability(ies) pursuant to Article IX of the Stock Purchase
Agreement, dated as of February 8, 2001, between Fleet and the Company, and
joined in for limited purposes, by Endeavour Capital Fund III, L.P.,
Endeavour Associates Fund III, L.P., and Shawmut Equity Partners, L.P, as
amended (the " _Fleet Purchase Agreement_ "), then Parent shall take all such
actions as are reasonably necessary to permit the Shareholders
Representative to (at its option and at the sole expense of the Company
Shareholders) pursue, by, on behalf of and in the name of the Surviving
Corporation but for the benefit of the Company Shareholders, any claim or
remedy that is or may be available to the Surviving Corporation under the
2001 Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (h) The parties hereto agree that a Tax deduction should arise from the
accelerated vesting or disposition of capital stock of the Company and Vested
Company Options held by the Persons identified on Schedule 11.6(h) in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that
neither the Company nor the Company Shareholders are providing any
representation, warranty or indemnification (including pursuant to _Section
8.17_ , _Section 11.2_ , this _Section 11.6_ or the Related Agreement) with
respect to the availability or timing of any such deduction (including the
failure (i) of the Company or the Surviving Corporation to claim any such
deduction at any time, or (ii) of the Company to withhold any Taxes required
to be withheld with respect to income upon vesting or disposition at any time
prior to (1) consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, or (2) the
accelerated vesting or disposition of the capital stock of the Company and
Vested Company Options in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby).

  



  

## 11.7 _Appointment of Shareholders  Representative_.

  



  

### (a) Each of the Company Shareholders and the Company (on behalf of the
Company Shareholders) hereby designates Endeavour Capital Fund III, L.P., a
Delaware limited partnership, as the exclusive representative and agent of
the Company Shareholders (" _Shareholders  Representative_") to execute any
and all instruments or other documents on behalf of the Company Shareholders,
and to do any and all other acts or things on behalf of the Company
Shareholders, which Shareholders Representative may deem necessary or
advisable, or which may be required pursuant to this Agreement, the Related
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or otherwise, in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Company
Shareholders and the Company (on behalf of the Company Shareholders) hereby
irrevocably appoints, and consents to the designation of Endeavour Capital
Fund III, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, its successor or its
designee, to act as such Company Shareholders exclusive attorney-in-fact and
agent, with full power of substitution, to act in the name, place and
stead of such Person with respect to the matters identified herein or
arising hereunder, including the power (i) to act for such Person with regard
to matters pertaining to indemnification referred to in this Agreement; (ii)
to execute and deliver on behalf of such Person all ancillary agreements,
certificates, statements, notices, approvals, extensions,
waivers, undertakings, amendments and other documents Shareholders
Representative deems appropriate in connection with responding to,
compromising or settling any claims made pursuant to this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement and the Related Agreement; (iii) to give and receive all
notices and communications to be

  

### 

  

### 32      
   

### 

  

### given or received under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the
Related Agreement and to receive service of process in connection with any
claims under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Related Agreement;
and (iv) to take all other actions which under this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement and the Related Agreement may be taken by Shareholders
Representative and to do or refrain from doing any further act or deed on
behalf of such Person which Shareholders Representative deems necessary or
appropriate in its sole discretion relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Related Agreement as fully
and completely as such Person could do if personally present. The death or
incapacity of any such Person shall not terminate the agency and power
granted hereby to Shareholders Representative.

  

### 

  

### (b) Parent shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the Shareholders
Representative on all Company Shareholder matters relating to this Agreement.
A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholders Representative
constitutes a decision of all the Company Shareholders. Such decision,
act, consent or instruction is final, binding and conclusive upon each
Company Shareholder, and Parent may rely upon such decision of the
Shareholders Representative.

  

### 

  

### (c) The Shareholders Representative shall act for the Company
Shareholders hereunder in the manner the Shareholders Representative
believes to be in the best interest of the Company Shareholders and
consistent with its obligations hereunder, but shall have no duties or
obligations to the Company Shareholders except as specifically set forth
herein.  In acting as representative of the Company Shareholders, the
Shareholders Representative may rely upon, and shall be protected in acting
or refraining from acting upon, an opinion or advice of counsel, certificate
of auditors or other certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report,
notice, request, consent, order, arbitrators award, appraisal, bond or other
paper or documents reasonably believed by the Shareholders Representative to
be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or
parties. The Shareholders Representative shall not be personally liable to
the Company Shareholders for any act done or omitted hereunder as
Shareholders Representative except in the event of intentional wrongdoing
for personal benefit. The Shareholders Representative may consult with
counsel and any advice of such counsel shall be full and complete
authorization and protection in respect to any action taken or suffered or
omitted by it in such capacity in good faith and in accordance with such
opinion of counsel. The Shareholders Representative may perform its duties
as Shareholders Representative either directly or by or through its agents
or attorneys, and the Shareholders Representative shall not be responsible
to the Company Shareholders for any misconduct or negligence on the part of
any agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder.

  

### 

  

### (d) The Shareholders Representative shall be entitled to reimbursement
from the Shareholder Representative Escrow Account for its expenses incurred
in connection with its duties as Shareholders Representative. The Company
Shareholders (severally in proportion to their Pro Rata Share and not
jointly) shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend the Shareholders
Representative from and against, and reimburse the Shareholders
Representative with respect to, any and all Losses reasonably incurred by the
Shareholders Representative as a result of such Person acting as the
Shareholders Representative under this Agreement or in connection with such
Persons duties hereunder, provided that the Shareholders Representatives
initial recourse for all such claims shall be to the Shareholder
Representative Escrow Amount for so long as any of the
Shareholder Representative Escrow Amount remains in the Shareholder
Representative Escrow Account.

  



  

## 11.8 _Collection of Accounts Receivable_.

  



  

### (a) After the Closing and until the Final Receivables Settlement Date (as
defined below), the Surviving Corporation shall in good faith use
commercially reasonable efforts to collect the accounts receivable which are
reflected in Closing Working Capital on the Closing Statement (net of any
allowance for doubtful accounts reflected in Closing Working Capital on the
Closing Statement, the " _Closing Accounts Receivable_ "). Without limiting
the foregoing, the Surviving Corporation shall not be deemed to be in good
faith using commercially reasonable efforts to collect the Closing Accounts
Receivable if it shall forgive, discharge or compromise, in whole or in part,
any receivable reflected in Closing Working Capital on the

  

### 

  

### 33      
   

### 

  

### Closing Statement and the primary purpose for such forgiveness, discharge
or compromise, in whole or in part, was not to resolve a bona fide customer
dispute with respect to or otherwise resulting from any act or omission by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing. If the Surviving
Corporation has not collected an amount of receivables in an amount at least
equal to the Closing Accounts Receivable by the date that is five business
days before the Indemnity Escrow Release Date, then (without regard to
whether such non-collection constitutes a breach of a representation or
warranty hereunder) Parent and Shareholders Representative shall take all
such actions as are necessary under the Escrow Agreement to cause the Escrow
Agent to release to the Surviving Corporation, in immediately available funds
from the Indemnity Escrow Account on or prior to the Indemnity Escrow Release
Date, an aggregate amount equal to (the " _Accounts Receivable Shortfall
Amount_ ") the amount by which the Closing Accounts Receivable exceeds the
amount collected by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this _Section
11.8(a)_ during the period from the Closing Date through the date that is
five business days before the Indemnity Escrow Release Date. For
the avoidance of doubt, any collection of a receivable that was a doubtful
account on the Closing Statement or had been written off prior to the Closing
will be considered an amount collected by the Surviving Corporation for the
purposes of the preceding sentence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Section 11.8, in the event that the Surviving Corporation desires to
forgive, discharge or compromise, in whole or in part, a receivable reflected
in Closing Working Capital on the Closing Statement and, pursuant to the
second sentence of this Section 11.8(a), such forgiveness, discharge or
compromise would not constitute the good faith use of commercially reasonable
efforts to collect the Closing Accounts Receivable, the Surviving Corporation
may nonetheless effect such forgiveness, discharge or compromise, in whole or
in part, so long as the Surviving Corporation provides the Shareholders
Representative with prior written notice of such forgiveness, discharge or
compromise, which notice shall contain the Surviving Corporations written
agreement that the amount so forgiven, discharged or compromised shall be
considered an amount collected by the Surviving Corporation for the
purposes of the third sentence of this Section 11.8(a) (or, with respect to
any forgiveness, discharge or compromise occurring during the Subsequent
Collection Period (as defined below), an amount collected by the Surviving
Corporation for the purposes of Section 11.8(b) below).

  



  

### (b) If the Accounts Receivable Shortfall Amount is paid to the Surviving
Corporation from the Indemnity Escrow Account as contemplated by _Section
11.8(a)_  above, and if the Accounts Receivable Shortfall Amount paid to the
Surviving Corporation from the Indemnity Escrow Account is greater than
$200,000, then if, during the period (the " _Subsequent Collection Period_ ")
beginning on the date that is four business days before the Indemnity Escrow
Release Date and ending on the date that is the three year anniversary of the
Closing Date (the " _Final Receivables Settlement Date_ "), the Surviving
Corporation collects an amount of Closing Accounts Receivable in excess of
$200,000, then the Surviving Corporation, no later than the date that is ten
business days after the Final Receivables Settlement Date, shall pay to the
Shareholders Representative (on behalf of the Company Shareholders other
than the holders of Vested Company Options in accordance with the
_Shareholder Distribution Schedule_ attached hereto) and to the holders of
Vested Company Options (subject to applicable withholding laws and

## 12.4 _Severability_.  Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be

## 

  

## 12.5 _Interpretation_.  The headings and captions used in this Agreement,
in any Schedule or Exhibit hereto, in the table of contents or in any index
hereto are for convenience of reference only and do not constitute a part of
this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit, characterize or in any way
affect any provision of this Agreement or any Schedule or Exhibit hereto, and
all provisions of this Agreement and the Schedules and Exhibits hereto shall
be enforced and construed as if no caption or heading had been used herein
or therein. Any capitalized terms used in any Schedule or Exhibit attached
hereto and not otherwise defined therein shall have the meanings set forth in
this Agreement.  Each defined term used in this Agreement shall have a
comparable meaning when used in its plural or singular form.  The use of the
word "including" herein shall mean "including without limitation." The
parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this
Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the
parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement.

  

## 

  

## 12.6 _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement (including all of the Schedules
and Exhibits attached hereto), the Related Agreement, the Escrow Agreement
and each of the Employment Agreements (including Section 7 of each of the
Employment Agreements) contain the entire agreement and understanding between
the

  



  

36      
   



  

## parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral,
relating to such subject matter in any way.

  

## 

  

## 12.7 _Counterparts_.  This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by means of telecopied signature pages), all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.  

  

## 

  

## 12.8 _Governing Law_.  Except as provided in _Section 12.11_ below, all
questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and
interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by the internal law of the

law provision or rule (whether of the State of Oregon or any other
jurisdictions) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdictions other than the State of Oregon.

  

## 

  

## 12.9 _Schedules_.  Information set forth in any schedule of the Company
Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to have been disclosed only with respect
to (a) any representation, warranty or statement in the Agreement qualified
by reference to the schedule in question; and (b) any representation,
warranty or statement in the Agreement qualified by reference to any other
schedule where the information set forth on the face of the schedule in
question is set forth with such specificity that a reasonable person would
know that such disclosure was applicable to such other schedule. The fact
that any matter or event is disclosed in the Company Disclosure
Schedules shall not constitute an admission that such item is required to be
so disclosed, nor shall the fact that any matter or event is disclosed in
the Company Disclosure Schedules necessarily mean that it is material,
whether considered individually or in combination with other matters or
events disclosed therein. No information contained in the Company Disclosure
Schedules shall be deemed to be an admission by any party to the Agreement or
to any third party of any matter whatsoever, including, without limitation,
any violation of law or breach of any agreement. Except as otherwise
limited herein or in the Agreement, all disclosures contained in these
Schedules are made as of the date of the Agreement.  Capitalized terms used
but not otherwise defined in the Company Disclosure Schedules shall have the
meanings set forth in the Agreement.

## 12.10 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing herein expressed or implied
is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person other
than the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns
any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, certain provisions of this Agreement are intended for the
benefit of the Company Shareholders and such provisions may only be enforced
by the Shareholders Representative (on behalf of the Company Shareholders).

  

## 

  

### 12.11 _Dispute Resolution_.

  



  

### (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the parties
agree that the arbitration procedure set forth below shall be the sole and
exclusive method for resolving and remedying any and all disputes,
controversies or claims that arise out of or in connection with, or relate in
any manner to, the rights and liabilities of the parties hereunder or any
provision of this Agreement or the Related Agreement or the interpretation,
enforceability, performance, breach, termination or validity hereof or
thereof, including this _Section 12.11_  relating to the resolution of
disputes (the " _Disputes_ ") and questions concerning arbitrability;
_provided that_ nothing in this _Section 12.11_  shall prohibit a party
hereto from instituting litigation to enforce any Final Determination (as
defined below). The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that, except as
otherwise provided in this  _Section 12.11_ or in the applicable rules for
arbitration of business disputes (the " _Rules_ ") promulgated by the
Arbitration Service of Portland, Inc. (the " _Arbitration Service_ ") as in
effect from time to time, the arbitration procedures and any Final
Determination hereunder shall be governed by, and shall be enforced pursuant
to, the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §1 et. seq.

  

### 

  

### (b) Except as provided elsewhere herein, in the event that any party
asserts that there exists a Dispute, such party shall deliver a written
notice to each other party involved therein specifying the nature of the
asserted Dispute and requesting a meeting to attempt to resolve the same.
 If no such resolution is reached within ten business days after
the delivery of such notice, the party delivering such notice of Dispute (the
" _Disputing Person_ ") may thereafter commence arbitration hereunder by
delivering to each other party

  

### 

  

### 37      
   

### 

  

### involved therein a notice of arbitration (a " _Notice of Arbitration_ ").
Such Notice of Arbitration shall specify the nature of any Dispute and any
other matters required by the Rules as in effect from time to time to be
included therein. The Arbitrator shall permit and facilitate such discovery
as the parties shall reasonably request. Parent and Shareholders
Representative shall mutually agree upon one arbitrator to resolve any
Dispute pursuant to the procedures set forth in this _Section 12.11_ and the
Rules. If Parent and Shareholders Representative cannot mutually agree to an
arbitrator within 15 days from receipt of the notice of arbitration, the
arbitrator shall be appointed by the Arbitration Service within 15 days of
being notified in writing of the Arbitration Services need to make such
appointment or as soon thereafter as may be practicable.

  

### 

  

### (c) The fees and expenses of the Arbitration Service and the arbitrator
selected pursuant to _Section 12.11(b)_ shall be shared equally by Parent and
the Company Shareholders (severally in proportion to their Pro Rata Share and
not jointly) and advanced by them from time to time as required; _provided_
_that_  at the conclusion of the arbitration, the arbitrator shall award
reasonable costs and expenses (including the costs of the arbitration
previously advanced and the reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys,
accountants and other experts) and interest at the Applicable Rate to the
prevailing party.

  

### 

  

### (d) The arbitration shall be conducted in Portland, Oregon **** under the
Rules as in effect from time to time. The parties shall use their reasonable
best efforts to cause the arbitrator to conduct the arbitration so that a
final result, determination, finding, judgment and/or award (the "
_Final Determination_ ") is made or rendered as soon as practicable, but in
no event later than 90 business days after the delivery of the Notice of
Arbitration nor later than 30 days following completion of the arbitration.
Notwithstanding any Oregon law to the contrary, the Final Determination shall
be final and binding on all parties and there shall be no appeal from or
reexamination of the Final Determination, except for fraud, perjury, evident
partiality or misconduct by an arbitrator prejudicing the rights of any party
and to correct manifest clerical errors.

  

### 

  

### (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the Related Agreement
to the contrary, nothing in this _Section 12.11_ shall be construed to impair
the right of any Person to seek injunctive or other equitable relief.

  

###
