(" _Parent_ "), Millennium Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Zipcar, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). All capitalized terms used in this
Agreement shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in _Section 8.4_ or
as otherwise defined elsewhere in this Agreement unless the context clearly
indicates otherwise. 

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent (the " _Parent Board_
"), Merger Sub and the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") have each approved
this Agreement and the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "
_Merger_ ") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement;

WHEREAS, the Company Board has, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, unanimously (i) determined that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, are fair to and in the
best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved and declared
advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger (collectively, the " _Transactions_ "), and (iii) directed that
the adoption of this Agreement be submitted to the holders of Common Stock for
approval;

 

WHEREAS, each of the Parent Board and the board of directors of Merger Sub
have, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, approved
this Agreement and the Transactions;

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements in connection

WHEREAS concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
certain stockholders of the Company and certain officers and directors of the
Company who are also stockholders of the Company are entering into Voting
Agreements with Parent with respect to the Merger (the " _Voting Agreements_
"). NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this
Agreement agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE 1

 

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
(the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time (as defined below) Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").
The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of
the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective
Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all of the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation. (b) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company
shall, subject to _Section 5.12(b)_, be amended and restated in its entirety
to read identically to the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the name of the
Surviving Corporation shall be "Zipcar, Inc." (and excluding any provisions
with respect to the incorporator or the initial directors) and, as so amended,
shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. In
addition, at the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Company shall, subject to
_Section 5.12(b)_, be amended and restated in their entirety to read
identically to the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation as used
therein shall be "Zipcar, Inc." and, as so amended, shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein
or by applicable Law.

(c) The parties shall take all actions necessary so that the directors
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after
the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to
hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors shall have been
duly elected or appointed and qualified, or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the
officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until their respective successors shall have been duly elected or appointed
and qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation.

(d) After the Effective Time, if the Surviving Corporation shall determine or
shall be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance,
assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,
the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the officers
and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all
such deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments and
assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of each of such
corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be
necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title or
interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving
Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

1.2 _Closing and Effective Time of the Merger_. The closing of the Merger
(the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m., Boston, Massachusetts time,
on the fifth (5th) Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of all of
the conditions set forth in _Article 6_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of those conditions at the Closing), at the offices of
Latham and Watkins LLP, 200 Clarendon Street, 20th Floor,
Boston, Massachusetts 02116, unless another time, date or place is agreed to
in writing by the parties hereto. The date on which the Closing actually
occurs is referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_ ". At the Closing, the
Company shall cause an appropriate certificate of merger or other appropriate
documents (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in
Section 251 of the DGCL and shall take all such reasonable further actions
and make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger
shall

 



2  become effective at the time the Certificate of Merger shall have been duly
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or such other date
and time as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the Certificate of
Merger, such date and time hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_
".

1.3 _Meeting of Stockholders to Approve the Merger_.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC (as defined below)
a proxy statement for the Company Stockholder Meeting (together with any
amendments or supplements thereto and any other required proxy materials, the
" _Proxy Statement_ ") relating to the Merger and this Agreement. The Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to comply as to
form and substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Exchange Act. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement and all other
materials that (i) constitute "proxy materials" or "solicitation materials"
as those terms are used in Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act or (ii) are
otherwise used for the "solicitation" of "proxies" as those terms are defined
in Rule 14a-1 under the Exchange Act, in each case, prior to the filing
thereof with the SEC or the dissemination thereof to any stockholder of the
Company. Subject to _Section 5.6_, the Company shall include in the Proxy
Statement the recommendation of the Company Board that the stockholders of
the Company vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with
the DGCL (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "). The Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be cleared by the SEC
and disseminated to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as practicable
following the filing thereof with the SEC. The Company shall provide Parent
and its counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of
any oral comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to
time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement promptly
after the CompanyÂ’s receipt of such comments, and any written or oral
responses thereto. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review any such written responses. The Company shall, after
consultation with Parent, respond promptly to any comments made by the SEC
with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company, on the one hand, and
Parent, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided
by it for use in the Proxy Statement if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or
as otherwise required by applicable Laws, and the Company further agrees to
cause the Proxy Statement, as so corrected (if applicable), to be filed with
the SEC and mailed to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by the Exchange Act or the SEC (or its staff). The Company agrees
that as of the date it is first mailed to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders and at
the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, none of the information supplied
or to be supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Proxy Statement will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading.

(b) As promptly as practicable following the date on which the SEC (or its
staff) advises the Company or its counsel that it has no further comments
thereon or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement in
connection with the Company Stockholder Meeting, the Company shall,
in consultation with Parent, (i) take all action necessary to duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting for the purpose of
seeking the adoption of this Agreement by the CompanyÂ’s stockholders; (ii)
cause the Proxy Statement to be printed and mailed to the stockholders of the
Company; and (iii) subject to _Section 5.6_, use reasonable best efforts to
seek any approval of stockholders of the Company that is required by
applicable Law to effect the Merger. The Company shall not change the record
date for the Company Stockholder Meeting or postpone or adjourn the date for
which the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled without the prior written
consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , the Company may postpone or adjourn the
Company Stockholder Meeting (x) to allow additional time for the 

 



3  prompt filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which
the Company Board has determined is necessary under applicable Law for such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be reasonably disseminated and reviewed
by the CompanyÂ’s stockholders prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting or (y)
if necessary, to solicit additional proxies in the event that there are not
sufficient votes at the time of the meeting to adopt this Agreement. If, on a
date for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, the Company has
not received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval or to obtain a quorum for such meeting, the
Company shall, at ParentÂ’s written request, postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholder Meeting solely for the purpose of and for the minimum time
reasonably necessary to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval. Except as
Parent shall have otherwise consented to in writing in advance, (i) the
Company Stockholder Approval and (ii) an advisory vote on golden parachute
compensation in connection with the Merger in accordance with applicable
federal securities laws shall be the only matters (other than procedural
matters) which the Company shall propose to be acted on by the Company
Stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall, on the
reasonable request of Parent, advise Parent promptly as to the aggregate
tally of proxies received by the Company with respect to the Company
Stockholder Approval. Unless this Agreement has been validly terminated in
accordance with its terms, the obligation of the Company to duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting and to submit
this Agreement to the stockholders of the Company for the purpose of obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval shall not be limited or otherwise affected by
the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission of any Acquisition
Proposal or by any Change of Company Board Recommendation or Intervening Event
Change of Recommendation.

(c) Upon ParentÂ’s request, (i) the Company and Parent shall promptly prepare a
mutually acceptable joint written presentation to Institutional Shareholder
Services recommending adopting of this Agreement and approval of the
Transactions, (ii) the Company shall request a meeting with Institutional
Shareholder Services for purposes of obtaining its recommendation in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement by the CompanyÂ’s stockholders and (iii) the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such
recommendation; _provided_ , that the foregoing obligations shall not apply in
the event the Company Board shall have made a Change of Company Board
Recommendation or Intervening Event Change of Recommendation.

ARTICLE 2

 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any of the following securities: 

(a) _Conversion of Common Stock_. Subject to _Section 2.2_, each share of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the " _Common Stock_ "), of the
Company (a " _Share_ " or collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares to be
cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and other than Dissenting
Shares (as defined below), shall be converted into the right to receive $12.25
in cash, without interest (the " _Per Share Amount_ ").

 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All Shares that
are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by any of the
Subsidiaries of the Company (each a " _Company Subsidiary_ " and collectively,
the " _Company Subsidiaries_ "), and all Shares owned of record by Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, with no payment being made with respect
thereto.

(c)  _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly and validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



4 The cash to be paid upon the conversion of Shares pursuant to _Section
2.1(a)_ is referred to herein as the " _Merger Consideration_ ". At the
Effective Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_
") formerly representing any of the Shares (other than Shares to be cancelled
in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and other than Dissenting Shares) shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Amount, in each
case without interest, subject to compliance with the procedures for
surrender of such Shares as set forth in _Section 2.2_. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Common Stock or
the securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of Common Stock
shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class
by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares,
readjustment, or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock
distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date within said
period, the Per Share Amount and any other similarly dependent items, as the
case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of Shares
the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event.

 

2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

(a) _Payment Agent_. At or immediately following the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited with a nationally recognized
financial institution designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the
Company (the " _Payment Agent_ ") in immediately available funds all of the
cash necessary to pay the Merger Consideration (such cash deposited with the
Payment Agent being hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). The
Payment Fund shall be invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent, in
(i) short-term obligations of the United States of America or (ii) short-term
obligations backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America, in each case pending payment thereof by the Payment Agent to the
holders of Shares pursuant to this _Article 2_. Following the Effective Time,
the Payment Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the
cash contemplated to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.1_ out of the Payment
Fund. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_.

(i) _Certificates_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Amount at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a letter of
transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Payment Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form and
have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and as reasonably
approved by the Company prior to the Effective Time, and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
payment of the Per Share Amount. Upon surrender of Certificates for
cancellation to the Payment Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly
executed and in proper form, with respect to such Certificates, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Payment Agent, the holder of
such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
amount of cash into which each Share formerly represented by such Certificates
was converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_, and the Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer
of ownership of

 



5  Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
payment of the Per Share Amount may be made to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer and
other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Amount
to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered
or shall establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes either have
been paid or are not required to be paid.

 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Any holder of non-certificated Shares represented by
book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ " and each individually a " _Book-Entry
Share_ "), in each case whose Shares were converted into the right to receive
the Per Share Amount at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement, shall
not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal
to the Payment Agent to receive the Per Share Amount that such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement. In lieu thereof, each holder
of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose Shares were converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Amount at the Effective Time pursuant to
this Agreement shall, upon receipt by the Payment Agent of an "agentÂ’s
message" (or such other evidence, if any, of surrender as the Payment Agent
may reasonably request) be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount
of cash into which each Share formerly represented by such Book-Entry Share
was converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_. Payment of the Per Share
Amount with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in
whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.

 

(iii) Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each
Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Per Share Amount
into which the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share has been converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_. No interest shall be
paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-
Entry Share.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. As of the close
of business on the date of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration
of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article 2_ upon
conversion of any Shares shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Agreement.

(d) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At any time
following twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to require the Payment Agent to deliver to it
any portion of the Payment Fund (including any interest received with respect
thereto) not disbursed to holders of Shares, and thereafter such holders shall
be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with
respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Shares
and compliance with the procedures set forth in _Section 2.2(b)_,
without interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving
Corporation nor the Payment Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Share for
Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and
the Payment Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold or cause to be deducted or withheld from any amount otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts

 



6  as Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent are
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any other provision of applicable Law. Parent, Merger Sub,
the Surviving Corporation and the Payment Agent, as applicable, shall timely
remit to the appropriate Governmental Entity any and all amounts so deducted
or withheld. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Entity by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Payment Agent or their respective affiliates, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by Parent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent or their respective
affiliates.

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Per Share
Amount payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its reasonable discretion and as
a condition precedent to the payment of any such Merger Consideration, require
the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to deliver a bond in
such sum as Parent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the
Payment Agent with respect to the Certificate alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held
by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for
such Shares in accordance with, and who otherwise complies with, Section 262
of the DGCL (such Shares, " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section
2.1(a)_, and shall instead represent the right to receive only the payment
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or
otherwise waives, withdraws or loses his right to appraisal under Section 262
of the DGCL or other applicable Law, then such Dissenting Shares shall be
deemed to be Shares that have been converted as of the Effective Time into,
and to have become exchangeable solely for, the right to receive the Per
Share Amount as provided in _Section 2.1(a)_, without interest. The Company
shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal,
attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served
pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company relating to
Company stockholdersÂ’ rights of appraisal, and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to
any demands for appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands.

 

2.4 _Treatment of Company Options, Company Warrants, Stock Plans_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board
(or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate
resolutions and take all other actions necessary and appropriate to provide
that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding option to
purchase Shares (the " _Company Options_ ") other than the Company Warrants
(as defined below), under any equity plan of the Company, including the 2000
Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan, the 2010 Stock Incentive Plan and the 2011
Stock Incentive Plan, each as amended (collectively, the " _Company
Equity Plans_ "), or otherwise shall be accelerated and automatically become
fully vested, cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of any
such cancelled Company Option shall be entitled to receive, in consideration
of the cancellation of such Company Option and in settlement therefor, a
payment in cash (subject to any withholding in accordance with _Section
2.2(e)_) of an amount equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares
previously subject to such Company Option, and (ii) the excess, if any, of
the Per Share Amount over the exercise price per Share previously subject to
such

 



7  Company Option (such amounts payable hereunder, the " _Option Payments_ ").
Promptly following the Effective Time (and no later than ten (10) days
following the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to pay to each holder of a Company Option an amount equal to the Option
Payment (if any) with respect to such Company Option. From and after the
Effective Time, any such cancelled Company Option shall no longer be
exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle such holder
to the payment of the Option Payment as set forth herein.

(b) _Treatment of Warrants_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, or the
Company, each outstanding unexercised warrant to purchase or otherwise
acquire shares of Common Stock (the " _Company Warrants_ ") shall be
accelerated and automatically become fully vested, cancelled and, in exchange
therefor, each former holder of any such cancelled Company Warrant shall be
entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such Company
Warrant and in settlement therefor, a payment in cash (subject to any
withholding in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_) of an amount equal to the
product of (i) the total number of Shares previously subject to such Company
Warrant, and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Amount over the
exercise price per Share previously subject to such Company Warrant (such
amounts payable hereunder, the " _Warrant Payments_ "). From and after the
Effective Time, any such cancelled Company Warrant shall no longer be
exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle such holder
to the payment of the Warrant Payment. Promptly following the date of this
Agreement (and in no event later than the date on which the Proxy Statement is
first mailed to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders), the Company shall deliver written
notice to each holder of a Company Warrant, in accordance with the terms of
the applicable Company Warrant, informing such holders of the effect of the
Merger on the Company Warrants.

(c) _Treatment of Restricted Stock_. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that
all outstanding restricted stock awards (the " _Company Restricted Shares_ ")
shall automatically become fully vested and free of any forfeiture
restrictions at the Effective Time, and the Company will use commercially
reasonable efforts, including obtaining any required consents or amendments to
the CompanyÂ’s equity incentive plans, to permit holders of outstanding
Company Restricted Shares to be treated in the Merger on the same terms and
conditions as all other holders of unrestricted Shares.

(d) _Termination of Company Equity Plans_. After the Effective Time, all
Company Equity Plans shall be terminated and no further Company Options or
other rights with respect to Shares shall be granted thereunder.

Disclosure Schedule_ ") delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the
execution of this Agreement (which letter sets forth items of disclosure with
specific reference to the particular section or subsection of this Agreement
to which the information in the Company Disclosure Schedule relates;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any information set forth in one section of the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be a disclosure in any other
individual section or 

 



8  subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule to which its relevance is
reasonably apparent from the actual text of the disclosure that such
disclosure is relevant to such other section or subsection; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the inclusion of an item in such schedule as an exception to a representation
or warranty will not be deemed an admission that such item represents a
material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item
has had, or could have, a Material Adverse Effect), the Company represents and
warrants to Parent and Merger Sub:

 

3.1 _Organization and Qualification_. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware. The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to
own, lease and operate its assets and properties and to carry on its business
as it is now being conducted. The Company is qualified to do business and
is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the assets and properties
owned, leased and operated by it, or the nature of the business conducted by
it, makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect. True,
accurate and complete copies of the CompanyÂ’s certificate of incorporation and
bylaws, in each case as in effect on the date hereof, including all amendments
thereto, have heretofore been made available to Parent.

3.2 _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 510,000,000
shares, of which 500,000,000 shares are designated Common Stock and
10,000,000 shares are designated preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share
(the " _Preferred Stock_ "). As of December 31, 2012: (i) 40,121,660 shares of
Common Stock and no shares of Preferred Stock, were issued and outstanding;
and (ii) no shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock were held in treasury.
All of such issued and outstanding shares are validly issued and are fully
paid and nonassessable. No issued and outstanding shares of the
CompanyÂ’s capital stock are subject to a repurchase or redemption right or
right of first refusal or condition of forfeiture in favor of the Company.

(b) Except as set forth on _Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_, there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, contracts,
commitments, restrictions, stock appreciation rights, phantom stock, rights
or warrants, including any right of conversion or exchange under any
outstanding security, instrument or other agreement and also including any
rights plan or other anti-takeover agreement, obligating the Company to
issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional
shares of the CompanyÂ’s capital stock. There are no voting trusts, proxies or
other agreements or understandings to which the Company is a party or is bound
with respect to the voting of any shares of the CompanyÂ’s capital stock.
_Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth the number of
shares of Common Stock issuable, as of the date of this Agreement, upon (i)
the exercise of outstanding Company Options and Company Warrants, and (ii)
the vesting of outstanding Company Restricted Shares. The Company Options, the
Company Warrants and Company Restricted Shares are collectively referred to as
" _Company Stock-Based Securities_ ". All shares of Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of Company Options, Company Warrants or other Company Stock-
Based Securities have been duly reserved for issuance by the Company, and upon
issuance of such shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Company Equity Plan or other arrangement, will be duly authorized,
validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable and will not be subject to
any preemptive or similar rights. No Company Option was granted with an
exercise price less than the fair market value of the Company Option on the
date of grant.

(c)  _Section 3.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth a
complete and accurate list of all record holders of outstanding Company Stock-
Based Securities, indicating with respect to each of the Company Stock-Based
Securities, (i) the number of shares of Common Stock

 



9  subject to such Company Stock-Based Securities (whether by exercise,
conversion or vesting), held by each such record holder, (ii) the exercise or
conversion price, date of issuance or grant and expiration date, if any, of
such Company Stock-Based Securities, and (iii) the particular Company Equity
Plan pursuant to which such Company Stock-Based Security was granted or
issued. The Company has made available to Parent accurate and complete copies
of each of the Company Equity Plans and the standard form of all agreements
and instruments relating to or issued under each Company Equity Plan and all
agreements and instruments relating to or issued under the Company Equity
Plans that differ in any material respect from such standard form agreements.

(d) As of the date hereof, (i) no bonds, debentures, notes or other
indebtedness of the Company having the right to vote are issued or
outstanding, and (ii) there are no outstanding contractual obligations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
any shares of the CompanyÂ’s capital stock or any equity securities of any
Company Subsidiary.

3.3  _Subsidiaries_.

(a) For each Company Subsidiary, _Section 3.3(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_ lists the name, jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, and
each jurisdiction such Company Subsidiary is qualified to do business.

(b) Each Company Subsidiary is a corporation or limited liability company duly
incorporated or organized, validly existing and in good standing (except in
the case of good standing, any jurisdiction that does not recognize such
concept) under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization,
and has all corporate or limited liability powers, except where failure to be
so incorporated or organized, validly existing or in good standing (except in
the case of good standing, any jurisdiction that does not recognize such
concept), or to have such corporate or limited liability powers would not have
a Material Adverse Effect. Each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation or limited liability company, and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary,
except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified or in good
standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Other than its
Subsidiaries, neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries beneficially
owns or controls, directly or indirectly, any equity or similar securities of
any corporation or other entity whether incorporated or unincorporated.

(c) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other voting
securities or ownership interests in, each of the Company Subsidiaries are
owned by the Company, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Lien other
than Liens specified in the organizational documents of such Company
Subsidiary and other than any restrictions imposed under the Securities Act.
Other than the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other voting
securities or ownership interests in, each Company Subsidiary that is owned by
the Company, directly or indirectly through one or more Subsidiaries, there
are no outstanding (i) shares of capital stock or other voting securities or
ownership interests in any of the CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries, (ii) securities of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable for
shares of capital stock or other voting securities or ownership interests in
any of the CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries, or (iii) options or other rights by any
Person other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to acquire from the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or other obligation of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to issue, any capital stock or other voting securities or
ownership interests in, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for
any capital stock or other voting securities or ownership interests in, any
of the CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries.

(e) Subject to the accuracy of the representation set forth in _Section 4.6_
hereof, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the total voting

impairment of such Permit. All applications required to have been filed for
the renewal of any Permits have been duly filed on a timely basis with
the appropriate Governmental Entity. Neither the Company nor any Company

the Company or any Company Subsidiary is currently not in compliance in all
material respects with the terms of any such Permits.

the Company Disclosure Schedule_, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in breach or violation of, or in default in the performance or

default or event. To the knowledge of the Company, there exists no breach,
violation, default in performance or obligation by any other party to any
Material Contract, except for such breach, violation or default would
not have a Material Adverse Effect.

3.8 _SEC Matters_.

 

(a) The Company has timely filed, within the time periods or extensions
thereof prescribed under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as
applicable, and the rules and regulations thereunder, all forms, reports and
other documents required to be filed by it with the SEC since June 1, 2010
(collectively, the " _Company Reports_ "). As of their respective dates
(or, if amended, supplemented or superseded by a filing prior to the date of
this Agreement, as of the date so amended, supplemented or superseded), the
Company Reports (i) complied in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and the rules and
regulations thereunder, and (ii) did not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the
consolidated balance sheets included in the Company Reports (including the
related notes and schedules) fairly presented in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the respective dates thereof and each of the consolidated statements of
operations, cash flows and stockholdersÂ’ equity included in the Company
Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all
material respects the results of operations, cash flows or changes in
stockholdersÂ’ equity, as the case may be, of the Company and its Subsidiaries
for the periods set forth therein, in each case in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied during the periods involved, except, as may be indicated
in the notes thereto and, in the case of unaudited statements, for normal
year-end audit adjustments. The principal executive officer of the Company
and the principal financial officer of the Company (and each former principal
executive officer or principal financial officer of the Company) have made the
certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder with respect to the Company Reports that were required
to be accompanied by such certifications. For purposes of the preceding
sentence, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer"
shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(b) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal
controls over financial reporting required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the
Exchange Act. Such controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable
assurance that all material information concerning the Company and its
Subsidiaries required to be disclosed by the Company in the Company Reports is
made known on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for
the preparation of the CompanyÂ’s filings with the SEC and other public
disclosure documents and such internal controls over financial reporting are
effective to provide reasonable assurance to the CompanyÂ’s management and the
Company Board regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP.

 



12 3.9 _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_. The Company did not have
at September 30, 2012, nor has it incurred since that date, any liabilities
or obligations (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) of any
nature required by GAAP to be set forth in a consolidated balance sheet of the
Company or in the notes thereto, except (i) to the extent such liabilities or
obligations are disclosed in the Company Reports filed with the SEC prior to
the date hereof, (ii) such liabilities that have been discharged or paid in
full prior to the date hereof or (iii) such liabilities or obligations that
were incurred after September 30, 2012 in the ordinary course of business and
consistent with past practices and would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any commitment
to become a party to, any balance sheet partnership, joint venture or any
similar arrangements (including any Contract relating to any transaction or
relationship between or among the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and any other Person, including any structured finance, special
purpose or limited purpose Person, on the other hand), or any "off-balance
sheet arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K promulgated
under the Securities Act).

3.10 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as set forth in _Section
3.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule_, (a) since September 30, 2012, (i)
the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses
in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and (ii) neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has taken any action that, if taken after
the date of this Agreement without ParentÂ’s consent, would constitute a
breach of any of the covenants set forth in _Section 5.2_, and (b) since
December 31, 2011, there has not been a Material Adverse Effect.

 

3.11 _Litigation_. Except as set forth in _Section 3.11 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule_, there are no material claims, suits, actions, hearings,
arbitrations or, to the knowledge of the Company, investigations or other
proceedings, audits or reviews by any Governmental Entity or arbitrator
pending or threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any material judgment,
decree, settlement, award, injunction, rule or order of any court,
governmental department, commission, agency, instrumentality or authority, or
any arbitrator. 

3.12 _Employee Benefit Plans; ERISA_.

(a) _Section 3.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ lists (i) each plan,
program, arrangement, practice and policy, whether formal or informal, funded
or unfunded, written or oral, under which any current or former officer,
employee, individual independent contractor or director of the Company or a
Company Subsidiary has any right to employment, to purchase or receive any
stock or other securities of the Company or a Company Subsidiary or to
receive any compensation (whether in the form of cash or stock or otherwise)
or benefits of any kind or description whatsoever in any material amount or
under which the Company or a Company Subsidiary has any material
liability, (ii) each employee benefit plan within the meaning set forth in
Section 3(3) of Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("
_ERISA_ "), whether or not subject to ERISA, under which the Company or a
Company Subsidiary has any liability, and (iii) the Company Equity Plans
(collectively, the " _Company Benefit Plans_ ").

 



13 (b) The Company has made available to Parent (i) a current, complete and
accurate copy of each Company Benefit Plan which is set forth in writing (and
any related trust, insurance contract or other funding arrangement) and a
written summary of each Company Benefit Plan which is not set forth in
writing, and (ii) a copy of the three (3) most recent Annual Reports (Form
5500) and all related exhibits and reports for each Company Benefit Plan which
is subject to ERISA.

(c) No Company Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of
the Code, and no Company Benefit Plan is a multiemployer plan within the
meaning of Section 414(f) of the Code or a plan described in Section 413(c)
of the Code. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any material
liability under Title IV of ERISA. No Company Benefit Plan maintained for the
benefit of employees outside the United States is a defined benefit pension
plan.

(d) There have been no prohibited transactions within the meaning of Section
406 or Section 407 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code with respect to any
of the Company Benefit Plans that could result in material penalties, taxes,
liabilities or indemnification obligations, and there has been no other event
with respect to any Company Benefit Plan that could result in any material

rulings, charges, or settlements pending or, threatened in writing against
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to any violation of or
liability under, or alleged violation of or liability under, any Environmental
Law. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has treated,
stored, transported, disposed of, arranged for or permitted the disposal of,
Released, or exposed any Person to any Hazardous Substances (i) at a location
that requires investigation or remediation under Environmental Laws or (ii) as
would otherwise reasonably be expected to give rise to any material liability
of the Company or its Subsidiaries under Environmental Laws. There has been no
Release of Hazardous Substances by the Company or its Subsidiaries or at any
property currently operated by the Company or its Subsidiaries, nor to the
CompanyÂ’s knowledge has there been a Release of Hazardous Substances at any
property formerly owned or operated by the Company or its Subsidiaries during
the period of ownership or operation, so as would reasonably be expected to
give rise to any material liability of the Company or its Subsidiaries under

Rights owned, licensed, distributed or used by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in their respective businesses as conducted in the past six (6)
years or as currently conducted (" _Company IP Claim_ "), including any
Company IP Claim that alleges that the operation of any such businesses
infringes, misappropriates, impairs, dilutes or otherwise violates the rights
of any Person or contests the validity, use, ownership, enforceability or
registrability of any Intellectual Property Rights owned by the Company, and
the Company and its Subsidiaries are not subject to any outstanding
injunction, judgment, order, decree, ruling, charge, settlement, or other
dispute involving any PersonÂ’s Intellectual Property Rights. To the knowledge
of the Company, no Person has infringed, misappropriated or otherwise
violated, or is infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating, any
Intellectual Property Rights owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in any material respect, and, in the past (6) years, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has brought or threatened any Company IP Claims
against any Person that remains unresolved.

developed or otherwise created any part of any item covered by material
Intellectual Property Rights intended to be owned by the Company or its
Subsidiaries, either (i) to be a party to an agreement that conveys or
obligates such Person to convey to the Company or its Subsidiaries any and all
right, title and interest in and to all Intellectual Property Rights developed
or otherwise created by such Person in connection with such PersonÂ’s
employment or engagement on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (ii) as
to works and all other Intellectual Property Rights created in the course of
such PersonÂ’s employment with or engagement on behalf of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, in each case which works or Intellectual Property Rights are
eligible to be "works for hire," to execute an agreement acknowledging that
the works are "works for hire" and otherwise assigning to the Company or its
Subsidiaries all rights, title and interest in such works and other
Intellectual Property Rights, and/or (iii) to ensure that such Intellectual
Property Rights otherwise have by operation of law vested in the Company or
its Subsidiaries any and all right, title and interest in and to all such
Intellectual Property Rights developed or otherwise created by such Person in
connection with such PersonÂ’s employment with, or engagement on behalf of the
Company or its Subsidiaries. 

(d) To the knowledge of the Company, in the last eighteen (18) months, there
have been no material failures, breakdowns, continued substandard performance
or other adverse events affecting any software, hardware or computer systems
owned, leased or licensed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including
any used to provide Company products and services or to otherwise operate its
business (" _Company Systems_ "), that in any such case have caused or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and
its Subsidiaries maintain commercially reasonable security, disaster recovery
and business continuity plans, procedures and facilities, use commercially

Return), and (iii) duly withheld and paid all material Taxes required by
applicable law to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid
or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, or other third
party. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries currently is the
beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return. No
written claim has been made by any Tax Authority in a jurisdiction where the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries does not file Tax returns that it is or
may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. The liabilities and reserves
for Taxes (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect
timing differences between book and Tax income) reflected on the face of the
balance sheet included in the Company Reports (rather than in any notes
thereto) are adequate to cover the unpaid Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for all periods ending at or prior to the date of such balance
sheet, and the unpaid Taxes of the Company will not exceed such liabilities
and reserves as adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date in
the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practices. There are
no Liens for Taxes upon any property or asset of either of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, except for Permitted Liens for Taxes. No audit or
administrative or judicial Tax proceeding is pending or being conducted with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary has received any written notice indicating an intent to
open an audit or other review, a request for information related to Tax
matters, or notice of deficiency or proposed adjustment for any amount of
material Tax proposed, asserted or assessed. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has waived any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or
agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or
deficiency. The Company has made available to Parent correct and complete
copies of all federal income Tax Returns and all other material Tax Returns
filed prior to the date hereof for the years 2009 through 2011 and for all
other open years. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
request for a ruling in respect of Taxes pending before any Tax Authority.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement
providing for the allocation or sharing of Taxes with or, pursuant
to Treasury Regulations section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state,
local, or non-U.S. law) or otherwise, is liable for the Taxes of, any entity
other than the Company or a Company Subsidiary (excluding customary Tax
indemnification provisions in commercial Contracts not primarily relating to
Taxes). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a transaction
during the last two (2) years which the parties treated as a distribution to
which Section 355 of the Code applied. Except as set forth on _Section 3.18
of the Company Disclosure Schedule_, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries will be required to include any item of income in, or exclude
any item of deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period (or portion
thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result of any (A) change in method
of accounting for a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date,
(B) "closing agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any
corresponding or similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S. law) executed
on or prior to the Closing Date, (C) intercompany transactions or any excess
loss account described in Treasury Regulations section 1502 (or any
corresponding or similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S. law), (D)
installment sale or open transaction disposition made on or prior to the
Closing Date, (E) prepaid amount received on or prior to the Closing Date or
(F) election under Section 108(i) of the Code. Except as expressly set forth
in _Section 3.12_, this  _Section 3.18_ constitutes all of the
representations and warranties of the Company with respect to Taxes, and no
other representation or warranty in this Agreement shall be construed to apply
to any matter relating to Taxes.

 

3.19 _Anti-Takeover Law Inapplicable_. Subject to the accuracy of the
representation set forth in _Section 4.6_ hereof, the Company Board has
approved this Agreement and the Transactions, including, to the extent the
persons that have entered into a Voting Agreement collectively hold shares of
Common Stock representing fifteen percent (15%) or more than the total number
of currently outstanding shares of Common Stock, the approval of the Voting
Agreements, and such approval is sufficient to

 



20  render inapplicable to the Transactions any anti-takeover restrictions set
forth in Section 203 of the DGCL and any other similar applicable restrictions
contained in any similar statute or regulation of any jurisdiction which
applies or purports to apply to any such transactions. No other "fair price,"
"moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other anti-takeover statute or
regulation (each, a " _Takeover Statute_ "), is, or at the Effective Time
would reasonably be expected to be, applicable to the Shares or the
Transactions.

3.20 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Company Financial Advisor (as defined
below) has rendered to the Company Board its opinion to the effect that, as of

contained therein.

outstanding, and has not arranged any outstanding, "extensions of credit" to
directors or executive officers within the meaning of Section 402 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Except for the Material Contracts or as set forth in the
Company Reports, no officer or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries nor any member of any such individualÂ’s immediate family (whether

such Person) is presently, or within the past twelve (12) months has been, a
party to any transaction or contract with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

3.22 _Insurance_.  _Section 3.22 of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ sets
forth all insurance policies maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries
(the " _Company Insurance Policies_ "). All of the Company Insurance Policies
are in full force and effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
is in material breach or default, and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has taken any action or failed to take any action which, with
notice or the lapse of time, would constitute such a breach or default, or
permit termination of any of the Company Insurance Policies. No written notice
of cancellation or termination has been received by the Company with respect
to any such Company Insurance Policy other than as is customary in connection
with renewals of existing Company Insurance Policies.

3.23 _Advisors Â’ Fees_. Except for Morgan Stanley and Co. LLC (the " _Company
Financial Advisor_ "), there is no investment banker, broker, finder,
financial advisor or other intermediary that has been retained by or is
authorized to act on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is

21  sharing, disposition or other use of any personal or sensitive data (whether
cross border or to any Person)), have completed all agreements and filings or
notifications with all applicable Governmental Entities or otherwise as
required under applicable Law, and have kept the data secure and confidential
at all times as required under applicable Law, and the Transactions will not
result in Parent, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to be in breach or
violation of any such data privacy or other applicable Laws.

(c) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary nor, to the knowledge of
the Company, any director, officer, agent, employee or other Person acting on

merchantability, suitability or fitness for a particular purpose of any of
the assets used in the business or held by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (ii) makes any representation or warranty, express or
implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the business conducted by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, in each case except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement or as and to the extent required by this Agreement to be set forth
in the Company Disclosure Schedule. Except for the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement (as modified by the Company Disclosure
Schedule), the Company disclaims all liability and responsibility for any

Company Subsidiary or any Company Representative has received a _bona fide_
written Acquisition Proposal involving the Company from a third party or

Company Subsidiaries or the Company Representatives and that did not otherwise
result from a breach of this  _Section 5.6_ in any material respect, and
(ii) the Company Board determines after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside counsel, that (A) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal and (B) the failure
to take such action would be inconsistent with the directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, then the Company may (1) furnish information (including
non-public information) with respect to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to the Person or group of Persons making such Acquisition
Proposal and to his, her, its or their respective Representatives (including
their respective potential financing sources), and (2) engage in or otherwise
participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person or group of Persons
making such Acquisition Proposal and his, her, its or their respective
Representatives (including their respective potential financing sources)

not, and will not allow the Company Subsidiaries and the Company
Representatives to, disclose any information to such Person or group of
Persons without such Person or each member of such group of Persons first
entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the Company, and

material information concerning the Company or the Company Subsidiaries

securing the Company Stockholder Approval (i) the Company receives a _bona
fide_ written Acquisition Proposal involving the Company from a third party or
group of third party Persons that was not solicited by the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries or the Company Representatives and that did not
otherwise result from a breach of this _Section 5.6_ in any material respect,
and (ii) the Company Board determines, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside counsel, that (A) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
a Superior Proposal and (B) the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then
the Company Board may (1) effect a Change of Company Board Recommendation
with respect to such Superior Proposal or (2) terminate this Agreement to
enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, if
and only if, prior to taking any such action described in the preceding
clause (1) or clause (2), (x) the Company provides prior written notice to
Parent at least three (3) Business Days in advance of taking any such action,
which notice shall state the CompanyÂ’s intention to take such action and
shall include the identity of the Person making the Superior Proposal and
copies of all relevant documents relating to such Superior Proposal provided

respective Representatives (including copies of all draft agreements and any
other written materials provided to the Company, any of the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives to the extent such
material contains any financial terms, conditions or other material terms
relating to such Superior Proposal), (y) the Company shall, and shall cause
the Company Subsidiaries to, and shall instruct and use its reasonable best
efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, negotiate with Parent
and its Representatives in good faith during such three (3) Business Day
period (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal
would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal (provided, that in the event
that such Acquisition Proposal is modified by the Person making the
Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new notice
pursuant to the 

 



30  preceding clause (x) and shall again comply with this clause (y)) and (z)
the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement offered by Parent and shall have
determined, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal would continue to constitute a
Superior Proposal if such changes offered by Parent were to be given effect.

5.6(d) _unless in advance of or concurrently with such termination the Company
pays the Termination Fee and otherwise complies with the provisions of

Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to the receipt of Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may grant a waiver or release under,
or determine not to enforce any standstill agreement of the Company if the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
the directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Other than in connection
with a Superior Proposal (which shall be subject to _Section 5.6(d)_ and
shall not be subject to this _Section 5.6(e)_), the Company Board may take
any action prohibited by clauses (iii) and (iv) of _Section 5.6(a)_ (an "
_Intervening Event Change of Recommendation_ ") only in response to an
Intervening Event and only if (i) the Company Board determines, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, that the failure
to effect an Intervening Event Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent
with the directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (ii) (A) the
Company provides prior written notice to Parent at least three (3) Business
Days in advance of effecting an Intervening Event Change of Recommendation,
which notice shall specify the Intervening Event in reasonable detail, (B) the
Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, and shall instruct
and use its reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives
to, negotiate with Parent and its Representatives in good faith during such
three (3) Business Day period (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to
make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would
permit the Company Board not to effect the Intervening Event Change of
Recommendation (provided, that in the event that any material change to the
facts and circumstances relating to such Intervening Event shall occur,
the Company shall be required to deliver a new notice pursuant to the
preceding clause (A) and shall again comply with this clause (B)) and (C) the
Company Board shall have considered in good faith any adjustments in the terms
and conditions of this Agreement offered by Parent and shall have determined,
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, that such
Intervening Event would continue to necessitate an Intervening Event Change of
Recommendation if such changes offered by Parent were to be given effect.

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.6_ shall prohibit the Company Board
from (i) disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act; or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of
the Company if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company (for
the avoidance of doubt, it being agreed that the issuance by the Company or
the Company Board of a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of
its position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under
the Exchange Act shall not constitute a Change of Company Board
Recommendation); _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything in
this _Section 5.6(f)_, the Company Board shall not make a Change of Company
Board Recommendation or Intervening Event Change of Recommendation except in
accordance with _Section 5.6(d)_ or _Section 5.6(e)_, respectively.

(g) The Company agrees that in the event any of its Subsidiaries or
Representatives takes any action which, if taken by the Company, would
constitute a breach of this _Section 5.6_, the Company shall be deemed to be
in breach of this _Section 5.6_.

 



31 5.7 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 

(a) The Company and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action and do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or
otherwise to consummate and make effective, the Merger and the other
Transactions, including transactions under the Voting Agreements, as promptly
as practicable, (ii) obtain from any Governmental Entities any consents,
licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required or
advisable to be obtained by Parent or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, or to avoid any action or proceeding by any Governmental
Entity, in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, (iii) cause the
satisfaction of all conditions set forth in  _Article 6_ , (iv) vigorously
defend all lawsuits or other legal, regulatory or other proceedings to which
it is a party challenging or affecting this Agreement or the consummation of
the Transactions, in each case until the issuance of a final, non-appealable
order, (v) seek to have lifted or rescinded any injunction or restraining
order which may adversely affect the ability of the parties to consummate the
Transactions, in each case until the issuance of a final, non-appealable
order, and (vi) (A) as promptly as practicable, and in any event within ten
(10) Business Days after the date hereof, make or cause to be made an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to this Agreement and the Merger and (B) as promptly as
practicable, and in any event within thirty (30) calendar days after the date
hereof, make or cause to be made all necessary and advisable applications and
filings and/or engage with such Governmental Entity after consultation with
the other party, and, in each case, thereafter make any other required or
advisable submissions, and pay any fees due in connection therewith; provided,
that the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in connection
with determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any
Governmental Entity is required or advisable in connection with the
consummation of the Merger and seeking any such actions, consents, approvals
or waivers or making any such filings. The Company and Parent shall furnish to
each other all information required for any application or other filing under
the rules and regulations of any applicable Law in connection with
the Transactions. Parent shall not pull and re-file any notification to any
Governmental Entity or consent to any voluntary delay of the Closing at the
behest of any Governmental Entity without first notifying and consulting with
the Company. Each of Parent and the Company shall not, except as may be
consented to in writing by the other party, directly or indirectly through one
or more of its controlled affiliates, take any action, including acquiring or
making any investment in any corporation, partnership, limited liability
company or other business organization or any division or assets thereof, that
would reasonably be expected to cause a material delay in the satisfaction of
the conditions contained in _Article 6_ or the consummation of the Merger.
Without limiting this _Section 5.7(a)_, Parent agrees to take, or cause to be
taken, any and all steps and to make, or cause to be made, any and all
undertakings necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under
any antitrust, merger control, competition, or trade regulation Law or any
other Law applicable to the Company, any Company Subsidiary or the Merger that
may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as
to enable the Effective Time and the Closing, respectively, to occur as
promptly as practicable (and in any event, no later than the Extended Outside
Date (as defined below)), including (A) proposing, negotiating, committing to,
and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the
sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition of such assets or businesses of
Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or (B)
accepting any operational restrictions, including restrictions on the ability
to change rates or charges or standards of service, or otherwise taking or
committing to take actions that limit ParentÂ’s or any Parent SubsidiaryÂ’s
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain or freely
operate, any of the assets, properties licenses, rights, product lines,
operations or businesses of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries (collectively, " _Remedies_ "), in each case as may be required
in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the lifting or dissolution of,
any injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order in any suit or
proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying
the Effective Time or the Closing, as applicable, unless such Remedies,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have

 



32  a material and adverse impact on (1) the business, financial condition or
results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
or (2) the reasonably expected benefits to Parent of completing the Merger,
which reasonably expected benefits shall be measured at a level of those
reasonably likely to have a material and adverse impact on the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and not at the level or measure of what would
be reasonably likely to have a material and adverse impact on Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (such a material and adverse impact, a "
_Material Adverse Impact_ ").

 

(b) The Company and Parent shall give (or shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use, commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
third party consents (i) necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Merger and the other Transactions, including transactions under the
Voting Agreements, or (ii) disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule;
_provided_ , _however_ that the Company and Parent shall coordinate and
cooperate in determining whether any actions, consents, approvals or waivers
are required to be obtained from parties to any Material Contracts in
connection with consummation of the Merger and in seeking any such actions,
consents, approvals or waivers. In the event that either party shall fail to
obtain any third party consent described in this _Section 5.7(b)_, such
party shall use commercially reasonable efforts, and shall take any such
actions reasonably requested by the other party hereto, to minimize any
adverse effect upon the Company and Parent, their respective Subsidiaries,
and their respective businesses resulting, or which could reasonably be
expected to result, after the Effective Time, as applicable, from the failure
to obtain such consent.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
5.7_, each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties prompt notice of
the making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or
legal proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Merger or any of the other Transactions, including transactions under the
Voting Agreements; (ii) keep the other parties informed as to the status of
any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding; and
(iii) promptly inform the other parties of any communication to or from
the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or any other
Governmental Entity regarding the Merger. Each party hereto will consult and
cooperate with the other parties and will consider in good faith the views of
the other parties in connection with any filing, analysis, appearance,
presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or
submitted in connection with the Merger, or any of the other Transactions,
including transactions under the Voting Agreements. In addition, except as
may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any Law, in connection with
any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding, each
party hereto will permit authorized representatives of the other parties to
be present at each meeting or conference relating to such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or legal proceeding and to have access to and be
consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or
submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding.

5.8 _Certain Notices; Supplemental Disclosure_.

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each
party hereto shall promptly notify the other party hereto of (a) the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event that would be likely to cause any
condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied, or (b) the
failure of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, to comply
with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which would reasonably be expected
to result in any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement not to be
satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this _Section 5.8(a)_ shall not cure any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or otherwise limit
or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving
such notice.

 



33 (b) Until the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall have the
obligation to promptly supplement the information contained in their
respective disclosure schedules attached hereto, for informational purposes
only, with respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered which, if in
existence on the date hereof and known at the date of this Agreement, would
have been required to be set forth or described in such disclosure schedules.
Neither the supplementation of the disclosure schedules pursuant to the
obligation in _Section 5.8(b)_ nor any other disclosure after the date
hereof of an inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement made or contained in this Agreement shall affect any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made or contained herein
or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to any party
hereto.

5.9 _Public Announcements_. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and
Merger Sub, on the other hand, agree that, from the date hereof through the
Closing Date, no public release or announcement concerning the Transactions
shall be issued or made by any party without the prior consent of the other
party or parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except (i) as such release or announcement may be
required by law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United
States securities exchange, in which case the party required to make the
release or announcement shall allow the other party or parties reasonable time
to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance, (ii)
that each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and their respective
affiliates may make such an announcement to their respective employees,
customers and suppliers, after consultation with the other parties, and (iii)
with respect to any Change of Company Board Recommendation or Intervening
Event Change of Recommendation or other action taken pursuant to _Section
5.6(f)_.

 

5.10 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time (the " _Benefit
Protection Period_ "), Parent shall either (i) assume and maintain, or cause
the Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to assume and
maintain, for the benefit of the employees of the Company and Company
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time who remain employed
immediately following the Effective Time (the " _Company Employees_ " and
each individually a " _Company Employee_ "), the Company Benefit Plans (other
than the Company Equity Plans) at the benefit levels in effect on the date of
this Agreement and provide or cause the Parent Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Corporation, to provide compensation and benefits to each Company
Employee under the Company Benefit Plans or other employee benefit plans or
compensation arrangements of Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries that
have a value sufficient to replace the value of the compensation and benefits
(other than any equity based compensation or benefits) provided to such
Company Employee under the Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than any equity based compensation or benefits), or
(ii) provide or cause the Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, to provide compensation and benefits (other than any equity based
compensation or benefits) to the Company Employees that, taken as a whole
(other than any equity based compensation or benefits), has a value that is
not less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation and benefits (other
than any equity based compensation or benefits) provided to the Company
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) Without limiting the generality of  _Section 5.10(a)_, from and after
the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries,
including the Surviving Corporation, to, assume, honor and continue without
unilateral amendment (unless required by applicable Law) during the Benefit
Protection Period (or, if sooner, until all obligations thereunder have been
satisfied), all of the

 



34  CompanyÂ’s employment, severance, retention and change in control obligations
under the offer letters and related documents and the Change in Control Bonus
Plan set forth in  _Section 3.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_,
including with respect to any payments, benefits or rights arising as a result
of the Transactions (either alone or in combination with any other event).

 

(c) With respect to any "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA, maintained by Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Corporation (including any vacation, paid time-off and severance
plans, but other than any equity based plan) that replaces a comparable
Company Benefit Plan and in which a Company Employee is eligible
to participate following the Effective Time, for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, level of benefits, and vesting, each Company
EmployeeÂ’s service with the Company or any Company Subsidiary (as well as
service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, to the extent service with the predecessor employer is recognized
by the Company or such Company Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with
Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, to the extent recognized prior to the Effective Time for similar
purposes under an equivalent Company Benefit Plan; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition
would result in any duplication of benefits or compensation.

(d) Parent shall, or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Corporation, to waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing
condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting
periods under any medical, dental or health benefit plan maintained by Parent
or any of the Parent Subsidiaries in which U.S. Company Employees (and their
eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate and that replaces an
equivalent Company Benefit Plan that is a health benefit plan in the plan year
in which the Effective Time occurs, except to the extent that such pre-
existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and
waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable
Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall,
or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation,
to, use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize, or cause to be
recognized, the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar
expenses incurred by each U.S. Company Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for
purposes of satisfying such yearÂ’s deductible and co-payment limitations
under the medical, dental or health benefit plan in which such U.S. Company
Employee (and dependents) will be eligible to participate and that replaces a
Company Benefit Plan that is a medical, dental or health benefit plan
(as applicable) in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs.

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.10_, express or implied: (i) shall
be construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement, policy, contract or arrangement, (ii) subject to
compliance with the other provisions of this  _Section 5.10_, shall alter or
limit the ability of Parent or any of its affiliates (including, following the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation) to amend, modify or terminate any benefit
or compensation plan, program, agreement, policy, contract or arrangement at
any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them, (iii)
is intended to confer upon any Person (including any Company Employee) any
right to employment or continued employment for any period of time by reason
of this Agreement, or any right to a particular term or condition of
employment, or shall in any way limit the ability of Parent or any of its
affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) to
terminate the employment of any employee (including any Company Employee) at
any time and for any or no reason, or (iv) is intended to confer upon any
Person (including any Company Employee) any rights as a third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement. 

(f) The Company shall take such actions as are reasonably necessary or
appropriate to terminate the CompanyÂ’s 401(k) plan in accordance with the
terms of such plan and the

 



35  requirements of applicable Law, with such termination to be effective at
least one day prior to the Closing Date, and the Company shall provide to
Parent at least one day prior to the Closing Date written evidence (in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent) of such termination. As soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing, each Company Employee shall become eligible
to participate in ParentÂ’s 401(k) plan subject to and in accordance with its
terms and shall, at the participantÂ’s election, be able to roll over such
participantÂ’s outstanding participant loan and related promissory note under
the CompanyÂ’s 401(k) plan to ParentÂ’s 401(k) plan to the extent such loan
constitutes part of an "eligible rollover distribution" as defined in Section
402(c)(4) of the Code. During the period commencing on the Closing Date and
ending at the time of the rollover or other distribution of such promissory
notes and related account balances, such loans shall continue to be maintained
under the CompanyÂ’s 401(k) plan, and Parent shall make payroll deductions in
respect of required payments under any such loan and timely remit
such amounts to the CompanyÂ’s 401(k) plan as payments on such loan. During
such period, _provided_ that the participant continues to make all required
installment payments with respect to such loan, such loan shall not be placed
in default. 

5.11 _Takeover Laws_. If any "control share acquisition", "fair price",
"business combination", or other anti-takeover Law becomes or is deemed to be
applicable to the Merger, including the acquisition of Shares pursuant
thereto, or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then the
Company and the Company Board shall take all action reasonably available to
it to render such Law inapplicable to the foregoing.

5.12 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

(a) For a period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless all past
and present directors and officers of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, arising out of acts or omissions
in their capacity as directors or officers of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, advance reasonable
expenses in a timely fashion (including reasonable legal fees and expenses)
incurred in the defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation with respect to the matters subject to indemnification pursuant
to this _Section 5.12(a)_; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the director or
officer to whom expenses are advanced undertakes to repay such advanced
expenses to Parent and the Surviving Corporation if it is ultimately
determined that such director or officer is not entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this _Section 5.12(a)_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, if any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made against such persons
with respect to matters subject to indemnification or expense advancement
hereunder on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time,
the provisions of this _Section 5.12(a)_ shall continue in effect until the
final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.
Any Person wishing to claim indemnification under this _Section 5.12(a)_,
upon learning of any such claim, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but
the failure to so notify Parent shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving
Corporation of any liability it may have to such Person except to the extent
such failure materially prejudiced the indemnifying party. Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement or compromise
effected without their prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed.

 

(b) For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the
Company for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than are currently set
forth in the CompanyÂ’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws. The
indemnification agreements, if any, in existence

 



36  on the date of this Agreement with any of the directors or officers of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary and set forth in _Section 3.14 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule_ shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation,
without any further action, and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms following the Effective Time.

(c) For the benefit of the CompanyÂ’s directors and officers, the Company shall
be permitted, prior to the Effective Time, to obtain and fully pay the premium
for a "tail" insurance policy that provides coverage for a period of six (6)
years from and after the Effective Time for events occurring prior to the
Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is substantially equivalent to
and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate than the CompanyÂ’s
existing policy (true and complete copies which have been previously provided
to Parent) or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable,
the best available coverage;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in each case, the
Company shall not pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of
three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid prior to the date
of this Agreement. If the Company is unable to purchase such DandO Insurance
prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, as of the Effective Time, obtain and fully
pay the premium for DandO Insurance that is substantially equivalent to and in
any event not less favorable in the aggregate than the CompanyÂ’s existing
policy (true and complete copies which have been previously provided to
Parent) or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable,
the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO
Insurance in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual
premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement, but in such case shall
purchase as much coverage as is available for such amount. The Surviving
Corporation shall maintain such policies in full force and effect, and
continue to honor the obligations thereunder for a period of not less than
six (6) years from and after the Effective Time.

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper
provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or
entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this  _Section 5.12_.

(e) The obligations under this _Section 5.12_ shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any past or present
directors or officers of the Company to whom this _Section 5.12_ applies
without the consent of such affected Person (it being expressly agreed that
the persons to whom this  _Section 5.12_ applies are express third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 5.12_).

(f) In the event of any breach by the Surviving Corporation or Parent of this
_Section 5.12_, the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall, jointly and
severally, be obligated to pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable
attorneysÂ’ fees, that may be incurred by any past or present directors or
officers of the Company in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations
provided in this _Section 5.12_ as such fees are incurred upon the written
request of such person.

 

5.13 _Parent Agreements Concerning Merger Sub_. Parent shall, immediately
following execution of this Agreement, adopt this Agreement in its capacity
as sole stockholder of Merger Sub and shall, upon the CompanyÂ’s request,
deliver to the Company evidence of its vote or action by written consent
approving and adopting this Agreement in accordance with applicable Law and
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub.

5.14 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board
and the Parent Board, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors
thereof, shall adopt resolutions

 



37  consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the disposition
by any Person who is a covered person of the Company for purposes of Section
16 of the Exchange Act (" _Section 16_ ") of Shares or other Equity Interests
in the Company (including Company Options) pursuant to this Agreement shall be
an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16\. The Company shall provide
copies of such resolutions to Parent.

5.15 _Stockholder Litigation_. In the event that any litigation or claim
relating to this Agreement or the Transactions (" _Transaction Litigation_ ")
is brought against the Company and/or its directors or officers, the Company
shall promptly notify Parent of any such Transaction Litigation and shall keep
Parent informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall
cooperate with Parent in connection with, and shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of, any Transaction
Litigation, and no settlement in connection with any Transaction Litigation
shall be agreed to prior to the Effective Time without ParentÂ’s prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned); _provided_ , _however_ , that no settlement requiring a payment
or an admission of wrongdoing by a director shall be agreed without such
directorÂ’s consent.

5.16  _De-registration_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Law (including
the rules and regulations of NASDAQ) to cause the delisting of the Common
Stock from the NASDAQ and the de-registration of the Common Stock and other
securities of the Company, as applicable, under the Exchange Act as promptly
as practicable after the Effective Time.

5.17 _Company Indebtedness_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, if requested by Parent, the Company shall, and
shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, and shall instruct and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Representatives to, take all
reasonable actions to (a) obtain any waivers or consents from lenders or
other Persons necessary, proper or advisable in connection with any credit
agreement or other agreement relating to any indebtedness of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, including with respect to any securitization program
or variable funding note facility in which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary participates, and/or (b) arrange for, at the Closing, the
termination of any credit agreement or other agreement relating to, and the
repayment of, any indebtedness of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and
the procurement of customary payoff letters in connection therewith, including
with respect to any securitization program or variable funding note facility
in which the Company or any Company Subsidiary participates, and shall make
arrangements for the release of all Liens over any property or asset of the
Company and any Company Subsidiary securing obligations under any
such indebtedness.

5.18 _FIRPTA Affidavit_. On the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to
Parent an affidavit, under penalties of perjury, stating that the Company is
not and has not been a United States real property holding corporation, dated
as of the Closing Date and in form and substance required under Treasury
Regulations section 1.897-2(h), together with evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Parent that the Company has provided notice to the Internal
Revenue Service in accordance with the provisions of Treasury Regulations
section 1.897-2(h)(2).

purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement.

 



51 8.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

8.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits, Parent
Disclosure Schedule and Company Disclosure Schedule and the other documents
delivered pursuant hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement of the parties and supersede all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof and, except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights
or remedies hereunder.

8.9  _Assignment_. The Agreement shall not be assigned by any party by
operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other
parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
Merger Sub may assign this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent; _provided_ , _further_ , that no such assignment shall
relieve the assigning party of any of its obligations hereunder.

 

8.10 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors
and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than, after the
Effective Time (a) any Persons entitled to indemnification or other rights
under the provisions of _Section 5.12_ (Indemnification of Directors and
Officers), with respect to such provisions, who shall be entitled to enforce
their rights under this Agreement as third-party beneficiaries, and (b) the
stockholders of the Company with respect to the right of such stockholders to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement.

 

8.11 _Mutual Drafting; Interpretation_. Each party hereto has participated in
the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result
of extensive negotiations between the parties. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the
singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine gender
shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender shall
include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall include
masculine and feminine genders. As used in this Agreement, the words "include"
and "including," and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of
limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement
to "Sections," "Exhibits" and "Schedules" are intended to refer to Sections
of this Agreement and Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement. All references
in this Agreement to "$" are intended to refer to U.S. dollars. Unless
otherwise specifically provided for herein, the term "or" shall not be deemed
to be exclusive.

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether at Law, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or
relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof,
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the

 



52  Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to Laws that may be applicable
under conflicts of laws principles (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Delaware Court of Chancery and any appellate court from thereof in the State
of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the
State of Delaware and any appellate court from any thereof), in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements
delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto,
and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not
to commence any such action or proceeding except in such court, (ii) agrees
that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in such court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally
and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to
the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in such court, and (iv)
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in such court located
in Delaware. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any
such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.
Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the
manner provided for notices in Section 8.3. Nothing in this Agreement will
affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other
manner permitted by Law.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH
WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 8.12(c)_.

8.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. The exchange
of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile or
by electronic delivery in .pdf format shall be sufficient to bind the parties
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

8.14 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to
consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms
or otherwise

 



53  breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that each party
hereto shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Without
limitation of the foregoing and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the parties hereby further acknowledge and agree that prior
to the Closing, the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of, and to prevent or cure
breaches of, the terms and provisions of this Agreement. Each party hereto
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that (x) the other party
has an adequate remedy at law, or (y) an award of specific performance is not
an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

(b) The parties further agree that (x) the seeking of the remedies provided
for in _Section 8.14(a)_ shall not in any respect constitute a waiver by any
party seeking such remedies of its respective right to seek any other form of
relief that may be available to it under this Agreement, including under
_Section 7.2_, in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the
event that the remedies provided for in _Section 8.14(a)_ are not available
or otherwise are not granted, and (y) nothing set forth in this Agreement
shall require a party to institute any proceeding for specific performance
under _Section 8.14(a)_ prior to or as a condition to exercising any
termination right under _Article 7_ (and pursuing damages after such
termination), nor shall the commencement of any legal proceeding pursuant to
_Section 8.14(a)_ or anything set forth in this _Section 8.14(b)_ restrict
or limit a partyÂ’s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the
terms of _Article 7_ or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that
may be available then or thereafter.

8.15 _Obligations of Parent and the Company_. Whenever this Agreement requires
Merger Sub to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an
undertaking on the part of Parent to cause Merger Sub to take such action.
Whenever this Agreement requires a Company Subsidiary to take any action, such
requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the
Company to cause such Company Subsidiary to take such action.
