-v- AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is entered into as of
March 1, 2006, by and among Dassault Systemes Corp., a Delaware corporation
(the "Buyer"), DS Newco Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Buyer (the "Transitory Subsidiary"), and MatrixOne, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"). 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary and
the Company have each determined that it is advisable and in the best
interests of each corporation and their respective stockholders that the Buyer
acquire the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein; and

WHEREAS, the acquisition of the Company shall be effected through a merger
(the "Merger") of the Transitory Subsidiary with and into the Company in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), as a result of which the Company shall become a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below, and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary and the Company
agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

1.1 _Effective Time of the Merger_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, prior to the Closing, the Buyer and the Company shall
jointly prepare, and immediately following the Closing the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware, a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") in such
form as is required by, and executed by the Company in accordance with, the
relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings
required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of
the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or at such later time as is established by the Buyer and the Company
and set forth in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time").

1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at
10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on a date to be specified by the Buyer and the
Company (the "Closing Date"), which shall be no later than the second Business
Day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII
(other than delivery of items to be delivered at the Closing and other than
satisfaction of those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, it being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall
remain subject to the delivery of such items and the satisfaction or waiver of
such conditions at the Closing), at the offices of Wilmer Cutler Pickering
Hale and Dorr LLP, 60 State Street, Boston, Massachusetts, unless another
date, place or time is agreed to in writing by the Buyer and the Company. For
purposes of this Agreement, a "Business Day" shall be any day other than (a)
a Saturday or Sunday or (b) a day on which banking institutions located in
Boston, Massachusetts are permitted or required by law, executive order or
governmental decree to remain closed. 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time (a) the separate existence
of the Transitory Subsidiary shall cease and the Transitory Subsidiary shall
be merged with and into the Company (the Company following the Merger is
sometimes referred to herein as the "Surviving Corporation") and (b) the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company as in effect on the date of this
Agreement shall be amended so that the authorized capital stock provided for
by such Certificate of Incorporation consists solely of 1,000 shares of common
stock, and, as so amended, such Certificate of Incorporation shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until further
amended in accordance with the DGCL. In addition, subject to Section 6.8(b)
hereof, the Buyer shall cause the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation to be
amended and restated in their entirety so that, immediately following the
Effective Time, they are identical to the By-laws of the Transitory Subsidiary
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that
all references to the name of the Transitory Subsidiary therein shall be
changed to refer to the name of the Company, and, as so amended and restated,
such By-laws shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation, until further
amended in accordance with the DGCL. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

1.4 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

(a) The directors of the Transitory Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation,
each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and
By-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) The officers of the Transitory Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation,
each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and
By-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Buyer, the Transitory
Subsidiary, the Company or the holder of any shares of the capital stock of
the Company or capital stock of the Transitory Subsidiary:

(a) _Capital Stock of the Transitory Subsidiary_. Each share of the common
stock of the Transitory Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Buyer-Owned Stock_. All shares of
common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company ("Company Common
Stock") that are owned by the Company as treasury stock or by any wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by the
Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of
the Buyer immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
shall cease to exist and no payment or distribution or other consideration
shall be delivered with respect thereto.



 

-2- (c) _Merger Consideration for Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.2,
each share of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section
2.4(a) below)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be automatically converted into the right to receive $7.25 in cash per
share, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective
Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) upon the
surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.2, without
interest.

2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the
Merger are as follows:

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer shall
deposit with Computershare, Inc. or another bank or trust company mutually
acceptable to the Buyer and the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Stock
Options, as the case may be, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, for payment through the Exchange Agent in accordance with this Section
2.2, cash in an amount sufficient to make payment of the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and the Option Consideration pursuant to Section
2.3 in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and
in respect of the termination of the Company Stock Options (the "Exchange
Fund").

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly (and in any event within five Business
Days) after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail to each holder of record of a certificate which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
entitled to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c) (each, a
"Certificate") (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in a form
reasonably acceptable to the Company and shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and compliance with
the standard procedures of the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration payable with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a Certificate
for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be paid promptly in
exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration
may be paid to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is presented to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to  



 

-3-  evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.2. In addition,
promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Exchange Agent to pay to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder
of record of Company Stock Options, the Option Consideration to which such
person is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates evidencing
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be
deemed to have been paid in satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Company Common Stock. At the close of business on the day of the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common
Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. At any time following the twelfth month
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any amounts in the Exchange Fund
which remain undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock or Company
Stock Options (including, without limitation, all interest and other income
received by the Exchange Agent in respect of all funds made available to it)
and, thereafter, any holder of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options
who has not previously complied with this Article II shall be entitled to look
to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and
other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to any
Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates held by them or Option Consideration that may be payable to
them.

(e) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of the
Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law. 

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "Code"), or any other applicable state, local or foreign tax
law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation
or the Buyer, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted
by the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, to the
applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company
Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
the Surviving Corporation or the Buyer, as the case may be.



 

-4- (g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Article
II; provided, however, that the Buyer or the Exchange Agent may require the
delivery of a reasonable indemnity or bond against any claim that may be made
against the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate or
ownership thereof.

2.3 _Company Stock Plans_.

(a) The Company shall take all reasonable action to, as of the Effective Time,
terminate all outstanding options to purchase Company Common Stock
(the "Company Stock Options") granted under all stock option plans or other
equity-related plans of the Company (including the stock plans listed in
Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule but not including the
Company ESPP), each as amended through the date of this Agreement (the
"Company Stock Plans"). Subject to the foregoing, each holder of a Company
Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised at the Effective Time,
whether or not then exercisable or vested, shall be entitled to receive from
the Exchange Agent on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, immediately after
the Effective Time, in exchange for the cancellation of such Company Stock
Option, an amount in cash equal to the excess of (i) the Merger Consideration
over (ii) the per share exercise price of such Company Stock Option,
multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option as of the Effective Time (the "Option Consideration").
Any such payment shall be subject to all applicable federal, state, local and
foreign tax or social charges withholding requirements. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall be responsible for delivering to the Exchange Agent
(i) a list of holders of Company Stock Options, (ii) calculations showing the
respective amount of Option Consideration for each Company Stock Option, and
(iii) such information as is reasonably requested by the Exchange Agent and
in the Companys possession and necessary to ensure proper withholding.

(b) The Company shall take all action reasonably necessary to approve the
disposition of the Company Stock Options in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement so as to exempt such dispositions under Rule
16b-3 of the Exchange Act.

(c) The Company shall terminate its 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
"Company ESPP") in accordance with its terms as of the last day of the
current Payment Period, as defined in such plan, that ends on or before the
Effective Time.

2.4 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and which are held by a holder who has not voted in favor
of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has made a demand for
appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL (any such shares collectively being referred to as
"Dissenting Shares" until such time as such holder fails to perfect or
otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL
with respect to such shares) shall not be  



 

-5-  converted into or represent the right to receive Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.1, but shall be entitled only to such rights as
are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares.

(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the
date of loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be converted into
and shall represent only the right to receive Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.1, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the
Certificate formerly representing such shares.

(c) The Company shall give the Buyer: (i) prompt notice of any written demand
for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
the DGCL, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or
instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
the DGCL that relate to such demand; and (ii) the opportunity to direct (with
the assistance and cooperation of the Company) all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. The
Company shall not make any payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective
Time with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument unless the Buyer
shall have given its written consent to such payment or settlement offer.

ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

The Company represents and warrants to the Buyer and the
Transitory Subsidiary that the statements contained in this Article III are
true and correct, except as set forth herein or in the disclosure schedule
delivered by the Company to the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary and dated
as of the date of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"). The
Company Disclosure Schedule and the information and disclosures contained
therein are intended only to qualify and limit the representations, warranties
and covenants of the Company contained in this Agreement.

3.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation, has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as now being conducted and is duly qualified to do business and,
where applicable as a legal concept, is in good standing as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction in which the character of the properties it
owns, operates or leases or the nature of its activities makes
such qualification necessary, except for such failures to be so organized,
qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, that are not
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of
this Agreement, the term "Company Material Adverse Effect" means any change,
event, circumstance, effect or development that (i) is, or is reasonably
likely to be or become materially adverse to the assets, properties, business,
financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (ii) materially impedes or delays the
Companys ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with its terms and applicable laws; provided,
however, that none of the following shall constitute, in and of itself,  



 

-6-  or shall be considered in determining whether there has occurred, a Company
Material Adverse Effect:

(a) changes that are the result of economic factors affecting the national,
regional or world economy or acts of war or terrorism, provided that
the Company and its Subsidiaries are not materially disproportionately
affected thereby;

(b) changes that are the result of factors generally affecting the industries
or markets in which the Company conducts its business, provided that the
Company and its Subsidiaries are not materially disproportionately affected
thereby;

(c) any adverse change, effect or circumstance resulting from actions
contemplated by the parties in connection with this Agreement or the pendency

(d) changes in applicable law, rules or regulations or GAAP which occur or
become effective after the date of this Agreement, provided that the Company
and its Subsidiaries are not disproportionately affected thereby;

(including Section 6.6) or at the request of the Buyer;

(f) any revenues or earnings reported by the Company that are below any
published securities analyst estimates for any period ending on or after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing, in and of itself; and

(g) a decline in the price of the Company Common Stock, in and of itself.

Agreement consists of 100,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and
5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $.01 par value per share ("Company

indicating for each Company Stock Plan, as of such date, the number of shares
of Company Common Stock issued under such Plan, the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to outstanding options under such Plan and the
number of shares of Company Common Stock reserved for future issuance under
such Plan; and (ii) all outstanding Company Stock Options (other than Company
Stock Options issued pursuant to the Company ESPP), indicating with respect
to each such Company Stock Option the name of the holder thereof, the Company

-7-  whether (and to what extent) the vesting will be accelerated in any way by
the Merger or by termination of employment or change in position
following consummation of the Merger. The Company has made available to the
Buyer complete and accurate copies of all Company Stock Plans and the forms of
all stock option agreements evidencing Company Stock Options.

(c) Except (i) as set forth in this Section 3.2 and (ii) as reserved for
future grants under Company Stock Plans, as of the date of this Agreement,
(A) there are no equity securities of any class of the Company, or any
security exchangeable into or exercisable for such equity securities, issued,

or obligations. Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates is a party to or
is bound by any agreements or understandings with respect to the voting
(including voting trusts and proxies) or sale or transfer (including
agreements imposing transfer restrictions) of any shares of capital stock or
other equity interests of the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, the
term "Affiliate" when used with respect to any party shall mean any person who
is an "affiliate" of that party within the meaning of Rule 405 promulgated
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). Except
as contemplated by this Agreement and except to the extent arising pursuant to
applicable state takeover or similar laws, there are no registration rights,
and there is no rights agreement, "poison pill" anti-takeover plan or other
similar agreement or understanding to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which it or they are bound with respect to any
equity security of any class of the Company. 

(d) All outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are, and all shares of
Company Common Stock subject to issuance as specified in Section 3.2(b)
above, upon issuance on the terms and conditions specified in the instruments
pursuant to which they are issuable, will be, duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to or issued in violation of any
purchase option, call option, right of first refusal, preemptive right,

Companys Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws or any agreement to which
the Company is a party or is otherwise bound.

(e) There are no obligations, contingent or otherwise, of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of
Company Common Stock or the capital stock of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or to provide funds to the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company other than guarantees of bank obligations of Subsidiaries of the
Company entered into in the ordinary course of business consistent in all
material respects with past practice (the "Ordinary Course of Business").



 

-8- 3.3 _Subsidiaries_.

(a) Section 3.3 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the date
of this Agreement, for each Subsidiary of the Company: (i) its name; (ii) the
number and type of outstanding equity securities and a list of the holders
thereof; and (iii) the jurisdiction of organization. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Subsidiary" means, with respect to any party, any
corporation, partnership, trust, limited liability company or other non-
corporate business enterprise in which such party (or another Subsidiary of
such party) holds stock or other ownership interests representing (A) more
than 50% of the voting power of all outstanding stock or ownership interests
of such entity or (B) the right to receive more than 50% of the net assets of
such entity available for distribution to the holders of outstanding stock or
ownership interests upon a liquidation or dissolution of such entity. 

(b) Each Subsidiary of the Company is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing (to the extent such concepts are applicable)
under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has all requisite
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as now being conducted and as proposed to
be conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as
a foreign corporation (to the extent such concepts are applicable) in each
jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned, operated or leased
or the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except
for such failures to be so organized, qualified or in good standing,
individually or in the aggregate, that are not reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. All of the outstanding shares of capital
stock and other equity securities or interests of each Subsidiary of the
Company are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and
free of preemptive rights and all such shares (other than directors
qualifying shares in the case of non-U.S. Subsidiaries, all of which the
Company has the power to cause to be transferred for no or nominal
consideration to the Company or the Companys designee) are owned, of record
and beneficially, by the Company or another of its Subsidiaries free and
clear of all security interests, liens, claims, pledges, agreements,
limitations in the Companys voting rights, charges or other encumbrances.
There are no outstanding or authorized options, warrants, rights, agreements
or commitments to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
which are binding on any of them providing for the issuance, disposition or
acquisition of any capital stock of any Subsidiary of the Company. There are
no outstanding stock appreciation, phantom stock or similar rights with
respect to any Subsidiary of the Company. There are no voting trusts, proxies
or other agreements or understandings with respect to the voting of any
capital stock of any Subsidiary of the Company.

(c) The Company has made available to the Buyer complete and accurate
copies of the charter, by-laws or other organizational documents of the
Company and each Subsidiary of the Company. Such charter, by-laws or other
organizational documents as made available to Buyer are in full force and
effect and have not been amended, altered or repealed. The Company is not in
violation of any of the provisions of its certificate of incorporation or by-
laws, and each of the Companys Subsidiaries is in compliance with its
charter, by-laws or equivalent organizational documents, except for such
violations or non-compliance as would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.



 

-9- (d) The Company does not control directly or indirectly or have any direct or
indirect equity participation or similar interest in any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other business
association or entity which is not a Subsidiary of the Company, other than
securities in a publicly traded company held for investment by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and consisting of less than 5% of the outstanding
capital stock of such company. The Company does not have any branch office or
representative office in any country and since July 2, 2005 has not adopted a
plan of complete or partial liquidation, nor undertaken a dissolution,
restructuring, recapitalization or other reorganization of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company (other than the Merger).

3.4 _Authority; No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and, subject to
the adoption of this Agreement (the "Company Voting Proposal") by the
Companys stockholders as described in Section 3.4(d) (the "Company
Stockholder Approval"), to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Board of
Directors of the Company (the "Company Board"), at a meeting duly called and

state takeover law or similar law that might otherwise apply to the Merger and

under this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by the Company have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, subject only to the
required receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval. This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes the valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles
(the "Bankruptcy and Equity Exception").

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and
the performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company or of
the charter, by-laws, or other organizational document of any Subsidiary of
the Company, (ii) conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or
constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) a default (or
give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any
obligation or loss of any material benefit) under, require a consent or
waiver under, constitute a change in control under, require the payment of a
penalty  



 

-10-  under or result in the imposition of any mortgage, security interest,
pledge, lien, charge or encumbrance ("Liens") on the Companys or any of its
Subsidiarys assets under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
lease, license, contract or other agreement, instrument or obligation to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or
any of their properties or assets may be bound, or (iii) subject to obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval and compliance with the requirements
specified in clauses (i) through (v) of Section 3.4(c), conflict with or
violate any permit, concession, franchise, license, judgment, injunction,
order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective
properties or assets, except in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) of this
Section 3.4(b) for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults,
terminations, cancellations, accelerations, losses, penalties or Liens, and
for any consents or waivers not obtained, that, individually or in the
aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

(c) No consent, approval, license, permit, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration, notice or filing with, any court, arbitrational
tribunal, administrative agency or commission or other governmental or
regulatory authority, agency or instrumentality (a "Governmental Entity") or

consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and
filings as may be required under applicable state securities laws, and (vi)
such other consents, approvals, licenses, permits, orders, authorizations,
registrations, declarations, notices and filings which, if not obtained or
made, would not be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

(d) The affirmative vote for adoption of the Company Voting Proposal by the
holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock entitled by law to vote on the Company Voting Proposal on the record
date for the meeting of the Companys stockholders (the "Company Meeting") to
consider the Company Voting Proposal (the "Required Company Stockholder
Vote") is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of the Companys
capital stock or other securities necessary for the adoption of this Agreement
and for the consummation by the Company of the Merger and all other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. There are no bonds, debentures,
notes or other indebtedness of the Company having the right to vote (or
convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote)
on any matters on which stockholders of the Company may vote.



 

-11- 3.5 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements; Information Provided_.

(a) The Company has filed all registration statements, forms, reports and
other documents required to be filed by the Company with the SEC since August
1, 2002. All such registration statements, forms, reports and other documents
(including those that the Company may file after the date hereof until the
Closing) are referred to herein as the "Company SEC Reports." The Company SEC
Reports (i) were or will be filed on a timely basis, (ii) at the time filed,
complied, or will comply when filed, as to form in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as
the case may be, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("SOX") and the rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Reports, and
(iii) did not or will not at the time they were or are filed contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated in such Company SEC Reports or necessary in order to make the
statements in such Company SEC Reports, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. No Subsidiary of the Company is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the
Exchange Act. No investigation by the SEC with respect to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened.

(b) Each of the principal executive officer of the Company and the principal
financial officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer
of the Company and each former principal financial officer of the Company, as
applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14
under the Exchange Act or Sections 302 and 906 of SOX and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder with respect to the Company SEC
Reports and, to the Companys Knowledge, the statements contained in such
certificates are true and correct. For purposes of the preceding sentence,
"principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the
meanings given to such terms in SOX. Except as permitted by the Exchange Act,
since the enactment of SOX neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has outstanding, or has arranged any outstanding, "extensions of credit" to
directors or executive officers within the meaning of Section 402 of SOX.

(c) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any related notes and schedules) contained or to be contained in the
Company SEC Reports at the time filed (i) complied or will comply as to form
in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) were or
will be prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes to such financial
statements or, in the case of unaudited interim financial statements, as
permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act), and (iii) fairly
presented or will fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the dates
indicated and the consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for
the periods indicated, except that the unaudited interim financial statements
were or are subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments. The
Companys foreign Subsidiaries maintain their books pursuant to GAAP for
consolidation purposes and adjust their books to conform to local accounting
rules. The consolidated, unaudited balance sheet of the Company as
of December 31, 2005 is referred to herein as the "Company Balance Sheet."



 

-12- (d) The information to be supplied by or on behalf of the Company for
inclusion in the proxy statement to be sent to the stockholders of the
Company (the "Proxy Statement") in connection with the Company Meeting shall
not, on the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to stockholders of the
Company, at the time of the Company Meeting or at the Effective Time, contain
any statement which, at such time and in light of the circumstances under
which it shall be made, is false or misleading with respect to any material
fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements made in the Proxy Statement not false or misleading in light
of the circumstances under which they were or shall be made; or omit to state
any material fact necessary to correct any statement in any earlier
communication with respect to the solicitation of proxies for the Company
Meeting which has become false or misleading. If at any time prior to the
Company Meeting any fact or event relating to the Company or any of its
Affiliates which should be set forth in a supplement to the Proxy Statement
should be discovered by the Company or should occur, the Company shall,
promptly after becoming aware thereof, inform the Buyer of such fact or event.

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract or arrangement (including any contract or
arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
person, on the other hand) or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as
defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the result,
purpose or intended effect of such contract or arrangement is to avoid
disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the Companys or such Subsidiarys
published financial statements or other Company SEC Reports.

(f) The Company has established and maintains a system of internal accounting
controls designed to provide reasonable assurance (i) that receipts and
expenditures are executed in accordance with managements general or specific
authorizations; (ii) that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP; and (iii)
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the
Companys financial statements.

(g) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls
and procedures are effective to ensure that all material information
concerning the Company is made known on a timely basis to the individuals
responsible for the preparation of the Companys filings with the SEC and
other public disclosure documents. The Company is in compliance with the
applicable listing and other rules and regulations of The Nasdaq National
Market.

(h) Except as disclosed in the Companys SEC Reports filed prior to the date
of this Agreement, since August 1, 2004, the Company has not received any
written, or to the Companys Knowledge any oral, notification from its
independent auditors, any Governmental Entity or any other person of a (i)
"reportable condition" or (ii) "material weakness" in the Companys internal
controls. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "reportable condition"
and "material weakness" shall have the meanings assigned to them in the
Statements of Auditing Standards 60, as in effect on the date hereof.



 

-13- 3.6 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except as disclosed in the Company SEC
Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement or in the Company Balance
Sheet and except for liabilities incurred (i) in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (ii) in the Ordinary Course of Business
since the date of the Company Balance Sheet, the Company and its Subsidiaries
do not have any liabilities of any nature required by GAAP to be reflected on
a consolidated balance sheet of the Company that, individually or in the
aggregate, are reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

3.7 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as disclosed in the Company
SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, since the date of the Company
Balance Sheet (a) the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their
respective businesses only in the Ordinary Course of Business and (b) there
has not been (i) a Company Material Adverse Effect or (ii) any other action
or event that would have required the consent of the Buyer under Section 5.1
of this Agreement (other than paragraphs (b) and (k) of Section 5.1) had such
action or event occurred after the date of this Agreement.

3.8 _Taxes_.

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has filed all Tax Returns that it
was required to file, and all such Tax Returns were correct and complete,
except for any failure to file or errors or omissions that, individually or
in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has paid on a timely basis
all Taxes that are due, except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. For
purposes of this Agreement, (i) "Taxes" means (A) all taxes, charges, fees,
levies or other similar assessments or liabilities, including income, gross
receipts, ad valorem, premium, value-added, excise, real property, personal
property, sales, use, services, transfer, withholding, employment, payroll and
franchise taxes imposed by the United States of America or any state, local or
foreign government, or any agency thereof, or other political subdivision of
the United States or any such government and (B) any interest, fines,
penalties, assessments or additions to tax resulting from, attributable to or
incurred in connection with any tax or any contest or dispute thereof. "Tax

Subsidiaries have been audited by the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") or
are closed by the applicable statute of limitations for all taxable years
through the taxable year specified in Section 3.8(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. No examination or audit of any Tax Return of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries by any Governmental Entity is currently in progress or, to
the Companys Knowledge, threatened or contemplated.



 

-14- (c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries: (i) has made any
payments, is obligated to make any payments, or is a party to any agreement
that could obligate it to make any payments that will be treated as an "excess
parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code or that will result in the
imposition of an excise Tax under Section 4999 of the Code (or any
corresponding provisions of state, local or foreign Tax law), including upon
consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement; or (ii) has
any actual or potential liability for any Taxes of any person (other than the
Company and its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) is or has ever been a
member of a group of corporations with which it has filed (or been required
to file) consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Returns, other than a group of

zoning, subdivision, health, safety and other land use statutes, laws, codes,

(c) Section 3.9(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete
and accurate list as of the date of this Agreement of all real
property leased, subleased or licensed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively "Company Leases") and the location of the premises.

Knowledge, any other party to any Company Lease is in default under any of
the Company Leases, except where the existence of such defaults, individually
or in the aggregate, is not reasonably likely to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries leases,

and its Subsidiaries. The Company has made available to the Buyer complete and
accurate copies of all Company Leases.

excluding in each case the Companys software license agreements which the
Company and its Subsidiaries license Company Software to their customers in
the Ordinary Course of Business and excluding generally commercially
available, off-the-shelf software programs that are available for less than
$2,000.00 per license. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company and the consummation by the Company of the Merger will not result in
the breach of, or create on behalf of any third party the right to terminate
or modify, (i) any license, sublicense or other agreement relating to any
Company Intellectual Property, (ii) any license, sublicense and other
agreement as to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and
pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is authorized to use
any third party Intellectual Property that is material to the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or (iii) alter, impair or extinguish any of the
Company Intellectual Property.

(c) All the Company Registered Intellectual Property is subsisting and has
not expired or been cancelled. To the Companys Knowledge, no third party has
infringed, violated or misappropriated, or is infringing, violating or
misappropriating, any of the Company Intellectual Property. To the Companys
Knowledge, the Company Registered Intellectual Property is valid and
enforceable and there are no actual or threatened opposition proceedings,
cancellation proceedings, interference proceedings, decrees, orders,
injunctions or other similar action challenging the validity, existence or
ownership of the Company Registered Intellectual Property. None of the Company
Registered Intellectual Property has been previously adjudicated to be invalid
or unenforceable in whole or in part or is the subject of any written pending
threatened challenge.

(d) To the Companys Knowledge, the conduct of the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as it has been conducted, and is currently being
conducted, does not infringe (whether directly, as a contributory infringer,
through inducement or otherwise), violate or constitute a misappropriation of
any Intellectual Property of any third party. Since August 1, 2002, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written claim or
notice alleging any such infringement, violation or misappropriation or has
received any written "invitations to license" or other communications
asserting that the Company or one of its Subsidiaries will be obligated to
take a license under third party Intellectual Property rights in order to
continue conducting business in their ordinary fashion.

(e) Except as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company
and its Subsidiaries employees, officers and independent consultants that
have created any Intellectual Property used or held for use by the Company or
its Subsidiaries, have assigned ownership of such Intellectual Property to the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries through a written agreement.



 

-16- (f) The Company has disclosed source code to the Company Software only to its
contractors and then only pursuant to written confidentiality terms that
reasonably protect the Companys interests and rights in such Company
Software. Except as disclosed in accordance with such confidentiality
agreements or as provided under valid source code escrow agreements (under
which there has been no release), no person (other than Company) is in
possession of any source code for any Software included in the Company
Software or has any rights to the same. Neither the entering into of this
Agreement nor the consumation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
result in a triggering event under any source code escrow arrangement to which
the Company is a party or otherwise give any person a right to access or use
the source code to the Company Software.

ARTICLE VI

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 

6.1 _No Solicitation_.

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. Except as set forth in this Section 6.1,
until the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof
(the "Specified Time"), neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall, and the Company shall use reasonable efforts and act in good faith to
cause its directors, officers, employees, investment  



 

-30-  bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors or representatives (such
directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants,
other advisors and representatives, collectively, "Representatives") not to,
directly or indirectly:

(i) solicit, initiate, or knowingly induce or encourage, any inquiries or the
making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal; or

(ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public information
for the purpose of encouraging, facilitating or inducing, any inquiries or
the making of any Acquisition Proposal.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in
response to an Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this
Agreement and that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors) is reasonably
likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and subject to compliance with Section
6.1(c), the Company may (A) furnish information with respect to the Company to
any person (and the Representatives of such person) making such Acquisition
Proposal, pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not less
restrictive of the other party than the Confidentiality Agreement, (B) engage
in discussions or negotiations (including solicitation of a revised
Acquisition Proposal) with such person and its Representatives regarding any
such Acquisition Proposal, and (C) amend, or grant a waiver or release under,
any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any Company Common Stock.

(b) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. Prior
to the Specified Time, the Company Board shall not:

(i) except as set forth in this Section 6.1, withhold, withdraw or modify, in
a manner adverse to the Buyer, the approval or recommendation by the Company
Board with respect to the Company Voting Proposal;

(ii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement or arrangement (whether
binding or not) (an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement") providing for the
consummation of a transaction contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal (other
than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.1(a) entered into in
the circumstances referred to in Section 6.1(a)); or

(iii) except as set forth in this Section 6.1, adopt, approve or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 6.1 or
Section 6.5, the Company Board may withhold, withdraw or modify its
recommendation with respect to the Company Voting Proposal or approve or
recommend a Superior Proposal if and only to the extent that, after complying
with the notice provisions in this Section 6.1 (including Section 6.1(d)), the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations under applicable law. Promptly (and in any event no later than one
calendar day) following a determination by the  



 

-31-  Company Board that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal,
the Company shall deliver to the Buyer a written notice advising the Buyer
that the Company Board has received a Superior Proposal together with a copy
of any such Superior Proposal if in writing, specifying (to the extent not
previously done under Section 6.1(d)) the terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal and the identity of the person making such Superior
Proposal. During the period of four Business Days after the Buyers receipt
from the Company of such notice of a Superior Proposal, the Company shall
negotiate in good faith with the Buyer to revise this Agreement so that the
Acquisition Proposal of such person no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal.
If, following, the expiration of such period of four Business Days, the
Acquisition Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal and did
not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 6.1, the Company, by
action of the Company Board, may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(f), provided that, concurrently with such termination, the Company pays to
the Buyer all amounts payable pursuant to Section 8.3 and enters into a
definitive agreement to consummate such Superior Proposal.

(c) _Change of Recommendation_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, the obligation of the Company to call, give notice
of, convene and hold the Company Meeting and to hold a vote of the Companys
stockholders on the Company Voting Proposal at the Company Meeting shall not
during the term of this Agreement be limited or otherwise affected by the
commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to the Company of any
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal). The Company shall
not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal (whether
or not a Superior Proposal), or propose to do so, prior to the termination of
this Agreement.

(d) _Notices to the Buyer_.

(i) Upon the Companys receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or request for
information or inquiry which would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall promptly, and in any event within 24
hours, (A) advise the Buyer orally, with written confirmation to follow, of
the Companys receipt of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, the
material terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the person making
any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and (B) provide a copy to
Buyer of all written materials provided by that person or its representatives
with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry.

Company shall (A) continue to keep the Buyer informed, on a prompt (and
in any event no later than one calendar day) basis, in all material respects
of the details of, or any communication by the Company to the person making
the Acquisition Proposal, of the Companys position with respect to, such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (including, without limitation,
notice of all material amendments thereto, and notice of withdrawal or
rejection thereof), and (B) promptly (and in any event no later than one
calendar day) provide to the Buyer a copy of all written materials
subsequently provided or received by the Company in connection with such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (to the extent that the Company has
not previously provided such materials to the Buyer).



 

-32- (iii) The Company shall provide the Buyer with two Business Days prior
written notice of any meeting of the Company Board at which such Company
Board or any members or committee thereof are reasonably expected to consider
declaring a Superior Proposal to be such or changing their recommendation with
respect to the Company Voting Proposal. 

(e) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Section 6.1 or
in Section 6.5 (or elsewhere in this Agreement) shall be deemed to prohibit
the Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position with
respect to a tender offer contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated
under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to the Companys
stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after
consultation with outside counsel, failure to so disclose would be
inconsistent with its obligations under applicable law.

(f) _Cessation of Ongoing Discussions; Destruction/Return of Confidential
Material_.

(i) The Company shall, and shall direct its Representatives to, cease
immediately all discussions and negotiations that commenced prior to the date
of this Agreement regarding any proposal that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal.

(ii) The Company shall promptly, and not later than 48 hours following the
execution of this Agreement, request in writing that each person which has
within the 12 months prior to the date of this Agreement executed a
confidentiality agreement with the Company or any of its Representatives with
respect to such persons consideration of an Acquisition Proposal to
immediately return or destroy all confidential information heretofore
furnished to such person or its Representatives by the Company or its
Representatives pursuant to the terms of such confidentiality agreement.

(i) on terms which the Company Board determines (after consultation with its
financial and legal advisors) in its good faith judgment to be more favorable
from a financial point of view to the holders of Company Common Stock (in
their capacity as stockholders) than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, taking into account all the  



 

-33-  terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any
proposal by the Buyer to amend the terms of this Agreement), (ii) is not
subject to any financing contingency or, if so subject, that the Company
Board determines in its good faith judgment is reasonably likely of being
financed, and (iii) that the Company Board determines in its good faith
judgment is reasonably likely of being completed without undue delay on the
terms proposed, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other
aspects of such proposal.

Agreement, but in any event not later than 30 calendar days (subject to the
last proviso to this sentence), the Company, in cooperation with the Buyer,
shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement; provided, however,
that the Company shall give to Buyer the opportunity to review and comment on
the initial preliminary Proxy Statement and all subsequent forms or versions
of or amendments to the Proxy Statement and the Company shall take into good
faith consideration all of Buyers reasonable comments to each version of or
amendment to the Proxy Statement; and provided, further, that the Company
shall not file or submit the initial preliminary or any subsequent forms or
versions of or amendments to the Proxy Statement without the prior written
consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). The Company shall respond to any comments of the SEC
or its staff and shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its
stockholders at the earliest practicable time after the resolution of any such
comments. The Company shall notify the Buyer promptly upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or its staff or any other government officials and of
any request by the SEC or its staff or any other government officials for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall supply the Buyer
with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of its
representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any other
government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement.
The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all documents
that it is responsible for filing with the SEC or other regulatory authorities
under this Section 6.2 to comply in all material respects with all applicable
requirements of law and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
Whenever any event occurs which is required to be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Buyer or the Company, as the case may
be, shall promptly inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in
filing with the SEC or its staff or any other government officials, and/or
mailing to stockholders of the Company, such amendment or supplement.

properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel, records and
accountants work papers (subject to such undertakings as the Companys
accountants may require), as the Buyer shall reasonably request, and, during
such period, the Company shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to)

registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of federal or

necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the stockholders of
the Company required by the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market or the DGCL to
obtain such approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in

(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), may

commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to each other all information
required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to the rules

and to contest and resist any action, including any legislative,
administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) (an "Antitrust Order") that restricts, prevents or
prohibits the consummation of the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law. The parties hereto
will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the
views of one another, in connection with, and provide to the other parties

arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any
party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust
Law.

efforts to obtain any third party consents required in connection with the
Merger that are (i) necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) disclosed or required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure
Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be, or (iii)
required to prevent the occurrence of an event that is reasonably likely to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Buyer Material Adverse Effect
prior to or after the Effective Time, it being understood that neither the
Company nor the Buyer shall be required to make any payments in connection

shall be issued only in such form as shall be mutually agreed upon by the
Company and the Buyer and (b) the Buyer and the Company shall each use its
commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other party, and provide
such other party with an opportunity to review and comment, before issuing any
other press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to
the Merger or this Agreement.

6.8 _Indemnification_.

(a) From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on which
the Effective Time occurs, each of Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall,
jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless each person who is now, or
has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties"), against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and
expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the
fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL
for officers and directors of Delaware corporations. Each Indemnified Party
will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from each of the Buyer
and the Surviving Corporation upon receipt by the Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor, provided that
such Indemnified Party seeking advancement of expenses provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.

(b) The Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain, and Buyer shall cause the Certificate of Incorporation and By-
laws of the Surviving Corporation to so contain, provisions no less favorable
with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of
present and former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries
than are presently set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws
of the Company.

(c) Subject to the next sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain,
and the Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, at no expense
to the beneficiaries, in effect for six (6) years from the Effective Time the
current policies of the directors and officers liability insurance
maintained by the Company with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), so long as the annual premium therefor would not be in excess of
200% of the last annual premium paid prior to the Effective Time (such 200%,
the "Maximum Premium"), which annual premium is set forth in Section 6.8(c) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule. If the Companys existing insurance expires,
is terminated or canceled during such six-year period or  



 

-37-  exceeds the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain, and
Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain, as much directors
and officers liability insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of
such period for an annualized premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium, on
terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than the
Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance.

(d) The Buyer shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees,
that may be incurred by the persons referred to in this Section 6.8 in
connection with their enforcement of their rights provided in this Section
6.8, unless it is ultimately determined that the person was not entitled to
such indemnification.

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.8 are intended to be in addition to the
rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of the
Company by law, charter, statute, by-law or agreement, and shall operate for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
their heirs and their representatives. 

6.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the
Buyer shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give
prompt notice to the Buyer, of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any
event, which occurrence or failure to occur is reasonably likely to cause any
representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, in each case at any time from
and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, or (b) any
material failure of the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary or the Company, as
the case may be, or of any officer, director, employee or agent thereof, to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, (x)
the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.9 will not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice or prevent or cure any misrepresentations, breach of warranty or breach
of covenant, and (y) the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.9
will not be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedule or
constitute an exception to any representation or warranty of the Company.

6.10 _Reserved_.

6.11 _Service Credit_. Following the Effective Time, the Buyer will give each
employee of the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or their respective
Subsidiaries who shall have been an employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees")
full credit for prior service with the Company or its Subsidiaries for
purposes of (a) eligibility and vesting (but not for the accrual of benefits)
under any Buyer Employee Plans (as defined below), (b) determination of
benefit levels under any Buyer Employee Plan or policy relating to vacation
and (c) determination of "retiree" status under any Buyer Employee Plan, in
each case for which the Continuing Employee is otherwise eligible and in
which the Continuing Employee is offered participation, and in each case only
to the same extent recognized by the Company under a comparable Company
Employee Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, but except where such
credit would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, the Buyer shall
waive, or cause to be waived, any limitations on benefits relating to pre-
existing conditions to the same extent such limitations are waived under any
comparable medical or dental plan, to the extent permitted by such plan, of
the Buyer and  



 

-38-  recognize for purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under
its medical and dental plans, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid
by Continuing Employees in the calendar year in which the Effective Time
occurs in each case to the extent such limitations would have been waived or
such expenses recognized by a comparable Company Employee Plan immediately
prior to the Effective Time. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Buyer
Employee Plan" means any "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(2) of ERISA), any "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined
in Section 3(1) of ERISA), and any other written or oral plan, agreement or
arrangement (other than stock plans or other equity incentive plans),
including insurance coverage, or disability benefits, for the benefit of, or
relating to, any current or former employee of the Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries or any entity which is a member of (A) a controlled group of
corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code), (B) a group of trades
or businesses under common control (as defined in Section 414(c) of the Code)
or (C) an affiliated service group (as defined in Section 414(m) of the Code
or the regulations under Section 414(o) of the Code), any of which includes or
included the Buyer or a Subsidiary of the Buyer.

Expenses), this Section 8.2 (Effect of Termination) and Article IX
(Miscellaneous) of this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement shall

Agreement.

8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be paid by the party incurring such fees and expenses, whether or not the

(d) The Company shall pay the Buyer the Termination Fee (less any
expense reimbursement previously paid under Section 8.3(b)) in the event of
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Sections 8.1(b), 8.1(d) or

Proposal that is not withdrawn and (y) within 12 months following such
termination the Company consummates an Acquisition Proposal with any person or
enters an Alternative Acquisition Agreement (provided that for purposes of
this Section 8.3(d) all references to "15%" in the definition of "Acquisition
Proposal" shall be deemed references to "40%").

Any fee due under this Section 8.3(d) shall be paid to the Buyer by wire
transfer of same-day funds within two Business Days after the date
of consummation of the Acquisition Proposal or entering into the Alternative
Acquisition Agreement (as the case may be).

are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and

Agreement described in clause (a) of Section 8.2, but otherwise shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties in connection with
any termination of this Agreement.

8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any
time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the
Merger by the stockholders of any party, but, after any such approval, no
amendment shall be made which by law requires further approval by such
stockholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto.

8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards
of Directors, may, to the extent legally  



 

-43-  allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party. Such extension or waiver shall not
be deemed to apply to any time for performance, inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty, or noncompliance with any agreement or condition,
as the case may be, other than that which is specified in the extension or
waiver. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights.

specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that

9.8 _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to an Article
or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this
Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, table of defined

reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and
no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any party.
Whenever the context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall
include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the

deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
unless the context requires otherwise. Whenever the words "include,"

State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law
provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdictions other than
those of the State of Delaware.

9.10 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that  



 

-46-  irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity, without the necessity of posting bonds or other undertaking in
connection therewith. The parties acknowledge that in the absence of a waiver,
a bond or undertaking may be required by a court and the parties hereby waive
any such requirement of such a bond or undertaking.

9.11 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties to this Agreement (a)
consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal
court sitting in Wilmington, Delaware, as well as to the jurisdiction of all
courts to which an appeal may be taken from such courts, in any suit, in any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in
respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such
court, (c) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (d)

to a jury trial. Each of the parties hereto waives any defense of
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought.
Each of the parties further agrees to waive any bond, surety or other security
that might be required of any other party with respect to any action or
proceeding, including an appeal thereof. Any party hereto may make service on
another party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the party to
be served at the address and in the manner provided for the giving of notices
in Section 9.2. Nothing in this Section 9.11, however, shall affect the right
of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law.

9.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LEGAL
REQUIREMENT THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE, AND COVENANT
THAT THEY WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE), ANY
