certificate (a "CERTIFICATE") which immediately prior to the Effective Time

no other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable on or in exchange
therefor.

                  3.4.  EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.

                         (a) EXCHANGE AGENT. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent
         shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
         Company as agent (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") for the benefit of holders of
         Company Shares for the purpose of exchanging, pursuant to this Article
         III, Certificates representing Company Shares for the Merger
         Consideration. On or before the Closing Date, Parent will deposit or
         cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent the aggregate Merger
         Consideration to be paid in respect of all Company Shares (other than
         Dissenting Shares, if any) pursuant to this Article III (the "EXCHANGE
         FUND"), and except as contemplated by Section 3.4(e), Section 3.4(f) or
         Section 3.4(g) hereof, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any

         resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. All fees,
         costs and expenses of the Exchange Agent shall be borne by Parent.

                         (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. As promptly as practicable
         after the Effective Time (but not later than five (5) Business Days
         after the date on which the Effective Time occurs), the Surviving
         Corporation shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to
         each record holder of Certificates ("RECORD HOLDER") immediately prior
         to the Effective Time, a letter of transmittal and instructions (which
         shall be in customary form and specify that delivery shall be effected,
         and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon delivery of the
         Certificates to the Exchange Agent), for use in the exchange
         contemplated by this Section 3.4. Upon surrender of a Certificate to
         the Exchange Agent, together with a duly executed letter of
         transmittal, the holder shall be entitled to receive in exchange
         therefor, the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article III in
         respect of the Company Shares represented by the Certificate (after
         giving effect to any required withholding Tax). Until surrendered as
         contemplated by this Section 3.4, each such Certificate representing
         Company Shares shall be deemed, after the Effective Time, to represent
         only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. No interest shall
         be paid on any such delivery of cash to be paid pursuant to this
         Article III upon such delivery.

                         (c) NO FURTHER RIGHTS IN COMPANY SHARES. Subject to
         Section 3.6, at the Effective Time, holders of Company Shares shall
         cease to be, and shall have no rights as, stockholders of the Company,
         other than to receive any dividend or other distribution with respect
         to the Company Shares with a record date occurring prior to the
         Effective Time and the Merger Consideration provided in Section 3.3.
         All cash paid upon surrender of Certificates in accordance with the
         terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction
         of all rights pertaining to Company Shares represented thereby. As of
         the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
         closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
         Company's stock transfer books of any Company Shares, other than


                                       12
<PAGE>

         transfers that occurred before the Effective Time. If, after the
         Effective Time, Certificates representing Company Shares are presented
         to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and
         exchanged as provided in this Section 3.4.

                         (d) ALTERNATE ENDORSEMENT. If payment of the Merger
         Consideration in respect of Company Shares is to be made to a Person
         other than the Person in whose name a surrendered Certificate is
         registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that the
         Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
         otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting
         such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by
         reason of such payment in a name other than that of the registered
         holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the
         satisfaction of Parent or the Exchange Agent that such Taxes either
         have been paid or are not payable.

                         (e) RETURN OF MERGER CONSIDERATION. Upon demand by
         Parent, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to Parent any portion of the
         Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to
         this Section 3.4 (with any interest and earnings thereon) that remains
         undistributed to Record Holders twelve (12) months after the Effective
         Time. Record Holders who have not complied with this Section 3.4 prior
         to the demand by Parent shall thereafter look only to Parent for
         payment of any claim to the Merger Consideration without any interest
         thereon. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed as of a date
         which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
         escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the
         extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free
         and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
         thereto.

                         (f) NO LIABILITY. None of the Surviving Corporation,
         Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect
         of amounts paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
         abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

                         (g) WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. Parent, Surviving Corporation
         and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
         the Merger Consideration otherwise payable hereunder to any holder of
         any Certificate any amounts that it is required to deduct and withhold
         with respect to payment under any provision of federal, state, local or
         foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, the
         withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
         having been paid to the holder of such Certificate.

                         (h) LOST CERTIFICATES. If any Certificate has been or
         is claimed to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
         an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming that a Certificate has
         been lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting
         by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving
         Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
         against it with respect to that Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
         deliver to such Person in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
         Certificate, the proper amount of the Merger Consideration.

                         (i) EXCHANGE OF ACQUIROR STOCK CERTIFICATES.
         Immediately after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
         deliver to Parent in exchange for the certificates which immediately
         prior to the Effective Time represented all the outstanding Acquiror
         Common Shares that were converted into the right to receive shares of
         common stock of the Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section
         3.1, share certificates registered in the name of Parent, representing
         the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation to
         which Parent is so entitled by virtue of Section 3.1.

                  3.5.  COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS.

                         (a) Each outstanding Company Option whether or not then
         vested, that has an exercise price equal to or greater than the Merger
         Consideration shall be canceled immediately prior to the Effective Time
         for no consideration. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all
         unvested Company Options shall be automatically vested.

                         (b) At the Effective Time, all other outstanding and
         vested Company Options shall be canceled and in consideration of such
         cancellation, the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each holder of a
         canceled Company Option, as soon as practicable following the Effective
         Time, an amount per Company Share subject to such canceled Company
         Option equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the Merger Consideration
         over (ii) the exercise price per Company Share subject to such canceled
         Company Option (such excess, the "SPREAD AMOUNT"), as reduced by any
         required withholding of Taxes for employees of the Company.

                  3.6.  DISSENTING SHARES.

                         (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
         the contrary, any Company Shares ("DISSENTING SHARES") that are issued
         and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are
         held by a Person who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented
         thereto in writing and who properly demands appraisal of such Company
         Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262
         (or any successor provision) of the DGCL, shall not be converted into
         or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided
         hereunder unless and until such Person shall have failed to perfect, or
         shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such Person's right to
         appraisal under the DGCL, and instead shall only entitle the holder
         thereof to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due
         with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to, and subject to the
         requirements of, Section 262 (or any successor provision) of the DGCL.
         If, after the Effective Time, any such Person shall have failed to
         perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right to
         appraisal, each of such holder's Company Shares shall thereupon be
         deemed to have been converted into and to have become, as of the
         Effective Time, the right to receive, without interest, the Merger
         Consideration, in accordance with Section 3.3 (together with any
         dividends or other distributions to which holders of Certificates
         become entitled in accordance with this Article III upon the surrender
         of such Certificates).

                         (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of
         any notices or demands (or purported demands) for appraisal received by
         the Company, withdrawals of such notices or demands and any other


                                       14
<PAGE>

         instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company and
         (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and
         proceedings with respect to such notices or demands. The Company shall
         not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any
         payments, or settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate, with
         respect to any such notices or demands.

                  3.7. ADJUSTMENTS. If between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time the number of outstanding Company Shares shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any
stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares or the like other than pursuant to the Merger,
the amount of Merger Consideration shall be correspondingly adjusted and, if and
as appropriate, all other appropriate corresponding adjustments shall be made.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

                  Except as disclosed in the Company disclosure schedule
delivered by the Company to the Acquiror prior to the execution of this
Agreement (the "COMPANY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE") with specific reference to the
particular Section or subsection of this Agreement to which the information set
forth in such disclosure schedule relates (it being understood that any
information set forth in a particular section of the Company Disclosure Schedule
shall be deemed to apply to each other section or subsection thereof or hereof
to which its relevance is clearly apparent on its face), the Company represents
and warrants to Parent and Acquiror as set forth below:

                  4.1.  CORPORATE EXISTENCE AND POWER.

                         (a) The Company is a corporation, duly incorporated,
         validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of
         Delaware, and has all corporate power and authority required to own,
         lease and operate its properties, to carry on its business as now
         conducted and (assuming this Agreement is duly approved and adopted at
         the Company Stockholder Meeting) to consummate the Merger and the other
         transactions contemplated hereby.

                         (b) The Company is duly qualified to do business as a
         foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where
         the character of the property owned, leased or operated by it or the
         nature of its activities makes qualification necessary, except where
         the failure to be so qualified has not had, and would not be reasonably
         expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
         Adverse Effect.

                         (c) The Company has made available to Acquiror a
         complete and correct copy of the Certificate of Incorporation and
         By-laws (or other constituent documents) of the Company and each of the
         Company Subsidiaries. The corporate records and minute books of the
         Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries reflect all material
         action taken and authorizations made at meetings of such companies'
         Board of Directors or any committees thereof and at any stockholders'
         meetings thereof.

                  4.2.  CORPORATE AUTHORIZATION.

                         (a) The execution, delivery and performance by the
         Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
         Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
         and validly authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company and,
         except for adoption and approval of this Agreement by the vote of the
         holders of a majority of the outstanding Company Shares (the "COMPANY
         STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL"), no other corporate proceedings on the part of
         the Company are necessary to authorize or consummate this Agreement or
         to consummate the other transactions contemplated hereby (other than
         the filing and recordation of the appropriate documents with respect to
         the Merger in accordance with the DGCL).

                         (b) On or prior to the date hereof, the Company's Board
         of Directors has (i) determined that this Agreement, the Voting
         Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
         including the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the
         Company and its Stockholders, (ii) adopted resolutions approving this
         Agreement, the Voting Agreements and the transactions contemplated
         hereby and thereby, including the Merger, (iii) adopted resolutions
         declaring this Agreement and the plan of merger contained herein
         advisable, (iv) recommending to the Company Stockholders that they vote
         in favor of adopting and approving this Agreement in accordance with
         the terms hereof and (v) adopted resolutions declaring that Section 203
         of the DGCL and any other Takeover Statute are and shall be
         inapplicable to Parent, Acquiror, the Merger, this Agreement, the
         Voting Agreements or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
         thereby. Such approval by the Company's Board of Directors is
         sufficient to render inapplicable to this Agreement, the Voting
         Agreements, the Merger and any of the transactions contemplated hereby
         or thereby, the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL. To the Company's
         Knowledge, no other Takeover Statute applies or purports to apply to
         this Agreement, the Voting Agreements, the Merger or any of the
         transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. No provision of the
         Certificate of Incorporation or the By-laws of the Company or similar
         governing instruments of any Company Subsidiary would, directly or
         indirectly, restrict or impair the ability of Parent to vote, or
         otherwise to exercise the rights of a stockholder with respect to, any
         shares of the Company and any Company Subsidiary that may be acquired
         or controlled by Parent.

                         (c) This Agreement has been duly and validly executed
         and delivered by the Company, and assuming that this Agreement
         constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Parent and Acquiror,
         constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
         enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.

                  4.3. GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATION. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not
require any consent, approval, action, order, authorization, or permit of, or
registration or filing with, any Governmental Entity, other than (a) the filing
of (i) the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL and (ii) the
appropriate documents with respect to the Company's qualification to do business
with the relevant authorities of other states or jurisdictions in which the
Company is qualified to do business; (b) compliance with any applicable
requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as


                                       16
<PAGE>
amended (the "HSR ACT"); (c) compliance with any applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act; (d) such as may be required under any applicable state securities
or blue sky Laws; and (e) other consents, approvals, actions, orders,
authorizations, registrations, declarations, filings and permits which, if not
obtained or made, have not had, and would not be reasonably expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                  4.4. NON-CONTRAVENTION. (a) The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not
(a) contravene, breach or conflict with the Company's Certificate of
Incorporation or By-laws, (b) assuming compliance with the matters referred to
in Section 4.3, contravene, breach or conflict with or constitute a violation of
any provision of any Law binding upon or applicable to the Company or its
Subsidiaries or by which any of their respective properties is bound or
affected, (c) constitute a default under (or an event that with notice or lapse
of time or both could reasonably be expected to become a default) or give rise
(with or without notice or lapse of time or both) to a right of termination,
amendment, cancellation or acceleration under any Material Contract, or (d)
result in the creation or imposition of any material Lien on any asset of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, other than, in the case of clauses (b) and
(c) any items that have not had, and would not be reasonably expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b) The execution, delivery and performance by Jeffrey Webb
and John Nichols of their respective Employment Agreements does not and will not
breach or conflict with or constitute a violation of any contract, agreement, or
understanding between each of Jeffrey Webb and John Nichols, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand.

                  (c) The execution, delivery and performance by the Principal
Stockholders of their respective Voting Agreements does not and will not breach
or conflict with or constitute a violation of any contract, agreement, or
understanding between each of the Principal Stockholders, on the one hand, and
the Company, on the other hand.

                  4.5.  CAPITALIZATION.

                         (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company
         consists solely of 40,000,000 Company Shares and 5,000,000 shares of
         preferred stock (the "COMPANY PREFERRED STOCK"). As of March 31, 2003,
         (i) 9,592,250 Company Shares were issued and outstanding (no Company
         Shares were held in treasury), all of which have been duly authorized
         and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and were issued
         free of preemptive or similar rights, (ii) no Company Shares were held
         by Subsidiaries of the Company, (iii) 1,666,925 Company Shares were
         issuable upon the exercise of Company Options then outstanding, (iv)
         33,075 Company Shares were reserved for issuance upon the grant of
         options reserved and available under the Company Option Plans, (v)
         there was outstanding $6,125,000 aggregate principal amount of the
         Company's 4.10% convertible subordinated note (which is convertible
         into Company Shares at a rate of $4.42 per share (the "CONVERTIBLE
         DEBT") and (vi) no shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued and
         outstanding. Since December 31, 2002, the Company has not declared or
         paid any dividend or distribution in respect of any of its Equity
         Interests and has not issued, sold, repurchased, redeemed or otherwise


                                       17
<PAGE>

         acquired any of its Equity Interests, and its Board of Directors has
         not resolved to do any of the foregoing. Since March 31, 2003, the
         Company has not issued any Company Securities (as defined below) other
         than upon exercise of Company Options outstanding on such date or in
         connection with the conversion of the Convertible Debt.

                         (b) Except as set forth in this Section 4.5, the
         Company has not issued, or reserved for issuance, any (i) Equity
         Interests of the Company, (ii) securities of the Company convertible
         into or exchangeable for Equity Interests of the Company or (iii)
         options, warrants or other rights to acquire from the Company, or
         obligations of the Company to issue, any Equity Interests of the
         Company or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, or
         requiring payments based on the value of, Equity Interests of the
         Company (the items in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) being referred to
         collectively as the "COMPANY SECURITIES"). There are no outstanding
         agreements or other obligations of the Company or any Company
         Subsidiary to issue, sell, repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any
         Company Securities.

                         (c) Section 4.5(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
         sets forth a complete and accurate list of all outstanding Company
         Options as of the date hereof, which list sets forth the name of the
         holders thereof and, to the extent applicable, the exercise price or
         purchase price thereof, the number of Company Shares subject thereto,
         the governing Company Option Plan with respect thereto and the
         expiration date thereof.

                  4.6.  SUBSIDIARIES.

                         (a) Section 4.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
         lists each Company Subsidiary together with the jurisdiction of
         incorporation of each Subsidiary. Except for the Equity Interests in
         each Company Subsidiary, and as set forth in Section 4.6(a) of the
         Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company does not own, directly or
         indirectly, any capital stock or other ownership interest in any other
         Person.

                         (b) Each Company Subsidiary (i) is a corporation duly
         incorporated or an entity duly organized, and is validly existing and
         in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or
         organization, and has all powers and authority required to own, lease
         or operate its properties, to carry on its business as now conducted,
         and (ii) has all governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and
         approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted and is
         duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation or entity and is
         in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of the
         property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its
         activities makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure
         to be so qualified has not had, and would not be reasonably expected to
         have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
         Effect. All of the outstanding Equity Interests in each Company
         Subsidiary have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully
         paid and nonassessable and free of preemptive or similar rights. Except
         as set forth in Section 4.6(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, all
         of the Equity Interests in each Company Subsidiary are beneficially
         owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company.

                                       18
<PAGE>


                         (c) Except as set forth in Section 4.6(c) of the
         Company Disclosure Schedule, such Equity Interests in each Company
         Subsidiary are owned free and clear of any Lien and free of any other
         limitation or restriction (including any limitation or restriction on
         the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of the stock or other
         ownership interests). There are no outstanding (i) securities of the
         Company or any Company Subsidiary convertible into or exchangeable or
         exercisable for Equity Interests in any Company Subsidiary, (ii)
         options, warrants or other rights to acquire from the Company or any
         Company Subsidiary, or obligations of the Company or any Company
         Subsidiary to issue, any Equity Interests in, or any securities
         convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any Equity
         Interests in, any Company Subsidiary or (iii) agreements, obligations
         or arrangements of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue,
         sell, repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Equity Interests of
         any Company Subsidiary.

                         (d) None of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is in
         violation of any provision of its articles or Certificate of
         Incorporation or By-laws or equivalent organizational documents.

                  4.7.  COMPANY SEC DOCUMENTS.

                         (a) The Company has filed or otherwise furnished all
         Company SEC Documents required to be filed with or furnished to the SEC
         by the Company. No Company Subsidiary currently is, and no Company
         Subsidiary at any time since January 1, 2000 has been, required to file
         or otherwise furnish any form, report, registration statement or
         prospectus or other document with or to the SEC.

                         (b) As of their respective dates, each Company SEC
         Document including, without limitation, any financial statements or
         schedules included or incorporated by reference therein, at the time
         filed (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy
         statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates of mailing,
         respectively) (i) complied in all material respects with all applicable
         requirements of the Securities Act and/or the Exchange Act, as the case
         may be and (ii) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
         or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
         necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
         circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

                         (c) The Company will file with the SEC and promptly
         will make available to Acquiror true and complete copies of each form,
         registration statement, report, schedule, proxy or information
         statement and other documents (including exhibits thereto) required to
         be filed with the SEC under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.

                  4.8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; NO MATERIAL UNDISCLOSED
                        LIABILITIES.

                         (a) Each of the audited consolidated financial
         statements (including the notes thereto) (the "AUDITED FINANCIAL
         STATEMENTS") and unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of
         the Company included in the Company SEC Documents were prepared in
         conformity with GAAP throughout the periods involved, and each fairly


                                       19
<PAGE>

         presents, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
         of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates
         thereof and their consolidated results of operations and changes in
         financial position for the periods then ended (subject to normal
         year-end adjustments in the case of any unaudited interim financial
         statements, which adjustments shall not be material).

                         (b) There are no liabilities or obligations of the
         Company or any Company Subsidiary, which, individually or in the
         aggregate, would be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken
         as a whole, of any kind whatsoever, whether accrued, contingent,
         absolute, determined, determinable or otherwise other than: (i)
         liabilities or obligations disclosed or provided for in the Company
         Balance Sheet or disclosed in the notes thereto; (ii) liabilities or
         obligations incurred after December 31, 2002 in the ordinary course of
         business consistent with past practice; and (iii) liabilities under
         this Agreement or incurred in connection with the transactions
         contemplated hereby or by the Voting Agreements.

                  4.9. ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES. Since December 31, 2002,
except as set forth in Section 4.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or
otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and each Company
Subsidiary has conducted its business in the ordinary course consistent with
past practice. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has engaged in any
transaction or series of transactions material to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary other than in the ordinary course of business and consistent with
past practices, and there has not been any event, occurrence or development,
that individually or in the aggregate, constitutes or would be reasonably
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and except as set forth by the Company on Schedule
4.9, since December 31, 2002, there has not been:

Effect (it being expressly understood and agreed that the mere filing of

                  4.12. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.

                         (a) Except as set forth in Schedule 4.12(a) of the
         Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate
         (as defined below) maintains, administers, sponsors or otherwise has
         any liability with respect to any "employee benefit plan", as defined
         in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
         as amended ("ERISA"), or any employment, severance or similar contract,
         plan, arrangement or policy or any other plan or arrangement (written
         or oral) whether or not subject to ERISA (including any funding
         mechanism therefore now in effect or required) providing for
         compensation, bonuses, profit-sharing, stock option or other stock
         related rights or other forms of incentive or deferred compensation,
         vacation benefits, insurance coverage (including any self-insured
         arrangements), health or medical benefits, disability benefits,
         workers' compensation, supplemental unemployment benefits, severance
         benefits and post-employment or retirement benefits (including
         compensation, pension, health, medical or life insurance benefits)
         which covers any employee or former employee or director of the Company
         or any Company Subsidiary. The Company has delivered to Parent (i)
         current, accurate and complete copies (or to the extent no such copy
         exists, an accurate description of the material features) of each
         Company Employee Plan (as defined below and, if applicable, related
         trust agreements), (ii) all amendments thereto and written

                                       24
<PAGE>

         interpretations and (iii) if applicable, for the two most recent years
         (A) the Form 5500 and attached schedules, (B) audited financial
         statements and (C) actuarial valuation reports. The plans required to
         be listed on Section 4.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule are
         referred to collectively herein as the "COMPANY EMPLOYEE PLANS." An
         "ERISA AFFILIATE" means any Person which would be treated as a single
         employer with the Company or any Company Subsidiary under Section 414
         of the Code.

                         (b) None of the Company Employee Plans are subject to
         Title IV of ERISA. None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary, or any
         ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability (whether absolute or
         contingent) with respect to any employee pension benefit plan (as
         defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) or any multiemployer plan (as defined
         in Section 3(37) of ERISA) under Title IV of ERISA, and no events have
         occurred and no circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected
         to result in any such liability to the Company, any Company Subsidiary
         or any ERISA Affiliate.

                         (c) Each Company Employee Plan which is intended to be
         qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and has been
         so qualified during the period from its adoption to date, and each
         trust forming a part thereof is exempt from Tax pursuant to Section
         501(a) of the Code and nothing has occurred, whether by action or
         failure to act, that could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of
         such qualification. The Company has furnished to Acquiror copies of the
         most recent Internal Revenue Service determination letters with respect
         to each Company Employee Plan. Each Company Employee Plan has been
         maintained in compliance with its terms and with the requirements
         prescribed by any and all statutes, orders, rules and regulations,
         including ERISA and the Code, which are applicable to such Company
         Employee Plan. Further, nothing has been done or omitted to be done and
         no transaction or holding of any asset under or in connection with any
         Company Employee Plan has occurred that will make the Company or any
         Company Subsidiary, or any officer or director of the Company or any
         Company Subsidiary, subject to any liability under Title I of ERISA or
         liable for any Tax pursuant to Section 4975 of the Code (assuming the
         taxable period of any such transaction expired as of the date hereof).

                         (d) (i) Except as set forth on Section 4.12(d) of the
         Company Disclosure Schedule, no Company Employee Plan exists that could
         result in the payment to any present or former employee of the Company
         or any Company Subsidiaries of any money or other property or
         accelerate or provide any other rights or benefits to any present or
         former employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries as a result
         of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) there is no
         contract, agreement, plan or arrangement covering any employee or
         former employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that,
         individually or collectively, would give rise to the payment of any
         amount that would not be deductible pursuant to the terms of Sections
         162(m) or 280G of the Code. Section 4.12(a) of the Company Disclosure
         Schedule sets forth the maximum aggregate amount payable in respect of
         any and all payments, costs, excise taxes, fees and expenses due,
         payable, owed or forgiven as a result of termination pursuant to any
         severance agreement, contract, benefit plan or other arrangement
         existing on the date hereof pursuant to which the Company or any

                                       25
<PAGE>

         Company Subsidiary has any obligation or liability in connection with

Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which
any of them or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound, except
for Defaults which have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Company as the terms and conditions of such Specified Contract as in effect on

under the Riddell Sale Agreement.

                  (b) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is, or has
received any notice that any other party is, in Default (and no event has
occurred or not occurred through the Company's inaction or to the Knowledge of
the Company, through the action or inaction of any Third Parties, which with
notice or the lapse of time or both would constitute a Default) of any term,
condition or provision of the Riddell Sale Agreement.


                                       32
<PAGE>

                  (c) To the Knowledge of the Company, no representation or
warranty contained in the Riddell Sale Agreement which is qualified as to
materiality is untrue as of the date hereof (and no event has occurred or not
occurred through the Company's inaction or to the Knowledge of the Company,
through the action or inaction of any Third Parties, which with notice or the
lapse of time or both would cause any such representation to become untrue) and
no representation or warranty not so qualified is untrue (and no event has
occurred or not occurred through the Company's inaction or to the Knowledge of
the Company, through the action or inaction of any Third Parties, which with
notice or the lapse of time or both would cause any such representation to
become untrue) in any material respect as of the date hereof.

                  (d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any notice of any claim of an indemnified party for indemnification
under the Riddell Sale Agreement, and to the Knowledge of the Company no event
has occurred or not occurred through the Company's inaction or to the Knowledge
of the Company, through the action or inaction of any Third Parties, which with
notice or the lapse of time or both would give rise to a claim for
indemnification under the Riddell Sale Agreement.

                  4.21. REAL ESTATE. Except as has not had, and would not be
reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect: (i) all of the leases, licenses, tenancies, subleases
and all other occupancy agreements ("LEASES") in which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is a tenant, subtenant, landlord or sublandlord (the leased
and subleased space or parcel of real property thereunder being, collectively,
the "REAL PROPERTY"), are in full force and effect, (ii) neither the Company (or
the applicable Company Subsidiary), nor to the Knowledge of the Company, any
other party to any Lease, is in default under the Leases, and no event has
occurred which, with notice or lapse of time, would constitute a Default by the
Company (or such Subsidiary) under the Leases and (iii) the Company (or the
applicable Company Subsidiary) enjoys peaceful and undisturbed possession under
the Leases. The Company does not own, and no Company Subsidiary owns, any real
property or any interests (other than the Leases) therein. All of the Leases of
the Company and its Subsidiaries are set forth on Section 4.21 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

                  4.22. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND INVENTORY. Since December 31, 2002,
the Company has (i) discharged its material accounts payable and other material
current liabilities and obligations in accordance with past practice, and (ii)
purchased and maintained inventory in an amount which it reasonably believes to
be appropriate for normal seasonal requirements of the Company's business and
current business conditions consistent with its past practices.

                  4.23. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. The accounts and notes receivable
reflected on the Company Balance Sheet (except to the extent collected since the
Balance Sheet Date), and all accounts or notes receivable since the Balance
Sheet Date, represent bona fide claims of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries against customers for sales made, services performed or other
charges or valid consideration arising on or before the date hereof and require
no additional performance by the Company or any Company Subsidiary to render
them valid. Such accounts receivable are valid and enforceable claims, fully
collectible in the ordinary course of business (and to the Company's Knowledge
without resort to commencement of any action or assignment to a collection
agency), consistent with past practice (subject to reserves for bad debts


                                       33
<PAGE>

reflected on the Company Balance Sheet in accordance with GAAP and, in the case
of accounts receivable arising since the Balance Sheet Date, additions to such
reserves reflected on the Company's books and records) and to the Company's
Knowledge, subject to no defense, set-off or counterclaim. To the Company's
Knowledge, all of the goods delivered and services performed which gave rise to
said accounts were delivered or performed in accordance with the applicable
orders, contracts or customer requirements. The Company and the Company
Subsidiaries have no accounts or loans receivable from any Person, firm or
corporation that is affiliated with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or
from any director, officer, shareholder or employee of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, except for advances for business expenses incurred in the
ordinary course of business, so long as such advances do not exceed $250,000 in
the aggregate, outstanding at any one time.

                  4.24. SUPPLIERS. Set forth in Section 4.24 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule is a list of the ten largest suppliers and the ten largest
contract manufacturers of the Company based on the dollar value of materials or
products purchased by the Company, in the case of suppliers, and payments made
by the Company, in the case of contract manufacturers, for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2002. Since such date, there has not been, nor as a result of the
Merger is there anticipated to be, any change in relations with any of the major
suppliers and contract manufacturers of the Company and its Subsidiaries that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had, or would be reasonably expected to
result in, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The existing suppliers and
contract manufacturers of the Company and its Subsidiaries are adequate for the
operation of the Company's business as operated on the date hereof.

                  4.25. PERSONNEL, ETC.

                         (a) Set forth in Section 4.25 of the Company Disclosure
         Schedules is a list setting forth: (i) the name of each officer of the
         Company and each of the Company's Subsidiaries, specifying the title of
         each such Person; and (ii) the name of each director of the Company and
         each of the Company's Subsidiaries.

                         (b) The Company has heretofore provided Acquiror with a
         complete and accurate schedule of compensation which each of the
         officers referred to in clause (a) above is currently entitled to
         receive, and all payroll records relating to non-officer employees
         heretofore provided to Acquiror are accurate and complete in all
         material respects.

                  4.26. ASSETS. The assets and properties of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, considered as a whole, constitute all of the material
assets and properties which are reasonably required for the business and
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries as presently conducted. The
Company and its Subsidiaries have good and marketable title to or a valid
leasehold estate in, free and clear of any Liens, all personal properties and
assets reflected on the Company Balance Sheet at the Balance Sheet Date (except
for properties or assets subsequently sold in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practices).

                  4.27. INSURANCE. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries
maintains insurance policies (the "INSURANCE POLICIES") against all risks of a
character and in such amounts as are usually insured against by similarly
situated companies in the same or similar businesses. Section 4.27 of the


                                       34
<PAGE>

Company Disclosure Schedules contains a complete and accurate list of all
Insurance Policies of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Each Insurance Policy is
in full force and effect and is valid, outstanding and enforceable, and all
premiums due thereon have been paid in full, in each case without any exception
other than those which have not had, and would not be reasonably expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. None
of the Insurance Policies will terminate or lapse (or be affected in any other
materially adverse manner) by reason of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, in each case without any exception other than those which have not
had, and would not be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has complied in all material respects with the provisions of each
Insurance Policy under which it is the insured party. No insurer under any
Insurance Policy has canceled or generally disclaimed liability under any such
policy or, to the Company's Knowledge, indicated any intent to do so or not to
renew any such policy, in each case without any exception other than those which
have not had, and would not be reasonably expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. All material claims under the
Insurance Policies have been filed in a timely fashion. Since the Company's
formation, there have been no historical gaps in insurance coverage of the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries.

                  4.28. DISCLAIMER OF OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The
Company does not make, and has not made, any representations or warranties in
connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby other than
those expressly set forth herein, including those items set forth in the Company
Disclosure Schedule or incorporated herein by reference. For the avoidance of
doubt, notwithstanding the fact that Parent and Acquiror and their
representatives have been afforded the opportunity, prior to the date hereof, to
ask questions of, and receive answers from the Company and its management, it is
understood that any responses from or other information provided by the Company,
or its management, including, but not limited to any data, financial information
or any memoranda or other materials of any nature whatsoever or any

duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction where the character of the property owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of its activities makes qualification necessary,

Material Adverse Effect.

                  5.2. CORPORATE AUTHORIZATION. The execution, delivery and
performance by Parent and the Acquiror of this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements, as applicable, and the consummation by Parent and the Acquiror of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, as

Acquiror are necessary to authorize this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. This Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements have been duly and validly executed and delivered
by Parent and the Acquiror, as applicable, and assuming that this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements constitute the valid and binding obligation of the
Company and/or the other parties thereto, this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements constitute valid and binding obligations of Parent and the Acquiror,
as applicable, each enforceable in accordance with their terms.

                  5.3. GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATION. The execution, delivery and
performance by Parent and the Acquiror of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, as applicable, and the consummation by Parent and the Acquiror of

of the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL; (b) compliance with
any applicable requirements of the HSR Act; (c) compliance with any applicable

performance by Parent and the Acquiror of this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements and the consummation by Parent and the Acquiror of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, as applicable, do not and
will not (a) contravene or conflict with Parent's or Acquiror's Certificate of
Incorporation or By-laws, (b) assuming compliance with the matters referred to
in Section 5.3, contravene or conflict with or constitute a violation of any
provision of any Law binding upon or applicable to Parent or the Acquiror or by
which any of their respective properties is bound or affected, (c) constitute a
Default under (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both could
reasonably be expected to become a Default) or give rise (with or without notice
or lapse of time or both) to a right of termination, amendment, cancellation or
acceleration under any agreement, contract, note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
lease, franchise, Permit or other similar authorization or joint venture,
limited liability or partnership agreement or other instrument binding upon


                                       36
<PAGE>

Acquiror, other than, in the case of clauses (b) and (c) any items that have not
had, and would not be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect.

                  5.5. EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS. Parent has caused Acquiror to
enter into the Employment Agreements. Neither Parent nor Acquiror will take any
action to cause the Employment Agreements not to be in full force and effect on

the aggregate Merger Consideration and to provide the Company with sufficient
funds to consummate the Notes Tender Offer for the Company's 10-1/2% Senior

warranties in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby other than those expressly set forth herein, including those items set

representatives have been afforded the opportunity, prior to the date hereof, to
ask questions of, and receive answers from the Parent and its management, it is

Schedule, there is no investment banker, financial advisor, broker, finder or
other intermediary which has been retained by, or is authorized to act on behalf
of, the Parent, Acquiror or any Affiliate thereof, which might be entitled to
any fee or commission from the Parent, Acquiror, Company, any Company
Subsidiary, or of any of their respective Affiliates upon consummation of the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements.

         right under any Material Contract of the Company or any of its
         Subsidiaries;

                         (r) take any action that would result in any
         representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement
         which is qualified as to materiality becoming untrue as of the
         Effective Time or any representation or warranty not so qualified
         becoming untrue in any material respect as of the Effective Time;

                         (s) except as required by applicable Law or GAAP,
         revalue in any material respect any of its assets, including writing
         down the value of inventory in any material manner, or writing-off
         notes or accounts receivable in any material manner;

                         (t) alter through merger, liquidation, reorganization
         or restructuring or any other fashion the corporate structure or

                         (w) authorize, agree or commit to do any of the
         foregoing.

                  6.2.  ACQUISITION PROPOSALS; BOARD RECOMMENDATION.

                         (a) The Company shall immediately terminate, and shall
         cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers,
         directors, employees, attorneys, accountants, advisors, representatives
         and agents ("REPRESENTATIVES") to immediately terminate all existing
         discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Person conducted
         heretofore with respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to
         lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall immediately demand
         that each Person which has heretofore executed a confidentiality
         agreement with or for the benefit of the Company or any of its
         Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives with respect to
         such Person's consideration of a possible Acquisition Proposal to


                                       40
<PAGE>

         immediately return or destroy (which destruction shall be certified in
         writing by such Person to the Company) all confidential information
         heretofore furnished by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
         of its or their Representatives to such Person or any of its or their
         Representatives.

                         (b) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective
         Time, the Company shall not, and the Company shall cause its
         Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives not to, (i) solicit,
         initiate, encourage or take any other action to facilitate any
         proposal, inquiry or request that constitutes, or may reasonably be
         expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate or
         engage in discussions or negotiations with, or disclose or provide any
         non-public information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries to,
         or afford access to any of the properties, books or records of the
         Company or its Subsidiaries to, any Person that has made an Acquisition
         Proposal or such a proposal, inquiry or request or any of such Person's
         Affiliates or Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives,
         (iii) except as provided in this Section 6.2 and subject to compliance
         herewith, enter into any agreement or agreement in principle with any
         Person that has made an Acquisition Proposal or such a proposal,
         inquiry or request or any of such Person's Affiliates or Subsidiaries
         or any of its or their Representatives, or (iv) grant any waiver or
         release under, or fail to enforce to the maximum extent possible, any
         standstill or similar agreement by any Person who has made an
         Acquisition Proposal or such a proposal, inquiry or request; PROVIDED,
         HOWEVER, that prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the
         Company and its Representatives may take any of the actions described
         in clause (ii) of this subsection (b) in respect of a Person that has
         made an Acquisition Proposal if, but only if, (A) such Person has
         submitted an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal which did not
         result from a violation by the Company of its obligations under this
         Section 6.2 or Section 8.2(b) and at such time the Company has fully
         complied with its obligations under this Section 6.2, and the Company
         is proceeding in good faith with respect to its obligations under
         Section 8.2(b), to the extent applicable, (B) such Person has entered
         into a confidentiality agreement with the Company on terms that are no
         less favorable to the Company than the Confidentiality Agreement (as
         defined below), (C) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
         Proposal, (D) a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company has
         reasonably determined in good faith, following consultation with
         outside counsel expert in Delaware law, that taking such action is
         required in order for the members of the Board of Directors of the
         Company to comply with their fiduciary duties imposed by Delaware law,
         and (E) prior to disclosing or providing any such non-public
         information, the Company shall disclose or provide all such information
         to Acquiror.

                         (c) The Company shall immediately advise Parent and
         Acquiror, telephonically and in writing, of the Company's receipt of
         any Acquisition Proposal or any proposal, inquiry or request related
         to, or that may reasonably be expected to lead to, or that contemplates
         the possibility of, any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
         immediately provide Parent and Acquiror, in writing and in detail, with
         the terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal, or such
         proposal, inquiry or request, and the identity of the Person making the
         same, and copies of any written materials received from such Person.
         The Company shall continuously update Parent and Acquiror on the status
         and content of any discussions or negotiations regarding any
         Acquisition Proposal and shall immediately inform Parent and Acquiror


                                       41
<PAGE>

         of any change in any of the price, form of consideration, structure,
         terms and conditions or other meaningful terms of any Acquisition
         Proposal. Immediately upon determination by the Board of Directors of
         the Company that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
         Proposal, the Company shall deliver to Parent and Acquiror a written
         notice (a "NOTICE OF SUPERIOR PROPOSAL") advising them that the Board
         of Directors of the Company has so determined, specifying in detail the
         terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and the identity of the
         Person making such Superior Proposal, and providing Parent and Acquiror
         with copies of all written materials received from such Person and not
         previously provided.

                         (d) The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted a
         resolution recommending the adoption and approval of this Agreement and
         the Merger by the Company's stockholders (the "COMPANY
         RECOMMENDATION"), and, except as provided in the next sentence, the
         Board of Directors of the Company shall at all times recommend approval
         of this Agreement and the Merger by the Company's stockholders. The
         Board of Directors of the Company shall be permitted to (i) withdraw or
         modify in a manner adverse to Parent and Acquiror (or not to continue
         to make) its recommendation to its stockholders with respect to a
         Superior Proposal or (ii) enter into an agreement relating to a
         Superior Proposal if, but only if, (a) a majority of the Board of
         Directors of the Company has reasonably determined in good faith,
         following consultation with outside counsel expert in Delaware law,
         that taking such action is required in order for the members of the
         Board of Directors of the Company to comply with their fiduciary duties
         imposed by Delaware law, (b) the Company has given Parent and Acquiror
         four (4) Business Days' prior written notice of its intention to
         withdraw or modify such recommendation or enter into such Agreement,
         the Company shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent and
         Acquiror to revise this Agreement (if so requested by Parent or
         Acquiror) so that the Superior Proposal of such Person no longer
         constitutes a Superior Proposal, and the Board of Directors of the
         Company has considered in good faith any proposed changes to this
         Agreement proposed by Parent or Acquiror (it being understood and
         agreed that any amendment to the financial or other material terms of
         such Superior Proposal shall require a new four (4) Business Day period
         to afford Parent and Acquiror to negotiate with the Company as
         contemplated above), (c) the Company has fully complied with its
         obligations under this Section 6.2, and (d) simultaneously with
         entering into any such agreement, the Company shall pay Parent the
         Termination Fee in accordance with Section 10.2. Nothing in this
         Section 6.2 shall prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from
         taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
         with respect to an Acquisition Proposal by a Third Party to the extent
         required under Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange
         Act; PROVIDED THAT unless and until this Agreement is terminated in
         accordance with Section 10.1 hereof, nothing in this sentence shall
         affect the obligations of the Company and its Board of Directors under
         any other provision of this Agreement, including Section 8.2(b).

                  6.3. TAXES. The Company shall, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries to timely file or cause to be timely filed (in all cases, giving
effect to any valid extension granted to the Company by an appropriate
Governmental Entity), consistent with past practice, all Company Returns due
prior to the Closing Date and shall timely pay, or cause to be timely paid (in
all cases, giving effect to any valid extension granted to the Company by an


                                       42
<PAGE>

appropriate Governmental Entity) all Taxes due and payable by or with respect to
the Company and each Company Subsidiary. Prior to filing any such Company Return
with respect to federal income Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries, the
Company shall provide a copy of such returns to Parent for Parent's review.
Except as set forth in Section 6.3 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, all Tax
sharing agreements or similar arrangements involving the Company or any Company
Subsidiary shall be terminated prior to the Closing Date and, after the Closing
Date, no such entity shall be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

                  6.4. THE NOTES TENDER OFFER. (a) Provided that this Agreement
shall not have been terminated in accordance with Section 10.1, the Company will
commence a tender offer (the "NOTES TENDER OFFER") for all of the $66,035,000
million aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Senior Notes as promptly
as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, but in no event later than the
mailing of the Company Proxy Statement. The aggregate consideration payable to
each holder of Senior Notes pursuant to the Notes Tender Offer shall be an
amount in cash established by Parent; PROVIDED that such amount shall not be
less than the amount required to redeem the Senior Notes as provided in Section
3.07 of the Senior Notes Indenture, as of the date the Notes Tender Offer is
expected to expire in accordance with its terms (as such date may be extended).
The Notes Tender Offer shall be made pursuant to an Offer to Purchase and
Consent Solicitation Statement prepared by the Company in connection with the
Notes Tender Offer in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent (as
amended from time to time, the "NOTES OFFER TO PURCHASE").

                         (b) As part of the Notes Tender Offer, the Company
shall solicit the consent of the holders of the Senior Notes, to amend,
eliminate or waive certain sections (as selected by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company) of the Senior Notes Indenture (the "NOTES CONSENTS").
The Company's obligation to accept for payment and pay for the Senior Notes
tendered pursuant to the Notes Tender Offer shall be subject to the conditions
that (i) the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Notes Tender Offer constitutes at least
a majority of the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes outstanding at the
expiration of the Notes Tender Offer (the "MINIMUM NOTES CONDITION"), (ii) the
Company receives Notes Consents from Noteholders (as that term is defined below)
of at least a majority of the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes, (iii)
the other conditions set forth in Article IX below shall have been satisfied or
waived, (iv) the simultaneous occurrence of the Effective Time and (v) such
other conditions as are customary for transactions similar to the Notes Tender
Offer. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Notes Tender Offer (including,
without limitation, the Minimum Notes Condition), the Company agrees to accept
for payment and to pay for, as promptly as practicable after expiration of the
Notes Tender Offer, all Senior Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn. The
Company will not waive any of the conditions to the Notes Tender Offer without
the consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

                         (c) The Company shall prepare, as promptly as
practicable, the Notes Offer to Purchase, together with related letters of
transmittal and similar ancillary agreements (such documents, together with all
supplements and amendments thereto, being referred to herein collectively as the
"NOTES TENDER OFFER DOCUMENTS"), relating to the Notes Tender Offer and to
disseminate to the record holders of the Senior Notes, and to the extent known
by the Company, the beneficial owners of the Senior Notes (collectively, the


                                       43
<PAGE>

"NOTEHOLDERS"), the Notes Tender Offer Documents; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that prior
to the dissemination thereof, the Company shall consult with Parent with respect
to the Notes Tender Offer Documents and shall afford Parent reasonable
opportunity to comment thereon. Parent and the Acquiror shall provide the
Company with any information for inclusion in the Notes Tender Offer Documents
which may be required under applicable Law and which is reasonably requested by
the Company. If at any time prior to the acceptance of Senior Notes pursuant to
the Notes Tender Offer any event should occur that is required by applicable Law
to be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Notes Tender Offer
Documents, the Company will prepare and disseminate such amendment or
supplement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that prior to such dissemination, the Company
shall consult with Parent with respect to such amendment or supplement and shall
afford Parent reasonable opportunity to comment thereon. The Company will notify
Parent at least 48 hours prior to the dissemination of the Notes Tender Offer
Documents, or 24 hours prior to the mailing of any amendment or supplement
thereto, to the Noteholders.

                         (d) At such time as the Company receives consents from
Noteholders holding at least a majority of the aggregate principal amount of
Senior Notes, the Company agrees to execute, and to cause all of the guarantors
that are a party to the Senior Notes Indenture to execute, and will use
reasonable best efforts to cause the trustee under the Senior Notes Indenture to
execute, a supplemental indenture (the "SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE") in order to
give effect to the amendments of the Indenture contemplated in the Notes Tender
Offer Documents; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that notwithstanding the fact that the
Supplemental Indenture will become effective upon such execution, the proposed
amendments set forth therein (the "PROPOSED AMENDMENTS") will not become
operative unless and until the Minimum Notes Condition is satisfied or waived
and all other conditions to the Notes Tender Offer have been satisfied or waived
by the Company and the Company accepts all Senior Notes (and related consents)
validly tendered for purchase and payment pursuant to the Notes Tender Offer. In
such event, the parties hereto agree that the Proposed Amendments will be deemed
operative as of immediately prior to such acceptance for payment, and the
Company will thereafter be obligated to make all payments for the Senior Notes
(and related consents) so tendered.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                              COVENANTS OF ACQUIROR

                  Acquiror agrees as set forth below:

                  7.1. DIRECTOR AND OFFICER LIABILITY. (a) The Surviving
Corporation shall honor all of the Company's obligations to indemnify and hold
harmless the present and former officers and directors of the Company in respect
of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time to the extent
provided under the DGCL and the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and
By-laws in effect on the date hereof, and such obligations shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect from the Effective Time until
six (6) years after the Effective Time, except to the extent such obligation
shall expire or terminate by its terms prior to such time; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that such indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time
to time under applicable Law. For a period of six (6) years after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained the current
policies of officers' and directors' liability insurance maintained by the
Company (the "CURRENT POLICIES") (provided that the Surviving Corporation may


                                       44
<PAGE>

substitute therefore policies with reputable and financially sound carriers of
at least the same coverage and amount containing terms and conditions that are
no less favorable (the "REPLACEMENT POLICIES")) in respect of acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such Person currently
covered by such Current Policies; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in no event shall the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend, per annum, in excess of 200% of the
annual premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage (or such coverage
as is available for 200% of such annual premium); PROVIDED, FURTHER, that if the
annual premium required to provide the foregoing insurance exceeds 200% of the
annual premium currently paid by the Company (which the Company represents and
warrants is equal to $175,000 per annum), the Company shall provide as much of
such insurance as can be purchased for such premium, and, any present or former
officer or director, upon reasonable written notice thereof from the Surviving
Corporation, who desires to be covered by the Current Policies may so elect and
shall be covered by the Current Policies so long as such former offer or
director pays the portion of the premium for such Current Policies in excess of
the amount which the Surviving Corporation is obligated to pay pursuant to this
Section 7.1. Alternatively, with the consent of Parent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, the Company may purchase "tail" insurance coverage, at
a cost no greater than that set forth above, that provides coverage identical in
all material respects to the coverage described above.

                  (b) This Section 7.1 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
present or former officers or directors, their heirs and personal
representatives and shall be binding on the Surviving Corporation and its
successors and assigns and the covenants and agreements contained herein shall
not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any present or former
officer or director is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise.

                  (c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of it successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, to the extent reasonably
necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
the Surviving Corporation shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section
7.1.

                  (d) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be
construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and
officers' insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the Company or any of its officers, directors or employees, it
being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this
Section 7.1 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such
policies.

                  7.2.  TRANSFER TAXES. All state, local or foreign sales, use,
real property transfer, stock transfer or similar Taxes (including any interest
or penalties with respect thereto) attributable to the Merger shall be timely
paid by the Surviving Corporation.

                  7.3.  RESERVED.

                  7.4.  REPAYMENT OF DEBT. Parent or Acquiror shall take any and
all necessary action to provide the funds to, or to cause the funds to be


                                       45
<PAGE>

provided to, the Company to enable the Company to consummate the Notes Tender
Offer at the Effective Time, PROVIDED that the conditions to the Merger and the
Notes Tender Offer have been satisfied or waived.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                      COVENANTS OF ACQUIROR AND THE COMPANY

                  The parties hereto agree as set forth below:

                  8.1.  EFFORTS AND ASSISTANCE/HSR ACT.

                         (a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each
party will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, to file, or caused to be filed, all documents and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements as promptly as practicable, including, without limitation, obtaining
all necessary consents, waivers, approvals, authorizations, Permits or orders
from all Governmental Entities or other Third Parties. Each party shall also
refrain from taking, directly or indirectly, any action which would impair such
party's ability to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. Without limiting the foregoing,
the Company shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to (i) take all
action necessary or desirable so that no Takeover Statute or similar statute or
regulation is or becomes applicable to the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and
(ii) if any Takeover Statute or regulation becomes applicable to any of the
foregoing, take all action necessary so that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated in this
Agreement and/or the Ancillary Agreements, as the case may be, and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger and such other
transactions. Each of the Company and Acquiror will use their reasonable best
efforts to exempt Parent, Acquiror, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Voting Agreements
from Section 203 of the DGCL and to the extent applicable, any other Takeover
Statute.

                         (b) The Company, Parent and Acquiror shall cooperate
with one another in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or
filing with, any Governmental Entity is required, or any actions, consents,
approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any Material
Contracts, in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Each of the Company, Parent and Acquiror will, and will cause
its respective Subsidiaries, if any, to take all reasonable actions necessary to
obtain (and will cooperate with each other in obtaining) any consent, approval,
waiver, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any
Governmental Entity or other public or private Third Party required to be
obtained or made by the Company, Parent and Acquiror or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, if any, in connection with the Merger or the taking of any action


                                       46
<PAGE>

contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting Agreements.

                         (c) The Company, Parent and Acquiror shall furnish all
information required to be included in any application or other filing to be
made pursuant to the rules and regulations of any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent,
Acquiror and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the
extent reasonably practicable each will consult the other on, all the
information relating to the other and each of their respective Subsidiaries,
that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any
Third Party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreements.

                         (d) If required, each of the Company, Parent and
Acquiror shall take all reasonable action necessary to file as soon as
practicable notifications under the HSR Act and to respond as promptly as
practicable to any inquiries from the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice for additional information or
documentation and to respond as promptly as practicable to all inquiries and
requests received from any state attorney general or other Governmental Entity
in connection with antitrust matters related to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreements.

                         (e) The Company will use its best efforts to obtain,
prior to the Closing Date, from each of the holders of Company Options that has
not executed a cash-out consent on or prior to the date hereof, a valid and
binding consent to the cash-out of their Company Options pursuant to the terms
of the Company Option Plans and in accordance with Section 3.5 hereof.

                  8.2.  STOCKHOLDER MEETING/PROXY STATEMENT AND SCHEDULE 13E-3.

                         (a) The Company, Parent and Acquiror shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken such actions as
may be required to be taken under the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and any
other federal securities laws, and under any applicable state securities, or
blue sky Laws in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and by the Voting Agreements.

                         (b) The Company shall duly call and hold a meeting of

the Acquiror reasonable opportunity to comment thereon. Parent and the Acquiror
shall provide the Company with any information for inclusion in the Company
Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3 which may be required under applicable
Law and which is reasonably requested by the Company. The Company shall promptly

or supplement thereto) is first mailed to the Company's Stockholders and as of
the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading. The Company
Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3 will comply as to form in all material
respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing,

         conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries and shall
         be in accordance with any other existing agreements or obligations
         binding on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Unless otherwise
         required by Law, each of Parent and Acquiror will hold, and will cause

         Company, of (i) the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event the
         occurrence or nonoccurrence of which would reasonably be expected to
         cause any representation or warranty of such party contained in this
         Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect; (ii) any
         failure of the Company, Parent or Acquiror, as the case may be, to
         materially comply with or satisfy, or the occurrence or nonoccurrence
         of any event, the occurrence or nonoccurrence of which would reasonably
         be expected to cause the failure by such party to materially comply
         with or satisfy, any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
         with or satisfied by it hereunder; (iii) any notice or other
         communication from any Third Party alleging that the consent of such
         Third Party is or may be required in connection with the transactions
         contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; (iv) any
         actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to
         the best of such party's knowledge, threatened against, or affecting

         been required to have been disclosed pursuant to this Agreement or
         which relate to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
         hereby or by the Ancillary Agreements; and (v) the occurrence of any
         event, development or circumstance which has had or would be reasonably
         expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or Acquiror
         Material Adverse Effect; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the delivery of any
         notice pursuant to this Section 8.4(b) shall not limit
         or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
         giving or receiving such notice.

                         (c) Parent, the Acquiror and their agents, shall have
         the right, from time to time, prior to the Closing Date or earlier
         termination of this Agreement, during normal business hours and after
         reasonable notice has been provided, to enter upon the real property
         owned or leased by the Company or any Company Subsidiary (collectively,
         the "PREMISES") for the purpose of conducting visual inspections of the
         Premises, taking of measurements, making of surveys and generally for
         the reasonable performance of a standard "Phase I" investigation

         obligations binding on the Company or any Company Subsidiary and all
         applicable Environmental Laws. Parent and the Acquiror shall keep the
         Premises free and clear of any mechanic's or materialmen's liens
         arising out of any entry onto or inspection of the Premises. Parent and
         the Acquiror shall not disturb the Premises beyond what is reasonably
         necessary to conduct its investigations.

                  8.5. FURTHER ASSURANCES. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use their

under this Agreement. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Acquiror, any deeds, bills
of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf
of the Company or Acquiror, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right,
title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets of
the Company acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result
of, or in connection with, the Merger.

                  8.6. DISPOSITION OF LITIGATION. The Company will consult with
Parent and the Acquiror with respect to any action by any Third Party to
restrain or prohibit or otherwise oppose the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting Agreements and, subject to Section
6.2, will use reasonable best efforts to resist any such effort to restrain or


                                       50

prohibit or otherwise oppose the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the Voting Agreements. Acquiror may participate in (but not
control) the defense of any stockholder litigation against the Company and its
directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at
Acquiror's sole cost and expense (subject to Section 10.2). In addition, subject
to Section 6.2, the Company will not voluntarily cooperate with any Third Party
which has sought or may hereafter seek to restrain or prohibit or otherwise
oppose the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Voting Agreements and will cooperate with Acquiror to resist any such effort
to restrain or prohibit or otherwise oppose the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreements.

the Company and Leonard Green & Partners, L.P. entered into the Confidentiality
Agreement, which shall be deemed to be incorporated herein as if it were set
forth in its entirety, and which Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms until the earlier of (a) the
Effective Time or (b) the expiration of the Confidentiality Agreement according
to its terms; PROVIDED that, to the extent any provision of this Agreement or
the Ancillary Agreements permits Parent or Acquiror to take any action otherwise
prohibited under the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of this Agreement or
such Ancillary Agreement shall prevail.

                             (iii) at the Company Stockholder Meeting or any
                         adjournment thereof at which this Agreement has been
                         voted upon, the Company Stockholder Approval shall not
                         have been obtained;

                         (c) by the Company, if a breach of or failure to
         perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part
         of Parent or Acquiror set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred
         which would cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 9.2(a) not
         to be satisfied, and such condition shall either be incapable of being
         satisfied by the End Date or is not cured within ten (10) Business Days

         the End Date or is not cured within ten (10) Business Days after notice

         Acquiror shall not also then be in material breach of this Agreement;

                         (e) by Parent: (i) if the Company shall have breached

         that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, for purposes of this
         clause (e)(iii), the term "Third-Party Acquisition" shall not be deemed
         to include a transaction or series of transactions (other than a tender
         offer or exchange offer) in which a professional arbitrageur acquires
         solely for investment purposes (and not with the purpose or with the
         effect of changing or influencing the control of the Company (nor in
         connection with or as a participant in any transaction or series of
         transactions having such purpose or effect)) more than 20% but less
         than 35% of the outstanding voting power of the Company; PROVIDED that
         the Company has not cooperated, assisted, facilitated or otherwise had
         any involvement in such transaction or series of transactions,
         or

                         (f) by the Company, if and only if (i) the Company
         simultaneously enters into a definitive agreement for a Superior
         Proposal in accordance with, and has otherwise complied with, the terms
         of Section 6.2 hereof, (ii) the Company has complied with all
         provisions of Section 6.2, including the notice provisions therein and

                  The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Sections 10.1(b) through (f) shall give written notice of such termination to
the other party in accordance with Section 11.1 of this Agreement; PROVIDED that
no such termination by the Company shall be effective unless and until the
Company shall have paid any Termination Fee and/or Parent Expense Reimbursement
Amount required to be paid by it pursuant to Section 10.2 of this Agreement and
PROVIDED, FURTHER, that no such termination by the Parent or Acquiror shall be
effective unless and until the Parent shall have paid any Company Expense
Reimbursement Amount required to be paid by it pursuant to Section 10.2(b) of
this Agreement.

                  10.2. EFFECT OF TERMINATION.

                         (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by
         either the Company or Acquiror as provided in Section 10.1, this
         Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability
         or obligation on the part of the Company or Acquiror or their
         respective Subsidiaries, officers or directors except (i) with respect
         to Section 8.3, Section 8.7, this Section 10.2 and Article XI and (ii)
         with respect to any liabilities for damages incurred or suffered by a
         party as a result of the willful and material breach by the other party
         of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
         agreements set forth in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

                         (b) The Company and Acquiror agree that if this
         Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, as a consequence
         of a failure or non-waiver of any condition contained in Section

                                       56
<PAGE>

         9.3(a), Section 9.3(c), Section 9.3(e), Section 9.3(f) or Section
         9.3(i), or pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(iii) or Section 10.1(d), then
         the Company shall pay Acquiror an amount equal to the Parent Expense
         Reimbursement Amount. In the event that this Agreement is terminated
         prior to the Effective Time, as a consequence of the failure or
         non-waiver of any of the conditions set forth in Section 9.2, Parent
         shall pay the Company an amount equal to the Company Expense
         Reimbursement Amount. Payment of the Parent Expense Reimbursement
         Amount or Company Expense Reimbursement Amount pursuant to this Section
         10.2(b) shall be made not later than two (2) Business Days after the
         party seeking reimbursement has delivered to the other party a notice
         of demand for payment and a documented itemization setting forth in
         reasonable detail all expenses for which it seeks payment (which
         itemization may be supplemented and updated from time to time until the
         thirtieth (30th) day after such party delivers notice of demand for
         payment).

                         (c) In addition to any payment required by Section
         10.2(b) and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
         Company and Parent agree that (i) if this Agreement is terminated
         pursuant to Section 10.1(e) or Section 10.1(f) then the Company shall
         immediately pay to Parent the Termination Fee; (ii) if this Agreement
         is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(iii) or Section 10.1(d) then,
         in the event that, prior to such termination, (A) any Third Party
         Acquisition occurs or (B) any Third Party shall have publicly made,
         proposed, communicated or disclosed an intention to make an Acquisition
         Proposal, or such Acquisition Proposal becomes publicly known, then the
         Company shall immediately pay to Parent the Termination Fee; (iii) if
         (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(i)
         (PROVIDED that at the time of such termination pursuant to Section
         10.1(b)(i), the condition precedent in Section 9.1(b) shall have been
         satisfied and the reason for the Closing not having previously occurred
         shall not be the failure to satisfy the condition precedent set forth
         in Section 9.2 through no fault of the Company), Section 10.1(b)(iii)
         or Section 10.1(d) and (B) no Termination Fee has been paid by the
         Company to Parent and (C) within twelve (12) months following such
         termination (1) the Company enters into a definitive agreement with
         respect to an Acquisition Proposal or (2) any Third Party Acquisition
         occurs, then, the Company shall immediately pay to Parent the
         Termination Fee upon the first to occur of the events described in
         clause (C)(1) and (C)(2) of this sentence. For purposes of clause
         10.2(c)(iii), the term Acquisition Proposal (including the way such
         term is used to determine if a Third Party Acquisition has occurred),
         shall not include offers or proposals related to the acquisition of
         capital stock or assets of any Company Subsidiary that would not result
         in a Third Party acquiring Beneficial Ownership of more than twenty
         percent (20%) of the fair market value of the assets (including,
         without limitation, the capital stock of Subsidiaries) of the Company
         and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such offer
         or proposal. Furthermore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, for
         purposes of clause 10.2(c)(iii)(C)(2), the term "Third-Party
         Acquisition" shall not be deemed to include a transaction or series of
         transactions (other than a tender offer or exchange offer) in which a
         professional arbitrageur acquires solely for investment purposes (and
         not with the purpose or with the effect of changing or influencing the
         control of the Company (nor in connection with or as a participant in
         any transaction or series of transactions having such purpose or
         effect)) more than 20% but less than 35% of the outstanding voting
         power of the Company; PROVIDED that the Company has not cooperated,

                                       57
<PAGE>

         assisted, facilitated or otherwise had any involvement in such
         transaction or series of transactions.

                         (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 10.2 to
         the contrary, the Company shall not be required to pay any Termination
         Fee and/or Parent Expense Reimbursement Amount to Parent in the event
         this Agreement is terminated by Parent as a result of (i) Parent's
         refusal to waive or deem satisfied its condition in 9.3(d) or 9.3(j) or
         (ii) the condition in 9.3(f) or 9.3(i) becoming incapable of being
         satisfied due to the death or "Disability" (as that term is defined in
         the applicable Employment Agreement) of either Jeffrey Webb or John
         Nichols.

                  10.3. FEES AND EXPENSES. Except as otherwise specifically
provided herein, all fees and expenses incurred in connection herewith and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring expenses,
whether or not the Merger is consummated.

covenants or agreements in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time. This Section 11.2
shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties which by its terms

                  11.3. AMENDMENTS; NO WAIVERS.

                         (a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or
         waived prior to the Effective Time, if, and only if, the amendment or
         waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by the

         other occasion. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any
         right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof

of its obligations hereunder); PROVIDED, FURTHER, that other than with respect
to the

                                       59

foregoing proviso, no party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of
its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the consent of the other
parties hereto. Any purported assignment in violation hereof shall be null and
void.

                  11.5. COUNTERPARTS; EFFECTIVENESS; THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES.

be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto
were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each
party hereto shall have received counterparts hereof signed by all of the other
parties hereto. Except as set forth in Section 7.1, no provision of this
Agreement is intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto
any rights or remedies hereunder.

waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection which it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any suit, action or proceeding

that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

                  11.11. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL
