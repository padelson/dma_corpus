I - Conditions to the Offer    - iii -    5    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
MERGER   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of October 13,
2000 ("Agreement"), among Specialty Equipment Companies, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), United Technologies Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), and Solar Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Purchaser").   W I T N E S S E T
H:   WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Purchaser
and the Company have approved the acquisition of the Company by Purchaser
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;  
WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, it is proposed that Purchaser
shall make a cash tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as
permitted under this Agreement, the "Offer") to acquire all of the issued
and outstanding shares (the "Shares") of the common stock, $.01 par value, of
the Company (the "Common Stock") at a purchase price of $30.50 per share
(such price or such other price per share as may be payable in the Offer, the
"Offer Price"), net to the seller in cash, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement;   WHEREAS, the respective Boards of
Directors of Purchaser and Parent as the sole stockholder of Purchaser have
each approved this Agreement and the merger of Purchaser with and into the
Company (the "Merger"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement;   WHEREAS, as a condition to and inducement to
Parent\'s and Purchaser\'s willingness to enter into this Agreement,
simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, certain holders and
beneficial owners of Shares are entering into a Stockholder Agreement (the
"Stockholder Agreement") with Purchaser;   WHEREAS, the Board of Directors
of the Company (the "Board of Directors") has unanimously, (i) approved the
Offer, the Merger, this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement (and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby) and (ii) resolved, subject to
the provisions of Article VII hereof, to recommend that the holders of such
Shares accept the Offer and approve this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby;   WHEREAS, Parent, Purchaser and the Company desire to
make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in
connection with the Offer and the Merger and also to prescribe various
conditions to the Offer and the Merger; and   WHEREAS, capitalized terms
not defined in the context in the Section in which they first appear shall
have the meanings set forth in Section 8.15.   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the other parties herein contained,
and intending to be legally bound hereby, each of Parent, Purchaser and the
Company hereby agree as follows:    6    ARTICLE I  THE OFFER  
Section 1.01. The Offer.    (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have
been terminated in accordance with Article VII and none of the events
specified in clause (iii) of Annex I shall have occurred and then be
continuing, as promptly as practical after the date hereof, but in no event
later than the sixth business day after the date hereof, Parent shall cause
Purchaser to commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange
Act) the Offer at the Offer Price. The obligation of Purchaser to consummate
the Offer, to accept for payment and to pay for any Shares tendered pursuant
to the Offer shall be subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in Annex I. The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the twentieth
business day following commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under
the Exchange Act) of the Offer. Parent shall cause Purchaser to, and
Purchaser shall, subject to the conditions provided in Annex I, accept for
payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer as soon as practicable after such expiration date and in any
event in compliance with the obligations respecting prompt payment pursuant
to Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act. On or prior to the dates that the
Purchaser becomes obligated to accept for payment and pay for Shares pursuant
to the Offer, Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to the Purchaser
the funds necessary to pay for all Shares that Purchaser becomes so obligated
to accept for payment and pay for pursuant to the Offer. The Offer Price
shall be net to the seller in cash, without interest, subject to any
applicable withholding taxes.   (b) Purchaser reserves the right to (i)
waive any of the conditions set forth in Annex I (other than the Minimum
Condition and the condition relating to the expiration of the waiting period
under the HSR Act), (ii) increase the price per Share payable in the Offer,
and (iii) make any other changes in the terms of the Offer; provided,
however, unless previously approved by the Company in writing no change may
be made which (a) reduces the maximum number of Shares to be purchased
pursuant to the Offer, (b) decreases the price per Share payable pursuant to
the Offer, (c) changes the form of consideration to be paid for the Shares
pursuant to the Offer, (d) imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to the
conditions set forth in Annex I, (e) waives the Minimum Condition or waives
the condition relating to the expiration of the waiting period under the HSR
Act or (f) makes other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer that
are in any manner adverse to the holders of Shares. Without the prior written
consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not extend the expiration date of the
Offer beyond the initial expiration date of the Offer, except (x) as required
by applicable law including applicable rules and regulations of the SEC or
any interpretation or position of the SEC staff, (y) that if, immediately
prior to the expiration date of the Offer (as it may be extended), the Shares
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer constitute less than 90% of
the outstanding Shares, Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, extend the
Offer for one or more periods not to exceed an aggregate of ten business
days, notwithstanding that all conditions to the Offer are satisfied as of
such expiration date of the Offer; provided that after the initial expiration
date, the Offer shall not be subject to any conditions that are at the time
of such extension satisfied other than the Minimum Condition and the
conditions set forth in paragraph (a) of Annex I, or (z) that if
any condition to the Offer has not been satisfied or waived, Purchaser shall
extend the expiration date of the Offer for one or more periods, but in no
event later than the Outside Date. In addition, the Offer Price may be
increased and the Offer may be extended to the extent required by law in
connection with such increase without the consent of the Company.    - 2
-   7   (c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase
(the "Offer to Purchase") subject only to the conditions set forth in Annex
I. As soon as reasonably practicable on the date the Offer is commenced,
Parent and Purchaser shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the
"Schedule TO") with respect to the Offer that (i) will comply in all material
respects with the provisions of all applicable federal securities laws and
(ii) will contain (including as an exhibit) or incorporate by reference the
Offer to Purchase, a form of the related letter of transmittal and a summary
advertisement (which documents, together with any supplements or amendments
thereto, are referred to collectively herein as the "Offer Documents"). Each
of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Purchaser, on the other hand,
agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it in writing for use
in the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents if and to the extent that the
Schedule TO or the Offer Documents shall be, or have become, false or
misleading in any material respect, and Parent and Purchaser further agree to
take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO, as so corrected, to be
filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be
disseminated to holders of Shares and any other holder of securities issued
by the Company (if any), in each case to the extent required by applicable
federal securities laws. Parent and Purchaser shall provide the Company and
its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Schedule TO and any Offer Documents before they are filed with the
SEC. Parent and Purchaser shall promptly provide the Company and its counsel
in writing with, and consult with the Company and its counsel regarding,
any comments Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive from time to time
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO or the Offer
Documents.   Section 1.02. Company Action.   (a) The Company hereby
consents to the Offer and represents and warrants that the Board of
Directors, at a meeting duly called and held on October 13, 2000, acting by a
unanimous vote of the directors: (i) approved and adopted this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger and
the transactions contemplated by the Stockholder Agreement (including,
without limitation, for purposes of Section 9 of the Confidentiality
Agreement dated August 14, 2000 between Parent and the Company (the
"Confidentiality Agreement")); (ii) resolved to recommend that
the stockholders of the Company accept the Offer, tender their Shares
pursuant to the Offer and approve this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger; (iii) determined that this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and
the Merger, are advisable and in the best interests of the stockholders of
the Company and that the consideration to be paid for each Share in the Offer
and the Merger is fair to the holders of Shares; and (iv) irrevocably has
taken all action necessary to render Section 203 of the DGCL and other state
takeover statutes inapplicable to the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement and
the Stockholder Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. The Board has received the opinion of Credit Suisse First Boston
Corporation (the "Company\'s Financial Advisor") to the effect that, based
upon and subject to the matters set forth therein and as of the date thereof,
the Offer Price to be received by holders of Shares (other than Parent and
its Affiliates) pursuant to the Offer and the Merger is fair to such holders
of Shares from a financial point of view. The Company hereby consents to the
inclusion in the Offer Documents of the recommendations of the Board
described in this Section 1.02, provided that this Agreement has not
been terminated.   (b) The Company shall file with the SEC, as promptly as
practicable after the filing by Purchaser of the Schedule TO with respect to
the Offer but in any event on the date such Schedule TO is filed with the
SEC, a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
(together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9")
that   - 3 -    8  (i) will comply in all material respects with the
provisions of all applicable federal securities laws and (ii) will include
the recommendations of the Board of Directors referred to in clause (ii) of
Section 1.02(a) and the opinion of the Company\'s Financial Advisor referred
to in Section 4.16, provided that this Agreement has not been terminated.
Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Purchaser, on the other
hand, agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in
the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that the Schedule 14D-9 shall be, or
have become, false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company
shall take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected,
to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Company\'s stockholders, in
each case to the extent required by applicable law. The Company shall provide
Parent, Purchaser and their counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC. The
Company shall promptly provide the Parent and Purchaser and their counsel in
writing with, and consult with Parent and Purchaser and its counsel
regarding, any comments the Company or its counsel may receive from the time
to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9.   (c)
In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly upon execution of
this Agreement furnish Parent and Purchaser with mailing labels, security
position listings, any available non-objecting beneficial owner lists and any
available listing or computer list containing the names and addresses of the
record holders of the Shares and holders of other securities issued by
the Company (if any) as of the most recent practicable date and shall furnish
the Purchaser with such additional available information (including, but not
limited to, updated lists of holders of Common Stock and their addresses,
mailing labels and lists of security positions and non-objecting beneficial
owner lists) and such other information and assistance as Parent, Purchaser
or their agents may reasonably request for the purpose of communicating the
Offer to the record and beneficial holders of Shares. Subject to the
requirements of law, and except for such steps as are necessary to such
dissemination of, and communication with respect to, the Offer Documents and
any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer and the Merger,
Purchaser shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such
labels and lists and the additional information referred to in the
penultimate sentence of this Section 1.02(c), will use such information only
in connection with the Offer and the Merger, and, if this Agreement is
terminated, will, upon request, deliver to the Company all such written
information then in its possession.   Section 1.03. Directors. Promptly upon
the payment of the Offer Price by Purchaser for the Shares tendered pursuant
to the Offer, Purchaser shall be entitled to designate up to such number of
directors (the "Purchaser Designees"), rounded up to the nearest whole
number, to the Board of Directors as will give Purchaser, subject to
compliance with the Exchange Act, representation on the Board of Directors
equal to the product of the total number of directors on the Board of
Directors (giving effect to the directors appointed or elected pursuant to
this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of
Shares as are accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer bears to the number
of Shares then outstanding. In furtherance thereof, upon Purchaser\'s
request, the Company shall use its best efforts, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, after consummation of the Offer, to secure the resignations
of such number of directors as is necessary to enable Purchaser\'s designees
to be elected to the Board of Directors in accordance with the terms of this
Section 1.03. At such time, the Company shall also cause, if requested by
Purchaser, (i) each committee of the Board of Directors, (ii) the board
of directors of each of the Subsidiaries and (iii) each committee of such
board to include persons designated by Purchaser constituting up to the same
percentage (rounded up to the nearest whole number) of each such committee or
board as Purchaser Designees constitute on the Board of Directors. The
foregoing notwithstanding, until the Effective Time, the Company, Purchaser
and Parent shall use all reasonable best efforts to retain as members of
the   - 4 -   9   Company\'s Board of Directors at least two directors
who are directors of the Company on the date hereof and who are not
representatives of Parent (the "Independent Directors"). As used in this
Agreement, the term "Independent Directors" shall initially mean each of
Messrs. Richard A. Kent and Barry L. MacLean; provided that in the event that
any such Independent Director resigns or otherwise ceases to be a director
for any reason, then the Company, Purchaser and Parent shall use their best
efforts to cause a Person nominated by the remaining Independent Directors to
be elected as a replacement for such director as expeditiously as legally
practicable. If for any reason at any time prior to the Effective Time no
Independent Directors then remain, then (i) the other directors shall use
best efforts to designate two persons to be the Independent Directors, none
of whom shall be directors, officers, employees or Affiliates of Parent or
Purchaser, and (ii) the Company, Purchaser and Parent shall use their best
efforts to cause such persons to be elected as a replacement for
such director as expeditiously as legally practicable. The Company shall
promptly take all action necessary to effect such contemplated election,
including (i) establishing as a record date for the written consent by the
Company\'s Stockholders to such election a date that is within six business
days prior to the commencement of the Offer and (ii) filing with the SEC a
Schedule 14A (together with any supplements or amendments thereto the
"Schedule 14A") regarding the solicitation of written consents to the
election of the Purchaser Designees which shall contain the information as
may be required by Schedule 14A under the Exchange Act as is necessary to
enable the Purchaser Designees to be elected to the Board of Directors,
including distributing the information required by the Exchange Act and such
Schedule with the Schedule 14D-9. Purchaser will supply to the Company in
writing and be solely responsible for any information with respect to itself
and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Schedule
14A. Parent and Purchaser will disseminate the Schedule 14A to the holders of
the Shares together with the Offer Documents. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, following the time directors designated by
Purchaser constitute a majority of the Board of Directors and prior to the
Effective Time, the affirmative vote of a majority of the Independent
Directors shall be required to (i) amend or terminate this Agreement on
behalf of the Company, (ii) exercise or waive any of the Company\'s rights or
remedies hereunder, (iii) extend the time for performance of
Parent\'s obligations hereunder, or (iv) approve any other action by the
Company that could adversely affect the interests of the stockholders of the
Company (other than Parent, Purchaser and their Affiliates) with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby and such affirmative majority vote shall
be sufficient to take any such action.   ARTICLE II  THE MERGER  
Section 2.01. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time in accordance with the DGCL, Purchaser
shall be merged with and into the Company. Following the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Purchaser shall cease and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").   Section 2.02.
Closing; Effective Time.   (a) The closing of the Merger (the "Closing")
will take place at 10:00 a.m. Chicago time on a date to be specified by the
parties, which shall be no later than the second business day after
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI, at the
offices of Sonnenschein Nath and Rosenthal, 8000 Sears Tower, Chicago, Illinois
60606, unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing between
Parent and the Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to
in this Agreement as the "Closing Date."   - 5 -   10    (b) The Merger
shall be consummated by Parent duly filing, or causing the Company and/or
Purchaser to duly file, the appropriate Certificate of Merger in such form as
is required by, and prepared, executed and acknowledged in accordance with,
the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at
such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL or at such later
time as is specified in the Certificate of Merger (the
"Effective Time").    Section 2.03. Effect of the Merger. At the Effective
Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable
provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Purchaser shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company
and Purchaser shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.   Section 2.04. Certificate of Incorporation; By-Laws;
Directors and Officers.   (a) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of
Incorporation of Company, as in effect immediately before the Effective Time,
shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until
thereafter amended as provided by law and such Certificate of
Incorporation.   (b) At the Effective Time, the By-Laws of Company, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the By-Laws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such By-
Laws.   (c) The directors of Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the
officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier
death, permanent disability, resignation or removal.   Section 2.05.
Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Purchaser, the Company or the holder of any
of the following securities:   (a) Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Shares to be canceled
pursuant to Section 2.05(b) and any Dissenting Shares shall be canceled and
be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash payable to the
holder thereof, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"), upon surrender
of the certificate representing such Share, less any applicable withholding
taxes.   (b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company or owned by
any Subsidiary and each Share owned by Parent, Purchaser or any direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or Purchaser immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be canceled and no payment or other consideration
shall be made with respect thereto.   (c) Each share of common stock,
$0.0001 par value, of Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and thereafter represent one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $.0l par
value, of the Surviving Corporation.   - 6 -   11    Section 2.06.
Dissenting Shares.   (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, but only to the extent required by the DGCL, Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and owned of record by
any stockholder who has not voted such Shares in favor of or consented to the
Merger and who properly demands appraisal of such Shares pursuant to the DGCL
and complies with all the provisions of the DGCL concerning the right of
holders of Shares to demand appraisal of their Shares in connection with the
Merger (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but shall become the right to
receive such cash consideration as may be determined to be due to such
stockholder as provided in the DGCL. If, however, such stockholder withdraws
such holder\'s demand for appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise loses
such holder\'s right of appraisal, in any case pursuant to the DGCL, each
such Share of such holder shall be deemed to be converted as of the Effective
Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.05(a), without any interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or
certificates representing such Shares.   (b) The Company shall give Parent
(i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal of Shares received by the
Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. Except as
required by law, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, settle, or offer to settle any such
demands.   (c) Each Dissenting Share, if any, shall be canceled after
payment in respect thereof has been made to the holder thereof pursuant to
the DGCL.   (d) At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto except the rights provided by
Section 262 of the DGCL or otherwise provided in this Section 2.06.  
Section 2.07. Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books.   (a) Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company which shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as paying agent in the Merger
(the "Paying Agent") to receive the funds necessary to make the payments
contemplated by Section 2.05(a). From time to time after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause Purchaser to and Purchaser shall deposit with such Paying
Agent an amount of cash sufficient to permit the Paying Agent to make the
payments necessary for payment of the Merger Consideration under Section
2.07(b) to which holders of Shares shall be entitled at the Effective Time
pursuant to Section 2.05(a). Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent
as directed by Parent. Any net profits resulting from, or interest or income
produced by, such investments shall be payable as directed by Parent.   (b)
As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of
a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented Shares (the "Certificates") (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration as
provided in Section 2.05(a). Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation
to the Paying Agent or to such other   - 7 -   12   agent or agents as
may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Paying Agent, as consented to by Company, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash, without
interest, into which the Shares theretofore represented by such Certificate
shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.05(a), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.   (c) If payment of cash in respect
of canceled Shares is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name a surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such
payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason
of such payment in a name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of
Parent or the Paying Agent that such tax either has been paid or is not
payable. If a mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the Paying Agent or if
the holder of a Certificate submits an affidavit to the Paying Agent stating
that the Certificate has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, such
holder shall, if required by Parent, furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in
the reasonable judgment of Parent to protect Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent from any loss that any of them may
suffer.   (d) Promptly following the date six months after the Effective
Time, the Paying Agent shall deliver to Parent all cash, certificates and
other documents in its possession relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby, and the Paying Agent\'s duties shall terminate. Thereafter, each
holder of a Certificate (other than Certificates representing Dissenting
Shares and Certificates representing Shares to be canceled pursuant to
Section 2.05(b)) shall look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) and only as general
creditors thereof, with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by such holder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate shall not have been
surrendered prior to the date which is immediately prior to the date that
such unclaimed funds would otherwise become subject to any abandoned
property, escheat or similar law, then such unclaimed funds payable with
respect to such certificates shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.   (e) Parent (or any affiliate thereof) or the Paying Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as
Parent or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code, or under any provision of state,
local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Parent or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Parent or the
Paying Agent.   (f) All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates in
accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares theretofore
represented by such Certificates. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall not be any
further registration of transfers of Shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time on the records of the Surviving Corporation. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for   - 8 -   13  transfer, they shall be canceled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.05(a) and
this Section 2.07.   Section 2.08. Stock Plans.   (a) As of the Effective
Time, each outstanding option to purchase Shares (each, a "Company Stock
Option") issued pursuant to the Company\'s Executive Long-Term Incentive Plan
and Non-Employee Directors Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Stock Option
Plans") shall be cancelled and each holder of Company Stock Options, whether
such Company Stock Option is vested or not, will receive, in consideration of
such holder\'s Company Stock Options a cash payment from Parent immediately
upon the Effective Time equal to the product of (A) the amount by which the
Merger Consideration amount exceeds the exercise price of such Company Stock
Option and (B) the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of such Company
Stock Option.   (b) The provisions of this Section are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each holder of Company Stock
Options (it being expressly agreed that such persons shall be the third party
beneficiaries of this Section).   ARTICLE III  REPRESENTATIONS AND

Merger) or granting to any person or group of persons the right to elect, or
to designate or nominate for election, a director to the Board of Directors.

this Agreement by the Company, subject to obtaining the approval of the
Company\'s stockholders of the Merger if required by Section 251 of the DGCL,
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor
compliance by the Company with any of the provisions hereof, will (i)

merger notification requirements of the HSR Act, (iii) filings by the Company

or   - 13 -   18   the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, except where the failure to give such notices, make such filings or

prevent or materially delay consummation of the Offer or the Merger.  
Section 4.05. SEC Filings; Financial Statements.   (a) The Company has
timely filed all forms, reports, schedules, proxy statements, registration

and (ii) do not (except to the extent revised or superseded by a
subsequent filing with the SEC), and did not at the time they were filed,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the

made, not misleading.   (b) The consolidated financial statements contained
in the SEC Reports were prepared in accordance with United States generally
accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods involved and present fairly the financial position of the Company and

occurred, and there is not currently existing, any circumstance or event that
is reasonably likely to have individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect.   Section 4.07. Litigation. There are no claims, actions,
suits, proceedings or investigations pending or, to the knowledge of the

or the Merger.   Section 4.08. Employee Benefit Plans.   (a) The
Company\'s Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of all material "employee
benefit plans", as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA whether or not such plan
is subject to ERISA, and all other material employee employment agreements,
consulting agreements, severance or change of control agreements, benefit or
executive compensation arrangements, perquisite programs or
payroll practices, including, without limitation, any such material
arrangements or payroll practices providing severance pay, sick leave,
vacation pay, salary continuation for disability, retirement benefits,
deferred compensation, bonus pay, incentive pay, stock options (including
those held by directors, employees, and consultants), hospitalization
insurance, medical insurance, life insurance, scholarships or tuition
reimbursements, that are maintained by the Company, any Subsidiary or any
entity within the same "controlled group" as the Company or Subsidiary,
within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA (an "ERISA Affiliate") or
to which the Company, any Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate is obligated to
contribute thereunder for current or former employees or directors of the
Company, any Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate (the "Employee Benefit Plans").
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any plan
or commitment, whether legally binding or not, to create any additional
Employee Benefit Plan or modify or change any existing Employee Benefit Plan
that would materially increase the benefits provided to any employee or
former employee, consultant or director of the Company or any Subsidiary
thereof. Since January 31, 2000 there has been no material change, amendment,
modification to, or adoption of, any Employee Benefit Plan.   (b) The
Company has delivered or made available to Parent true, correct and complete
copies of the following documents, with respect to each of the Employee
Benefit Plans: (i) all Employee Benefit Plan documents and related trust
documents, if any, and amendments thereto; (ii) the most recent Forms 5500,
if any; (iii) current summary plan descriptions, if any; (iv) the most recent
determination letter from the IRS, if any and (v) the most recent actuarial
valuation reports.   (c) None of the Employee Benefit Plans is a
"multiemployer plan", as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA or a plan
that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under
common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA.   (d) None of
the Employee Benefit Plans is a "single employer plan," as defined in Section
4001(a)(15) of ERISA, that is subject to Title IV of ERISA.    - 15 -  
20    (e) Each Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify
under Section 401 of the Code and each trust maintained pursuant thereto has
been determined to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501
of the Code by the IRS, and nothing material has occurred with respect to the
operation of any such Employee Benefit Plan that is reasonably likely to
cause the loss of such qualification or exemption or to require a filing
under Rev. Proc. 2000-16 or any predecessor thereto to maintain such
qualification.   (f) All material contributions required to be made to any
Employee Benefit Plan by the Company or any Subsidiary by applicable law or
regulation or by any plan document, and all premiums due from or payable by
the Company or any Subsidiary with respect to insurance policies funding any
Employee Benefit Plan, for any period through the date hereof have been
timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required to be made or paid
on or before the date hereof, have been appropriately reflected in the
financial statements of the Company included in the SEC Reports to the extent
required under United States generally accepted accounting principles.  
(g) Under each Employee Benefit Plan that is a single-employer plan as of the
last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the date hereof,
the actuarially determined present value of all "benefit liabilities", within
the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA or, with respect to any Employee
Benefit Plan established pursuant to the laws of a country other than the
United States ("Foreign Plan") as determined under any equivalent law or
practice (in each case as determined on the basis of the actuarial
assumptions contained in the Employee Benefit Plan\'s most recent actuarial
valuation), did not exceed the then current value of the assets of such
Employee Benefit Plan (or, with respect to a Foreign Plan that in accordance
with local law, custom or practice is not funded, adequate reserves are
appropriately reflected in the financial statements of the Company included
in the SEC Reports to the extent required under United States generally
accepted accounting principles), and there has been no material adverse
change in the financial condition of such Employee Benefit Plan (with respect
to either assets or benefits) since the last day of the most recent plan
year.   (h) The Company has materially complied with the continuation
coverage requirements of Sections 601 through 608 of ERISA, and the
requirements of any similar state law regarding continued insurance coverage,
and there is no material suit or action pending or threatened against the
Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to such requirements.   (i) No
amount of compensation paid or payable by the Company to any employee will
result in any nondeductible compensation under Section 162(m) of the
Code.   (j) To the Company\'s knowledge, none of the Company, the
Subsidiaries, the officers or directors of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, any trusts created thereunder or any trustee or administrator
of any Employee Benefits Plans subject to ERISA, has engaged in a "prohibited
transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975
of the Code) that subjects the Company, any of its Subsidiaries to a tax or
penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by such Section 4975 or liability
under Section 502(i) or (l) of ERISA which would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   (k)
There are no material pending actions, claims or lawsuits which have been
asserted, instituted or, to the Company\'s knowledge, threatened, against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Employee Benefit Plan with respect
to the operation of the Employee Benefit Plan (other than routine benefit
claims).   - 16 -   21    (l) All Employee Benefit Plans have been
maintained and administered, in all material respects, in accordance with
their terms, with all provisions of ERISA, the Code (including rules and
regulations under ERISA or the Code), and other applicable federal and state
laws and regulations, all to the extent applicable to each such Employee
Benefit Plan.   (m) With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan that is a
"welfare plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA, neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary has any obligations to provide health, life insurance, or
death benefits with respect to current or former employees, consultants or
directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries beyond their termination
of employment or service, other than as required under Section 4980B of the
Code, and each such Employee Benefit Plan may be amended or terminated at any
time without incurring liability thereunder. Except as set forth in Section
4.08 of the Company\'s Disclosure Letter, there has been no communication to
any employee, consultant or director of the Company or any Subsidiary that
would reasonably be expected to create an enforceable promise or guarantee of
such retiree health or life insurance or other retiree death benefits on a
permanent basis.   (n) No Employee Benefit Plan, or the Company or any
Subsidiary with respect to such Employee Benefit Plan, is under audit or is
the subject of an audit or investigation by the IRS, the U.S. Department of
Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any other federal or state
governmental agency, nor is any such audit or investigation pending or
threatened.   (o) All Foreign Plans have been established, operated,
administered and maintained, in all material respects, in compliance with all
laws, regulations and orders applicable thereto. All premiums, contributions
and any other amounts required by applicable Foreign Plan documents or
applicable laws to be paid or accrued by the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries have been paid or accrued as required and have been
appropriately reflected in the financial statements of the Company included
in the SEC Reports to the extent required under United States generally
accepted accounting principles.   (p) Neither the execution and delivery of
this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
either alone or in conjunction with any other event (whether contingent or
otherwise), will except as contemplated by Section 2.08 of this Agreement (i)
result in any nondeductible compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code or
any payment (including, without limitation, severance, unemployment
compensation, "excess parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G
of the Code), forgiveness of indebtedness or otherwise) becoming due to any
director or any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any
Employee Benefit Plan or otherwise; (ii) materially increase any benefits
otherwise payable under any Employee Benefit Plan; (iii) result in any
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits; (iv)
materially limit or prohibit the ability to amend or terminate any Employee
Benefit Plan; (v) require the funding of any trust or other funding vehicle;
or (vi) renew or extend the term of any agreement in respect of compensation
for an employee of the Company or any Subsidiary that would create any
liability to the Company, any Subsidiary, Parent or Purchaser or their
respective affiliates after consummation of the Offer.   (q) Each
employment retention agreement between the Company and the executives
identified on Section 4.08(q) of the Company\'s Disclosure Letter have been
amended in the applicable form set forth in Section 4.08(q) of the Company\'s
Disclosure Letter.    - 17 -   22  Section 4.09. Labor and Employment.
There is no (i) unfair labor practice charge pending or, to the Company\'s
knowledge, threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii)
there is no labor strike, slowdown, stoppage or other similar labor activity
actually pending or, to the Company\'s knowledge, threatened against or
involving the Company or its Subsidiaries; and (iii) no material labor
grievance is pending or, to the Company\'s knowledge, threatened which,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary (i) is
presently a party to or otherwise bound by any collective
bargaining agreement or union contract and (ii) has any material labor
negotiations in progress with any labor union or other labor organization. To
the Company\'s knowledge, there are no efforts in progress by labor unions to
organize any employees who are not now represented by recognized collective
bargaining agents.   Section 4.10. Environmental Matters. Except as set
forth in the financial statements contained in the Company\'s Form 10-K and
except for Environmental Liability (as defined below) which has not had and
is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect: (a) each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is and
has been in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws; (b) no current

have given rise to any Release that may require cleanup or other study,

and each Subsidiary have all permits, licenses and other authorizations
required under any Environmental Law ("Environmental Permits"); (d) the
Company and each Subsidiary is in compliance with its Environmental Permits;

applicable times hereunder held, all permits, licenses, variances,
exemptions, franchises, authorizations and approvals from all Governmental
Entities that are required for the operation of the businesses of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and the ownership, operation, lease and holding by the
Company and its Subsidiaries of their respective properties and assets (the
"Company Permits") to the extent the failure to do so, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect
or would prevent or materially delay the Offer or the Merger. The Company and
its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with the terms of
the Company Permits to the extent the failure to do so, individually or in
the aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect or would prevent or materially delay consummation of the Offer or the
Merger. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with
all applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes, ordinances, laws,
rules, regulations, orders, judgments and decrees of any Governmental Entity
to the extent the failure to so comply, individually or in the aggregate, has
had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or would
prevent or materially delay consummation of the Offer or the Merger.  
Section 4.12. Taxes.   (a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has duly
filed with the appropriate Governmental Entity all Tax Returns required to be
filed by the Company or such Subsidiary. All such Tax Returns were correct
and complete in all material respects. Except to the extent that failure to
do so would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect: (i) all Taxes due thereon have been paid, and
the most recent financial statements contained in the SEC Reports provide an
adequate accrual for the payment of Taxes for the periods   - 18 -  
23  covered by such reports; and (ii) the Company and each Subsidiary has
duly withheld and paid all Taxes which it is required to withhold and pay
relating to amounts heretofore due or owing to any employee, independent
contractor, creditor, shareholder or any other third party. Since July 31,
2000, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has incurred any Tax other than
Taxes incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent in type and
amount with past practices of the Company and each Subsidiary,
respectively.   (b) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has requested any
extension of time within which to file any Tax Return in respect of any
taxable year, which Tax Return has not since been filed.   (c) Set forth in
the Company\'s Disclosure Letter is a complete list of all Tax Returns filed
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that have been examined or audited
by the IRS or any other Governmental Entity during the preceding three years,
and except as set forth in the Company\'s Disclosure Letter, no such audit or
examination is in progress. No (i) deficiency or adjustment for any Taxes has
been proposed or assessed against the Company or any Subsidiary, except for
deficiencies or adjustments which have been fully satisfied, settled or
reserved for in the financial statements; (ii) waivers or comparable consents
have been given by the Company or any Subsidiary that remain outstanding with
respect to any Tax Return of the Company or any Subsidiary regarding the
application of any statute of limitations with respect to any Taxes or Tax
Returns of the Company or any such Subsidiary; and (iii) issue has been
raised in any examination or audit of any Tax Return of the Company or
any Subsidiary that, by application of similar principles, is reasonably
likely to result in the assertion of a deficiency for any other year not so
examined or audited. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has (x) been a
member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return
(other than a group the common parent of which is the Company) or (y) any
liability for the Taxes of any person (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) under Section 1.1502-6 of the Treasury Regulations (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or
successor, by contract or otherwise.   (d) The Company has made available to
the Parent for inspection copies of all material Tax Returns filed (or
intended to be filed) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries within the
previous three years and all workpapers prepared in connection with the

necessary to correct any statements in any earlier filing by the Company with
the SEC or communication from the Company to the holder of Shares with
respect to the Offer, the Merger or the Company\'s Stockholders\' Meeting (if
any) that has become false or misleading. Any proxy statement to be sent to
the stockholders of the Company in connection with a meeting of
the Company\'s stockholders to consider the Merger (the "Company
Stockholders\' Meeting") or the information statement to be sent to such
stockholders in connection with any action by consent in   - 19 -  
24   writing in lieu of a meeting, as appropriate (such proxy statement
or information statement, as amended or supplemented, is herein referred to
as the "Proxy Statement"), as amended or supplemented from time to time, will
comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the DGCL. The Proxy Statement will not, at the time the
Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) is filed with the
SEC or first sent to stockholders, at the time of the Company Stockholders\'
Meeting (if any) or at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact (i) required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (ii) necessary
to correct any statement in any earlier filing by the Company with the SEC or
communication from the Company to the holders of Shares with respect to the

first published, sent or given to stockholders of the Company, will comply in
all material respects with the Exchange Act. The Schedule 14A will not, at
the respective times the Schedule 14A or any amendments or supplements

stockholders of the Company, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing,

provision in the Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws or under

opinion (or a reference thereto) in the Schedule 14D-9.   Section 4.17.

applicable law or the Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws,
call or hold any stockholders\' meeting other than as required by Section 251
of the DGCL to approve the Merger.   - 25 -    30    Section 5.02. No
Solicitation.   (a) Until this Agreement has been terminated in accordance
with Section 7.01 (and the payments, if any, required to be made in
connection with such termination pursuant to Section 7.02(b) have been made),
the Company shall not and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
officers, directors, employees, consultants, representatives, affiliates and
other agents, including, but not limited to, investment bankers, attorneys
and accountants (collectively, the "Company Representatives"), not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) encourage, solicit, initiate or facilitate the
making of, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making
of any proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to,
any Acquisition Proposal (including, without limitation, by taking any action
that would make Section 203 of the DGCL inapplicable to an Acquisition
Proposal), (ii) participate in any way in discussions or negotiations with,
or furnish or disclose any information or afford any access to the
properties, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to,
any Person (other than Parent or Purchaser or any affiliate or associate of
Parent or Purchaser) in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent or Purchaser the approval and recommendation of the Offer, the Merger
or this Agreement, (iv) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve
or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (unless contemporaneously with such
approval or recommendation the Company terminates this Agreement in
accordance with Section 7.01(e)), (v) release any third party from any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which the Company is a party or
fail to enforce to the fullest extent possible, or grant any waiver,
request or consent to any Acquisition Proposal under, any such agreement, or
(vi) enter into any agreement, letter of intent or similar document
contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Proposal; provided,
however, that this Section 5.02 shall not prohibit the Company or the Company
Representatives from:   (A) (i) issuing a press release or otherwise
publicly  disclosing the terms of this Agreement (including the provisions
of  this Section 5.02), the Offer, the Merger or any Acquisition Proposal, 
(ii) proceeding with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,  (iii)
communicating to the holders of the Company\'s securities a  position with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal by a third party  contemplated by Rule
14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the  Exchange Act, or (iv) making any
disclosure to the holders of the  Company\'s securities which, in the
judgment of the Board of Directors  (after receiving the advice of legal
counsel) is advisable to be made  under applicable law (including laws
relating to the fiduciary duties  of directors); or   (B) participating in
discussions or negotiations with, or  furnishing or disclosing nonpublic
information to or entering into any  confidentiality or standstill or similar
agreements with, any Person  in response to an unsolicited, bona fide and
written Acquisition  Proposal that is submitted to the Company by such Person
after the  date of this Agreement and prior to the date an amount of Shares 
sufficient to satisfy the Minimum Condition have been accepted for  payment
pursuant to the Offer if (I) such Acquisition Proposal does  not result from
a violation of any of the provisions of this Section  5.02, (II) a majority
of the members of the Board of Directors  determines in good faith, after
having received the advice of its  financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that (x) such Person is  reasonably capable, financially and
otherwise, of consummating such  Acquisition Proposal, (y) such Acquisition
Proposal is reasonably  likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (z) failure
to do so would  result in a breach of the fiduciary duty of the Board of
Directors of  the Company to the stockholders of the Company under applicable
law,  and (III) prior to participating in   - 26 -    31   discussions
or negotiations with, or furnishing or disclosing any  nonpublic information
to, such Person, the Company gives Parent  written notice of the identity of
such Person and of the Company\'s  intention to participate in discussions or
negotiations with, or  furnish or disclose nonpublic information to, such
Person, and the  Company receives from such Person an executed
confidentiality  agreement containing terms no less restrictive than the
terms of the  Confidentiality Agreement.   Parent and Purchaser agree that
neither the Company, the Company Representatives, nor any Person who makes an
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed, by reason of taking actions permitted
under the provisos of paragraphs (A) and (B) of this Section 5.02, to have
tortiously or otherwise wrongfully interfered with or caused a breach of this
Agreement or any other agreements, instruments or documents executed in
connection herewith, or tortiously or otherwise wrongfully interfered with
the Offer, the Merger, the other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
or the rights of Parent, Purchaser or any of their Affiliates hereunder or
thereunder.   (b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
the Company Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any discussions or negotiations, if any, with any other parties that may be
ongoing as of the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.  
(c) "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any proposal or offer, or
any indication of interest in making an offer or proposal, made by any Person
or group (in each case, whether or not in writing and whether or not
delivered to the stockholders of the Company generally) relating to (i) any
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase which is structured to permit such
Person or group to acquire beneficial ownership of at least 10% of the assets
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or of over 10% of any class of
equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any tender
offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any Person,
other than Parent, Purchaser, their Affiliates or any group of which any of
them is a member beneficially owning 10% or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iii) any merger,
consolidation, business combination, sale of substantially all the assets,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. "Superior Proposal" shall mean an
unsolicited bona fide written proposal made by a third party to acquire all
of the issued and outstanding Shares pursuant to a tender offer or a merger
or to acquire all of the properties and assets of the Company on terms and
conditions that the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
receiving the written advice of its financial advisor and taking into account
all the terms and conditions of such proposal (including, without limitation,
any expense reimbursement provisions, termination fees and conditions), is
more favorable to the Company\'s stockholders from a financial point of view
than the transactions contemplated hereby and is reasonably likely to be
consummated.   (d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 shall prohibit
Purchaser from purchasing the Shares pursuant to the Offer or consummating
the Merger. Without limiting any other rights of Parent or Purchaser under
this Agreement in respect of any such action, neither any withdrawal or
modification by the Company of the approval or recommendation of the Offer or
the Merger nor the termination of this Agreement shall have any effect on the
approvals of, and other actions referred to herein for the purpose of causing
Section 203 of the DGCL and the other statutes referred to in Section 4.15
hereof and paragraph 9 of the Confidentiality Agreement to be inapplicable
to, this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, which approvals and actions are
irrevocable.   - 27 -    32    Section 5.03. Access to
Information.   (a) Subject to applicable law, during the period commencing
on the date hereof and ending on the earlier of (i) the Closing Date and (ii)
the date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.01, the
Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, upon reasonable
notice, afford Parent and Purchaser, and their respective counsel,
accountants, consultants and other authorized representatives, complete
access during normal business hours to the employees, properties (including
plants, offices, warehouses and other facilities), books and records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and cause the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\'
independent public accountants and tax advisors to provide access to their
work information so that the Parent and Purchaser may have the opportunity to
make such investigations as they shall desire of the affairs of the Company
and its Subsidiaries. The Company shall furnish as promptly as practicable to
Parent and Purchaser a copy of each form, report, schedule, statement,
registration statement and other document filed by it or its Subsidiaries
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
securities laws or the DGCL. The Company agrees to cause its officers and
employees, in a manner consistent with the fulfillment of their ongoing
duties and obligations, to furnish such additional financial and operating
data and other information and respond to such inquiries as Parent and
Purchaser shall from time to time reasonably request.   (b) Parent hereby
confirms to the Company that the Confidentiality Agreement is in full force
and effect.   Section 5.04. Stockholders Approval of the Merger. Following
the consummation of the Offer, the Company shall promptly take all action
necessary in accordance with the DGCL and its Certificate of Incorporation
and By-Laws to convene the Company Stockholders\' Meeting, or, at the option
of Parent, to seek approval of the Merger by written consent in lieu of the
Company Stockholder\'s Meeting. The Company shall use its reasonable efforts
to solicit from stockholders of the Company proxies to the extent a
stockholder meeting is to be held in favor of the Merger (or written consent
is to be obtained in lieu thereof) and shall take all other action necessary
or, in the reasonable opinion of Parent, advisable to secure any vote (or
written consent) of stockholders required by the DGCL to effect the Merger.
Parent agrees that it will vote, or cause to be voted, at the Company
Stockholders\' Meeting all Shares then owned by it or Purchaser or any of
Parent\'s other subsidiaries and Affiliates in favor of the Merger and the
adoption of this Agreement (or deliver written consents conforming to the
requirements of the DGCL in lieu thereof). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
Purchaser or any other subsidiary of Parent shall acquire at least 90% of the
outstanding Shares, and provided that the conditions set forth in Article VI
shall have been satisfied or waived, the Company shall use its best efforts
to take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become
effective as soon as practicable after such acquisition, without the approval
of the stockholders of the Company, in accordance with Section 253 of the
DGCL.   Section 5.05. Proxy Statement. As promptly as practicable after
the consummation of the Offer if required by the Exchange Act, the Company
shall prepare and file the Proxy Statement with the SEC subject to the prior
review and approval of Parent and Purchaser (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld), and shall use all reasonable efforts to have it
cleared by the SEC. The Company shall obtain and furnish the information
required to be included in the Proxy Statement, shall provide Parent and
Purchaser with, and consult with Parent and Purchaser regarding, any comments
that may be received from the SEC or its staff with respect thereto, shall,
subject to the prior review and approval of Parent and Purchaser (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), respond promptly to any such
comments made by the SEC or its staff with respect to the   - 28 -   
33 Proxy Statement and shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to
the Company\'s shareholders at the earliest practicable date. The Proxy
Statement shall contain the recommendation of the Board of Directors that the
Company\'s stockholders approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger.  
Section 5.06. Public Announcements. So long as this Agreement is in effect,
Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing,
and provide each other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon,
any press release or other public statements with respect to the Offer or the
Merger and shall not issue, or permit their affiliates to issue, any such
press release or make any such public statement without the written consent
of the other party, except as may be required by law or in accordance with
any listing agreement with any securities exchange on which such party\'s
securities are listed.   Section 5.07. Reasonable Best Efforts;
Cooperation.   (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, each
of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain in a
timely manner all necessary waivers, consents and approvals and to effect all
necessary registrations and filings, and to take, or cause to be taken, all
other actions and to do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly as
practicable the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that nothing in this Agreement (except as expressly provided for in
Section 1.01) shall obligate Parent or Purchaser to extend the Offer. Without
limiting the foregoing, each of the parties hereto shall (i) cooperate in
responding to inquiries from, and making presentations to, regulatory
authorities and customers, (ii) defend against and respond to any action,
suit, proceeding, or investigation, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order
entered, by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, (iii)
cooperate in the preparation and filing of the Offer Documents, the Schedule
TO, the Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement and (iv) promptly make all
regulatory filings and applications, including without limitation any
required filings and responses to requests for additional information under
the HSR Act and Foreign Antitrust Laws, and any amendments thereto as are
necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   (b) Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Parent, Purchaser
or any of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates to agree (i) to limit
in any manner or not to exercise any rights of ownership of any securities
(including the Shares), or to divest, dispose of or hold separate any
securities or all or any portion of their respective businesses, assets or
properties or of the businesses, assets or properties of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or (ii) to limit in any material manner the ability of
such entities (A) to conduct their respective businesses or own such assets
or properties or to conduct the businesses or own the properties or assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries or (B) to control their respective
businesses or operations or the businesses or operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries.   Section 5.08. Indemnification.   (a) The Certificate
of Incorporation and the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain
the provisions in favor of the directors, officers, employees or agents of
the Company, or of any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust
or other enterprise with which he or she is or was serving in such capacity
at the request of the Company, with respect to indemnification and
exculpation from liability set forth in the Company\'s Certificate
of Incorporation and By-Laws on   - 29 -    34  the date of this
Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who on or prior
to the Effective Time were directors, officers or employees of the Company,
or any of its subsidiaries unless such modification is required by
law. Parent shall guarantee the obligations of the Surviving Corporation with
respect to the indemnification provisions contained in the Surviving
Corporation\'s Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws and in any currently
existing agreements with respect to indemnification between the Company and
any of its current and former officers, directors or employees of the
Company, to the extent such agreements are listed in the Disclosure Letter
and copies of the forms thereof are provided by the Company.   (b) For six
years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in
effect, in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time, policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance covering
each person currently covered by such policies on terms with respect
to coverage and amount no less favorable in any material respect than those
of such policy in effect on the date hereof; provided, however, that in
satisfying its obligation under this Section 5.08(b) the Surviving
Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 200%
of the amount per annum the Company is currently paying for such coverage;
provided further that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceeds such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain
policies with as much coverage as is available for a cost not exceeding such
amount.   (c) The provisions of this Section 5.08 are intended for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the respective indemnified parties.
The obligations of Parent and Purchaser under this Section 5.08 shall not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
indemnified party to whom this Section 5.08 applies without the consent of
such party.   Section 5.09. Takeover Statutes. If any state takeover statute
or other similar statute or regulation becomes or is deemed to become
applicable to the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, the Company shall promptly take all action
necessary to render such statute or regulation inapplicable to all of the
foregoing.   Section 5.10. Employee Benefits. Each employee of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time will
become an employee of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time
("Company Employees"). Purchaser will provide to Company Employees for a
period of one year after the Effective Time, compensation, employee welfare
benefits, tax-qualified retirement benefits and other employee and fringe
benefits that are, in the aggregate, of at least equal value to those
currently in effect for such Company Employees. Aggregate comparable value
shall be determined separately for each principal line of business in which
the Company and its Subsidiaries are engaged. Purchaser shall waive any pre-
existing condition clause or waiting period requirement in welfare benefit
plans or programs (except to the extent such condition or waiting period in
comparable plans of the Company would apply to a participant or beneficiary
after the Closing if such plans continued after the Closing) and give credit
for deductible amounts and co-payments paid by Company Employees during the
current deductible year. Purchaser shall grant each Company Employee credit
under its tax-qualified retirement plans, for purposes of eligibility and
vesting (but not for purposes of benefit accrual), for Company Employee\'s
service with the Company and its Affiliates prior to the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to honor and assume the written employment
agreements (amended in accordance with Section 4.08(q)), severance
agreements, indemnification agreements with existing directors and officers
of the Company, incentive   - 30 -    35  arrangements and other
agreements listed on the Company\'s Disclosure Letter, all as in effect on
the date of this Agreement. The provisions of this Section 5.10 are not
intended to create any enforceable rights by, current or former employees,
officers and directors of the Company and their respective heirs and legal
representatives.   Section 5.11. Notification of Certain Matters. The
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Purchaser, and Parent or
Purchaser, as the case may be, shall give prompt notice to the Company, of
the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence, or non-
occurrence, of which is likely (a) to cause any representation or warranty of
such party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate (in the
case of any representation or warranty not limited by materiality or Material
Adverse Effect, in any material respect) if made as of any time at or prior
to the Effective Time or (b) to result in any material failure of such party
to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied hereunder.   Section 5.12. Subsequent Filings. Until the
Effective Time, the Company will timely file with the SEC each form, report
and document required to be filed by the Company under the Exchange Act and
will promptly deliver to Parent and Purchaser copies of each such report
filed with the SEC. As of their respective dates, none of such reports shall
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited
interim financial statements of the Company included in such reports shall be
prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles applied on a consistent basis (except as may be indicated in the
notes thereto) and shall fairly present the financial position of the Company
and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at the dates thereof and the results of
their operations and changes in financial position for the periods then
ended, except that the unaudited interim financial statements were or
are subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments which should not
be materially adverse to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole.   ARTICLE VI  CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER   Section 6.01. Conditions.
The respective obligations of each party to effect the Merger shall be
subject to the satisfaction or waiver, where permissible, on or prior to the
Effective Time of the following conditions:   (a) Purchaser shall have made,
or caused to be made, the Offer and shall have accepted for payment and paid
for Shares in an amount sufficient to satisfy the Minimum Condition and
otherwise pursuant to the Offer;   (b) The Merger and this Agreement shall
have been approved and adopted by the requisite vote of the stockholders of
the Company, if required by the DGCL; and   (c) No statute, rule,
regulation, judgment, writ, decree, order or injunction shall have been
promulgated, enacted, entered or enforced, and no other action shall have
been taken, by any Governmental Entity that in any of the foregoing cases has
the effect of making illegal or directly or indirectly restraining,
prohibiting or restricting the consummation of the Merger (provided that each
party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to have vacated
or reversed, in accordance with Section 5.07, any applicable judgment,
writ, decree, order or injunction).   - 31 -    36    ARTICLE VII 
TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER   Section 7.01. Termination. This
Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior
to the Effective Time, whether prior to or after approval of matters
presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of the Company
(with any termination by Parent also being an effective termination by
Purchaser):   (a) By the mutual written consent of Parent and the
Company;   (b) By either of Parent or the Company if any statute, law, rule
or regulation shall have been promulgated that prohibits the consummation of
the Offer or the Merger or if any Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other
action (which order, decree or ruling or other action each party hereto shall
use its reasonable best efforts to have vacated or reversed in accordance
with Section 5.07(a)), in each case restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such order,
decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and non-
appealable;   (c) By the Company if (i) Purchaser fails to commence the
Offer in violation of Section 1.01, (ii) as a result of the failure of one or
more conditions set forth in Annex I, Purchaser shall not have accepted for
payment and paid for Shares pursuant to the Offer in accordance with the
terms thereof on or before December 18, 2000; provided, however, that either
Purchaser or Company shall have the option, in their respective sole
discretion, to extend such date for an additional period not to exceed 60
business days if the sole reason that the Purchaser has not accepted for
payment and paid for Shares pursuant to the Offer is the failure of the
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or any Foreign Antitrust Laws to
expire or failure to obtain any required governmental or regulatory approval
(the "Outside Date") or (iii) Purchaser fails to purchase validly tendered
Shares in violation of the terms of this Agreement;   (d) By Parent if, due
to an occurrence or circumstance which would result in a failure to satisfy
any of the conditions to the Offer, Purchaser shall have (i) not commenced
the Offer within the time required by Section 1.01, (ii) terminated the Offer
without purchasing any Shares pursuant to the Offer or (iii) failed to accept
for payment Shares pursuant to the Offer prior to the Outside Date;   (e)
By the Company, prior to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, if (i)
the Company has complied with its obligations under Section 5.02 and (ii) the
Company has given Parent and Purchaser prior written notice, of not less than
the greater of seventy-two hours and two full business days, of its intention
to terminate this Agreement and accept or recommend a Superior Proposal and
of the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, provided that
the termination described in this Section 7.01(e) shall not be effective
unless and until the Company shall have paid to Parent the amounts specified
in Section 7.02(b);   (f) By Parent, prior to the purchase of Shares
pursuant to the Offer, if the Company breaches any of its covenants in
Section 5.02 or the Board of Directors of the Company shall have resolved to
effect any of the actions referred to in the first paragraph of Section
5.02(a);   (g) By Parent, prior to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the
Offer, if the Company shall have breached any of its representations,
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, which   - 32 -   
37  breach would give rise to a failure of a condition set forth in Annex I
and which breach has not been or is incapable of being cured by the Company
prior to the Outside Date; or   (h) By the Company, prior to the purchase
of Shares pursuant to the Offer, if the Parent or Purchaser shall have
breached any of their representations, warranties or covenants contained in
this Agreement, which breach would cause Parent or Purchaser to be unable to
complete the Offer and the Merger and which breach has not been or is
incapable of being cured prior to the Outside Date.   Section 7.02. Effect
of Termination.   (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either the Company or Parent or Purchaser as provided in Section 7.01, (i)
this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Purchaser or the Company,
except that (i) Article VIII and this Section 7.02 shall survive any
termination of this Agreement and (ii) nothing in this Section 7.02 shall
relieve any party to this Agreement for liability for breach of this
Agreement.   (b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to (i) Section
7.01(e), (ii) Section 7.01(f) or (iii) Section 7.01(c)(ii) or Section 7.01(d)
and, in the case of this clause (iii) only, at any time after the date of
this Agreement and prior to such termination an Acquisition Proposal shall
have been publicly announced or otherwise publicly communicated to the
stockholders of the Company generally and as of the date of such termination
such Acquisition Proposal shall not have been withdrawn or lapsed in
accordance with its terms, then the Company shall pay to Parent in
immediately available funds an amount equal to $20 million. If such amount
becomes payable pursuant to clause (i), (ii) or (iii)(A) of this Section
7.02(b), such amount shall be payable simultaneously with such termination
(in the case of termination by the Company) or within two business days
thereafter (in the case of termination by Parent). If such amount
becomes payable pursuant to clause (iii)(B) of this Section 7.02(b), it shall
be payable on the earlier of the Company\'s entry into such a definitive
agreement or within two business days following such consummation.   (c)
The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 7.02(b) are
an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, Parent and Purchaser would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to pay the amount due
pursuant to Section 7.02(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or
Purchaser commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company
for the amounts set forth in Section 7.02(b), the Company shall pay to Parent
or Purchaser, as the case may be, its costs and expenses (including
attorneys\' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made.   Section 7.03.
Amendment. Subject to Section 1.03, this Agreement may be amended by the
parties hereto by action taken by the respective Board of Directors of the
Company, Parent and Purchaser or by the respective officers authorized by
such Boards of Directors at any time prior to the Effective
Time (notwithstanding any stockholder approval); provided, however, that,
after approval of the Merger by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment
may be made which by law requires further approval by such stockholders
without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.   - 33 -   
38     Section 7.04. Extension; Waiver. Subject to Section 1.03, at any
time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto may (a) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other parties hereto contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance by the other parties
hereto with any of their agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by such party.
The failure of any party hereto to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.  
ARTICLE VIII  GENERAL PROVISIONS   Section 8.01. Non-Survival of
Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement shall not survive beyond the consummation of the Offer. The
covenants and agreements set forth herein shall survive the Effective Time
indefinitely (except to the extent a shorter period of time is explicitly
specified therein or as otherwise provided in Section 7.02).   Section
8.02. Expenses. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, except as expressly
set forth herein, all fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the
party incurring such fees, costs and expenses.   Section 8.03. Entire
Agreement. This Agreement (including the documents and the instruments
referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes any and
all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.   Section 8.04.
Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether
by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the
other parties (except that Parent may assign its rights and Purchaser may
assign its rights, interest and obligations to any Subsidiary of Parent
without the consent of the Company; provided that no such assignment shall
relieve Parent of any liability for any breach by such assignee). Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to
the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective
successors and assigns.   Section 8.05. Parties in Interest. Except as
otherwise provided herein, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other person any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.  
Section 8.06. Validity. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
