issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, on the
Effective Time, by reason of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, be converted into and become a right to receive 1.3636
shares of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Peoples Common Stock (the
"Exchange Ratio"). The shares of Peoples Common Stock payable pursuant to this
Section 1.02(g)(i) are sometimes referred to herein as the "Stock
Consideration" and together with the Additional Consideration (as defined
below) are sometimes referred to as the "Merger Consideration."

 



10 (ii) Each share of Penseco Common Stock which is either issued and held in
treasury of Penseco or by any Penseco Subsidiary or issued and held by
Peoples or its Subsidiaries (other than shares of Penseco Common Stock held in
trust accounts, managed accounts and the like or otherwise held in fiduciary
or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties (such
shares. "Trust Account Common Shares") and other than shares of Penseco Common
Stock held, directly or indirectly, by Penseco or Peoples in respect of a debt
preciously contracted (such shares, the "DPC Common Shares")) as of the

stock of Peoples or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefore.

 

(iii) No fraction of a whole share of Peoples Common Stock and no scrip or
certificates therefor shall be issued in connection with the Merger. Any
former holder of Penseco Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Peoples Common Stock shall receive, in lieu
thereof, cash in an amount equal to such fraction of a share multiplied by the
Peoples Market Share Price as of the Effective Time. For purposes of
determining any fractional share interest, all shares of Penseco Common Stock
owned by a Penseco Shareholder shall be combined so as to calculate the
maximum number of whole shares of Peoples Common Stock issuable to such
Penseco Shareholders.

(iv) Each share of Peoples Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not
be affected by the Merger.

(v) Each outstanding share of Peoples or Penseco Common Stock the holder of
which has perfected his right to dissent under the BCL, if applicable, and has
not effectively withdrawn or lost such right as of the Effective Time shall
not be converted into or represent a right to receive, or shall remain,
shares of Peoples Common Stock hereunder, respectively, and the holder thereof
shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the BCL. Each share of
Peoples Common Stock issued and held in the treasury of Peoples immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall on and after the Effective Time, continue to
be issued and held in the treasury of Peoples. The parties shall give each
other prompt notice upon receipt of any such written demands for payment of
the fair value of such shares of Peoples or Penseco Common Stock, respectively
("Dissenting Shares") and of withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments provided pursuant to the BCL (any shareholder duly making
such demand being hereinafter called a "Dissenting Shareholder"). If any
Dissenting Shareholder shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) his right to such payment at any time, such holders
shares of Penseco Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive
Peoples Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.02(g)(i) of this Agreement
or such holders shares of Peoples Common Stock shall remain shares of Peoples
Common Stock. Any payments made in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be made
by Peoples, as the continuing corporation after the Merger.

shall designate a mutually acceptable bank or trust company or other agent
which shall act as agent (the "Exchange Agent") for Peoples and the Surviving
Corporation in connection with the exchange procedures for converting shares
of Penseco Common Stock evidenced by stock certificates into the Merger
Consideration. Upon such selection, Peoples shall enter into an agreement with
the Exchange Agent in form and substance reasonable acceptable to the
parties hereto setting forth the terms and conditions upon which the Exchange
Agent will render the exchange services to Peoples and the Surviving
Corporation (the "Exchange Agent Agreement").

 

(ii) _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Peoples shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange
Agent (i) certificates representing the number of shares of Peoples Common
Stock sufficient to deliver, and Peoples shall instruct the Exchange Agent to
timely deliver, the aggregate Stock Consideration issuable to the holders of
Penseco Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii)
to the extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 1.02(g)(iii) (the "Additional Consideration,"
and collectively with the Stock Consideration, the "Exchange Fund") and
Peoples shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay the Additional
Consideration in accordance with this Agreement.

 

(iii) _Letter of Transmittal_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
stock certificate, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Penseco Common Stock, whose shares were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.02(g), a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the stock certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of stock certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of
such certificates) to the Exchange Agent and shall be substantially in such
form and have such other provisions as shall be prescribed by the Exchange
Agent Agreement) (the "Letter of Transmittal") and (ii) instructions for use
in surrendering stock certificate(s) in exchange for the Merger Consideration
to be issued and paid in consideration therefor and any dividends or
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section
1.02(h)(v)_.

 

(iv) _Surrender of Stock Certificates_. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent
of its stock certificate(s), accompanied by a properly completed Letter of
Transmittal, a holder of Penseco Common Stock will be entitled to receive
promptly after the Effective Time the Merger Consideration (with the Cash
Consideration, if any, paid to each such holder rounded to the nearest
whole cent). Until so surrendered, each such stock certificate shall
represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration to be issued and paid in consideration
therefor upon surrender of such stock certificate in accordance with, and any
dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to, this
_Section 1.02(h)(iv)_.

 



12 (v) _Dividends_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Peoples
Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered stock
certificate with respect to the shares of Peoples Common Stock represented
thereby, in each case until the surrender of such stock certificate in
accordance with  _Section 1.02(h)(iv)_. Subject to the effect of applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following surrender of any such
stock certificate in accordance with _Section 1.02(h)(iv)_, the record holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest, (i) the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore payable with respect to the whole shares of Peoples Common Stock
represented by such stock certificate and not paid and/or (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
payable with respect to shares of Peoples Common Stock represented by such
stock certificate with a record date after the Effective Time (but before
such surrender date) and with a payment date subsequent to the issuance of the
Peoples Common Stock issuable with respect to such stock certificate.

(vi) _Transfer of Penseco Common Stock_. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of a stock certificate representing Penseco Common Stock that is not
registered in the stock transfer records of Penseco, the proper amount of
Merger Consideration shall be paid or issued in exchange therefor to a person
other than the person in whose name the stock certificate so surrendered is
registered if the stock certificate formerly representing such Penseco Common
Stock shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer
and the person requesting such payment or issuance shall pay any transfer or
other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance to a
person other than the registered holder of the stock certificate or establish
to the satisfaction of Peoples that the Tax has been paid or is not
applicable.

(vii) _No Transfers After the Effective Time_. After the Effective Time, there
shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Penseco of the shares of
Penseco Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of Penseco Common Stock that
occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, stock
certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the
Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance
with the procedures set forth in this _Section 1.02(h)_.

 

(viii) _Treatment of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the shareholders of Penseco as of the first anniversary
of the Effective Time may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be paid
to Peoples. In such event, any former shareholders of Penseco who have not
theretofore complied with this _Section 1.02(h)_ shall thereafter look only
to Peoples with respect to the Merger Consideration and any unpaid dividends
and distributions on the Peoples Common Stock deliverable in respect of each
share of Penseco Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant
to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of Peoples, Peoples Bank, Penseco, Penn Security, the
Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of
shares of Penseco Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws.

 



13 (ix) _Lost Stock Certificates_. In the event any stock certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the person claiming such stock certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if reasonably required by Peoples or the Exchange Agent, the posting by
such person of a bond in such amount as Peoples may determine is reasonably
necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such stock certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed stock certificate the Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

(i) _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. If, between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Peoples Common Stock shall have
been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or
kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock
split, or other similar change in capitalization, an appropriate and
proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio.

 

(j) _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the IRC, and that
this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning
of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g).

a Material Adverse Effect on the system of internal accounting controls
described in this Section 2.05(d). Penseco (i) has implemented and maintains
a system of internal control over financial reporting that is designed to
provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of its financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP as consistently applied to Penseco, (ii) to the extent
required by applicable law, has implemented and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures to ensure that material information relating to Penseco,

within those entities, and (iii) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Pensecos outside auditors and the

deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect Pensecos ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Pensecos
internal control over financial reporting. These disclosures (if any) were
made in writing by management to Pensecos auditors and audit committee and a
copy has previously been made available to Peoples. 

(e) Since December 31, 2011, (i) neither Penseco nor any of the Penseco
Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of Penseco, any director, officer,
employee, auditor, accountant or representative of Penseco or any of the
Penseco Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained Knowledge of
any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or
oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of Penseco or any of the Penseco Subsidiaries or
their respective internal accounting controls, including any 

 



18  material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Penseco or any of
the Penseco Subsidiaries has engaged in illegal accounting or auditing
practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Penseco or any of the Penseco
Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Penseco or any of the Penseco
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of Securities
Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Penseco or any of its
officers, directors, employees or agents to the board of directors of Penseco
or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of Penseco.

liens on any of the assets of Penseco with respect to Taxes other than for
Taxes not yet due and payable.

all material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid and has
complied with all information reporting and backup withholding requirements
in all material respects.

filed by Penseco or the Penseco Subsidiaries for taxable periods ended on or
after December 31, 2007 that have been or are currently the subject of audit.
Except as set forth on _Section 2.06 of the Penseco Disclosure Schedule_,

Material Adverse Effect since December 31, 2012.

effect as of the date of this Agreement with any past or present officer,
director or employee of Penseco or any Penseco Subsidiary or any other Person,
except for "at will" arrangements; (ii) any plan, arrangement or contract
providing for bonuses, pensions, options, deferred compensation, retirement
payments, profit sharing, benefits, or similar arrangements for or with any

Subsidiary or any other Person; (iii) any collective bargaining agreement
with any labor union relating to employees of Penseco or any Penseco
Subsidiary; (iv) any agreement which by its terms limits the payment of
dividends by any Penseco Subsidiary; (v) any instrument evidencing or related
to indebtedness for borrowed money whether directly or indirectly, by way of
purchase money obligation, conditional sale, lease purchase, guaranty or
otherwise, in respect of which Penseco or any Penseco Subsidiary is an
obligor to any person,

 



20  which instrument evidences or relates to indebtedness other than deposits,
repurchase agreements, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, bankers acceptances
and "treasury tax and loan" accounts established in the ordinary course of
business and transactions in "federal funds" or which contains financial
covenants or other restrictions (other than those relating to the payment of
principal and interest when due) which would be applicable on or after the
Closing Date to Peoples; or (vi) any contract (other than this Agreement)
limiting the freedom of any Penseco Subsidiary to engage in any type of
banking or bank-related business permissible under law. 

(b) True and correct copies of agreements, plans, arrangements and instruments
referred to in Section 2.08(a) have been made available to Peoples on or
before the date hereof, are listed on _Section 2.08 of the Penseco Disclosure
Schedule_ and are in full force and effect on the date hereof and neither
Penseco nor any Penseco Subsidiary (nor, to the Knowledge of Penseco,
any other party to any such contract, plan, arrangement or instrument) has
breached any provision of, or is in default in any respect under any term of,
any such contract, plan, arrangement or instrument which breach or default has
resulted in or is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect
with respect to Penseco. No party to any material contract, plan, arrangement
or instrument will have the right to terminate any or all of the provisions of
any such contract, plan, arrangement or instrument as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. None of the employees (including
officers) of Penseco or any Penseco Subsidiary possess the right to terminate
their employment as a result of the execution of this Agreement. Except as
set forth in _Section 2.08 of the Penseco Disclosure Schedule_, no plan,
employment agreement, termination agreement, or similar agreement or
arrangement to which Penseco or any Penseco Subsidiary is a party or under
which Penseco or any Penseco Subsidiary may be liable contains provisions
which permit an employee or independent contractor to terminate it and
continue to accrue future benefits thereunder. Except as set forth in _Section
2.08 of the Penseco Disclosure Schedule_, no such agreement, plan or
arrangement (i) provides for acceleration in the vesting of benefits or
payments due thereunder upon the occurrence of a change in ownership or
control of Penseco or any Penseco Subsidiary; (ii) provides for benefits
which may cause the disallowance of a federal income tax deduction under IRC
Section 280G; or (iii) requires Penseco or any Penseco Subsidiary to provide a
benefit in the form of Penseco Common Stock or determined by reference to the
value of Penseco Common Stock.

_Section 2.09 Ownership of Property; Insurance Coverage_. 

(a) Penseco and each of the Penseco Subsidiaries has, or will have as to
property acquired after the date hereof, good and, as to real property,
marketable title to all assets and properties owned by Penseco or any Penseco
Subsidiary in the conduct of their businesses, whether such assets and
properties are real or personal, tangible or intangible, including assets and
property reflected in the balance sheets contained in the Penseco Regulatory
Reports and in the Penseco Financials or acquired subsequent thereto (except
to the extent that such assets and properties have been disposed of for fair
value, in the ordinary course of business, since the date of such balance
sheets), subject to no encumbrances, liens, mortgages, security interests or
pledges, except (i) those items which secure repurchase agreements and
liabilities for borrowed money from a Federal Home Loan Bank, (ii) inter-bank
credit facilities, or any transaction by a Penseco Subsidiary acting in a
fiduciary capacity, (iii) those reflected in the notes to the Penseco

 



21  Financials, (iv) statutory liens for amounts not yet delinquent or which are
being contested in good faith, and (v) the items disclosed in _Section 2.09
of the Penseco Disclosure Schedule_ (collectively the "Penseco Permitted
Encumbrances"). Penseco and the Penseco Subsidiaries, as lessee, have the
right under valid and subsisting leases of real and personal properties used
by Penseco and its Subsidiaries in the conduct of their businesses to occupy
or use all such properties as presently occupied and used by each of them.
Except as disclosed in _Section 2.09 of the Penseco Disclosure Schedule_,
such existing leases and commitments to lease constitute or will constitute
operating leases for both tax and financial accounting purposes and the lease
expense and minimum rental commitments with respect to such leases and lease
commitments are as disclosed in the notes to the Penseco Financials.

(b) With respect to all agreements pursuant to which Penseco or any Penseco
Subsidiary has purchased securities subject to an agreement to resell, if
any, Penseco or such Penseco Subsidiary, as the case may be, has a valid,
perfected first lien or security interest in the securities or other
collateral securing the repurchase agreement, and the value of such
collateral equals or exceeds the amount of the debt secured thereby.

(c) Penseco and the Penseco Subsidiaries currently maintain insurance
considered by Penseco to be reasonable for their respective operations and
similar in scope and coverage to that maintained by other businesses similarly
engaged. Neither Penseco nor any Penseco Subsidiary has received notice from
any insurance carrier that (i) such insurance will be cancelled or that
coverage thereunder will be reduced or eliminated, or (ii) premium costs with
respect to such policies of insurance will be substantially increased. There
are presently no material claims pending under such policies of insurance and
no notices have been given by Penseco or Penn Security under such policies.
All such insurance is valid and enforceable and in full force and effect, and
within the last ten (10) years Penseco has received each type of insurance
coverage for which it has applied and during such periods has not been denied
indemnification for any material claims submitted under any of its insurance
policies.

 

 _Section 2.10 Legal Proceedings_. Except as set forth in _Section 2.10 of
the Penseco Disclosure Schedule_, neither Penseco nor any Penseco Subsidiary
is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Penseco,
threatened legal, administrative, arbitration or other proceedings, claims
(whether asserted or unasserted), actions or governmental investigations
or inquiries of any nature (i) against Penseco or any Penseco Subsidiary,
(ii) to which Penseco or any Penseco Subsidiarys assets are or may be
subject, (iii) challenging the validity or propriety of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iv) which could adversely
affect the ability of Penseco to perform under this Agreement in any material
respect.

(a) Except as set forth on  _Section 2.11 of the Penseco Disclosure_
Schedule, each of Penseco and each Penseco Subsidiary is, and since January 1,
2010 has been, in compliance in all material respects with all, and is not in
default in any material respect under any, applicable federal, state, local
and foreign statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances, rules, judgments, orders
or decrees applicable to it, its properties, assets and deposits, its
business, and its conduct of business and its relationship with its customers

Secrecy Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the
Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and all
other applicable fair lending laws and other laws relating to discriminatory
business practices and neither Penseco nor any Penseco Subsidiary has
received any written notice to the contrary since January 1, 2010.

(b) Penseco and each of its Subsidiaries holds all licenses, franchises,
permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of their
businesses under, and have complied in all material respects with, applicable
laws, statutes, orders, rules or regulations of any federal, state or
local governmental authority relating to them, other than where such failure
to hold or such noncompliance will neither result in a limitation in any
material respect on the conduct of its businesses or otherwise have a Material
Adverse Effect on Penseco. 

(c) Except as set forth on _Section 2.11 of the Penseco Disclosure Schedule_,
neither Penseco nor any Penseco Subsidiary has received any notification or
communication from any Governmental Entity: (i) asserting that Penseco or any
Penseco Subsidiary is not in compliance with any of the statutes, regulations
or ordinances which such Governmental Entity enforces; (ii) threatening to
revoke any license, franchise, permit or governmental authorization which is
material to Penseco or any Penseco Subsidiary; (iii) requiring or threatening
to require Penseco or any Penseco Subsidiary, or indicating that Penseco or
any Penseco Subsidiary may be required, to enter into a cease and desist
order, agreement or memorandum of understanding or any other agreement
restricting or limiting, or purporting to restrict or limit, in any manner the
operations of Penseco or any Penseco Subsidiary, including without limitation
any restriction on the payment of dividends; or (iv) directing, restricting or
limiting, or purporting to direct, restrict or limit, in any manner the
operations of Penseco or any Penseco Subsidiary, including without limitation
any restriction on the payment of dividends (any such notice, communication,
memorandum, agreement or order described in this sentence is hereinafter
referred to as a "Regulatory Agreement"). Neither Penseco nor any Penseco
Subsidiary has consented to or entered into any Regulatory Agreement, except
as heretofore disclosed in the Penseco Financials or in _Section 2.11 of the
Penseco Disclosure Schedule_. 

_Section 2.12 Employee Benefit Plans_.

(a) Penseco has previously made available to Peoples true and complete copies
of all employee pension benefit plans which Penseco or Penn Security or any of
their ERISA Affiliates currently maintains within the meaning of ERISA
Section 3(3), including profit sharing plans; stock purchase plans; stock
ownership plans; stock option plans; phantom stock plans; deferred
compensation; supplemental income plans; supplemental executive
retirement plans; termination agreements; employment agreements; annual, long
term or other incentive plans; severance plans; policies and agreements; group
insurance plans; vacation pay; sick leave; life insurance; retiree life
insurance plans; short-term disability; long-term disability, and medical
plans or arrangements; and all other benefit plans, policies, agreements and
arrangements, all of which are set forth in _Section 2.12 of the Penseco
Disclosure Schedule_, maintained or contributed to for the benefit of the
employees, former employees (including retired employees), former directors of
Penseco or any Penseco Subsidiary and any beneficiaries thereof or other
person, or with 

 



23  respect to which Penseco, Penn Security or any of their ERISA Affiliates has
or may have any obligation or liability, whether actual or contingent (the
"Penseco Benefit Plans"), together with (i) the most recent actuarial (if
any) and financial reports relating to those plans which constitute "qualified
plans" under IRC Section 401(a), (ii) the most recent annual reports relating
to such plans filed by them, respectively, with any government agency, (iii)
all rulings and determination letters which pertain to any such plans, (iv)
all contracts currently in force with third party administrators, actuaries,
investment managers and other service providers to such plans, and (v) the
non-discrimination testing results for the three (3) most recent plan years.
Neither Penseco, any Penseco Subsidiary nor any pension plan maintained by
Penseco or any Penseco Subsidiary, has incurred, directly or indirectly,
within the past six (6) years any liability under Title IV of ERISA (including
to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation) or to the IRS with respect to any
pension plan qualified under IRC Section 401(a) which liability has resulted
in or is reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to Penseco, except liabilities to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation pursuant to ERISA Section 4007, all of which have been fully
paid, nor has any reportable event under ERISA Section 4043 occurred with
respect to any such pension plan. Except as set forth in _Section 2.12 of the
Penseco Disclosure Schedule_, with respect to each of such plans that
is subject to Title IV of ERISA, the fair market value of the assets under
such plan exceeds the present value of the accrued benefits liability as of
the end of the most recent plan year with respect to such plan calculated on
the basis of the actuarial assumptions used in the most recent actuarial
valuation for such plan. Neither Penseco nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has
incurred or is subject to any liability under ERISA Section 4201 for a
complete or partial withdrawal from a multiemployer plan. All Penseco Benefit
Plans that are "employee benefit plans," as defined in ERISA Section 3(3),
comply and within the past six (6) years have complied in all material
respects with (i) relevant provisions of ERISA and (ii) in the case of plans
intended to qualify for favorable income tax treatment, provisions of the IRC.
To the Knowledge of Penseco, no prohibited transaction (which shall mean any
transaction prohibited by ERISA Section 406 and not exempt under ERISA
Section 408 or any transaction prohibited under IRC Section 4975) has occurred
within the past six (6) years with respect to any employee benefit plan
maintained by Penseco or any of its ERISA Affiliates which would result in
the imposition, directly or indirectly, of an excise tax under IRC Section
4975 or other penalty under ERISA or the IRC, which, individually or in the
aggregate, has resulted in or is reasonably expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect with respect to Penseco. Penseco and the Penseco Subsidiaries
provide continuation coverage under group health plans for separating
employees and "qualified beneficiaries" of covered employees (as defined in
IRC Section 4980B(g)) in accordance with the provisions of IRC Section
4980B(f). There are no current or pending or, to the Knowledge of Penseco,
threatened audits or investigations by any governmental entity involving any
Penseco Benefit Plan, and there are no current or pending or, to the
Knowledge of Penseco, threatened claims (except for individual claims for
benefits payable in the ordinary course of operation of the Penseco Benefit
Plans), suits or proceedings involving any Penseco Benefit Plan and, to the
Knowledge of Penseco, no set of circumstances exists which may reasonably be
expected to give rise to any such audits, investigations, claims, suits or
proceedings.

 

(b) Penseco has not contributed to any "multiemployer plan" as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA.

 



24 (c) All contributions required to be made under the terms of any Penseco
Benefit Plan have been timely made and all anticipated contributions and
binding obligations are accrued monthly on Pensecos consolidated financial
statements to the extent required and in accordance with GAAP. Penseco has
expensed and accrued as a liability the present value of future benefits in
accordance with applicable laws and GAAP. Neither any pension plan nor any
single-employer plan of Penseco nor an ERISA Affiliate has an "accumulated
funding deficiency," whether or not waived, within the meaning of Section 412
of the IRC or Section 302 of ERISA and neither Penseco nor an ERISA Affiliate
has an outstanding funding waiver. There is not currently pending with the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation any filing with respect to
any reportable event under Section 4043 of ERISA nor has any reportable event
occurred as to which a filing is required and has not been made (other than as
might be required with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby) with respect to any plan subject to Title IV of ERISA
and to which Penseco or any of its ERISA Affiliates has any liability. Penseco
has not provided nor is required to provide security to any plan maintained by
Penseco or any of its ERISA Affiliates to which the requirements of Section
412 of the IRC apply pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the IRC.

(d) Except as set forth in _Section 2.12 of the Penseco Disclosure
Schedule_, none of the execution of this Agreement, shareholder approval of
this Agreement or consummation of the Transaction will, except as set forth in
_Section 2.12 of the Penseco Disclosure Schedule_, (i) entitle any employee,
consultant or director of Penseco to severance pay or any increase in
severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date hereof, (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or funding,
through a grantor trust or otherwise, of compensation or benefits under,
increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant
to, any of the Penseco Benefit Plans, (iii) result in any breach or violation
of, or a default under, any of the Penseco Benefit Plans or (iv) result in any
payment that would be a "parachute payment" to a "disqualified individual" as
those terms are defined in Section 280G of the IRC, without regard to whether
such payment is reasonable compensation for personal services performed or to
be performed in the future.

 

(e) All required reports and descriptions, including but not limited to Form
5500 annual reports and required attachments, Forms 1099-R, summary
annual reports, Forms PBGC-1 and summary plan descriptions, have been filed
or distributed appropriately with respect to each Penseco Benefit Plan. All
required tax filings with respect to each Penseco Benefit Plan have been made,
and any taxes due in connection with such filings have been paid.

(f) Penseco does not maintain any Penseco Benefit Plan or other compensation
program or arrangement under which payment is reasonably likely to become
non-deductible, in whole or in part, for tax reporting purposes as a result of
the limitations under Section 162(m) of the IRC and the regulations issued
thereunder.

 

(g) Each Penseco Benefit Plan that constitutes a "non-qualified deferred
compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A of the IRC complies in
both form and operation with the requirements of Section 409A of the IRC.

 



25 _2.13 Labor Matters_. Penseco is not a party to nor is bound by any collective
bargaining agreement, contract or other agreement or understanding with a
labor union or labor organization, nor is Penseco the subject of a proceeding
asserting that it has committed an unfair labor practice within the meaning of
the National Labor Relations Act or seeking to compel Penseco to bargain with
any labor organization as to wages or conditions of employment, nor is there
any strike or other labor dispute involving it, pending or, to the Knowledge
of Penseco, threatened, nor is Penseco aware of any activity involving its
employees seeking to certify a collective bargaining unit or engaging in other
organizational activity.

 

 _Section 2.14 Brokers, Finders and Financial Advisors_. Except for Pensecos
engagement of Cedar Hill Advisors, LLC and Griffin Financial Group, LLC in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, neither
Penseco nor any Penseco Subsidiary, nor any of their respective officers,
directors, employees or agents, has employed any broker, finder or financial
advisor in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
or, except for its commitments disclosed in _Section 2.14 of the Penseco
Disclosure Schedule_, incurred any liability or commitment for any fees or
commissions to any such person in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, which has not been reflected in the Penseco
Financials. _Section 2.14 of the Penseco Disclosure Schedule_ shall contain
as exhibits the engagement letters between Penseco and each of Cedar Hill
Advisors, LLC and Griffin Financial Group, LLC.

_Section 2.15 Environmental Matters_. To the Knowledge of Penseco, neither
Penseco nor any Penseco Subsidiary, nor any properties owned or occupied by
Penseco or any Penseco Subsidiary is or has been in violation of or liable
under any Environmental Law which violation or liability, individually or in
the aggregate, resulted in, or will result, in a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to Penseco.

_Section 2.16 Allowance for Loan Losses_. The allowances for loan losses
reflected, and to be reflected, in the Penseco Regulatory Reports, and shown,
and to be shown, on the balance sheets contained in the Penseco Financials
have been, and will be, adequate as of the respective dates, in accordance
with the requirements of GAAP and all applicable regulatory criteria.

_Section 2.17 Related Party Transactions_. Except as disclosed in _Section
2.17 of the Penseco Disclosure Schedule_, Penseco is not a party to any
transaction (including any loan or other credit accommodation but excluding
deposits in the ordinary course of business) with any Affiliate of Penseco
(except any Penseco Subsidiary); and all such transactions (a) were made in
the ordinary course of business, (b) were made on substantially the same
terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the
time for comparable transactions with other Persons, and (c) did not involve
more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable
features. Except as set forth in _Section 2.17 of the Penseco Disclosure
Schedule_, no loan or credit accommodation to any Affiliate of Penseco is
presently in default or, during the three (3) year period prior to the date of
this Agreement, has been in default or has been restructured, modified
or extended. Neither Penseco nor Penn Security has been notified that
principal and interest with respect to any such loan or other credit
accommodation will not be paid when due or that the loan grade classification
accorded such loan or credit accommodation by Penn Security is inappropriate.

 



26 _Section 2.18 Loans_.

(a) Each loan reflected as an asset in the Penseco Financial Statements (i) is
evidenced by notes, agreements or other evidences of indebtedness which are
true, genuine and correct (ii) to the extent secured, has been secured by
valid liens and security interests which have been perfected, and (iii) is the
legal, valid and binding obligation of the obligor named therein, enforceable
in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights and to general equity principles, in each case other than
loans as to which the failure to satisfy the foregoing standards would not
have a Material Adverse Effect on Penseco.

(b) _Section 2.18 of the Penseco Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth a listing,
as of March 31, 2013, by account, of: (i) all loans (including loan
participations) of Penn Security or any other Penseco Subsidiary that have
been accelerated during the past twelve months; (ii) all loan commitments or
lines of credit of Penn Security or any other Penseco Subsidiary which have

condition of the borrower or other events or circumstances affecting the
credit of the borrower; (iii) each borrower, customer or other party which has
notified Penn Security or any other Penseco Subsidiary during the past twelve
months of, or has asserted against Penn Security or any other Penseco
Subsidiary, in each case in writing, any "lender liability" or similar claim,
and, to the Knowledge of Penn Security, each borrower, customer or other party
which has given Penn Security or any other Penseco Subsidiary any oral
notification of, or orally asserted to or against Penn Security or any other
Penseco Subsidiary, any such claim; (iv) all loans (A) that are contractually
past due 90 days or more in the payment of principal and/or interest, (B)

and unpaid interest on each such loan and the identity of the obligor
thereunder, (D) where, during the past three (3) years, the interest rate
terms have been reduced and/or the maturity dates have been extended
subsequent to the agreement under which the loan was originally created due
to concerns regarding the borrowers ability to pay in accordance with such
initial terms, or (E) where a specific reserve allocation exists in connection

pensions, options, deferred compensation, retirement payments, profit sharing
or similar arrangements for or with any past or present officers, directors
or employees of Peoples or any Peoples Subsidiary; (iii) any collective
bargaining agreement with any labor union relating to employees of Peoples or
any Peoples Subsidiary; (iv) any agreement which by its terms limits the
payment of dividends by any Peoples Subsidiary; (v) any instrument evidencing
or related to indebtedness for borrowed money whether directly or indirectly,
by way of purchase money obligation, conditional sale, lease purchase,
guaranty or otherwise, in respect of which Peoples or any Peoples Subsidiary
is an obligor to any person, which instrument evidences or relates to
indebtedness other than deposits, repurchase agreements, Federal Home Loan
Bank advances, bankers acceptances and "treasury tax and loan" accounts
established in the ordinary course of business and transactions in "federal
funds" or which contains financial covenants or other restrictions (other than
those relating to the payment of principal and interest when due) which would
be applicable on or after the Closing Date to Penseco or any Penseco
Subsidiary; or (vi) any contract (other than this Agreement) limiting the
freedom of any Peoples Subsidiary to engage in any type of banking or bank-
related business permissible under law.

(b) True and correct copies of agreements, plans, arrangements and instruments
referred to in Section 3.08(a) have been made available to Penseco on or
before the date hereof, are listed on _Section 3.08 of the Peoples Disclosure
Schedule_ and are in full force and effect on the date hereof and neither
Peoples nor any Peoples Subsidiary (nor, to the Knowledge of Peoples, any

 



37  other party to any such contract, plan, arrangement or instrument) has
breached any provision of, or is in default in any respect under any term of,
any such contract, plan, arrangement or instrument which breach or default
has resulted in is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect
with respect to Peoples. Except as set forth in _Section 3.08 of the Peoples
Disclosure Schedule_, no party to any material contract, plan, arrangement or
instrument will have the right to terminate any or all of the provisions of
any such contract, plan, arrangement or instrument as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as set forth in  _Section
3.08 of the Peoples Disclosure Schedule_, none of the employees (including
officers) of Peoples or any Peoples Subsidiary possess the right to terminate
their employment as a result of the execution of this Agreement. Except
as set forth in _Section 3.08 of the Peoples Disclosure Schedule_, no plan,
employment agreement, termination agreement, or similar agreement or
arrangement to which Peoples or any Peoples Subsidiary is a party or under
which Peoples or any Peoples Subsidiary may be liable contains provisions
which permit an employee or independent contractor to terminate it and
continue to accrue future benefits thereunder. Except as set forth in _Section
3.08 of the Peoples Disclosure Schedule_, no such agreement, plan or
arrangement (i) provides for acceleration in the vesting of benefits or
payments due thereunder upon the occurrence of a change in ownership or
control of Peoples or any Peoples Subsidiary absent the occurrence of a
subsequent event; (ii) provides for benefits which may cause the disallowance
of a federal income tax deduction under IRC Section 280G; or (iii) requires
Peoples or any Peoples Subsidiary to provide a benefit in the form of Peoples
Common Stock or determined by reference to the value of Peoples Common Stock.

_Section 3.09 Ownership of Property; Insurance Coverage_.

(a) Peoples and each of the Peoples Subsidiaries has, or will have as to
property acquired after the date hereof, good and, as to real property,
marketable title to all assets and properties owned by Peoples or any Peoples
Subsidiary in the conduct of their businesses, whether such assets and
properties are real or personal, tangible or intangible, including assets and
property reflected in the balance sheets contained in the Peoples Regulatory
Reports and in the Peoples Financials or acquired subsequent thereto (except
to the extent that such assets and properties have been disposed of for fair
value, in the ordinary course of business, since the date of such balance
sheets), subject to no encumbrances, liens, mortgages, security interests or
pledges, except (i) those items which secure repurchase agreements and
liabilities for borrowed money from a Federal Home Loan Bank, (ii) interbank
credit facilities or any transaction by a Peoples Subsidiary acting in a
fiduciary capacity, (iii) those reflected in the notes to the Peoples
Financial, (iv) statutory liens for amounts not yet delinquent or which are
being contested in good faith, and (v) the items disclosed in _Section 3.09
of the Peoples Disclosure Schedule_ (collectively the "Peoples Permitted
Encumbrances"). Peoples and the Peoples Subsidiaries, as lessee, have the
right under valid and subsisting leases of real and personal properties used
by Peoples and its Subsidiaries in the conduct of their businesses to occupy
or use all such properties as presently occupied and used by each of them.
Except as disclosed in _Section 3.09 of the Peoples Disclosure Schedule_,
such existing leases and commitments to lease constitute or will constitute
operating leases for both tax and financial accounting purposes and the lease
expense and minimum rental commitments with respect to such leases and lease
commitments are as disclosed in the notes to the Peoples Financials.

 



38 (b) With respect to all agreements pursuant to which Peoples or any Peoples
Subsidiary has purchased securities subject to an agreement to resell, if
any, Peoples or such Peoples Subsidiary, as the case may be, has a valid,
perfected first lien or security interest in the securities or other
collateral securing the repurchase agreement, and the value of such
collateral equals or exceeds the amount of the debt secured thereby.

(c) Peoples and the Peoples Subsidiaries currently maintain insurance
considered by Peoples to be reasonable for their respective operations and
similar in scope and coverage to that maintained by other businesses similarly
engaged. Neither Peoples nor any Peoples Subsidiary has received notice
from any insurance carrier that (i) such insurance will be cancelled or that
coverage thereunder will be reduced or eliminated, or (ii) premium costs with
respect to such policies of insurance will be substantially increased. Except
as set forth on _Section 3.09 of the Peoples Disclosure Schedule_, there are
presently no material claims pending under such policies of insurance and no
notices have been given by Peoples or Peoples Bank under such policies. All
such insurance is valid and enforceable and in full force and effect, and
within the last ten (10) years Peoples has received each type of insurance
coverage for which it has applied and during such periods has not been denied
indemnification for any material claims submitted under any of its insurance
policies.

_Section 3.10 Legal Proceedings_. Except as set forth in _Section 3.10 of
the Peoples Disclosure Schedule_, neither Peoples nor any Peoples Subsidiary
is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Peoples,
threatened legal, administrative, arbitration or other proceedings, claims,
actions or governmental investigations or inquiries of any nature (i) against
Peoples or any Peoples Subsidiary, (ii) to which Peoples or any Peoples
Subsidiarys assets are or may be subject, (iii) challenging the validity
or propriety of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or
(iv) which could adversely affect the ability of Peoples to perform under this
Agreement in any material respect.

_Section 3.11 Compliance With Applicable Law_.

(a) Each of Peoples and each Peoples Subsidiary is, and since January 1, 2010
has been, in compliance in all material respects with all, and is not in
default in any material respect under any, applicable federal, state, local
and foreign statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances, rules, judgments, orders
or decrees applicable to it, its properties, assets and deposits, its
business, and its conduct of business and its relationship with its customers
and employees, including, without limitation, the Uniting and
Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept
and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the "USA Patriot Act"), the Bank Secrecy
Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Community
Reinvestment Act of 1977, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and all other
applicable fair lending laws and other laws relating to discriminatory
business practices and neither Peoples nor any Peoples Subsidiary has received
any written notice to the contrary since January 1, 2010.

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 3.11 of the Peoples Disclosure Schedule_,
Peoples and each of the Peoples Subsidiaries holds all licenses, franchises,
permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of their
businesses under, and have complied in all material respects with, applicable
laws, statutes, orders, rules or regulations of any federal, state or local
governmental

 



39  authority relating to them, other than where such failure to hold or such
noncompliance will neither result in a limitation in any material respect on
the conduct of their businesses nor otherwise have a Material Adverse Effect
on Peoples.

(c) Except as disclosed on _Section 3.11 of the Peoples Disclosure
Schedule_, neither Peoples nor any Peoples Subsidiary has received any
notification or communication from any Governmental Entity (i) asserting that
Peoples or any Peoples Subsidiary is not in compliance with any of the
statutes, regulations or ordinances which such Governmental Entity enforces;
(ii) threatening to revoke any license, franchise, permit or governmental
authorization which is material to Peoples or any Peoples Subsidiary; (iii)
requiring or threatening to require Peoples or any Peoples Subsidiary, or
indicating that Peoples or any Peoples Subsidiary may be required, to enter
into a cease and desist order, agreement or memorandum of understanding or any
other agreement restricting or limiting, or purporting to restrict or limit,
in any manner the operations of Peoples or any Peoples Subsidiary, including
without limitation any restriction on the payment of dividends; or (iv)
directing, restricting or limiting, or purporting to direct, restrict or
limit, in any manner the operations of Peoples or any Peoples Subsidiary,
including without limitation any restriction on the payment of dividends (any
such notice, communication, memorandum, agreement or order described in this
sentence is hereinafter referred to as a "Regulatory Agreement"). Neither
Peoples nor any Peoples Subsidiary has consented to or entered into any
Regulatory Agreement, except as disclosed on _Section 3.11 of the Peoples
Disclosure Schedule_.

 

 _Section 3.12 Employee Benefit Plans_.

(a) Peoples has previously made available to Penseco true and complete copies
of all employee pension benefit plans which Peoples, Peoples Bank or any of
their ERISA Affiliates currently maintains within the meaning of ERISA
Section 3(3), including profit sharing plans; stock purchase plans; stock
ownership plans; stock option plans; phantom stock plans; deferred
compensation; supplemental income plans; supplemental executive retirement
plans; termination agreements; employment agreements; annual, long-term or
other incentive plans, severance plans, policies and agreements; group
insurance plans; vacation pay; sick leave; life insurance; retiree life
insurance plans; short-term disability; long-term disability; and medical
plans or arrangements, and all other benefit plans, policies, agreements and
arrangements, all of which are set forth on _Section 3.12 of the Peoples
Disclosure Schedule_, maintained or contributed to for the benefit of the
employees, former employees (including retired employees), former directors of
Peoples or any Peoples Subsidiary and any beneficiaries thereof, or other
person, or with respect to which Peoples, Peoples Bank or any of their ERISA
Affiliates has or m ay have any obligation or liability, whether actual or
contingent (the "Peoples Benefit Plans"), together with (i) the most recent
actuarial (if any) and financial reports relating to those plans which
constitute "qualified plans" under IRC Section 401(a), (ii) the most recent
annual reports relating to such plans filed by them, respectively, with any
government agency, (iii) all rulings and determination letters which pertain
to any such plans, (iv) all contracts currently in force with third party
administrators, actuaries, investment managers and other service providers to
such plans, and (v) the non-discrimination testing results for the three (3)
most recent plan years. Neither Peoples, any Peoples Subsidiary, nor any
pension plan maintained by Peoples or any Peoples Subsidiary, has incurred,
directly or indirectly, within the past six (6) years any liability under
Title IV of ERISA (including to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation) or
to the IRS with respect to any

 



40  pension plan qualified under IRC Section 401(a) which liability has resulted
in or is reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to Peoples, except liabilities to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation pursuant to ERISA Section 4007, all of which have been fully paid,
nor has any reportable event under ERISA Section 4043 occurred with respect to
any such pension plan. With respect to each of such plans that is subject to
Title IV of ERISA, the fair market value of the assets under such plan exceeds
the present value of the accrued benefits liability as of the end of the most
recent plan year with respect to such plan calculated on the basis of the
actuarial assumptions used in the most recent actuarial valuation for such
plan. Neither Peoples nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has incurred or is
subject to any liability under ERISA Section 4201 for a complete or
partial withdrawal from a multiemployer plan. All Peoples Benefit Plans that
are "employee benefit plans," as defined in ERISA Section 3(3), comply and
within the past six (6) years have complied in all material respects with (i)
relevant provisions of ERISA, and (ii) in the case of plans intended to
qualify for favorable income tax treatment, provisions of the IRC. To the
Knowledge of Peoples, no prohibited transaction (which shall mean any
transaction prohibited by ERISA Section 406 and not exempt under ERISA
Section 408 or any transaction prohibited under IRC Section 4975) has occurred
within the past six (6) years with respect to any employee benefit plan
maintained by Peoples or any of its ERISA Affiliates which would result in
the imposition, directly or indirectly, of an excise tax under IRC Section
4975 or other penalty under ERISA or the IRC, which individually or in the
aggregate, has resulted in or is reasonably expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect with respect to Peoples. Peoples and the Peoples Subsidiaries
comply with the continuation coverage rules applicable to its group health
plan(s) for covered employees and "qualified beneficiaries" of covered
employees (as defined in IRC Section 4980B(g)), in accordance with the
provisions of IRC Section 4980B(f). There are no current or pending or, to the
Knowledge of Peoples, threatened audits or investigations by any governmental
entity involving any Peoples Benefit Plan, and there are no current or pending
or, to the Knowledge of Peoples, threatened claims (except for individual
claims for benefits payable in the ordinary course of operation of
the Peoples Benefit Plans), suits or proceedings involving any Peoples
Benefit Plan and, to the Knowledge of Peoples, no set of circumstances exists
which may reasonably be expected to give rise to any such audits,
investigations, claims, suits or proceedings.

(b) Peoples has not contributed to any "multiemployer plan" as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA.

 

(c) All contributions required to be made under the terms of any Peoples
Benefit Plan have been timely made and all anticipated contributions and
binding obligations are accrued monthly on Peoples consolidated financial
statements to the extent required and in accordance with GAAP. Peoples has
expensed and accrued as a liability the present value of future benefits in
accordance with applicable laws and GAAP. Neither any pension plan nor any
single-employer plan of Peoples nor an ERISA Affiliate has an "accumulated
funding deficiency," whether or not waived, within the meaning of Section 412
of the IRC or Section 302 of ERISA and neither Peoples nor an ERISA Affiliate
has an outstanding funding waiver. There is not currently pending with the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation any filing with respect to any reportable
event under Section 4043 of ERISA nor has any reportable event occurred as to
which a filing is required and has not been made (other than as might be
required with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby) with respect to any plan subject to Title IV of ERISA 

 



41  and to which Peoples or any of its ERISA Affiliates has any liability.
Except as set forth in _Section 3.12 of the Peoples Disclosure Schedule_,
Peoples has not provided nor is required to provide security to any plan
maintained by Peoples or any of its ERISA Affiliates to which the requirements
of Section 4.12 of the IRC applies pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the IRC.

 

(d) Except as set forth in _Section 3.12 of the Peoples Disclosure Schedule_,
none of the execution of this Agreement, shareholder approval of this
Agreement or consummation of the Transaction will, except as set forth in
_Section 3.12 of the Peoples Disclosure Schedule_, (i) entitle any employee,
consultant or director of Peoples to severance pay or any increase
in severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date hereof,
(ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or
funding, through a grantor trust or otherwise, of compensation or benefits
under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation
pursuant to, any of the Peoples Benefit Plans, (iii) result in any breach or
violation of, or a default under, any of the Peoples Benefit Plans or (iv)
result in any payment that would be a "parachute payment" to a "disqualified
individual" as those terms are defined in Section 280G of the IRC, without
regard to whether such payment is reasonable compensation for personal
services performed or to be performed in the future.

(e) All required reports and descriptions, including but not limited to Form
5500 annual reports and required attachments, Forms 1099-R, summary annual
reports, Forms PBGC-1 and summary plan descriptions, have been filed or
distributed appropriately with respect to each Peoples Benefit Plan. All
required tax filings with respect to each Peoples Benefit Plan have been
made, and any taxes due in connection with such filings have been paid.

(f) Peoples does not maintain any Peoples Benefit Plan or other compensation
program or arrangement under which payment is reasonably likely to become non-
deductible, in whole or in part, for tax reporting purposes as a result of the
limitations under Section 162(m) of the IRC and the regulations issued
thereunder.

(g) Each Peoples Benefit Plan that constitutes a "non-qualified deferred
compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A of the IRC and complies
in both form and operation with the requirements of Section 409A of the IRC.

_3.13 Labor Matters_. Peoples is not a party to nor is bound by any
collective bargaining agreement, contract or other agreement or understanding
with a labor union or labor organization, nor is Peoples the subject of a
proceeding asserting that it has committed an unfair labor practice within
the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act or seeking to compel Peoples
to bargain with any labor organization as to wages or conditions of
employment, nor is there any strike or other labor dispute involving it,
pending or, to the Knowledge of Peoples, threatened, nor is Peoples aware of
any activity involving its employees seeking to certify a collective
bargaining unit or engaging in other organizational activity.

 

 _Section 3.14 Brokers, Finders and Financial Advisors_. Except for Peoples
engagement of Boenning and Scattergood, Inc. in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, neither Peoples nor any Peoples
Subsidiary, nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees or
agents, has employed any broker, finder or financial advisor in 

 



42  connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or, except
for its commitments disclosed in _Section 3.14 of the Peoples Disclosure
Schedule_, incurred any liability or commitment for any fees or commissions
to any such person in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, which has not been reflected in the Peoples Financials. _Section
3.14 of the Peoples Disclosure Schedule_ shall contain as an exhibit the
engagement letter between Peoples and Boenning and Scattergood, Inc.

_Section 3.15 Environmental Matters_. To the Knowledge of Peoples, neither
Peoples nor any Peoples Subsidiary, nor any properties owned or occupied by
Peoples or any Peoples Subsidiary is or has been in violation of or liable
under any Environmental Law which violation or liability, individually or in
the aggregate, resulted in, or will result, in a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to Peoples.

 

 _Section 3.16 Allowance for Loan Losses_. The allowances for loan losses
reflected, and to be reflected, in the Peoples Regulatory Reports, and shown,
and to be shown, on the balance sheets contained in the Peoples Financials
have been, and will be adequate as of the respective dates, in accordance with
the requirements of GAAP and all applicable regulatory criteria.

 

 _Section 3.17 Related Party Transactions_. Except as disclosed in _Section
3.17 of the Peoples Disclosure Schedule_, Peoples is not a party to any
transaction (including any loan or other credit accommodation but excluding
deposits in the ordinary course of business) with any Affiliate of Peoples
(except a Peoples Subsidiary); and all such transactions (a) were made in
the ordinary course of business, (b) were made on substantially the same
terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the
time for comparable transactions with other Persons, and (c) did not involve
more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable
features. Except as set forth on _Section 3.17 of the Peoples Disclosure
Schedule_, no loan or credit accommodation to any Affiliate of Peoples is
presently in default or, during the three (3) year period prior to the date
of this Agreement, has been in default or has been restructured, modified or
extended. Neither Peoples nor Peoples Bank has been notified that principal
and interest with respect to any such loan or other credit accommodation will
not be paid when due or that the loan grade classification accorded such loan
or credit accommodation by Peoples Bank is inappropriate.

_Section 3.18 Loans_.

(a) Each loan reflected as an asset in the Peoples Financial Statements (i)
is evidenced by notes, agreements or other evidences of indebtedness which are
true, genuine and correct (ii) to the extent secured, has been secured by
valid liens and security interests which have been perfected, and (iii) is
the legal, valid and binding obligation of the obligor named therein,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance and other laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles, in each case
other than loans as to which the failure to satisfy the foregoing standards
would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Peoples.

participations) of Peoples Bank or any other

customer or other party which has notified Peoples Bank or any other Peoples
Subsidiary during the past twelve months of, or has asserted against Peoples
Bank or any other Peoples Subsidiary, in each case in writing, any "lender
liability" or similar claim, and, to the Knowledge of Peoples Bank, each
borrower, customer or other party which has given Peoples Bank or any other
Peoples Subsidiary any oral notification of, or orally asserted to or

all loans (A) that are contractually past due 90 days or more in the payment

and the identity of the obligor thereunder, (D) where, during the past three

originally created due to concerns regarding the borrowers ability to pay in
accordance with such initial terms, or (E) where a specific reserve
allocation exists in connection therewith; and (v) all assets classified by
Peoples Bank or any Peoples Subsidiary as real estate acquired through

(c) Except as set forth on _Section 3.18 of the Peoples Disclosure

entered on the books of Peoples and the Peoples Subsidiaries arose out of bona
fide arms-length transactions, were made for good and valuable consideration
in the ordinary course of Peoples or the appropriate Peoples Subsidiarys
respective business, and the notes or other evidences of indebtedness with
respect to such loans (including discounts) are true and genuine and are what
they purport to be. The loans, discounts and the accrued interest reflected on

set-offs or counterclaims (including, without limitation, those afforded by
usury or truth-in-lending laws), except as may be provided by bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar laws affecting creditors rights generally or by general
principles of equity. All such loans are owned by Peoples or the
appropriate Peoples Subsidiary free and clear of any all liens, security
interests, pledges, charges, encumbrances, agreements and restrictions of any

shall Penseco or Peoples be required to take any action, or commit to take
any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with

Governmental Entities, that would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Penseco, Peoples or the Surviving Corporation (any of which,

(f) Penseco and Peoples will use their reasonable best efforts to ensure that
the information relating to Penseco and Peoples that is provided by Penseco

including, without limitation, (i) obtaining the consent or approval of each
individual, partnership, corporation, association or other business or
professional entity whose consent or approval is required or desirable

agreements in connection therewith without the prior written consent of the
other party, and (ii) requesting the delivery of appropriate opinions,
consents and letters from its counsel and independent auditors. No party
hereto shall take, or cause, or to the best of its ability permit to be

 _Section 4.05 Indemnification; Insurance_.

(a) _Indemnification_. In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative,
in which any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of
this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or
officer or employee of either party or any of their respective Subsidiaries
(the "Indemnified Parties") is, or is threatened to be, made a party to a
suit based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or
pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer or
employee of either party, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of
their respective predecessors or (ii) this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising
before or after the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and

Corporation shall use its best efforts to) defend against and respond thereto
to the extent permitted by the BCL and the articles of incorporation and
bylaws of such party. On or after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless all prior and then-
existing directors, officers, and employees of Peoples, Penseco, Peoples
Subsidiaries

 



52  and Penseco Subsidiaries, against (i) all losses, claims, damages, costs,
expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement
(with the prior approval of Peoples) of or in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on or
arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a
director, officer or employee of Peoples or Penseco or any
Peoples Subsidiaries or Penseco Subsidiaries, whether pertaining to any
matter existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and whether
asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time ("Indemnified
Liabilities") and (ii) all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part
on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, to the same extent as such officer,
director or employee may be indemnified by Peoples or Peoples Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, as of the date hereof including the right to advancement
of expenses, provided, however, that any such officer, director or employee
may not be indemnified by Peoples if such indemnification is prohibited by
applicable law, including but not limited to 12 C.F.R. Part 359, which limits
and/or prohibits in certain circumstances, the ability of insured depository
institutions, their subsidiaries, and affiliated depository institution
holding companies, to enter into contracts to pay and make golden parachute
and indemnification payments to institution-affiliated parties.

(b) _Insurance_. The Surviving Corporation shall maintain a directors and
officers liability insurance policy providing coverage amounts not less than
the coverage amounts provided under the Penseco directors and officers
liability insurance policy and on terms generally no less favorable. Such
policy shall cover persons who are currently covered by the Penseco insurance
policies for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time; provided,
however, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to make annual
premium payments for such six (6) year period which exceed 200% of the annual
premium payment as of December 31, 2012, under Pensecos current policy in
effect as of the date of this Agreement (the "Maximum Amount"). If the amount
of the premiums necessary to procure such insurance coverage exceeds the
Maximum Amount, the Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable best
efforts to maintain the most advantageous policies of directors and officers
liability insurance obtainable for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount.

(c) _Assumption_. In the event that at or after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation or any of its respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger

Person, then, and in each such case the successors and assigns of such entity
shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 4.05.

_Section 4.06 No Other Bids and Related Matters_. So long as this Agreement
remains in effect, Penseco and Peoples shall not and shall not authorize or
permit any of its directors, officers, employees or agents, to directly or

the making of any proposal which relates to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
recommend or endorse an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) participate in any

of such party) with any nonpublic information in connection with any inquiry
or proposal relating to an Acquisition Proposal or (v) enter into an 

 



53  agreement with any other party with respect to an Acquisition Proposal.
Penseco and Peoples will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing activities, discussions or negotiations previously conducted with
any parties other than Penseco and Peoples hereto with respect to any of the
foregoing, and will take all actions necessary or advisable to inform the
appropriate individuals or entities referred to in this sentence of
the obligations undertaken in this Section 4.06. Penseco and Peoples will
notify each other orally (within one day) and in writing (as promptly as
practicable) if any inquiries or proposals relating to an Acquisition Proposal
are received or any such negotiations or discussions are sought to be
initiated or continued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the board of directors
of Penseco or Peoples may respond to, in a manner it deems appropriate,
recommend or endorse, participate in any discussions, provide any third party
with nonpublic information, or enter into an agreement regarding, unsolicited
inquiries relating to an Acquisition Proposal, in each case, if the respective
board of directors shall have determined, in good faith after consultation
with its legal and financial advisors, that the failure to do so may
constitute a breach of their fiduciary duties. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prevent Penseco and Peoples, and their respective Boards of
Directors, from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange
Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; provided, that such Rules will in
no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules
would otherwise have under this Agreement.

_Section 4.07 Duty to Advise; Duty to Update Disclosure Schedule_. Each of
Penseco and Peoples shall promptly advise the other party of any change or
event having or reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or
which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a

forth herein. Penseco and Peoples shall update its Disclosure Schedule as
promptly as practicable after the occurrence of any event or fact which, if
such event or fact had occurred prior to the date of this Agreement, would
have been disclosed in such Disclosure Schedule. The delivery of such updated
Disclosure Schedule shall not relieve either party from liability for any
breach or violation of this Agreement and shall not have any effect for the
purposes of determining the satisfaction of the condition set forth in
Sections 5.01(c) or 5.02(c).

_Section 4.08 Current Information_.

transactions contemplated hereby and in the case of Peoples the amendment and
restatement of the articles of incorporation to increase the number of
authorized shares of Peoples Common Stock and not withdraw, modify or change

provided, however, that the board of directors of Penseco or Peoples may
withdraw, modify or qualify such recommendation if it shall have determined,
in good faith after consultation with its legal and financial advisers, that
the failure to do so may constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties and, in
such event, may communicate the basis for its withdrawn, modified or qualified
recommendation to its shareholders in the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or an
appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law.

 



55 (b) Each of Penseco and Peoples may postpone or adjourn its respective
shareholders meeting to the extent it reasonably believe is necessary to

as set forth below, to any full-time, active employee of Peoples or any

its employees generally, provided that any coverage period required under IRC

Section 4.18.

62 (b) By Peoples or Penseco:

(i) if the Closing Date shall not have occurred on or before March 31, 2014,
unless the failure of such occurrence shall be due to the failure of the party
seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe in any material
respect its agreements set forth in this Agreement required to be performed or

the imposition of terms and conditions which would not permit satisfaction of
the conditions set forth at Section 5.01 or 5.02 hereof, unless the failure of

this Agreement to perform or observe in any material respect its agreements
set forth herein required to be performed or observed by such party on or
before the Closing Date;

 

(c) by Penseco in writing if Peoples has, or by Peoples in writing if Penseco
has, in any material respect, breached (i) any material covenant

written notice of such breach is given to the party committing such breach or
the Effective Time unless on such date such breach no longer causes a

other 

 



63  provision of this Agreement) and only if (i) during such ten (10) business
day period, the terminating party has caused its financial and legal advisors
to negotiate with the non-terminating party in good faith (to the extent the
other party chooses to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement such that the terminating party no longer
believes it has to terminate this Agreement in order to comply with its
fiduciary duties, and (ii) the terminating party has considered such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement resulting from such
negotiations and has concluded in good faith, based upon consultation with
its financial and legal advisers, that it must enter into the Acquisition
Proposal even after giving effect to the adjustments proposed by the non-
terminating party and further provided that such termination shall not be
effective until the terminating party has paid the Termination Fee to the
non-terminating party;

PENSECO LETTER AGREEMENT

June 28, 2013

 

Peoples Financial Services Corp.

82 Franklin Avenue

PO Box A

Hallstead, PA 18822 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Peoples Financial Services Corp. ("Peoples") and Penseco Financial Services
Corporation ("Penseco") are entering into concurrently herewith an Agreement
and Plan of Merger to be dated as of June 28, 2013 (the "Agreement").

Pursuant to the proposed Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions
set forth therein: (a) Penseco will merge with and into Peoples, with Peoples
surviving the merger (the "Merger"); and (b) shareholders of Penseco will
receive shares of Peoples common stock in exchange for their shares of
Penseco common stock owned on the closing date, plus cash in lieu of
fractional share interests.

I understand that Peoples is requiring, as a condition to its execution and
delivery to Penseco of the Agreement, that I execute and deliver to Peoples
this Letter Agreement.

Intending to be legally bound hereby, I irrevocably agree and represent as
follows:

 

1\. I agree to be present (in person or by proxy) at all meetings of
shareholders of Penseco called to vote for approval of the Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, so that all shares of Penseco common stock
over which I have or exercise sole or shared voting power, including those
held in a voting trust, individually or, to the extent of my proportionate
interest, jointly with other persons, but excluding any shares for which I
act as a fiduciary, other than those which are held in individual retirement
accounts for my own benefit (collectively, my "Covered Shares") will be
counted for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum at such
meetings.

2\. I agree to vote, or cause to be voted, (a) for approval and adoption of
the Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, and (b) against any
action that is intended, or could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere
with, delay, postpone, or adversely affect the transaction contemplated
in the Agreement, all Covered Shares over which I exercise sole voting power,
and I will use my reasonable efforts to cause all Covered Shares over which I
share voting power, including those held in a voting trust jointly with other
persons, to be voted for in the same manner. 3\. I hereby revoke any and all previous proxies granted with respect to the
Covered Shares and grant to the proxy holder designated by Peoples a proxy to
vote the Covered Shares as indicated in paragraph 1 above, which proxy will be
irrevocable and coupled with an interest, and I agree to take such further
actions and execute such other instruments as may be necessary to effectuate
the intent of this proxy, provided that this proxy will expire automatically
and without further action upon termination of this Letter Agreement.

 

4\. Through the earlier of (a) the receipt of the requisite approval of the
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby by the shareholders of
Penseco, and (b) termination of the Agreement in accordance with its terms, I
agree not to offer, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any Covered Shares;
_provided, however_ , that I may make a _bona fide_ gift of shares or
transfer of shares for estate planning or similar purposes prior to that date
as long as the recipient agrees to vote such shares for approval and adoption
of the Agreement and agrees, in writing, to be bound by all the terms hereof
as if an original signatory hereto.

5\. I hereby represent that I own of record or beneficially, good and valid
title to the Covered Shares free and clear of any and all mortgages, liens,
encumbrances, charges, claims, restrictions, pledges, security interests,
voting trusts or agreements, or impositions, except as expressly disclosed
herein.

 

6\. Peoples recognizes that, with respect to any Covered Shares which have
been pledged to a third party (as specifically identified below), I may not
be able to control the voting or disposition of such shares if contrary to the
terms of such pledge, and that any act or failure to act on my part which is
required by such pledge shall not be deemed a violation hereof.

 

7\. For three (3) years after the Effective Time (as defined in the
Agreement), provided I am a member of the Peoples board of directors, I agree
to vote or cause to be voted my Covered Shares for the nominees whom the board
of directors of Peoples recommends for election to the board of directors of
Peoples.

 

8\. I represent that I have the capacity to enter into this Letter Agreement
and that it is a valid and binding obligation enforceable against me in
accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency and other laws
affecting creditors rights and general equitable principles.

9\. Irreparable damage would occur in the event any of the provisions of this
Letter Agreement are not performed in accordance with the terms hereof, and
therefore Peoples shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms
hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity to which it may be
entitled.

The agreements contained in this Letter Agreement shall apply to me solely in
my capacity as a shareholder of Penseco, and no agreement contained in this
Letter Agreement shall

 



2  apply to me in my capacity as a director, officer or employee of Penseco or
in any other fiduciary capacity, other than as a fiduciary of a trust of which
I am a beneficiary. In addition, nothing contained in this Letter Agreement
shall be deemed to apply to, or limit in any manner, my obligations to comply
with my fiduciary duties as an officer or director, as applicable, of Penseco.

 

This Letter Agreement shall be effective upon acceptance by Peoples. Nothing
herein shall be deemed to vest in Peoples any direct or indirect ownership or
incidence of ownership of or with respect to any shares of common stock of
Penseco.

Except for paragraph 7, which shall survive for three (3) years after the
Effective Time (as defined in the Agreement), this Letter Agreement shall
terminate concurrently with, and be of no further force and effect
concurrently with, and automatically upon the earlier to occur of (a) the
consummation of the Merger, and (b) any termination of the Agreement in
accordance with its terms, except that any such termination shall be without
prejudice to Peoples rights arising out of any willful breach of any
covenant or representation contained herein.

6\. Penseco recognizes that, with respect to any Covered Shares which have

therefore Penseco shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms
hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity to which it may be
entitled.

The agreements contained in this Letter Agreement shall apply to me solely in
my capacity as a shareholder of Peoples, and no agreement contained in this

days prior to the date of any meeting of shareholders, or the date fixed for
the payment of any dividend or distribution, or the date for the allotment of

shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, any such meeting, or
entitled to receive payment of any such dividend or distribution, or to
receive any such allotment of rights, or to exercise the rights in respect to
any such change, conversion or exchange of shares. In such case, only
such shareholders as shall be shareholders of record on the date so fixed
shall be entitled to notice of, or to vote at, such meeting or to receive
payment of such dividend or to receive such allotment of rights or to exercise
such rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares
on the books of the Bank after any record date fixed as aforesaid. The Board
of Directors may close the books of the Bank against transfers of shares
during the whole or any part of such period, and in such case written or
printed notice thereof shall be mailed at least ten (10) days before closing
thereof to each shareholder of record at the address appearing on the records
of the Bank or supplied by him to the Bank for the purpose of notice. While
the stock transfer books of the Bank are closed, no transfer of shares shall
be made thereon. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors for the
determination of shareholders entitled to receive notice of, and vote at,

appointed, the Chairman of any such meeting may, and on the request of any
shareholder or his proxy shall, make such appointment at the meeting. The
number of judges shall be one (1) or three (3). If appointed at a meeting on
the request of one (1) or more shareholders or proxies, the majority of shares
present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall determine whether one
(1) or three (3) judges are to be appointed. No person who is a candidate for
office shall act as a judge. The judges of election shall do all such acts as
may be proper to conduct the election or vote, and such other duties as may be
prescribed by statute, with fairness to all shareholders, and if requested by
the Chairman of the meeting, or any shareholder or his proxy, shall make a
written report of any matter determined by them and execute a certificate of
any fact found by them. If there are three (3) judges of election,

having been excused by the Board.

 



B-6  Section 10.6 All Directors, upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of
73 years, shall be permitted to serve as a director for the remainder of

only, and not Peoples Financial Services Corp.

B-11  Article 23

INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES

Section 23.1 The Bank shall indemnify any officer and/or employee, or any
former officer and/or employee, who was or is a party to, or is threatened to
be made a party to, or who is called to be a witness in connection with, any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the
right of the Bank) by reason of the fact that such person is or was an officer
and/or employee of the Bank, or is or was serving at the request of the Bank
as a director, officer, employee or agent of a corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys
fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding
if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or
not opposed to, the best interests of the Bank, and, with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct
was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment,
order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its
equivalent, shall not of itself create a presumption that the person did not
act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in, or
not opposed to, the best interests of the Bank, and, with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe that his
conduct was unlawful.

Section 23.2 The Bank shall indemnify any officer and/or employee, who was or
is a party to, or is threatened to be made a party to, or who is called as a
witness in connection with, any threatened, pending or completed action or
suit by or in the right of the Bank to procure a judgment in its favor by
reason of the fact that such person is or was at the request of the Bank a
director, officer, and/or employee or agent of a corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against amounts paid in settlement
and expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by
him in connection with the defense or settlement of, or serving as a witness
in, such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he
reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the
Bank and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any such
claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be
liable for misconduct in the performance of his duty to the Bank.

 

Section 23.3 Except as may be otherwise ordered by a court, there shall be a
presumption that any officer and/or employee is entitled to indemnification
as provided in Sections 23.1 and 23.2 of this Article unless either a majority
of the directors who are not involved in such proceedings ("disinterested
directors") or, if there are less than three (3) disinterested directors,
then the holders of one-third of the outstanding shares of the Bank determine
that the person is not entitled to such presumption by certifying such

 



B-12   determination in writing to the Secretary of the Bank. In such event the
disinterested director(s) or, in the event of certification by shareholders,
the Secretary of the Bank shall request of independent counsel, who may be
the outside general counsel of the Bank, a written opinion as to whether or
not the parties involved are entitled to indemnification under Sections 23.1
and 23.2 of this Article.

 

Section 23.4 Expenses incurred by an officer and/or employee in defending a
civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the Bank in
advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding as
authorized in the manner provided under Section 23.3 of this Article upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the officer and/or employee
to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not
entitled to be indemnified by the Bank.

 

Section 23.5 The indemnification provided by this Article shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which a person seeking indemnification may
be entitled under any agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested
directors, or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity while
serving as an officer and/or employee and as to action in another
capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has
ceased to be an officer and/or employee and shall inure to the benefit of the
heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

Article 24

 

INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS

Section 24.1 A director of this Bank shall stand in a fiduciary relation to
the Bank and shall perform his duties as a director, including his duties as a
member of any committee of the Board of Directors upon which he may serve, in
good faith, in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of
the Bank, and with such care, including reasonable inquiry, skill and
diligence, as a person of ordinary prudence would 

 



B-13   use under similar circumstances. In performing his duties, a director shall
be entitled to rely in good faith on information, opinions, reports or
statements, including financial statements and other financial data, in each
case prepared or presented by any of the following:

(a) One (1) or more officers or employees of the Bank whom the director
reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented.

(b) Counsel, public accountants or other persons as to matters which the
director reasonably believes to be within the professional or expert
competence of such person.

 

(c) A committee of the Board of Directors upon which he does not serve, duly
designated in accordance with law, as to matters within its designated
authority, which committee the director reasonably believes to merit
confidence.

A director shall not be considered to be acting in good faith if he has
knowledge concerning the matter in question that would cause his reliance to
be unwarranted.

Section 24.2 In discharging the duties of their respective positions, the
Board of Directors, committees of the Board of Directors, and individual
directors may, in considering the best interests of the Bank, consider the
effects of any action upon employees, upon suppliers and customers of the
Bank, and upon communities in which offices or other establishments of the
Bank are located, and all other pertinent factors. The consideration of those
factors shall not constitute a violation of Section 24.1.

Section 24.3 Absent a breach of fiduciary duty, lack of good faith or self-
dealing, actions taken as a director or any failure to take any action shall
be presumed to be in the best interests of the Bank.

 

Section 24.4 A director of this Bank shall not be personally liable for
monetary damages as such for any action taken or for any failure to take any
action, unless:

(a) the director has breached or failed to perform the duties of his office
under the provisions of Sections 24.1 and 24.2, and

(b) the breach or failure to perform constitutes self-dealing, willful
misconduct or recklessness.

Section 24.5 The provisions of Section 24.4 shall not apply to:

(a) the responsibility or liability of a director pursuant to a criminal
statute, or

 

(b) the liability of a director for the payment of taxes pursuant to local,
state or federal law.

 



B-14  Section 24.6 The Bank shall indemnify any director, or any former director,
who was or is a party to, or is threatened to be made a party to, or who is
called to be a witness in connection with, any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Bank) by
reason of the fact that such person is or was a director of the Bank, or is or
was serving at the request of the Bank as a director, officer, employee or
agent of a corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in
connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and
in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best
interests of the Bank, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding,
had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination
of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction
or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not of itself
create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner
which he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests
of the Bank, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no
reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

 

Section 24.7 The Bank shall indemnify any director, who was or is a party to,
or is threatened to be made a party to, or who is called as a witness in
connection with, any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in
the right of the Bank to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact
that such person is or was at the request of the Bank a director, officer
and/or employee or agent of a corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust
or other enterprise, against amounts paid in settlement and expenses
(including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in
connection with the defense or settlement of, or serving as a witness in,
such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably
believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Bank and
except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any such claim,
issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable
for misconduct in the performance of his duty to the Bank.

Section 24.8 Except as may be otherwise ordered by a court, there shall be a
presumption that any director is entitled to indemnification as provided in
Sections 24.6 and 24.7 of this Article unless either a majority of the
directors who are not involved in such proceedings ("disinterested directors")
or, if there are less than three (3) disinterested directors, then the holders
of one-third of the outstanding shares of the Bank determine that the person
is not entitled to such presumption by certifying such determination in
writing to the Secretary of the Bank. In such event the disinterested
director(s) or, in the event of certification by shareholders, the Secretary
of the Bank shall request of independent counsel, who may be the outside
general counsel of the Bank, a written opinion as to whether or not the
parties involved are entitled to indemnification under Sections 24.6 and 24.7
of this Article. 

Section 24.9 Expenses incurred by a director in defending a civil or criminal
action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the Bank in advance of the final
disposition of such action, suit or proceeding as authorized in the manner
provided under Section 24.8 of this Article upon receipt of an undertaking by
or on behalf of the director to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be
determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Bank as authorized
in this Article.

 



B-15  Section 24.10 The indemnification provided by this Article shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which a person seeking
indemnification may be entitled under any agreement, vote of shareholders or
disinterested directors, or otherwise, both as to action in his official
capacity while serving as a director and as to action in another capacity
while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to
be a director and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of such a person.

 

Section 24.11 The Bank may create a fund of any nature, which may, but need
not be, under the control of a trustee, or otherwise secure or insure in any
manner its indemnification obligations arising under this Article.

 

Section 24.12 The Bank shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance
on behalf of any person who is or was a director, or is or was serving at the
request of the Bank as a director, officer, employee or agent of a
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against
any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity,
or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Bank would have the
power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this
Article.

Section 24.13 Indemnification under this Article shall not be made in any case
where the act or failure to act giving rise to the claim for indemnification
is determined by a court to have constituted willful misconduct or
recklessness.

Article 25

 

SHARE CERTIFICATES

Section 25.1 The share certificates of the Bank shall be numbered and

registered holder, the number and class of shares represented thereby, the
par value of each share or a statement that such shares are without par value,
as the case may be; shall include a statement that the institution is
incorporated under the laws of this Commonwealth; shall be signed by the
President or a Vice President and the Secretary or the Treasurer, or any other
person properly authorized by the Board of Directors; and, shall bear the
corporate seal, which seal may be a facsimile engraved or printed. Where the
certificate is signed by a transfer agent or a registrar, the signature of
any authorized officer on such certificate may be a facsimile engraved or
printed. In case any officer who has signed, or whose facsimile signature has
been placed upon, any share certificate shall have ceased to be such officer
because of death, resignation or otherwise before the certificate is issued,
it may be issued by the Bank with the same effect as if the officer had not
ceased to be such at the date of its issue. 

 



B-16  Article 26

TRANSFER OF SHARES

Section 26.1 Upon surrender to the Bank of a share certificate duly endorsed
by the person named in the certificate or by attorney duly appointed in
writing and accompanied where necessary by proper evidence of succession,
assignment or authority to transfer, a new certificate shall be issued to the
person entitled thereto and the old certificate canceled and the transfer
recorded upon the share register of the Bank. No transfer shall be made if it
would be inconsistent with the provisions of Article 8 of the Pennsylvania
Uniform Commercial Code.

Article 27

LOST CERTIFICATES

Section 27.1 Where a shareholder of the Bank alleges the loss, theft or
destruction of one (1) or more certificates for shares of the Bank and
requests the issuance of a substitute certificate therefor, the Secretary or
the Treasurer may direct a new certificate of the same tenor and for the same
number of shares to be issued to such person upon such persons making of an
affidavit in form satisfactory to the Secretary or the Treasurer setting forth
the facts in connection therewith, provided that prior to the receipt of such
request the Bank shall not have either registered a transfer of such
certificate or received notice that such certificate has been acquired by a
bona fide purchaser. When authorizing such issue of a new certificate, the
Secretary or the Treasurer may, in his discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, or his heirs or legal representatives, as the case may
be, to advertise the same in such manner as it shall require and/or give the
Bank a bond in such form and with surety or sureties, with fixed or open
penalty, as shall be satisfactory to the Secretary or the Treasurer, as
indemnity for any liability or expense which it may incur by reason of the
original certificate remaining outstanding.

Article 28

not be in violation of law or the Articles of Incorporation.

 



B-17  Section 28.2 Before payment of any dividend, there may be set aside out of
any funds of the Bank available for dividends such sum or sums as the Board
of Directors from time to time, in their absolute discretion, think proper as
a reserve fund to meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or for
repairing or maintaining any property of the Bank, or for such other purposes
as the Board of Directors shall believe to be for the best interests of the
Bank, and the Board of Directors may reduce or abolish any such reserve in the
manner in which it was created.

the Board of Directors, at any regular or special meeting thereof duly

United States, a nuclear disaster or another catastrophe as a result of which

additional or substitute directors.

alternative head offices or regional offices of the Bank or authorize the
officers to do so.

adopted, the Bylaws of the Bank shall remain in effect during any emergency
and, upon its termination, the emergency Bylaws shall cease to be effective.

of such severity as to prevent the normal conduct and management of the
affairs of this Bank by its directors and officers as contemplated by these
Bylaws, any three (3) available directors shall constitute the Executive

a duly elected Board of Directors can again assume full responsibility and

ARTICLE 3

QUORUM OF SHAREHOLDERS

Section 3.1. The presence, in person or by proxy, of shareholders entitled to
cast at least a majority of the votes which all shareholders are entitled to
cast on the particular matter shall constitute a quorum for purposes of
considering such matter, and unless otherwise provided by statute the acts of
such shareholders at a duly organized meeting shall be the acts of the
shareholders. If, however, any meeting of shareholders cannot be organized
because of lack of a quorum, those present, in person or by proxy, shall have
the power, except as otherwise provided by statute, to adjourn the meeting to
such time and place as they may determine, without notice other than an
announcement at the meeting, until the requisite number of shareholders for a
quorum shall be present, in person or by proxy, except that in the case of any
meeting called for the election of directors such meeting may be adjourned
only for periods not exceeding fifteen (15) days as the holders, present in
person or by proxy, of shares entitled to cast at least a majority of the
votes which all shareholders are entitled to cast, shall direct, and those
who attend the second of such adjourned meetings, although less than a quorum,
shall nevertheless constitute a quorum for the purpose of electing directors.
At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or so
represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted
at the original meeting if a quorum had been present. The shareholders
present, in person or by proxy, at a duly organized meeting can continue to
do business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough
shareholders to leave less than a quorum.

authorized attorney-in-fact and filed with the Secretary of the Corporation.
A proxy, unless coupled with an interest, shall be revocable at will,
notwithstanding any other agreement or any provision in the proxy to the
contrary, but the revocation of a proxy shall not be effective until notice
thereof has been given to the Secretary of the Corporation. No unrevoked proxy
shall be valid after eleven (11) months from the date of its execution, unless
a longer time is expressly provided therein, but in no event shall a proxy,
unless coupled with an interest, be voted after three (3) years from the date
of its execution. A proxy shall not be revoked by the death or incapacity of

DIRECTORS

 

Section 10.1. Any shareholder who intends to nominate or to cause to have
nominated any candidate for election to the Board of Directors (other than

shall so notify the Secretary of the Corporation in accordance with Section
2.6(b). Such notification, in addition to complying with the requirements of
Section 2.6(b), shall contain the following information to the extent known by

(g) the number of shares of the Corporation owned by the notifying
shareholder.

Any nomination for director not made in accordance with this section shall be
disregarded by the chairman of the meeting, and votes cast for each such
nominee shall be disregarded by the judges of election. In the event that the
same person is nominated by more than one shareholder, if at least one

honored and all votes cast for such nominee shall be counted. 

Section 10.2. The number of directors that shall constitute the whole Board of
Directors shall be not less than five (5) nor more than twenty-five (25). The

successive years. Each class shall be elected in a separate election. At each
annual meeting of shareholders thereafter, successors to the class of
directors whose term shall then expire shall be elected to hold office for a

(a) At the consummation of the merger (the "Effective Time") of Penseco
Financial Services Corporation ("Penseco") with and into the Corporation (the

approval of at least 80% of the board of  directors of the Corporation, director nominees shall be selected, or
recommended for the board of directors selection, by a nominating committee
comprised solely of independent directors (the "Nominating Committee"), and
more particularly as follows. With respect to any directorship held by an
incumbent Continuing Peoples Director whose term is expiring at any such
meeting, a subcommittee of the Nominations Committee comprised solely of
Continuing Peoples Directors shall select, or recommend for the boards
selection, a director nominee who, except for executive officers, is an
independent director as provided in the NASDAQ Stock Market Marketplace
Rules and who meets the requirements for a director under the Corporations
bylaws for election or reelection to such directorship. A "Continuing Peoples
Director" shall mean any member of the board of directors of the Corporation
who was a director of Peoples immediately prior to the Effective Time, or any
other member of the board of directors of the Corporation who was nominated in
accordance with the preceding sentence. With respect to any directorship held
by an incumbent Continuing Penseco Director whose term is expiring at any
such meeting, a subcommittee of the Nominations Committee comprised solely of
Continuing Penseco Directors shall select, or recommend for the boards
selection, a director nominee who, except for executive officers, is an
independent director as provided in the NASDAQ Stock Market Marketplace Rules
and who meets the requirements for a director under the Corporations bylaws
above for election or reelection to such directorship. A "Continuing Penseco
Director" shall mean any member of the board of directors of the Surviving
Corporation who was a director of Penseco immediately prior to the Effective
Time, or any other member of the board of directors of the Corporation who
was nominated in accordance with the preceding sentence.

formerly of Peoples and Penseco shall have prorata representation on all
committees based upon the representative number of directors of each party on
the board of directors as of the Effective Time, unless the Board of
Directors of the Corporation shall determine otherwise upon the approval of
80% of the directors of the entire Board of Directors.

Section 10.5 The Board of Directors may declare vacant the office of a
director if he or she is declared of unsound mind by an order of court or
convicted of a felony or for any other proper cause or if, within thirty (30)
days after notice of election, he or she does not accept such office either in
writing or by attending a meeting of the Board of Directors.

Section 10.6 All Directors, upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 73
years, shall be permitted to serve as a director for the remainder of their
term after which they shall no longer be eligible to serve as a director.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each director appointed to the Corporations
Board of Directors in connection with the Merger and Section 10.3 hereof shall
be eligible to stand for election to one additional three (3) year term,
regardless of their age, unless the Board of Directors of the Corporation
shall determine otherwise upon the approval of 80% of the directors of the
entire Board of Directors. ARTICLE 11

Section 23.1 The Corporation shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted
by Pennsylvania law and federal law, any director, officer and/or employee, or
any former director, officer and/or employee, who was or is a party to, or is
threatened to be made a party to, or who is called to be a witness in
connection with, any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other
than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the
fact that such person is or was a director, officer and /or employee of the
Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another Corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including
attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding
if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or
not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to
any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his
conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by
judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or
its equivalent, shall not of itself create a presumption that the person did
not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in,
or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect
to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his
conduct was unlawful.

Section 23.2 The Corporation shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted
by Pennsylvania law and federal law, any director, officer and/or employee,
who was or is a party   to, or is threatened by to be made a party to, or who is called as a witness
in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or
in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason
of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer and/or employee or
agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture , trust or other
enterprise against amounts paid in settlement and expenses (including
attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with
the defense or settlement of, or serving as a witness in, such action or suit
if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or
not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation and except that no
indemnification shall be made in respect of any such claim, issue or matter as
to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable for misconduct in
the performance of his duty to the Corporation.

Section 23.3 Except as may be otherwise ordered by a court, there shall be
a presumption that any director, officer and/or employee is entitled to
indemnification as provided in Sections 23.1 and 23.2 of this Article unless
either a majority of the directors who are not involved in such proceedings
("disinterested directors") or, if there are less than three (3)
disinterested directors, then the holders of one-third of the outstanding
shares of the Corporation determine that the person is not entitled to such
presumption by certifying such determination in writing to the Secretary of
the Corporation. In such event the disinterested director(s) or, in the event
of certification by shareholders, the Secretary of the Corporation shall
request of independent counsel, who may be the outside general counsel of the
Corporation, a written opinion as to whether or not the parties involved are
entitled to indemnification under Sections 23.1 and 23.2 of this Article.

 

Section 23.4 Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit
or proceeding may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final
disposition of such action, suit or proceeding as authorized in the manner
provided under Section 23.3 of this Article upon receipt of an undertaking by
or on behalf of the director, officer and/or employee to repay such
amount unless it shall ultimately be determined that he is entitled to be
indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article.

Section 23.5 The indemnification provided by this Article shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which a person seeking indemnification may be
entitled under any agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested
directors, or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity while
serving as a director, officer and/or employee and as to action in another
capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has
ceased to be a director, officer and/or employee and shall inure to the
benefit of the heirs and personal representatives of such a person.

ARTICLE 24

SHARE CERTIFICATES

 

Section 24.1. The share certificates of the Corporation shall be numbered and
registered in a share register as they are issued, shall bear the name of the
registered holder, the number and class of shares represented thereby, the par
value of each share or a statement that such shares are without par value, as
the case may be, shall be signed by the President or a Vice President and the
Secretary or the Treasurer or any other person properly authorized by the
Board of  Directors; and shall bear the corporate seal, which seal may be a facsimile
engraved or printed. Where the certificate is signed by a transfer agent or a
registrar, the signature of any corporate officer on such certificate may be
a facsimile, engraved or printed. In case any officer who has signed, or whose
facsimile signature has been placed upon, any share certificate shall have
ceased to be such officer because of death, resignation or otherwise before
the certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same
effect as if the officer had not ceased to be such at the date of its issue.

Section 24.2 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any or all
classes and series of shares, or any part thereof, may be represented by
uncertificated shares to the extent determined by the Board of Directors,
except that shares represented by a certificate that is issued and outstanding
shall continue to be represented thereby until the certificate is surrendered
to the Corporation. Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer
of uncertificated shares, the Corporation shall send to the registered owner
thereof a written notice containing the information required to be set forth
or stated on certificates. The rights and obligations of the holders of
shares represented by certificates and the rights and obligations of the
holders of uncertificated shares of the same class shall be identical.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the provisions of Section
24.1 shall not apply to uncertificated shares and, in lieu thereof, the Board
of Directors shall adopt alternative procedures for registration of transfers.

ARTICLE 25

TRANSFER OF SHARES

 

Section 25.1. Upon surrender to the Corporation of a share certificate duly
endorsed by the person named in the certificate or by attorney duly appointed
in writing and accompanied where necessary by proper evidence of succession,
assignment or authority to transfer, a new certificate shall be issued to the
person entitled thereto and the old certificate cancelled and the transfer
recorded upon the share register of the Corporation. No transfer shall be made
if it would be inconsistent with the provisions of Article 8 of the
Pennsylvania Uniform Commercial Code.

 

ARTICLE 26

LOST CERTIFICATES

Section 26.1. Where a shareholder of the Corporation alleges the loss, theft
or destruction of one or more certificates for shares of the Corporation and
requests the issuance of a substitute certificate therefore, the Board of
Directors may direct a new certificate of the same tenor and for the same
number of shares to be issued to such person upon such persons making of an
affidavit in form satisfactory to the Board of Directors setting forth the
facts in connection therewith, provided that prior to the receipt of such
request the Corporation shall not have either registered a transfer of such
certificate or received notice that such certificate has been acquired by a
bona fide purchaser. When authorizing such issue of a new certificate the
Board of Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, or his heirs or legal  representatives, as the case may be, to advertise the same in such manner as
it shall require and/or give the Corporation a bond in such form and with
surety or sureties, with fixed or open penalty, as shall be satisfactory to
the Board of Directors, as indemnity for any liability or expense which it may
incur by reason of the original certificate remaining outstanding.

Section 27.2. Before payment of any dividend, there may be set aside out of
any funds of the Corporation available for dividends such sum or sums as the
Board of Directors from time to time, in their absolute discretion, think
proper as a reserve fund to meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends,
or for repairing or maintaining any property of the Corporation, or for such
other purposes as the Board of Directors shall believe to be for the best
interests of the Corporation, and the Board of Directors may reduce or abolish
any such reserve in the manner in which it was created.
