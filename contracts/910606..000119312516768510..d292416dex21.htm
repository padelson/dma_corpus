(the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of a newly issued share of Raven Common Stock (the
" _Merger Consideration_ "), as more fully described in this Agreement and on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, each of the respective boards of directors of Raven and Eagle has
approved this Agreement and declared this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, to be advisable and in the best

entered into (a) a governance agreement (the " _Governance Agreement_ "),
which provides, among other things, for certain post-Closing governance

this Agreement is intended to be and hereby is adopted as a "plan of

applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in
accordance with the Maryland General Corporation Law (the " _MGCL_ ") and the
Florida Business Corporation Act (the " _FBCA_ "), at the Effective Time,
Eagle shall be merged with and into Raven (the " _Merger_ "). As a result of
the Merger, the separate existence of Eagle shall cease, and Raven shall

Maryland (the " _SDAT_ ") and the articles of merger for the Merger with the
Department of State of the State of Florida (the " _DOS_ ") (as applicable,
the " _Articles of Merger_ "), in such form as required by, and executed in
accordance with, the relevant provisions of the MGCL and the FBCA,
respectively. The Merger shall become effective at the time when the Articles
of Merger have been accepted for record by the SDAT and the DOS or at such
later time as may be agreed by the Parties in writing and specified in the
Articles of Merger (not to exceed 30 days from filing) (the date and time the
Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take
place at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd Street,
New York, New York 10019, at 8:30 a.m., New York time, on the second Business
Day after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Law) of the
conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than the conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at the Closing), unless another
date, time or place is agreed to in writing by the Parties (the date on which
the Closing occurs, the " _Closing Date_ ").

Section 1.3 _Articles and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_. At the
Effective Time, the restated articles of incorporation of Raven as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended in the Merger (such
amendment to be in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ , the "
_Articles Amendment_ "), and as so amended, shall be the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of
Raven as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided
therein or by applicable Law.

 

Section 1.4 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. Subject to
_Section 5.8_, from and after the Effective Time, the directors and officers
of Raven immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors and
officers of the Surviving Corporation. Prior to the Closing, the Board of
Directors of Eagle shall duly adopt resolutions to give effect to this
_Section 1.4_, including the matters set forth in Section 1.4 of the Eagle
Disclosure Letter.

Section 1.5 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that, for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, the Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning

-2- ARTICLE II

 

TREATMENT OF SECURITIES

 

Section 2.1 _Treatment of Securities_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Eagle Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or any holder of
any shares of capital stock of Raven or Eagle, each share of common stock, par
value $0.01, of Eagle (the " _Eagle Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than shares of Eagle Common
Stock owned directly by Raven or Eagle and in each case not held on behalf of
third parties (such excluded shares, the " _Excluded Shares_ " and such
eligible shares, the " _Eligible Shares_ "), shall be automatically converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

(b) _Conversion of Eagle Common Stock_. As a result of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the Parties or any holder of any shares of capital
stock of Raven or Eagle, as of the Effective Time, all of the Eligible Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall be automatically cancelled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and each evidence of shares in book-
entry form previously evidencing any of the Eligible Shares immediately prior
to the Effective Time (the " _Eagle Book-Entry Shares_ ") and each
certificate previously representing any Eligible Shares immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the " _Eagle Certificates_ ") shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and the right, if any, to
receive pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_ cash in lieu of fractional shares into
which such Eligible Shares have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_
and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ or 
_Section 5.10(c)_.

(c) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. At the Effective Time, as a result of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or any holder of
any shares of capital stock of Raven or Eagle, each Excluded Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to be
outstanding, be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and
shall cease to exist.

(d) _Raven Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share of capital stock
of Raven issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
remain outstanding as a share of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation
and shall not be affected by the Merger.

 

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to Effective Time, Raven shall deposit or
shall cause to be deposited with a nationally recognized financial
institution or trust company selected by Raven and reasonably acceptable to
Eagle to serve as the exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the
benefit of the holders of Eligible Shares, (i) an aggregate number of shares
of Raven Common Stock to be issued in uncertificated or book-entry form
comprising the number of shares of Raven Common Stock required to be issued
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_, and (ii) an aggregate amount of cash
comprising approximately the amount required to be delivered pursuant to
_Section 2.2(e)_. In addition, Raven shall deposit or cause to be deposited
with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time after the Effective
Time, any dividends or other

 



-3-  distributions, if any, to which the holders of Eligible Shares may be
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ with both a record and payment date
after the Effective Time and prior to the surrender of such Eligible Shares
or pursuant to _Section 5.10(c)_. Such shares of Raven Common Stock, cash in
lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_ and the
amount of any dividends or other distributions deposited with the Exchange
Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.2(a)_ are referred to collectively in this
Agreement as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Exchange Fund shall not be used for
any purpose other than for the purpose provided for in this Agreement.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five Business
Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail to each holder of record of Eligible Shares notice advising such holders
of the effectiveness of the Merger, including (A) appropriate transmittal
materials specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Eagle Certificates or Eagle Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Eagle Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Eagle Certificates, as provided in _Section 2.7_) or transfer of the Eagle
Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent (including customary provisions with
respect to delivery of an "agents message" with respect to Eagle Book-Entry
Shares) (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), and (B) instructions for
surrendering the Eagle Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Eagle Certificates, as provided in _Section 2.7_) or transferring the Eagle
Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent in exchange for the Merger
Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Raven Common Stock, if
any, to be issued or paid in consideration therefor, and any dividends or
distributions, in each case, to which such holders are entitled pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement. With respect to holders of Eagle Book-Entry
Shares, the Parties shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Exchange
Agent to allow the Exchange Agent to promptly transmit, following the
Effective Time, to such holders or their nominees, upon surrender of Eligible
Shares, the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Raven
Common Stock, if any, to be issued or paid in consideration therefor, and any
dividends or distributions, in each case, to which such holders are entitled
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

(ii) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of Eligible Shares that are
represented by Eagle Certificates, by physical surrender of such Eagle
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of an Eagle Certificate, as provided
in _Section 2.7_) or that are Eagle Book-Entry Shares, by book-receipt of
an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent in connection with the transfer of
Eagle Book-Entry Shares, in accordance with the terms of the Letter of
Transmittal and accompanying instructions or, with respect to Eagle Book-Entry
Shares, in accordance with customary procedures and such other procedures as
agreed by the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent, the holder of such
Eagle Certificate or Eagle Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor (A) that number of whole shares of Raven Common Stock that
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ and (B) an
amount (if any) in immediately available funds (or, if no wire transfer
instructions are provided, a check, and in each case, after giving effect to
any required Tax withholdings as provided in

 



-4-   _Section 2.2(h)_) of (1) any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable
pursuant to _Section 2.7_ _plus_ (2) any unpaid non-stock dividends and any
other dividends or other distributions that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ or _Section 5.10(c)_.

 

(iii) No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of Eligible Shares, and any Eagle Certificate or ledger entry
relating to Eagle Book-Entry Shares formerly representing shares of Eagle
Common Stock that have been so surrendered shall be cancelled by the Exchange
Agent.

 

(iv) In the event of a transfer of ownership of certificated Eligible Shares
that is not registered in the transfer records of Eagle, the proper number of
shares of Raven Common Stock, together with an amount (if any) in immediately
available funds (or, if no wire transfer instructions are provided, a check,
and in each case, after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 2.2(h)_) of cash to be paid upon due surrender of the
Eagle Certificate and any dividends or distributions in respect thereof, may
be issued or paid to such a transferee if the Eagle Certificate formerly
representing such Eligible Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not
applicable, in each case, in form and substance, reasonably satisfactory to
the Exchange Agent and the Surviving Corporation. Payment of the Merger
Consideration with respect to Eagle Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to
the Person in whose name such Eagle Book-Entry Shares are registered in the
stock transfer books of Eagle. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 2.2(b)_, each Eagle Certificate and Eagle Book-Entry Share shall be
deemed at any time at or after the Effective Time to represent only the right
to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Article II_,
including any amount payable in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with
_Section 2.2(e)_, and any dividends or other distributions in accordance
with _Section 2.2(c)_ or _Section 5.10(c)_, in each case without interest.

(c)  _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. All shares of Raven
Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger shall be deemed issued
and outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever a dividend or other
distribution is declared by Raven in respect of Raven Common Stock, the
record date for which is after the Effective Time, that declaration shall
include dividends or other distributions in respect of all shares issuable
pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions in respect of
Raven Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Eligible
Share until the Eagle Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Eagle
Certificate as provided in _Section 2.7_) or Eagle Book-Entry Share is
surrendered for exchange in accordance with this _Article II_. Subject to
applicable Laws, following such surrender, there shall be issued or paid to
the holder of record of the whole shares of Raven Common Stock issued in
exchange for Eligible Shares in accordance with this _Article II_, without
interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable
with respect to such whole shares of Raven Common Stock and not paid and (ii)
at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable
with respect to such whole shares of Raven Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.

 



-5- (d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of Eagle of the shares of Eagle Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Eagle Certificates or Eagle Book-
Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares of Eagle Common Stock, except
as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Eagle Certificates or Eagle Book-Entry Shares are presented
to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

(e) _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, no fractional shares of Raven Common Stock shall be
issued upon the conversion of Eligible Shares pursuant to this Agreement. Any
holder of Eligible Shares otherwise entitled to receive a fractional share of
Raven Common Stock but for this _Section 2.2(e)_ shall be entitled to
receive, upon surrender of the applicable Eligible Shares, a cash payment,
without interest, in lieu of any fractional share, equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional share interest to which such holder
(after taking into account all shares of Eagle Common Stock held at the
Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the
closing price on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ "), as reported on
the consolidated tape at the close of the NYSE regular session of trading, for
a share of Raven Common Stock on the last trading day immediately preceding
the Closing Date. No holder of Eligible Shares shall be entitled by virtue of
the right to receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of Raven Common Stock
described in this _Section 2.2(e)_ to any dividends, voting rights or any
other rights in respect of any fractional share of Raven Common Stock. The
payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Raven Common Stock is not a
separately bargained-for consideration and solely represents a
mechanical rounding-off of the fractions in the exchange.

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to holders of Eligible Shares for nine months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand,
and any former stockholders of Eagle who have not theretofore complied with
this  _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
for delivery of any shares of Raven Common Stock and any payment of cash and
any dividends and other distributions in respect thereof payable or issuable
pursuant to  _Section 2.1(a)_, _Section 2.2(c)_, _Section 2.2(e)_ and
_Section 5.10(c)_, in each case, without any interest thereon.

 

(g) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other
Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Eagle Common Stock
for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of Eligible Shares immediately
prior to the time at which the Exchange Fund would otherwise escheat to, or
become property of, any Governmental Entity, shall, to the extent permitted by
Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



-6- (h) _Withholding_. Each of Raven, Eagle, the Exchange Agent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
or any other applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted
or withheld by Raven, Eagle, the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

Section 2.3 _Further Assurances_. If at any time following the Effective
Time the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are
necessary, desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or
otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to
or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or
assets of any Party, or (b) otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, the Surviving Corporation and its proper officers and directors or
their designees shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of any Party, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances
and to do, in the name and on behalf of any such Person, all such other acts
and things as may be necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect or
confirm the Surviving Corporations right, title or interest in, to or under
any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of
such Party and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

Section 2.4 _Treatment of Eagle Equity Awards_. 

(a) _Eagle Stock Options_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the Parties or any holders thereof,
each option to purchase shares of Eagle Common Stock granted under the Eagle
Equity Plan (each, an " _Eagle Stock Option_ "), whether vested or unvested,
that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall vest in full, not be assumed by Raven and shall be converted into,
and entitle the holder thereof to receive, within seven days following the
Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number
of shares of Eagle Common Stock subject to such Eagle Stock Option as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) the excess of (A) the Merger
Consideration Cashout Value over (B) the exercise price per share of Eagle
Common Stock subject to such Eagle Stock Option. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Merger Consideration Cashout Value_ " shall be equal to the
product of (i) the Exchange Ratio and (ii) the closing price per share of
Raven Common Stock on the NYSE on the last complete trading day prior to the
date on which the Effective Time occurs.

(b) _Eagle Restricted Stock Awards_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or any holders
thereof, each award of restricted shares of Eagle Common Stock granted under
the Eagle Equity Plan (each, an " _Eagle Restricted Stock Award_ ") that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed by
Raven and shall be converted into an award of restricted shares of Raven
Common Stock (a " _Raven Restricted Stock Award_ ") with respect to a number
of whole shares of Raven Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share)
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Eagle
Common Stock subject to such Eagle Restricted Stock Award as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the Exchange Ratio. Except as otherwise
provided in this _Section 2.4(b)_, each Eagle Restricted Stock Award assumed
and converted into a Raven Restricted Stock Award pursuant to this _Section
2.4(b)_ shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and
conditions as applied to the corresponding

 



-7-  Eagle Restricted Stock Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the right to have shares of Raven
Common Stock withheld to satisfy any tax liabilities associated with the
vesting of such Raven Restricted Stock Award); _provided_ , _however_ , that
(i) all Raven Restricted Stock Awards held by Covered Individuals (as defined
in Section 5.6(c) of the Eagle Disclosure Letter) and members of the Eagle
Board of Directors will vest in full as of the Effective Time, and (ii) if the
employment with Raven and its Affiliates of a holder of a Raven Restricted
Stock Award is terminated without Cause, by the holder for Good Reason (each,
as defined in _Section 5.6(a)_ of the Eagle Disclosure Letter) or due to the
holders death or disability, such Raven Restricted Stock Award will vest in

ARTICLE V

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

Section 5.1 _Preparation of Joint Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meetings_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement
(and in any event within 40 days after the date of this Agreement), Raven and
Eagle shall cooperate in preparing and shall cause to be filed with the SEC
mutually acceptable proxy materials which shall constitute the joint proxy
statement/prospectus relating to the matters to be submitted to the
Eagle stockholders at the Eagle Stockholders Meeting and to the Raven

 



-53-  stockholders at the Raven Stockholders Meeting (such joint proxy
statement/prospectus, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ "), and Raven shall prepare and file with the SEC
a registration statement on Form S-4 (of which the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall be a part) with respect to the Raven Stock Issuance
(such Form S-4, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Form S-4_
"). Each of Raven and Eagle shall furnish all information required to be
disclosed in the Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus concerning
itself, its Affiliates and the holders of its capital stock to the
other, including all information necessary for the preparation of pro forma
financial statements, and provide such other assistance as may be reasonably
requested in connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the
Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Prior to filing the Form S-4
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) or filing or mailing the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to
any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each of Raven and Eagle shall
cooperate and provide the other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on such document or response, and each Party will provide the other Party with
a copy of all such filings made with the SEC. Raven and Eagle shall use
reasonable best efforts to have the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus cleared
by the SEC and the Form S-4 declared effective by the SEC and to keep the Form
S-4 effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and
the transactions contemplated thereby. Raven and Eagle shall, as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other Party with copies of any
written comments and advise the other Party of any oral comments with respect
to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 received from the
SEC. Each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to take any action
required to be taken under any applicable state securities laws in connection
with the Merger, and each Party shall furnish all information concerning it,
its Affiliates and the holders of its capital stock as may be reasonably
requested in connection with any such action. Each Party will advise the other
Party, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Form
S-4 has become effective, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of
the qualification of the Raven Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC
for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4. If, at
any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to either of
the Parties, or their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be
discovered by either Party, and such information should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus so that such documents would not include any misstatement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other Party and, to the extent required by law, rules
or regulations, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
stockholders of Raven and Eagle.

 

(b) Eagle shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as practicable (and in any
event within 45 days) following the date upon which the Form S-4 becomes
effective (the " _Eagle Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining
the Eagle Required Vote. Unless a Change in Eagle Recommendation has occurred
in accordance with _Section 5.4_, Eagle and the Board of Directors of Eagle
shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain from the stockholders of
Eagle the Eagle Required Vote. Unless a Change in Eagle Recommendation
has occurred in accordance with _Section 5.4_, Eagle and its Board of
Directors will recommend to its stockholders approval of the

 



-54-  Merger and Eagle shall cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the
Form S-4 to include such recommendation. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 5.1(b)_, if, on the date for which the Eagle
Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, Eagle has not received proxies representing
a sufficient number of shares of Eagle Common Stock to obtain the Eagle
Required Vote, whether or not a quorum is present, Eagle shall have the right
to (and at the request of Raven shall) make one or more successive
postponements or adjournments of the Eagle Stockholders Meeting; _provided_
that the Eagle Stockholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date
that is more than 30 days after the date for which the Eagle Stockholders
Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments or postponements
required by applicable Law). Nothing contained in this Agreement (absent
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms) shall be deemed
to relieve Eagle of its obligation to submit the Merger to its stockholders
for a vote on the approval thereof. Eagle agrees that, unless this Agreement
shall have been terminated in accordance with _Section 7.1_, its obligations
to hold the Eagle Stockholders Meeting pursuant to this _Section 5.1_ shall
not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to Eagle or its Board of Directors of any Acquisition Proposal,
by any Change in Eagle Recommendation or by any development, fact,
circumstance or change that would give rise to a right to make a Change in
Eagle Recommendation.

 

(c) Raven shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as practicable (and in any
event within 45 days) following the date upon which the Form S-4 becomes
effective (the " _Raven Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining
the Raven Required Vote. Unless a Change in Raven Recommendation has occurred
in accordance with _Section 5.4_, Raven and the Board of Directors of Raven
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the stockholders of Raven
the Raven Required Vote. Unless a Change in Raven Recommendation has occurred
in accordance with _Section 5.4_, Raven and its Board of Directors will
recommend to its stockholders approval of the Merger and Raven shall cause the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 to include
such recommendation. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 5.1(c)_, if, on a date for which the Raven Stockholders Meeting is
scheduled, Raven has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of
shares of Raven Common Stock to obtain the Raven Required Vote, whether or
not a quorum is present, Raven shall have the right to (and at the request of
Eagle shall) make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the
Raven Stockholders Meeting;  _provided_ that the Raven Stockholders Meeting
is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than 30 days after the
date for which the Raven Stockholders Meeting was originally scheduled
(excluding any adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law).
Nothing contained in this Agreement (absent termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms) shall be deemed to relieve Raven of its obligation
to submit the Merger to its stockholders for a vote on the approval thereof.
Raven agrees that, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with _Section 7.1_, its obligations to hold the Raven Stockholders
Meeting pursuant to this _Section 5.1_ shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to Raven or
its Board of Directors of any Acquisition Proposal, by any Change in Raven
Recommendation or by any development, fact, circumstance or change that would
give rise to a right to make a Change in Raven Recommendation.

 



-55- (d) Each of Raven and Eagle shall cooperate and use their reasonable best
efforts to cause the Raven Stockholders Meeting and the Eagle Stockholders
Meeting to be held on the same date and as soon as reasonably practicable
after the date of this Agreement.

 

Section 5.2 _Access to Information_. Upon reasonable notice, and at the
reasonable request of the other Party, (x) each of Raven and Eagle shall (and
shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to) afford to the
Representatives of the other, reasonable access, during normal business hours
during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties
(other than for purposes of invasive testing), books, contracts, records and
Representatives and (y) Eagle shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
to) afford to Raven and its Representatives access to all of their properties,
books, contracts, records and Representatives, and any other items as Raven
or its Representatives may reasonably request regarding Tax matters referred
to in _Section 5.2_ of the Eagle Disclosure Letter; _provided_ that all such
access shall be coordinated through the disclosing Party or its
Representatives in accordance with such procedures as they may reasonably
establish. Neither Party nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would violate or prejudice the rights of its customers, jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such
information or contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into prior to
the date of this Agreement. The Parties will make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply. No such investigation by either Raven or Eagle shall
affect the representations and warranties of the other. The terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information and access provided
pursuant to this _Section 5.2_.

 

Section 5.3 _Efforts; Notice of Certain Events_.

promptly furnish the other Party, subject in appropriate cases to appropriate
confidentiality agreements to limit disclosure to outside lawyers and
consultants, with such information and reasonable assistance as such other
Party may reasonably request in connection with their preparation of
necessary filings, registrations and submissions of information to any
Governmental Entity, (iii) supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to any applicable Laws by any Governmental Entity, and
(iv) take or cause to be taken all other actions

Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and consider
in good faith the views of the other Party and keep the other Party
reasonably informed of the status of matters related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including furnishing the other Party with any
written notices or other communications received by such Party from, or given
by such Party to, any Governmental Entity and of any communication received or
given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case
regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby, except that any
materials concerning one Partys valuation of the other Party may be
redacted; and (iii) permit the other Party to review in draft any proposed
substantive or other non-ministerial communication to be submitted by it to
any Governmental Entity with reasonable time and opportunity to comment, and
consult with each other in advance of any in-person or substantive or other
non-ministerial telephonic meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity
or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other
Person, and, to the extent permitted by the applicable Governmental Entity or
Person, not agree to participate in any meeting or substantive or other non-
ministerial discussion with any Governmental Entity relating to any filings
or investigations concerning this Agreement and or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other Party and its
Representatives in advance and invites the other Partys Representatives to
attend in accordance with applicable Laws. In furtherance of the foregoing,
prior to being exchanged with the other Party, any materials may be redacted

Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_
that Raven and Eagle shall not be required to, and shall not without the
other Partys written approval (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), incur any material expenses or liabilities in order to obtain
such consents.

 



-57- (e) Each of Eagle, the Board of Directors of Eagle, Raven and the Board of
Directors of Raven shall, if any state takeover statute or similar statute
becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, use all reasonable best efforts to ensure that
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.4 _Non-Solicitation; Change in Recommendation_.

 

(a) Each of Eagle and Raven agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor any of the Affiliates, directors, officers and employees of it or its
Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall cause its and its Subsidiaries other
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
propose, knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiry or the making of
any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to
lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, or any other effort or attempt to make or
implement an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise

Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected

to do any of the foregoing.

(b) (i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to its respective meeting of
stockholders to be held pursuant to _Section 5.1_, in response to an
unsolicited, _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal (that did not result
from such Partys breach of this _Section 5.4_) made after the date of this
Agreement, subject to compliance with the other terms of this _Section 5.4_
and Eagle or Raven, as applicable, first entering into a confidentiality
agreement with the Person who has made such Acquisition Proposal having
provisions that are no less favorable to such Party than those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that such confidentiality
agreement need not prohibit the making or amending of an Acquisition
Proposal), Eagle or Raven, as applicable, shall be permitted to (A) engage in
discussions and negotiations with the Person who has made such Acquisition
Proposal and (B) provide any nonpublic information or data in response to a
request therefor to the Person who has made such Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ that prior to taking any action described in clause (A) or (B)
above, the Board of Directors of Eagle or the Board of Directors of Raven, as
applicable, determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal
counsel that (I) based on the information then available and after
consultation with its financial advisor, such Acquisition Proposal
either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior

 



-58-  Proposal and (II) the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
the duties of the directors of the applicable board under applicable Law.
Eagle or Raven, as applicable, shall provide the other with a copy of any
nonpublic information or data provided to any Person pursuant to the prior
sentence prior to or simultaneously with furnishing such information to such
Person, unless such information has been previously made available to Eagle
or Raven, as applicable.

event later than 24 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any
request for nonpublic information relating to such Party or any of its
Subsidiaries by any Person that informs such Party or any of its Subsidiaries
that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, or any
inquiry from any Person seeking to have discussions or negotiations with such
Party relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall be made
orally and confirmed in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the
person making the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request and the material
terms and conditions of any inquiries, proposals or offers (including a copy
thereof if in writing and any related material documentation or material
correspondence, including proposed agreements). Each Party shall also
promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, notify the other Party, orally and
in writing, if it enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any
Acquisition Proposal or provides nonpublic information or data to any person
in accordance with this _Section 5.4(b)_ and keep the other Party reasonably
informed of the status and terms of any such proposals, offers, discussions or

(iii) Except as provided in _Section 5.4(b)(iv)_ or _Section 5.4(b)(v)_,
neither the Board of Directors of Eagle, the Board of Directors of Raven, nor
any committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify in any
manner adverse to the other Party, or propose publicly or resolve to withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify in any manner adverse to the other Party, the
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Board of
Directors of Eagle or the Board of Directors of Raven, as applicable, or any
such committee thereof, of this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby (a " _Change in Eagle Recommendation_ " or a
" _Change in Raven Recommendation_ ," respectively).

 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (but subject
to this _Section 5.4(b)(iv)_), prior to its respective meeting of
stockholders to be held pursuant to _Section 5.1_, with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal, the Board of Directors of Eagle or Board of Directors of
Raven, as applicable, may make a Change in Eagle Recommendation or a Change
in Raven Recommendation, as applicable, or authorize Eagle or Raven, as
applicable, to terminate this Agreement to enter into an Acquisition
Agreement, in each case, if and only if (A) an unsolicited _bona fide_

Raven, as applicable, has determined in good faith (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with
the duties of the directors of the applicable board under applicable Law, (D)
five Business Days shall have elapsed since the time the Party proposing to
take such action has given written notice to the other Party advising such
other Party that the notifying Party intends to take such action and
specifying in reasonable detail the reasons therefor, including the terms
and conditions of any such Superior Proposal that is the basis of the
proposed action (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal Recommendation Change_ ")
(it being understood that any amendment to any material term of such Superior
Proposal (including any change in the form or amount of consideration) shall
require a new Notice of Superior Proposal Recommendation Change and a new
five-Business Day period), (E) during such five-Business Day period, the
notifying Party has considered and, at the reasonable request of the other
Party, engaged in good faith discussions with such Party regarding, any
adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by the
other Party, and (F) the applicable Board of Directors proposing to take such
action, following such five-Business Day period, again determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
and taking into account any adjustment or modification of the terms of this
Agreement proposed by the other Party) that such Alternative Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and failure to do so would be inconsistent
with the duties of the directors of the applicable board under applicable
Law;  _provided_ , that in the case of termination of this Agreement to enter
into an Acquisition Agreement pursuant to this _Section 5.4(b)(iv)_, (x) the
terminating Party shall pay or cause to be paid to the other Party the

to be paid pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)_ or _Section 7.2(c)_, respectively,
in connection with such termination and (y) neither the Party nor
any Subsidiary or Representative thereof shall enter into any Acquisition
Agreement unless this Agreement has been or is prior to or substantially
concurrently terminated in accordance with its terms.

 

(v) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (but subject to
this _Section 5.4(b)(v)_), in circumstances not involving or relating to an
Acquisition Proposal, prior to its respective meeting of stockholders to be
held pursuant to _Section 5.1_, the Board of Directors of Eagle or Board of
Directors of Raven, as applicable, may make a Change in Eagle Recommendation
or a Change in Raven Recommendation, as applicable, if and only if (A) a
material change or development has occurred or arisen after the date of this
Agreement that was neither known to such Party or its directors nor
reasonably foreseeable as of the date of this Agreement (and which change or
development does not involve or relate to an Acquisition Proposal), (B) the
Board of Directors of Eagle or the Board of Directors of Raven,
as applicable, has determined in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with the applicable

notice to the other Party advising such other Party that the notifying Party
intends to take such action and specifying in reasonable detail the reasons

modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by the other Party, and
(E) the applicable Board of Directors proposing to take such action, following
such five-Business Day period, again determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel, and taking into account
any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by the
other Party) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with the applicable
boards duties under applicable Law.

 

(vi) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.4_ shall prohibit the Board of
Directors of Eagle or the Board of Directors of Raven, as applicable, from:
(A) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of Eagle or Raven, as
applicable, a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (B) making
any "stop, look and listen" communication to the stockholders of Eagle or
Raven, as applicable pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange

as applicable, except as permitted by  _Section 5.4(b)(iv)_ or _Section
5.4(b)(v)_.

(c) Each of Eagle and Raven agrees that (i) it will and will cause its
Subsidiaries, and its and their Representatives to, cease immediately and
terminate any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with
any third parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, and (ii) it will not release any third party from, or waive any
provisions of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and
will use reasonable efforts to enforce the provisions of such agreements.

Proposal other than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

 

Section 5.5 _NYSE Listing_. Raven shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
the shares of Raven Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger
to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of

Section 5.6 _Employee Matters_.

(a) For a period of one year following the Effective Time (the " _Continuation
Period_ "), Raven shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each
employee of Eagle and its Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by Raven
or its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (the " _Continuing Employees_
"), for so long as such Continuing Employee is employed following the
Effective Time, (i) an annual base salary or wage rate that is no less
favorable to such Continuing Employee than the annual base salary or wage rate
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time;
(ii) an annual cash bonus opportunity that is no less than the annual cash
bonus opportunity that was provided to such Continuing Employee

 



-61-  immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (iii) employee benefits that
are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to similarly
situated employees of Raven and its Subsidiaries, _provided_ that, for
purposes of this clause (iii), the employee benefits generally provided to
employees of Eagle and its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be deemed to be no less favorable in the aggregate to
those provided to similarly situated employees of Raven and its Subsidiaries,
it being understood that the Continuing Employees may commence participation
in the "employee benefit plans," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA (whether
or not subject to ERISA), maintained by Raven or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _New Plans_ ") at such times as are determined by Raven.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to such Continuing Employee executing
(and not revoking during the applicable revocation period) a release of claims
in favor of Raven and its Subsidiaries (including Eagle and its Subsidiaries),
Raven shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each Continuing
Employee (excluding any employee with an individual agreement providing for
severance) whose employment terminates during the Continuation Period under
circumstances set forth on _Section 5.6(a)_ of the Eagle Disclosure Letter
severance benefits that are set forth on _Section 5.6(a)_ of the Eagle
Disclosure Letter, and, for the avoidance of doubt, taking into account all of
the Continuing Employees service with the Eagle and its Subsidiaries (and
their predecessors) for purposes of determining the levels of severance
benefits to be provided to such Continuing Employee. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall require Raven or any of its
Subsidiaries to employ any Person.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Raven shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to assume and honor all Eagle
Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before
the Effective Time and the Transactions shall be deemed to constitute a
"change in control", "change of control" or term of similar import,
as applicable, under such Eagle Benefit Plans.

(c) Raven and Eagle agree to the matters set forth in _Section 5.6(c)_ of the
Eagle Disclosure Letter.

(d) For purposes of any New Plans providing benefits to any Continuing
Employees after the Effective Time, Raven shall, or shall cause its
applicable Subsidiary to: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions
and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents under
any New Plans in which such employees may be eligible to participate after the
Effective Time, except, with respect to pre-existing conditions or exclusions,
to the extent such pre-existing conditions or exclusions would apply under
the analogous Eagle Benefit Plan; (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide each Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents under any
New Plan with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid during the
portion of the plan year of the corresponding Eagle Benefit Plan ending on
the date such Continuing Employees participation in the New Plan begins (to
the same extent that such credit was given under the analogous Eagle Benefit
Plan prior to the date that the Continuing Employee first participates in the
New Plan) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under the New Plan; and (iii) recognize all service of the
Continuing Employees with Eagle and its Subsidiaries, for all purposes in any
New Plan in which such employees may be eligible to participate after the
Effective Time to the same extent such service was taken into account under
the analogous Eagle Benefit Plan prior to the date that the Continuing
Employee 

 



-62-  first participates in the New Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing clause (iii) shall not apply (A) to the extent it would result in
duplication of benefits, or (B) for any purpose with respect to any defined
benefit pension plan, postretirement welfare plan or any New Plan under which
similarly situated employees of Raven and its Subsidiaries do not receive
credit for prior service or that is grandfathered or frozen, either with
respect to level of benefits or participation.

(e) If requested by Raven not less than 10 Business Days before the Closing
Date, Eagle shall adopt board resolutions and take such corporate action as is
necessary to terminate the Eagle Benefit Plans that are Tax-qualified defined
contribution plans with a cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k)
of the Code (collectively, the " _Eagle Qualified DC Plan_ "), effective as of
the day prior to the Closing Date but contingent on the occurrence of the
Closing. The form and substance of such resolutions and any other actions
taken in connection with the foregoing termination shall be subject to the
review and approval of Raven. Upon the distribution of the assets in the
accounts under the Eagle Qualified DC Plan to the participants, Raven shall
permit such participants who are then actively employed by Raven or its
Subsidiaries to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code), in the
form of cash, from the Eagle Qualified DC Plan to the applicable Tax-
qualified defined contribution plans of Raven or its Subsidiaries.

(f) The provisions of this  _Section 5.6_ are solely for the benefit of the
Parties. No current or former director, officer, employee or other service
provider or any other person shall be a third-party beneficiary of this
Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Raven
Benefit Plan, Eagle Benefit Plan or other compensation or benefit plan or
arrangement for any purpose. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing
in this _Section 5.6_, nothing contained in this Agreement shall otherwise
obligate Raven, Eagle or any of their respective Affiliates to (i) maintain
any particular Benefit Plan or (ii) retain the employment or services of any
current or former director, employee or other service provider.

Section 5.7 _Fees and Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be paid by the Party
incurring such expense, except as otherwise provided in _Section 7.2_ and
except that expenses incurred in connection with filing, printing and mailing
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 (other than legal fees)
shall be shared equally by Eagle and Raven.

 

Section 5.8 _Governance_. Raven shall take such actions as are necessary to
cause the Eagle Designees to become members of the Board of Directors of
Raven immediately after the Effective Time. In furtherance of the foregoing,
Eagle and Raven agree to the matters set forth on _Section 5.8_ of the Raven
Disclosure Letter. Raven shall take such actions as are necessary to cause
the Eagle Chairman to (a) become the non-executive Vice Chairman of the Raven
Board of Directors immediately after the Effective Time and (b) be appointed
as a member of the Investment Committee of the Board of Directors of
Raven immediately after the Effective Time.

 



-63- Section 5.9 _Indemnification and D andO Insurance_.

 

(a) For six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall indemnify and hold harmless all past and present directors and officers
of Eagle and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ")
against any costs or expenses (including advancing attorneys fees and
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any actual or threatened
claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the
extent permitted by applicable Law; _provided_ such Indemnified Party agrees
in advance to return any such funds to which a court of competent jurisdiction
has determined in a final, nonappealable judgment such Indemnified Party is
not ultimately entitled), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or
threatened claim, action, investigation, suit or proceeding in respect of
acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the
approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger), in connection
with such Indemnified Parties serving as a director, officer, employee, agent
or other fiduciary of Eagle or any of its Subsidiaries or of any other Person
if such service was at the request or for the benefit of Eagle or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case to the extent permitted by Law and to the same
extent that Eagle or its Subsidiaries would have been permitted to do so
pursuant to the Organizational Documents of Eagle or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any
Indemnified Party notifies the Surviving Corporation on or prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time of a matter in respect of which such Person
may seek indemnification pursuant to this _Section 5.9_, the provisions of
this _Section 5.9_ shall continue in effect with respect to such matter until
the final disposition of all claims, actions, investigations, suits and
proceedings relating thereto.

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
cause to be maintained in effect the provisions in (i) the Organizational
Documents of any Subsidiary of Eagle and (ii) except to the extent such
agreement provides for an earlier termination, any other agreements (other
than insurance contracts) of Eagle and its Subsidiaries with any Indemnified
Party, in each case, regarding elimination of liability, indemnification of
officers, directors, agents and employees and advancement of expenses that are
in existence on the date of this Agreement, to the extent such agreements
have been made available to Raven prior to the date of this Agreement, and no
such provision shall be amended, modified or repealed in any manner that would
materially and adversely affect the rights or protections thereunder of any
such Indemnified Party in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to
have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions
occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger).

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, in consultation with Raven as provided in
this  _Section 5.9(c)_, Eagle shall purchase a six-year prepaid "tail"
policy for the extension of the directors and officers liability coverage of
Eagles existing directors and officers liability insurance policies and
fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or
discovery period of six years from and after the Effective Time, on terms and
conditions providing coverage retentions, limits and other material terms
substantially equivalent to the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by Eagle with
respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time, covering
without limitation the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Eagle shall, in cooperation with Raven, use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the most favorable pricing and most comprehensive
coverage reasonably available for such "tail" policy and Eagle shall not
commit or spend on such "tail" policy more than 300% of the last aggregate
annual

 



-64-  premium paid by Eagle prior to the date of this Agreement for Eagles
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance (the " _Base Amount_ "), and if the cost of such "tail"
policy would otherwise exceed the Base Amount, Eagle shall be permitted to
purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for the Base Amount. After
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause such "tail" policy
to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all
obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation, and no
Party shall have any other obligation to purchase or pay for any insurance
hereunder. Eagle shall in good faith cooperate and consult with Raven prior to
the Effective Time with respect to the procurement of such "tail" policy,
including with respect to the selection of the broker, available policy price
and coverage options, and shall in good faith consider Ravens recommendations
with respect thereto.

 

(d) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section
5.9_.

 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, and (ii) are
in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or
otherwise.

 

Section 5.10 _Dividends_.

 

(a) Each of Eagle and Raven shall declare a dividend to their respective
stockholders, the record date, and payment date (to the extent practicable),
for which shall be the close of business on the last Business Day prior to the
Closing Date (the " _Closing Dividend Date_ "), subject to funds being legally
available therefor. The per share dividend amount payable by Eagle shall be
an amount equal to (i) the per share amount of Eagles most recent quarterly
dividend, multiplied by the number of days elapsed since such last dividend
record date through and including the Closing Dividend Date, and divided by
the actual number of days in the calendar quarter in which such dividend is
declared, plus (ii) an additional amount per share (the " _Additional Dividend
Amount_ "), if any, necessary so that the aggregate dividend payable by Eagle
is equal to the Minimum Distribution Dividend. The per share dividend amount
payable by Raven shall be an amount equal to (A) the per share amount of
Ravens most recent quarterly dividend, multiplied by the number of
days elapsed since such last dividend record date through and including the
Closing Dividend Date, and divided by the actual number of days in the
calendar quarter in which such dividend is declared, plus (B) the Additional
Dividend Amount (on a per share basis), if any, divided by the Exchange
Ratio. If Eagle determines it is necessary to declare the Additional Dividend
Amount, Eagle shall notify Raven in writing of such determination at least ten
Business Days prior to Eagle Stockholders Meeting.

 



-65- (b) If Eagle determines that it is necessary to declare a Special Eagle
Distribution in accordance with _Section 4.1(b)(iv)_ or if Raven determines
that it is necessary to declare a Special Raven Distribution in accordance
with _Section 4.2(b)(iv)_, such Party shall notify the other Party in writing
at least 10 Business Days prior to the Eagle Stockholders Meeting and the
Raven Stockholders Meeting, and such other Party shall be entitled to declare
a dividend per share payable (i) in the case of Eagle, to holders of shares of
Eagle Common Stock, in an amount per share equal to the product of (A) the
Special Raven Distribution declared by Raven with respect to each share of
Raven Common Stock and (B) the Exchange Ratio and (ii) in the case of Raven,
to holders of shares of Raven Common Stock, in an amount per share equal to
the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the Special Eagle Distribution declared
by Eagle with respect to each share of Eagle Common Stock by (y) the Exchange
Ratio. The record date and payment date for any dividend payable pursuant to
this _Section 5.10_ shall be the Closing Dividend Date.

(c) In the event that a dividend or distribution with respect to the shares
of Eagle Common Stock permitted under the terms of this Agreement has (i) a
record date prior to the Effective Time and (ii) has not been paid as of the
Effective Time, the holders of shares of Eagle Common Stock shall be entitled
to receive such dividend or distribution pursuant to and in accordance with
_Section 2.2_.

 

Section 5.11 _Public Announcements_. Except (a) for communications consistent
with the final form of joint press release announcing the Merger and the
investor presentation given to investors on the date of announcement of the
Merger, (b) as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to
any listing agreement with or rules of the NYSE or (c) pursuant to Eagles or
Ravens rights pursuant to _Section 5.4_, Eagle and Raven shall consult with
each other, and provide meaningful opportunity for review and give due
consideration to reasonable comment by the other Party, prior to issuing any
press releases or other public written communications or otherwise making
planned public statements with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.12 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Eagle and Raven agree to use their respective reasonable best efforts to
cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, upon Ravens written
request, Eagle shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause (x) any
Subsidiary that is treated as a "qualified REIT subsidiary" (within the
meaning of Section 856(i)(2) of the Code) of (1) Eagle or (2) any Subsidiary
of Eagle that is a REIT (a " _Subsidiary REIT_ ") and (y) any Subsidiary set
forth in _Section 5.12(b)_ of the Eagle Disclosure Letter (each such
Subsidiary identified in such written request, a " _Converted Entity_ ") to
(i) convert into a limited liability company (or other entity that is
disregarded as an entity separate from Eagle or such Subsidiary REIT, as
applicable, for U.S. federal income tax purposes) (a " _Disregarded Entity_
"), (ii) merge with and into a Disregarded Entity, and/or (iii) make an
election under Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-3(c) to be disregarded as
an entity separate from its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as
applicable, in each case, such that, prior to and at the Effective Time, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, such Converted Entity is a Disregarded
Entity (and would be a Disregarded Entity without regard to its status as
a "qualified REIT subsidiary" (within the meaning of Section 856(i)(2) of the
Code, if applicable)). Within ten (10) days of receiving any such written
request, Eagle shall notify Raven in writing of any Subsidiary identified
in such request with respect to which a conversion, merger, and/or election,
as applicable, cannot occur prior to the Effective Time.

 



-66- (c) Raven and Eagle shall take the actions described in _Section 5.12(c)_ of
the Eagle Disclosure Letter.

Section 5.13 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Eagle shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall cause its and
their Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by
Raven in connection with financing arrangements (including, without
limitation, assumptions, guarantees, amendments, supplements, modifications,
refinancings, replacements, repayments, terminations or prepayments of
existing financing arrangements) as Raven may reasonably determine necessary
or advisable in connection with the completion of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Such cooperation shall include (i)
participating in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations and due
diligence sessions in connection with such financing arrangements, (ii)
providing reasonable and timely assistance with the preparation of materials
for presentations, offering memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents
required in connection with such financing arrangements, (iii) as promptly as
reasonably practical, and in any event at least 10 days prior to the Closing
Date, furnishing Raven and any of its financing sources with (A) unaudited
condensed consolidated balance sheets and related condensed consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows (in each
case, subject to normal year-end adjustments and absence of footnotes) for
Eagle for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 and each subsequent
fiscal quarter ended on a date that is not a fiscal year end and that is at
least 40 days before the Closing Date and (B) in the event that the Closing
Date occurs on a date that is more than 60 days following December 31, 2016,

consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, in each case prepared in
accordance with GAAP and (iv) to the extent requested in writing at least ten
(10) Business Days prior to the Closing, delivering at least three Business
Days prior to the Closing all documentation and other information with
respect to Eagle and its Subsidiaries that are required by regulatory

including the USA PATRIOT Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Eagle and its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall not be required to
enter into any letter, certificate, document, agreement or instrument (other
than customary authorization and representation letters) that will
be effective prior to the Closing and nothing in this _Section 5.13_ shall
require (x) such cooperation to the extent it would disrupt unreasonably the
business or operations of Eagle or any of its Subsidiaries or require any of
them to take any actions that would reasonably be expected to violate
applicable Law, contract or Organizational Documents, (y) the Board of
Directors of Eagle or the Board of Directors or similar governing body of any
Subsidiary of Eagle to adopt resolutions approving any letter, certificate,
document, agreement or instrument (other than customary authorization and
representation letters to the extent necessary) that will be effective prior
to the Closing or (z) Eagle or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any liability
(including due to any act or omission by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives) prior to the Closing
for which it has not received prior reimbursement or is not otherwise
indemnified by or on behalf of Raven.

 



-67- (b) Eagle shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to, as soon as reasonably practicable after (and not prior
to) the receipt of a written request from Raven to do so, on the terms and
conditions specified by Raven and in compliance with all applicable terms and
conditions of the applicable Eagle Debt Agreement, seek an amendment or
amendments to any of the Eagle Debt Agreements or pursue any approach chosen
by Raven to the assumption, defeasance, satisfaction and discharge,
constructive satisfaction and discharge, refinancing, repayment, repurchase,
redemption, termination, amendment, guarantee, purchase or other treatment of,
the Eagle Debt Agreements and the indebtedness incurred pursuant thereto, in
each case, subject to the occurrence of the Closing (any such transaction,
a " _Debt Transaction_ "). Eagle shall not be required to take any action in
respect of any Debt Transaction until Raven shall have provided Eagle with
drafts of the necessary documentation required in connection with such
Debt Transaction in a form reasonably satisfactory to Eagle (collectively,
the " _Debt Transaction Documents_ ") at least three (3) Business Days prior
to the date of such requested action. Eagle shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use commercially
reasonable efforts to, cause its and their respective Representatives to
provide cooperation and assistance reasonably requested by Raven in connection
with the Debt Transactions (including taking all corporate action reasonably
necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of any Debt Transaction
Documents to be entered into prior to Closing and delivering all officers
certificates and legal opinions required to be delivered in connection
therewith (such corporate action, execution and delivery not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned)); _provided_ , that the
effectiveness of any such Debt Transaction Documents shall be
expressly conditioned on the Closing. It is understood and agreed that a
failure to effectuate any Debt Transaction shall not constitute a failure by
Eagle to satisfy its obligations under this _Section 5.13(b)_.

 

(c) Eagle shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, after (and not prior to)
the receipt of a written request from Raven to do so, deliver all notices and
take all other actions to facilitate the termination at the Effective Time of
all commitments in respect of each of the Eagle Credit Facilities and any
other indebtedness of Eagle or its Subsidiaries to be paid off, discharged
and terminated on the Closing Date as specifically requested by Raven in
writing, the repayment in full on the Closing Date of all obligations in
respect of the indebtedness thereunder, and the release on the Closing Date of
any Liens securing such indebtedness and guarantees in connection therewith.
In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, after (and not prior
to) the receipt of a written request from Raven to do so, Eagle and its
Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Raven
(i) at least 10 Business Days prior to the Closing Date, a draft payoff letter

(e) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this

Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if either Eagle or Raven fails to pay all
amounts due to the other Party under this _Section 7.2_ on the dates

 



-75-  specified, then either Eagle or Raven, as applicable, shall pay all costs
and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred by such other Party
in connection with any action or proceeding (including the filing of any
lawsuit) taken by it to collect such unpaid amounts, together with interest on
such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing at such time, as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , from the date such amounts were
required to be paid until the date actually received by such other Party. Each
of the Parties acknowledges that each of the Raven Expense Reimbursement,
Eagle Expense Reimbursement, Raven Termination Fee and Eagle Termination Fee
is not a penalty, but rather are liquidated damages in a reasonable amount
that will compensate a Party in the circumstances in which such amounts are
due and payable, which amounts would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision.

 

(f) The " _Eagle Termination Fee_ " shall be an amount equal to the lesser of
(i) $150,000,000 (the " _Eagle Base Amount_ ") and (ii) the maximum amount,
if any, that can be paid to Raven without causing it to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (the " _REIT
Requirements_ ") for such year determined as if (A) the payment of such
amount did not constitute Qualifying Income, and (B) Raven has 0.5% of its
gross income from unknown sources during such year which was not Qualifying
Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income of Raven which was not
Qualifying Income), in each case as determined by independent accountants to
Raven. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Raven receives Tax Guidance
providing that Ravens receipt of the Eagle Base Amount would either
constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the
meaning of the REIT Requirements, the Eagle Termination Fee shall be an amount
equal to the Eagle Base Amount and Eagle shall, upon receiving notice
that Raven has received the Tax Guidance, pay to Raven the unpaid Eagle Base
Amount within five Business Days. In the event that Raven is not able to
receive the full Eagle Base Amount due to the above limitations, Eagle shall
place the unpaid amount in escrow by wire transfer within three days of
termination and shall not release any portion thereof to Raven unless and
until Raven receives either one or a combination of the following once or more
often: (x) a letter from Ravens independent accountants indicating the
maximum amount that can be paid at that time to Raven without causing Raven to
fail to meet the REIT Requirements (calculated as described above) or (y) the
Tax Guidance, in either of which events Eagle shall pay to Raven the lesser
of the unpaid Eagle Base Amount or the maximum amount stated in the letter
referred to in clause (x) above within five Business Days after Eagle has been
notified thereof. The obligation of Eagle to pay any unpaid portion of the
Eagle Termination Fee shall terminate on the December 31 following the date
which is five years from the date of this Agreement. Amounts remaining in
escrow after the obligation of Eagle to pay the Eagle Termination
Fee terminates shall be released to Eagle. " _Qualifying Income_ " shall mean
income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)(H) and 856(c)(3)(A)(I) of the
Code. " _Tax Guidance_ " shall mean a reasoned opinion from outside counsel
or a ruling from the IRS.

(g) The " _Raven Termination Fee_ " shall be an amount equal to the lesser
of (i) $240,000,000 (the " _Raven Base Amount_ ") and (ii) the maximum
amount, if any, that can be paid to Eagle without causing it to fail to meet
the REIT Requirements for such year determined as if (A) the payment of
such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income, and (B) Eagle has 0.5% of
its gross income from unknown sources during such year which was not
Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income of Eagle
which was not Qualifying Income), in each case as determined by independent
accountants to Eagle. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Eagle
receives Tax Guidance providing that Eagles receipt of the Raven

 



-76-  Base Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded
from gross income within the meaning of the REIT Requirements, the Raven
Termination Fee shall be an amount equal to the Raven Base Amount and Raven
shall, upon receiving notice that Eagle has received the Tax Guidance, pay to
Eagle the unpaid Raven Base Amount within five Business Days. In the event
that Eagle is not able to receive the full Raven Base Amount due to the above
limitations, Raven shall place the unpaid amount in escrow by wire transfer
within three days of termination and shall not release any portion thereof to
Eagle unless and until Eagle receives either one or a combination of the
following once or more often: (x) a letter from Eagles independent
accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at that time to
Eagle without causing Eagle to fail to meet the REIT Requirements (calculated
as described above) or (y) the Tax Guidance, in either of which events Raven
shall pay to Eagle the lesser of the unpaid Raven Base Amount or the maximum
amount stated in the letter referred to in clause (x) above within five
Business Days after Raven has been notified thereof. The obligation of Raven
to pay any unpaid portion of the Raven Termination Fee shall terminate on the
December 31 following the date which is five years from the date of this
Agreement. Amounts remaining in escrow after the obligation of Raven to pay
the Raven Termination Fee terminates shall be released to Raven.

(h) The " _Raven Expense Reimbursement_ " shall be an amount equal to the
lesser of (i) the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
Raven in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, in an amount not to exceed $45,000,000 (the " _Raven Expense
Reimbursement Base Amount_ ") and (ii) the maximum amount, if any, that can be
paid to Raven without causing it to fail to meet the REIT Requirements for
such year determined as if (A) the payment of such amount did not constitute
Qualifying Income, and (B) Raven has 0.5% of its gross income from unknown
sources during such year which was not Qualifying Income (in addition to any
known or anticipated income of Raven which was not Qualifying Income), in
each case as determined by independent accountants to Raven. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event Raven receives Tax Guidance providing that Ravens
receipt of the Raven Expense Reimbursement Base Amount would either
constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the
meaning of the REIT Requirements, the Raven Expense Reimbursement shall be an
amount equal to the Raven Expense Reimbursement Base Amount and Eagle shall,
upon receiving notice that Raven has received the Tax Guidance, pay to Raven
the unpaid Raven Expense Reimbursement Base Amount within five Business Days.
In the event that Raven is not able to receive the full Raven Expense
Reimbursement Base Amount due to the above limitations, Eagle shall place the
unpaid amount in escrow by wire transfer within three days of termination and
shall not release any portion thereof to Raven unless and until Raven receives
either one or a combination of the following once or more often: (x) a letter
from Ravens independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be
paid at that time to Raven without causing Raven to fail to meet the REIT
Requirements (calculated as described above) or (y) the Tax Guidance, in
either of which events Eagle shall pay to Raven the lesser of the unpaid Raven
Expense Reimbursement Base Amount or the maximum amount stated in the letter
referred to in clause (x) above within five Business Days after Eagle has
been notified thereof. The obligation of Eagle to pay any unpaid portion of
the Raven Expense Reimbursement shall terminate on the December 31 following
the date which is five years from the date of this Agreement. Amounts
remaining in escrow after the obligation of Eagle to pay the Raven Expense
Reimbursement terminates shall be released to Eagle.

 



-77- (i) The " _Eagle Expense Reimbursement_ " shall be an amount equal to the
lesser of (i) the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by Eagle in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, in an amount not to exceed $45,000,000 (the " _Eagle
Expense Reimbursement Base Amount_ ") and (ii) the maximum amount, if any,
that can be paid to Eagle without causing it to fail to meet the REIT
Requirements for such year determined as if (A) the payment of such amount did

Tax Guidance, in either of which events Raven shall pay to Eagle the lesser
of the unpaid Raven Base Amount or the maximum amount stated in the letter
referred to in clause (x) above within five Business Days after Raven has been

conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
