share, of Holdco (" _Holdco Share_ ") (such offer, as it may be amended from
time to time in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Offer_ "); and (b)
immediately following the acquisition of Deutsche Borse Shares pursuant to the
Offer, Merger Sub shall merge with and into NYSE Euronext (the " _Merger_ "),

Holdco, pursuant to which each share of NYSE Euronext common stock, par value
$0.01 per share (the " _NYSE Euronext Shares_ "), shall be converted into the
right to receive 0.47 (the " _NYSE Euronext Exchange Ratio_ ") of a Holdco
Share;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of NYSE Euronext has determined that the

-2-  ARTICLE I

THE OFFER

Section 1.1. _The Offer_.

 

(a) _Announcement of the Offer._ On the date of this Agreement, Holdco will
(i) notify the relevant stock exchanges and the German Federal Agency for
Financial Services Supervision ( _Bundesanstalt f ur
Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht_) (" _BaFin_ ") of its intention to make the
Offer, and (ii) publish its decision to launch the Offer (the " _Offer
Announcement_ ") in accordance with Section 10 para. 1 sentence 1, para. 3 of
the Takeover Act, which Offer Announcement shall include a description of the
Offer Consideration and such further information about the Offer as deemed to
be necessary or beneficial by the parties for further communication with
shareholders until the Offer has been cleared by BaFin. On the date hereof,
Deutsche Borse and NYSE Euronext shall also issue an initial press
release pursuant to Section 7.7, and Deutsche Borse shall issue an ad-hoc
release in accordance with Section 15 of the German Securities Dealing Act (
_Wertpapierhandelsgesetz_ ) to the effect that, in the opinion of each of the
Deutsche Borse Boards, a strategic business combination between NYSE Euronext
and Deutsche Borse is in the best interest of Deutsche Borse and its
shareholders, and that therefore each of the Deutsche Borse Boards has
determined that, subject to its duties under applicable Law, it will
recommend, in its statement on the Offer under Section 27 of the Takeover Act,
that the Deutsche Borse shareholders accept the Offer and tender their
Deutsche Borse Shares in the Offer. The wording of the Offer Announcement
required by this Section 1.1(a) shall be, to the extent reasonably
practicable, agreed between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse in advance.

 

(b) _Submission of Offer Documents to Regulators_. As promptly as practicable
after the date of this Agreement, NYSE Euronext, Deutsche Borse and Holdco
shall prepare, and Holdco shall file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ ") one or more registration statements on Form F-4
(together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Registration
Statement_ ") to register the offer and sale of Holdco Shares to be issued
pursuant to the Offer and the Merger. The Registration Statement will include
(1) a proxy statement/prospectus (the " _Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ ") to be
used for the NYSE Euronext Stockholders Meeting to adopt this Agreement and to
approve certain aspects of the Holdco articles of association that will be in
effect after the Merger and (2) a prospectus to be used as a prospectus sent
to U.S. holders of Deutsche Borse Shares (and, if NYSE Euronext and Deutsche
Borse mutually agree, the holders of American Depositary Shares representing
the right to receive Deutsche Borse Shares) for the Offer (the " _U.S. Tender
Offer Prospectus_ " and together with the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the "
_F-4 Prospectuses_ "). If Holdco shall file the Registration Statement with
the SEC prior to the date on which BaFin approves the Tender Offer Prospectus
(or, if earlier, the expiration of the review period required under the
Takeover Act), then Holdco shall file such Registration Statement with the SEC
on a confidential basis to the extent a confidential filing is permitted by
the SEC. Timely prior to the Acceptance Time, NYSE Euronext, Deutsche Borse
and Holdco

 



-3-   shall prepare, and Holdco shall submit to the Netherlands Authority for the
Financial Markets ( _Autoriteit Financi ele Markten_) (the " _AFM_ ") for the
purpose of admission of the Holdco Shares to trading on the regulated markets
of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and Euronext Paris, (i) a listing prospectus
(the " _Admission Prospectus_ "), in accordance with applicable Dutch Law
(which shall be identical with the Offer Documents in terms of content
relating to NYSE Euronext, Deutsche Borse, and Holdco and their respective
businesses to the greatest extent practicable) and (ii) applications for
notification of the admission prospectus to the relevant authorities in
Germany and France. On the date that is eight weeks following the Offer
Announcement or such earlier time as may be required by applicable Law, Holdco
shall submit to BaFin a tender offer document ( _Angebotsunterlage_ ) in
accordance with the Takeover Act, including as an annex the listing and
offering disclosure information as required by Section 7 German Securities
Prospectus Act ( _Wertpapierprospektgesetz_ ) in combination with Commission
regulation (EC) No. 809/2004 of 29 April 2004 and any further disclosure
information as deemed necessary or beneficial by the parties (the " _Tender
Offer Prospectus_ " and, together with the F-4 Prospectuses, the " _Offer
Documents_ ") and the related letter of transmittal form and other ancillary
documents with respect to the Offer; _provided_ that, if the parties agree,
Holdco may, in lieu of submitting the Tender Offer Prospectus to BaFin, (x)
submit to BaFin a tender offer document containing the information pursuant to
Section 11 of the Takeover Act and, in addition, (y) submit to the AFM a
securities prospectus containing the listing and offering
disclosure information required by applicable Dutch Law in combination with
Commission regulation (EC) No. 809/2004 of 29 April 2004 and any further
disclosure information as deemed necessary or beneficial by the parties (in
which case, such tender offer document and securities prospectus together
shall constitute the "Tender Offer Prospectus" for purposes of this
Agreement), for the purpose of passporting such securities prospectus that is
compliant with the relevant prospectus regulations for the offer of Holdco
Shares as consideration in the Offer and the Merger. Subject to applicable
Law, NYSE Euronext, Deutsche Borse and Holdco agree that the information
relating to NYSE Euronext, Deutsche Borse and Holdco and their respective
businesses included in the Offer Documents shall be identical in terms of
content to the greatest extent practicable. The parties agree to correct
promptly any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and
to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law. The
disclosure in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus of material U.S. federal income
tax consequences of the Merger to holders of NYSE Euronext common stock shall
include a description of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
Merger to holders of NYSE Euronext common stock in the event of a waiver of
the condition set forth in paragraph II.(b)(ii) of Annex II. Subject to
Section 7.4(c), the parties further agree to take all steps necessary to cause
the Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC, BaFin and, if
applicable, the AFM, and to be disseminated to holders of NYSE Euronext
Shares and Deutsche Borse Shares, as applicable, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable Law. As soon as practicable prior to the
consummation of the Offer and the Merger, Holdco shall apply for admission of
its entire issued share capital to trading on

 



-4-   the regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and Euronext Paris on
the basis of the Admission Prospectus.

(c) _Commencement of the Offer_. Following approval by BaFin (or the
expiration of the review period required under the Takeover Act) of the terms
of the Offer and the Tender Offer Prospectus filed by Holdco as set forth in
Section 1.1(b), Holdco shall (i) publish the Tender Offer Prospectus without
undue delay ( _ohne schuldhaftes Z ogern_) in accordance with Section 14 para.
2 of the Takeover Act and, thereby, commence the Offer, and (ii) on the date
of such publication, file with the SEC the U.S. Tender Offer Prospectus,
together with the related letter of transmittal form and other ancillary
documents with respect to the Offer, pursuant to Rule 424 under the U.S.
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ ") and disseminate
the U.S. Tender Offer Prospectus and such documents to the Deutsche Borse
shareholders in accordance with Rule 14d-4 promulgated under the Exchange
Act. If permitted by applicable Law, NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse may
mutually agree that Holdco shall split the Offer into two or more separate
exchange offers, including a separate U.S. offer and a non-U.S. offer. If the
Offer shall be split into multiple exchange offers, each reference to the
"Offer" set forth in this Agreement and the Annexes hereto shall refer to each
of these separate offers unless the context otherwise requires.

 

(d) _Offer Consideration_. Each Deutsche Borse Share accepted by Holdco
pursuant to the Offer (including during the subsequent offering period (
_weitere Annahmefrist_ )) shall be exchanged for one Holdco Share (the "
_Offer Consideration_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date
of this Agreement and the time that any particular Deutsche Borse Share is
accepted for exchange pursuant to the Offer, the outstanding NYSE Euronext
Shares or Deutsche Borse Shares shall have been changed into a different
number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then the
Offer Consideration will be appropriately and proportionately adjusted to
provide to the holder of such Deutsche Borse Share the same economic effect
as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

(e) _Acceptance Period of the Offer_. The Offer shall have an acceptance
period that ends at a time (such time, as it may be extended in accordance
with this Agreement and applicable Laws, the " _Expiration Time_ ") on a date
that is the earlier of (i) 10 weeks after the commencement of the Offer
pursuant to Section 1.1(c) and (ii) the Termination Date; _provided_ that (A)
in no event shall the Expiration Time occur on a date that is earlier than 20
business days (as defined in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) after
(and including the day of) the date of commencement of the Offer; and (B)
Holdco shall be permitted to extend the Expiration Time if such extension is
permitted by applicable Law and NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse mutually
agree to such extension.

(f) _Conditions to the Offer_. Holdcos obligation to accept for exchange,
and to exchange, any Deutsche Borse Shares validly tendered and not

 



-5-   withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer shall be solely ( _ausschlie
ßlich_) subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions (
_aufschiebende Bedingungen_ ) set forth in _Annex II_ (the " _Offer
Conditions_ "), including the condition that there shall be validly tendered
in accordance with the terms of the Offer prior to the Expiration Time and not
withdrawn, in each case in accordance with applicable Laws, a number of
Deutsche Borse Shares that represents at least 75% of the Deutsche Borse
Shares outstanding on a Fully Diluted Basis as of the Expiration Time (the "
_Minimum Condition_ "). As used in this Agreement, " _Fully Diluted Basis_ "
means, as of any particular time, the number of Deutsche Borse Shares issued
and outstanding at such time after taking into account all Deutsche Borse
Shares issuable upon the conversion of Deutsche Borses convertible
securities or upon the exercise of any options, warrants or rights to purchase
or subscribe for shares of the capital stock of Deutsche Borse.

 

(g) _Other Terms of the Offer_. Prior to the date of commencement of the
Offer, Deutsche Borse will reasonably determine the percentage of its share
capital held by U.S. holders in accordance with Instruction 2 to subsections
(c) and (d) of Exchange Act Rule 14d-1. If the conditions set forth for a
"Tier II" offer, as set forth in Rule 14d-1(d) under the Exchange Act, are
satisfied for the Offer, Holdco will conduct the Offer in reliance on the
exemptions for "Tier II" offers pursuant to Rule 14d-1(d) under the Exchange
Act. Subject to its duties under applicable Law, Deutsche Borse will provide
such information as NYSE Euronext and Holdco reasonably request to allow NYSE
Euronext and Holdco to make a determination that U.S. holders do not hold more
than 40% of the outstanding Deutsche Borse Shares and will otherwise
cooperate with their reasonable inquiries. The parties agree to comply with,
and agree that the terms and conditions of the Offer shall be conducted so as
to comply with, Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, as modified by any
applicable exemptions pursuant to Rule 14d-1(d)(2) under the Exchange Act.

(h) _Amendments and Waivers to Offer Terms and Conditions_. If BaFin permits
the publication of the Tender Offer Prospectus only in a form that is not in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall in
good faith cooperate to make changes to the Tender Offer Prospectus so as to
be consistent with the changes required by BaFin and to be consistent with the
original intent of the parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, nothing shall require the parties to agree to amend or waive
any of the terms or conditions of the Offer contemplated by this Agreement
without the prior written consent of both Deutsche Borse and NYSE Euronext,
including any changes as to the form or amount of the Offer Consideration, the
number of Deutsche Borse Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, any
changes to the conditions to the Offer or reduce the time period during which
the Offer shall remain open, or any changes to modify or amend any term of the
Offer in any manner that is adverse to either the holders of NYSE Euronext
Shares or the holders of Deutsche Borse Shares. The parties understand and
agree that, pursuant to Section 21 of the Takeover Act, a waiver or amendment
of any of the Offer Conditions generally is only permitted until the end of
the working day prior to the expiration date as published in the Tender Offer
Prospectus.

 



-6-  (i) _Closing of the Offer_. Provided that this Agreement shall not have been
earlier terminated in accordance with Article IX, and subject to the prior
satisfaction or waiver of the Offer Conditions, Holdco shall promptly
consummate the Offer in accordance with its terms and applicable Law, and
accept for exchange, and exchange, all Deutsche Borse Shares validly tendered
and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the time that Holdco accepts for
exchange, and exchanges, all of the Deutsche Borse Shares validly tendered and
not withdrawn, the " _Acceptance Time_ ").

(j) _Subsequent Offering Period_. Following the Expiration Time and the
satisfaction or waiver by Holdco of the Offer Conditions, with the exception
of the Offer Conditions set forth in paragraphs I.(b), I.(c), I.(e), I.(f),
I.(g), II.(b) and/or III.(b) of Annex II, Holdco shall conduct a subsequent
offering period ( _weitere Annahmefrist_ ) for the Offer in accordance with
the Takeover Law, during which Holdco shall offer to acquire all remaining
outstanding Deutsche Borse Shares.

(k) _Withholding_. Holdco, Deutsche Borse and the Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the Offer Consideration otherwise
required to be delivered to any tendering holder of Deutsche Borse Shares
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or non-U.S. tax law.
To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by or on behalf of
Holdco, Deutsche Borse or the Escrow Agent, as the case may be, and paid over
to the applicable Governmental Entity, such deducted and withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of the Deutsche Borse Shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

Section 1.2. _Effect of the Offer on Deutsche B orse Stock Options_. Unless
NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse agree otherwise, and subject to applicable
Law, the Offer shall not include any offer to acquire any outstanding option
to purchase Deutsche Borse Shares, but, in accordance with the Takeover Act,
shall include an offer to purchase any Deutsche Borse Share that is purchased
or subscribed for as a result of the exercise of any such option prior to the
Expiration Time.

Section 1.3. _Cooperation to Transmit the Offer_. In connection with the
Offer, Deutsche Borse shall, to the extent consistent with applicable Law,
promptly furnish Holdco with such information and assistance as Holdco or its
agent(s) may reasonably request for the purpose of communicating the Offer to
the record and beneficial holders of Deutsche Borse Shares.

THE MERGER

 

Section 2.1. _Appointment of Escrow Agent_. As promptly as possible following
the date hereof, Holdco shall appoint a United States bank or trust company
or

 



-7-   other independent financial institution in the United States reasonably
satisfactory to Deutsche Borse and NYSE Euronext (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") to
act, among other things, as escrow agent and exchange agent for the Merger
and to deliver the Merger Consideration to former stockholders of NYSE
Euronext. NYSE Euronext and Holdco shall enter into an Escrow Agency Agreement
with the Escrow Agent (the " _Escrow Agency Agreement_ "), which agreement
shall set forth the duties, responsibilities and obligations of the Escrow
Agent consistent with the terms of this Agreement.

Section 2.2. _Shares of Merger Sub_ __. Merger Sub is a corporation
incorporated under the laws of Delaware and is a constituent company in the
Merger. Except as provided in or contemplated by the immediately following
sentence, Holdco owns 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub.
Solely to accommodate the transactions described in this Article II and
subject to the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agency Agreement, at least
one day prior to the Effective Time, Holdco shall cause the Escrow Agent to be
registered as Holdco s fiduciary (for the period prior to the Effective Time)
as the record holder of all of the issued and outstanding shares of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Shares_
").

Section 2.3. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware General
Corporation Law, as amended (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, the
Merger shall occur pursuant to which Merger Sub shall merge with and into
NYSE Euronext, with NYSE Euronext surviving the Merger (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ") and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
thereupon cease. The Surviving Corporation shall continue to exist under the
laws of the State of Delaware, with all its rights, privileges, immunities,
powers and franchises, unaffected by the Merger except as set forth in this
Article II. After the Merger, but subject to Section 2.6, the
Surviving Corporation shall be a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco. The
Merger shall have the effects specified in the DGCL.

Section 2.4. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd
Street, New York, New York 10019, on the date on which the Acceptance Time
shall occur, unless a later date or place is agreed to by NYSE Euronext and
Deutsche Borse (the " _Closing Date_ ").

Section 2.5. _Effective Time_.

(a) On the Closing Date, NYSE Euronext shall file a certificate of merger
relating to the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of
State of Delaware, in such form as is required by and executed and
acknowledged in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and
shall make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL.

(b) The Merger shall become effective at (i) the date and time on which the
Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware as
required to effect the Merger, or (ii) such subsequent date and time as NYSE
Euronext 

 



-8-   and Deutsche Borse shall agree and as shall be specified in the Certificate
of Merger (such time that the Merger shall become effective being the "
_Effective Time_ "). The parties agree to cause the Effective Time to occur
immediately after the Acceptance Time.

Section 2.6. _Merger Exchange_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement and the Escrow Agency Agreement, and in accordance with
provisions of Section 2:94b of the Dutch Civil Code, as soon as possible after
the Effective Time, on the Closing Date:

(a) The Escrow Agent, acting as exchange agent and solely for the account of
the former stockholders of NYSE Euronext, shall contribute, for the account
of the former stockholders of NYSE Euronext, all of the issued and outstanding
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation (" _Surviving Corporation Shares_ "), that were issued to the
Escrow Agent solely for the account and benefit of the former stockholders of
NYSE Euronext pursuant to Section 2.7(b) to Holdco as a contribution in kind (
_inbreng op aandelen anders dan in geld_ ).

(b) In consideration of the contribution pursuant to Section 2.6(a), Holdco
shall issue and deliver to the Escrow Agent solely for the account and
benefit of the former stockholders of NYSE Euronext, the maximum number of
Holdco Shares that has become issuable pursuant to Section 2.7(a)(i) for
delivery to the Merger Consideration recipients entitled thereto (such Holdco
Shares being the " _Exchange Fund_ "). At the Effective Time, the obligations
of Holdco and the Escrow Agent under Section 2.6 shall be unconditional.

 

Section 2.7. _Effect of the Merger on Shares_.

(a) As a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
of any capital stock of NYSE Euronext, Holdco, Deutsche Borse or Merger Sub,
at the Effective Time:

 

(i) each NYSE Euronext Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any NYSE Euronext Share owned directly by NYSE
Euronext or Merger Sub and in each case not held on behalf of third parties
(each, an " _Excluded Share_ ")) shall automatically be converted into the
right to receive 0.47 of a fully paid and non-assessable Holdco Share (such
number of a Holdco Share, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding NYSE Euronext Shares or Deutsche Borse Shares shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of
any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred,
then the Merger Consideration will be appropriately and proportionately
adjusted to provide to the holder of such NYSE Euronext Share the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;

 



-9-  (ii) each Excluded Share shall cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled and retired without payment of any consideration therefor and shall
cease to exist; and

(iii) each Merger Sub Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding, be canceled and retired.

 

(b) Immediately following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
issue to the Escrow Agent, solely for the account and benefit of the former
stockholders of NYSE Euronext, a number of Surviving Corporation Shares equal
to the total number of NYSE Euronext Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Merger.

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, no NYSE Euronext Shares shall remain
outstanding and all NYSE Euronext Shares shall be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist. Each entry in the records of NYSE Euronext or its
transfer agent formerly representing NYSE Euronext Shares (the " _Book-Entry
Interests_ ") shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and any distribution or dividend pursuant to Section 2.9(c).
From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of NYSE
Euronext Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Book-Entry Interests formerly
representing NYSE Euronext Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation
or the Escrow Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II.

(d) In accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, no appraisal rights shall be
available to holders of NYSE Euronext Shares in connection with the Merger.

 

Section 2.8. _Effect of the Merger on NYSE Euronext Stock Options and Awards_.

 

(a) Each option to purchase NYSE Euronext Shares (a " _NYSE Euronext Stock
Option_ ") granted under the employee and director stock plans of NYSE
Euronext (the " _NYSE Euronext Stock Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested,
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
represent a right to acquire NYSE Euronext Shares and shall be converted, at
the Effective Time, into a stock option to acquire Holdco Shares (a " _Holdco
Stock Option_ ") on substantially the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such NYSE Euronext Stock Option. The number of Holdco Shares
subject to each such Holdco Stock Option (rounded down to the nearest whole
share) shall be equal to the number of NYSE Euronext Shares subject to each
such NYSE Euronext Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Merger Consideration (as adjusted pursuant to Section
2.7(a)(i)), and such Holdco Stock Option shall have an exercise price per
share (rounded up to the nearest penny) equal to the per-share exercise price
applicable to such NYSE Euronext

 



-10-   Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Merger
Consideration (as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.7(a)(i)).

 

(b) At the Effective Time, subject to the last sentence of this Section
2.8(b), each restricted stock unit or deferred stock unit measured in NYSE
Euronext Shares (each, an " _NYSE Euronext Stock-Based Award_ "), whether
vested or unvested, which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to represent a restricted stock unit or deferred stock unit
with respect to NYSE Euronext Shares and shall be converted, at the Effective
Time, into a restricted stock unit or deferred stock unit denominated in
Holdco Shares (a " _Holdco Stock-Based Award_ ") on substantially the
same terms and conditions as were applicable under the NYSE Euronext Stock-
Based Awards. The number of Holdco Shares subject to each such Holdco Stock-
Based Award (rounded down to the nearest whole share) shall be equal to the
number of NYSE Euronext Shares subject to the NYSE Euronext Stock-Based Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Merger Consideration
(as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.7(a)(i)). All restricted stock units
granted under NYSE Euronexts Omnibus Incentive Plan or under NYSE Euronexts
2006 Stock Incentive Plan that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall (i) to the extent unvested, vest as of the Effective
Time, and (ii) be distributed as of the Effective Time; _provided_ that, with
respect to any such units that constitute deferred compensation within the
meaning of Section 409A of the Code, such distribution shall occur on the date
that it would occur under the applicable award agreement absent the
application of this Section 2.8(b)(ii).

(c) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Holdco shall deliver to
the holders of NYSE Euronext Stock Options and NYSE Euronext Stock-Based
Awards appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the
respective NYSE Euronext Stock Plans and agreements evidencing the grants of
such NYSE Euronext Stock Options and NYSE Euronext Stock-Based Awards and
stating that such NYSE Euronext Stock Options and NYSE Euronext Stock-Based
Awards and agreements have been assumed by Holdco and shall continue in effect
on substantially the same terms and conditions (but subject to the
adjustments required by this Section 2.8 after giving effect to the Merger and
the terms of the NYSE Euronext Stock Plans and the Escrow Agency Agreement).

 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, NYSE Euronext shall take all necessary action
for the adjustment of NYSE Euronext Stock Options and NYSE Euronext Stock-
Based Awards under this Section 2.8. Holdco shall reserve for issuance a
number of Holdco Shares at least equal to the number of Holdco Shares that
will be subject to Holdco Stock Options and Holdco Stock-Based Awards as
a result of the actions contemplated by this Section 2.8.

(e) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Holdco shall file a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form, or if Form S-8 is
not available, other appropriate forms) with respect to the Holdco Shares
subject to such Holdco Stock Options and Holdco Stock-Based Awards and shall
maintain the

 



-11-   effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as such Holdco Stock Options and Holdco Stock-Based
Awards remain outstanding.

Section 2.9. _Delivery of Merger Consideration_. 

(a) _Merger Transmittal Letter_. NYSE Euronext and Holdco shall cause
appropriate transmittal materials (the " _Merger Transmittal Letter_ ") to be
provided by the Escrow Agent to holders of record of NYSE Euronext Shares
(other than holders of Excluded Shares) as soon as practicable after the
Effective Time advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger and
the procedure for providing instructions to the Escrow Agent to effect the
transfer and cancellation of Book-Entry Interests in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. The Merger Transmittal Letter shall contain such other terms
and conditions as NYSE Euronext and Holdco may reasonably specify.

(b) _Merger Consideration_. After the Effective Time, and upon delivery to
the Escrow Agent of instructions authorizing transfer and cancellation of
Book-Entry Interests in accordance with the terms of the Merger Transmittal
Letter and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Escrow
Agent, the holder of such Book-Entry Interests shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor, and the Escrow Agent shall be required to deliver to each
such holder (subject to Section 2.9(f)), (i) the number of Holdco Shares in
respect of the aggregate Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 2.7 (after taking into account all NYSE Euronext
Shares then held by such holder), and (ii) any cash in lieu of
fractional shares which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 2.9(d) and in respect of any dividends or other distributions which
the holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.9(c). The Book-Entry
Interests that are the subject of such authorization shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon such
transfer and cancellation of any Book-Entry Interests. The Holdco Shares
issued and paid in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.9(b) upon
conversion of any NYSE Euronext Shares (including any cash paid in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.09(d)) shall be deemed to have been
issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such NYSE
Euronext Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of any NYSE Euronext
Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of NYSE Euronext, the
proper number of Holdco Shares may be transferred by the Escrow Agent to such
a transferee if written instructions authorizing the transfer of the Book-
Entry Interests are presented to the Escrow Agent, in any case, accompanied by
all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence
that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. If any Holdco Shares
are to be delivered to a Person other than the holder in whose name any Book-
Entry Interests are registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that
the Person requesting such delivery shall pay any transfer or other similar
Taxes required by reason of the transfer of Holdco Shares to a Person other
than the registered holder of any Book-Entry Interests, or shall establish to
the satisfaction of Holdco or the Escrow Agent that such Tax has been paid or
is not applicable. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ "
means any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or
limited partnership, limited 

 



-12-   liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization,
Governmental Entity or Self-Regulatory Organization or other entity of any
kind or nature. " _Self-Regulatory Organization_ " means any U.S. or non-U.S.
commission, board, agency or body that is not a Governmental Entity but is
charged with the supervision or regulation of brokers, dealers, securities
underwriting or trading, stock exchanges, commodities exchanges, electronic
communication networks, insurance companies or agents, investment companies or
investment advisers.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares; Voting_. All Holdco
Shares to be transferred to the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 2.6(b) shall
be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever a
dividend or other distribution is declared by Holdco in respect of Holdco
Shares, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that
declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all
Holdco Shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other
distributions in respect of the Holdco Shares shall be paid to any holder of
any Book-Entry Interests until the instructions for transfer and
cancellation provided in this Article II and in accordance with the terms of
the Merger Transmittal Letter, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 2.9(b), have been delivered
to the Escrow Agent. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following
delivery to the Escrow Agent of such instructions with respect to Book-Entry
Interests, there shall be issued to the holder of Holdco Shares issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at the time of such surrender or
delivery of such instructions, the dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such
Holdco Shares and not paid and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the
dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such Holdco Shares
with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent
to surrender.

 

(d) _Fractional Shares_. No fractional Holdco Shares will be issued in the
Merger to any holder of NYSE Euronext Shares. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, each holder of NYSE Euronext Shares converted
pursuant to Section 2.7(a) who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Holdco Shares shall receive from the Escrow Agent, in
lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount representing such holders
proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale by the Escrow Agent
on behalf of all such holders of Holdco Shares which would otherwise
be issued (the " _Excess Merger Shares_ "). The sale of the Excess Merger
Shares by the Escrow Agent shall be executed on the New York Stock Exchange
and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, through one or more member firms of the New
York Stock Exchange and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, as the case may be, and
shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until the net
proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to such holders of NYSE
Euronext Shares, the Escrow Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for such
holders (the " _Fractional Interests Trust_ "). Holdco shall pay all
commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs incurred
in connection with such sale of the Excess Merger Shares. The Escrow Agent
shall determine the portion of the Fractional Interests Trust to which each
holder of NYSE Euronext Shares shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying

 



-13-   the amount of the aggregate net proceeds comprising the Fractional Interests
Trust by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of fractional
interests to which such holder of NYSE Euronext Shares is entitled and the
denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional interests to which
all holders of NYSE Euronext Shares are entitled. As soon as practicable after
the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of
NYSE Euronext Shares in lieu of fractional interests, the Escrow Agent shall
make available such amounts to such holders of NYSE Euronext Shares. Any such
sale shall be made within ten business days or such shorter period as may be
required by applicable Law after the Effective Time.

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Holdco, the Surviving Corporation and the
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable
pursuant to this Article II to any Person who was a holder of NYSE Euronext
Shares, NYSE Euronext Stock Options or NYSE Euronext Stock-Based
Awards immediately prior to the Effective Time, such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any provision of state, local or non-U.S. tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by or on behalf of Holdco,
the Surviving Corporation or the Escrow Agent, as the case may be, and paid
over to the relevant Governmental Entity, such deducted and withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of the NYSE Euronext Shares, NYSE Euronext Stock Options or NYSE
Euronext Stock-Based Awards, as the case may be, in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund and Fractional Interests Trust_. Any portion
of the Exchange Fund and Fractional Interests Trust that remains unclaimed by
the former stockholders of NYSE Euronext for 180 days after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Holdco. Any former stockholders of NYSE Euronext who
have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only
to Holdco for delivery of any Holdco Shares or Fractional Interests Trust of
such stockholders and payment of any dividends and other distributions in
respect of Holdco Shares of such stockholders payable and/or issuable pursuant
to this Article II upon delivery to the Escrow Agent of written instructions
for the transfer and cancellation of any Book-Entry Interests, in each case,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Holdco,
NYSE Euronext, Deutsche Borse, Merger Sub, the Escrow Agent or any other
Person shall be liable to any former holder of NYSE Euronext Shares for any
amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. 

Section 2.10. _Restructuring of the Merger_. The parties hereby agree and
acknowledge that, with the prior consent of Deutsche Borse, NYSE Euronext may
restructure the Merger; _provided_ that such restructuring shall not (i)
reduce or change the form of the Merger Consideration, (ii) materially delay
or prevent consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(iii) prevent or materially impede the qualification of the Merger as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and/or the
qualification of the Merger and the Offer, taken together, as a transaction

 



-14-   described in Section 351(a) of the Code, or (iv) prevent or materially
impede the qualification of the Offer and/or the Merger and the Offer, taken
together, as a transaction described in Section 351(a) of the Code.

ARTICLE III

POST-CLOSING REORGANIZATION

Section 3.1. _Post-Closing Reorganization_.

(a) Holdco intends, simultaneously with or as soon as practicable after the
Closing, to effectuate one or more corporate reorganization transactions (the
" _Post-Closing Reorganization_ ") intended to achieve legal and operational
integration of Deutsche Borse with Holdco and its Subsidiaries to the greatest
extent permitted by applicable Laws.

(b) The Post-Closing Reorganization may include any of the following, each of
which has been or will be, to the extent required, approved in principle by
the Deutsche Borse Boards:

(i) if 95% or more of the outstanding Deutsche Borse Shares shall have been
acquired by Holdco, Holdco may (A) commence a mandatory buy-out of the
Deutsche Borse Shares from any remaining holders thereof by way of a squeeze-
out transaction pursuant to Section 327a _et seq._ of the German Stock
Corporation Act ( _Aktiengesetz_ ) (the " _Stock Corporation Act_ ") or by
applying for a court order in accordance with Sections 39a _et seq._ of the
Takeover Act and (B) enter into a domination agreement (
_Beherrschungsvertrag_ ) and/or, at the election of Holdco, a combination of a
domination agreement ( _Beherrschungsvertrag_ ) and a profit transfer
agreement ( _Gewinnabf uhrungsvertrag_), in each case pursuant to Sections
291 _et seq_. of the Stock Corporation Act with Deutsche Borse as the
controlled company and with Holdco Shares offered to the outside Deutsche
Borse shareholders as consideration ( _Abfindung_ ) pursuant to Section 305
para. 2 of the Stock Corporation Act; and

(ii) if less than 95% of the outstanding Deutsche Borse Shares shall have
been acquired by Holdco, Holdco may enter into a domination agreement (
_Beherrschungsvertrag_ ) and/or, at the election of Holdco, a combination of a
domination agreement ( _Beherrschungsvertrag_ ) and a profit transfer
agreement ( _Gewinnabf uhrungsvertrag_), in each case pursuant to Sections 291
_et seq_. of the Stock Corporation Act with Deutsche Borse as the controlled
company and with Holdco Shares offered to the outside Deutsche Borse
shareholders as consideration ( _Abfindung_ ) pursuant to Section 305 para. 2
of the Stock Corporation Act;

_provided_ that, in each case, the Post-Closing Reorganization shall be
structured with the goal of providing holders of Deutsche Borse Shares who do
not exchange their Deutsche Borse Shares in the Offer with the same number of
Holdco Share(s) per Deutsche Borse

 



-15-   Share or consideration having the same value (without taking into account
the different tax treatment or withholding requirements that may apply) that
such holders would have received in the Offer had such holder tendered its
Deutsche Borse Shares in the Offer (it being understood that, in the Post-
Closing Reorganization, holders of Deutsche Borse Shares may under certain
circumstances receive a different amount or form of consideration than they
would have received in the Offer). If Holdco shall determine to enter into a
domination agreement and/or into a combination of a domination agreement and a
profit transfer agreement pursuant to the foregoing sentence, Deutsche Borse
agrees that it shall enter into such domination agreement and/or, subject to
tax, legal, regulatory and operational consideration, enter into such
combination of a domination agreement and a profit transfer agreement, in
each case in accordance with Sections 291 _et seq_. of the Stock Corporation
Act.

(c) Holdco shall have the right to change the structure of the Post-Closing
Reorganization (including to determine whether the domination agreement and/or
the profit transfer agreement shall be entered into with Deutsche Borse as the
controlled company by a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco
in the legal form of a German stock corporation or a German _societas
europaea_ (SE) instead of by Holdco); _provided_ , _however_ , that it shall
be effectuated in accordance with applicable Law and, if the domination
agreement is entered into with Deutsche Borse as the controlled company by a
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco in the legal form of a
German stock corporation or a German _societas europaea_ (SE) instead of
by Holdco, an additional domination agreement shall be entered into with such
German stock corporation or German _societas europaea_ (SE) as controlled
company by Holdco. Holdco, NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse shall cooperate
with each other in identifying and obtaining any tax or other governmental
clearances necessary or desirable in connection with the Post-Closing
Reorganization.

Section 3.2. _Cooperation of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche B orse_. Except to the
extent prohibited by applicable Law or contrary to the requirements of any
Regulatory Authority or other Governmental Entity, NYSE Euronext and Deutsche
Borse shall take, on or after the date of this Agreement, all actions
reasonably necessary or desirable to accomplish the Post-Closing
Reorganization, including if requested by Holdco such actions as may be
required for Holdco and Deutsche Borse to enter into a domination agreement
and/or a combination of a domination agreement and a profit transfer
agreement; _provided_ that the Post-Closing Reorganization shall not be
required to be effective prior to the Effective Time.

GOVERNING DOCUMENTS AND FUTURE STRUCTURE AND BUSINESS MODEL

OF HOLDCO GROUP 

Section 4.1. _Articles of Association, Rules for the Board of Directors and
Rules for the Global Executive Committee; Organizational Documents of
Subsidiaries of Holdco_.

(a) _Articles of Association, Rules for the Board of Directors and Rules for
the Global Executive Committee_. Subject to any required approval of the SEC
and any Regulatory Authority, prior to the Effective Time, the sole
stockholder(s) of Holdco shall (i) adopt the Articles of Association of Holdco
by notarial deed, substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_
(the " _Holdco Articles of Association_ "), and (ii) cause the Holdco Board to
adopt the Rules for the Board of Directors of Holdco, substantially in
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Holdco Rules for the Board of
Directors_ ") and the Rules for the Global Executive Committee of Holdco,
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (the " _Rules for
the Global Executive Committee_ "), in each case to be in effect as of the
Effective Time, or prior to the Effective Time if mutually agreed by NYSE
Euronext and Deutsche Borse. If, in connection with providing approval of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the SEC, any Regulatory
Authority or other Governmental Entity with jurisdiction in connection with
obtaining any required approval for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or otherwise requires an amendment or modification to (1) the form
of Holdco Articles of Association, (2) the form of Holdco Rules for the Board
of Directors, (3) the form of Rules for the Global Executive Committee, (4)
the form of Governance Resolutions or (5) the governance structure of the
Holdco and its Subsidiaries (together, the " _Holdco Group_ ") contemplated by
this Agreement to be in effect as of the Effective Time ((1) through (5),
taken together, the " _Corporate Governance Structure_ "), then NYSE
Euronext, Deutsche Borse and Holdco agree to amend or modify such forms or
governance structure in a way that comes as close as possible to the balance
of the Corporate Governance Structure contemplated by this Agreement as of
the date hereof, including the balance of powers and responsibilities between
the Chairman of the Holdco Group and the Chief Executive Officer of the Holdco
Group; _provided_ that neither NYSE Euronext nor Deutsche Borse shall be
obligated to agree to any such amendment or modification (and, in such case,
Holdco shall not implement any amendment) if such amendment or modification
would significantly change the balance of the Corporate Governance Structure
contemplated by this Agreement as of the date hereof, including the balance of
powers and responsibilities between the Chairman of the Holdco Group and the
Chief Executive Officer of the Holdco Group. The parties acknowledge and
agree that neither of the following (either alone or together) shall be
considered to significantly change the balance of the Corporate Governance
Structure (a) any requirement to adopt the restrictions, resolutions
or provisions in the governing documents of Holdco or its Subsidiaries
similar to those described in the proposed rule change (Release No. 34-56733;
File No. SR-ISE-2007-101) filed by the International Securities Exchange, LLC
in connection with its acquisition by Eurex Frankfurt AG

jurisdiction, books and records, notification, cooperation, compliance with
U.S. federal securities laws, confidentiality, preservation of independence
of self-regulatory functions, directors considerations of effect of actions
on ability of exchange to carry out responsibilities under the Exchange Act
and the implementation of a Delaware trust); and (b) any requirement to
preserve the Delaware trust and the Dutch foundation that currently exists for
NYSE Euronext. The parties are in agreement and have been advised by their
respective Dutch legal advisors that the powers and responsibilities of
the Chairman of the Holdco Group and the Chief Executive Officer of the
Holdco Group contemplated by the Holdco Articles of Association and the Holdco
Rules for the Board of Directors comply, as of the date hereof, with
applicable Dutch Law in effect as of the date hereof (it being acknowledged
that certain of such powers and responsibilities do not conform to the Dutch
Corporate Governance Code and therefore the deviations must be disclosed and
explained in Holdcos annual accounts) and the rules in the current draft
legislation set forth in Bill 31 763 ( _Bestuur en toezicht_ ), presently
before the First Chamber of Dutch Parliament. " _Regulatory Authorities_ "

Section 4.2. _Future Structure and Business Model of the Holdco Group_.
Subject to the legal power of the Holdco Board, the Executive Committee of
Holdco or the shareholders of Holdco to determine otherwise, Holdco and Holdco
Group shall have the following characteristics as of and after the Effective
Time:

 

(a) _Legal Structure of Holdco Group._ Holdco, having its legal seat in
Amsterdam, The Netherlands, shall, following the consummation of the Offer
and the Merger, serve as a holding company for the combined businesses of
Deutsche Borse and NYSE Euronext. In order to comply with regulatory
requirements and other applicable Laws and to ensure close proximity
to customers, there shall continue to be a separate operational subsidiary
legal entity in each of the different countries where Deutsche Borse and NYSE
Euronext operate securities exchanges ( _i.e._ , the United States, Germany,
Belgium, France, The Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Portugal). NYSE
Euronext and Deutsche Borse will review the organizational structure of the
Holdco Group with a view to organizing it in such a way that, in the medium
term, all European businesses and assets of the Holdco Group are held
directly or indirectly by a

 



-19-   European legal entity and all U.S. businesses and assets are held directly
or indirectly by a U.S. legal entity, taking into account and subject to tax,
regulatory and operational considerations. NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse
intend to appoint two regional coordinators for the European and the U.S.
businesses of Holdco Group, with a view to regional coordination in relation
to regulatory matters. The divisional structure of Holdco Group and the
responsibilities of the divisional heads for their respective divisions shall
not be affected thereby.

(b)  _Trading Platforms_. NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse shall decide,
after the Effective Time and in accordance with any regulatory requirements,
to harmonize the trading platforms of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse.
Subject to further review by the parties, the parties intend to migrate:

(i) to two platforms, one for the combined cash business and one for the
combined derivatives business of the Holdco Group. In the case of a migration
to two platforms, it is the intention of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse
that, subject to further review of the parties, one of those platforms will
be a platform currently used by NYSE Euronext, and the other will be a
platform currently used by Deutsche Borse; and/or

(ii) to one single platform for both cash and derivatives businesses of the
Holdco Group in the medium term;

_provided_ that any such migration shall be consistent with the primary goals
of maximizing synergies and creating an efficient market place for customers.

 

(c) _Divisional Structure of Holdco Group_. The Holdco Group shall have five
global divisions with the following locations: 

(i) Global Cash Trading and Listings with a Global Hub in New York and key
locations in the following locations (in alphabetical order): Amsterdam,
Brussels, Frankfurt, Lisbon and Paris;

(ii) Global Derivatives with a Global Hub in Frankfurt and key locations in
the following locations (in alphabetical order): Amsterdam, Chicago, London,
New York and Zurich;

(iii) Global Settlement and Custody with a Global Hub in Frankfurt and key
locations in the following locations (in alphabetical order): Luxembourg, New
York, Porto, Prague and Singapore, and with the office of the divisional head
for this division located in Luxembourg;

(iv) Technology Services/IT with a Global Hub in New York and a key location
in the following locations (in alphabetical order): Belfast, Frankfurt,

head for this division located in Paris; and

 



-20-  (v) Market Data and Analytics with a Global Hub in Frankfurt and
key locations in the following locations (in alphabetical order): London, New
York, Paris and Zurich.

The " _Global Hub_ " of a global division of the Holdco Group shall mean the
location from where such global division is managed. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Holdco Board and the sole shareholder of Holdco shall approve and
adopt resolutions substantially in the form attached hereto as _Schedule I_ ,
which, among other things, contemplate the locations of the global divisions
of the Holdco Group as set out in this Section 4.2(c). For the divisions, the
best existing names and brands by product or market shall be used.

(d) _European Equities Businesses of Holdco Group_. The European equities
businesses of Holdco Group expects to run its five markets (Amsterdam,
Brussels, Frankfurt, Lisbon and Paris) on the same trading technology
platform. This business will be led by the current Head of the European Cash
Markets of NYSE Euronext, and the deputy of this business will be a person
designated by Deutsche Borse. As has been the case, all five stock exchanges
will remain independently operated as listing venues/market undertakings, but
will share the same technology platform. Subsequent leaders of this business
will run the European equities business from the domicile of the cash market
which they operate.

(e) _Inclusion of Holdco Shares in Indices_. Prior to the Effective Time,
NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to seek the continued inclusion after the Effective Time of the Holdco
Shares in the DAX30, EuroStoxx50 and SandP500 indices.

(f) _Rating for Holdco_. Prior to the Effective Time, NYSE Euronext and
Deutsche Borse shall use their respective reasonable best efforts so that,
after the Effective Time, Holdco shall receive an "AA" rating from the rating
agencies of SandP or Fitch or an equivalent rating at one or several other
rating agencies.

Section 4.3. _Availability of FPI-Status for Holdco_. It is the parties
understanding that the status of a foreign private issuer (" _FPI-Status_ ")
as defined by Rule 3b-4 under the Exchange Act should be available to Holdco
until the Effective Time and that the parties will make use of this
availability until such time and shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cooperate and agree on any necessary measures in order to ensure that the
structure of Holdco allows it all times prior to the Effective Time to
maintain FPI-Status.

-40-   the case of Deutsche Borse, prior to the Expiration Time, engage in any
discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information or data to, any
Person in response to an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
by any such Person, if and only to the extent that, (i) in the case of clause
(B) above, (x) if such Change in NYSE Euronext Recommendation or Change in
Deutsche Borse Recommendation is made in response to an Acquisition Proposal
for NYSE Euronext or Deutsche Borse, respectively, then such Acquisition
Proposal shall have been an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
from a third party that the Board of Directors of NYSE Euronext or the
Deutsche Borse Boards, respectively, concludes in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors)
constitutes a Superior Proposal or (y) if such Change in NYSE Euronext
Recommendation or Change in Deutsche Borse Recommendation is not made in
response to an Acquisition Proposal for NYSE Euronext or Deutsche Borse, then
the Board of Directors of NYSE Euronext or the Deutsche Borse Boards, as the
case may be, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, determines in
good faith that the failure to make such Change in NYSE Euronext
Recommendation or Change in Deutsche Borse Recommendation, as the case may be,
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (ii) in
the case of clause (C) above, (1) its Board concludes in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that there
is a reasonable likelihood that such Acquisition Proposal could constitute a
Superior Proposal, and that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (2) prior to
providing any information or data to any Person in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal by any such Person, its Board receives from such Person
an executed confidentiality agreement with confidentiality terms no less
restrictive, in the aggregate, than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, and (3) such party is not then in material breach of its
obligations under this Section 7.2 related to such Acquisition Proposal. For
purposes of this Section 7.2(c), references to " _Board_ " means, in relation
to NYSE Euronext, the Board of Directors of NYSE Euronext and, in relation to

provide Deutsche Borse with a written notice (the " _NYSE Euronext Change in
Recommendation Notice_ ") of NYSE Euronexts intention to make a Change in
NYSE Euronext Recommendation at least five business days prior to making a
Change in NYSE Euronext Recommendation, and, in the case of any Change in
NYSE Euronext Recommendation in connection with an Acquisition Proposal for
NYSE Euronext, NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse shall negotiate in good faith
during such five Business Day period with respect to any modifications to the
terms of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement that are proposed by
Deutsche Borse, and NYSE Euronext shall consider any such modifications agreed
by Deutsche Borse in determining whether such Acquisition Proposal still
constitutes a Superior Proposal for NYSE Euronext after such five-Business Day
period. Prior to any Change in Deutsche Borse Recommendation, Deutsche Borse
shall provide NYSE Euronext written notice (the " _Deutsche B orse Change in
Recommendation Notice_") of Deutsche Borses intention to make a Change in
Deutsche Borse Recommendation at least five business days prior to making a
Change in Deutsche Borse Recommendation, and, in the case of any Change in
Deutsche Borse Recommendation in connection with an Acquisition Proposal for
Deutsche Borse, NYSE

 



-41-   Euronext and Deutsche Borse shall negotiate in good faith during such five
Business Day period with respect to any modifications to the terms of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement that are proposed by NYSE
Euronext, and Deutsche Borse shall consider any such modifications agreed by
NYSE Euronext in determining whether such Acquisition Proposal still
constitutes a Superior Proposal for Deutsche Borse after such five-Business
Day period.

(e) In the event that a third party who has previously made an Acquisition
Proposal that the Board of Directors of NYSE Euronext or either of the
Deutsche Borse Boards, as the case may be, has or have determined in
accordance with this Section 7.2 is a Superior Proposal subsequently modifies
or amends in an adverse manner any material term of such Superior Proposal
such that the Acquisition Proposal is no longer a Superior Proposal, then such
Boards prior determination shall be null and void and such Board shall be
subject to the provisions of Section 7.2(c) and (d) in all respects
(including the obligation to deliver a new NYSE Euronext Change in
Recommendation Notice or Deutsche Borse Change in Recommendation Notice, as
applicable, and negotiate in good faith with Deutsche Borse or NYSE Euronext,
as applicable; _provided_ that references to "five business days" or "five-
business day period" shall thereafter be references to "three business days"
or "three-business day period"). 

(f) Except as ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction or by shareholder
action, each of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse agrees that it will, and
will cause its senior officers, directors and representatives and its
Subsidiaries and such Subsidiaries senior officers, directors and
representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any activities, discussions or negotiations existing as of the date of this
Agreement with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any

to terminate this Agreement (except as specifically provided in Article IX
hereof) or (y) affect any other obligation of Deutsche Borse or NYSE Euronext
under this Agreement, except as otherwise expressly set forth in this
Agreement. Unless this Agreement shall have been earlier terminated and
except as ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction or by shareholder
action, neither Deutsche Borse nor NYSE Euronext shall submit to the vote of
its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal (other than the Offer or the
Merger).

" _Superior Proposal_ " means, with respect to NYSE Euronext or Deutsche
Borse, a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal obtained not in breach of this
Section 7.2 for or in respect of 50% or more of the outstanding NYSE Euronext
Shares or Deutsche Borse Shares (as applicable) or 50% or more of the assets
of NYSE Euronext and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, or Deutsche
Borse and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, as applicable, in each
case on terms that the Board of Directors of NYSE Euronext or the
Deutsche Borse Boards, as applicable, in good faith concludes (following
receipt of the advice of its financial advisors and outside legal counsel),
taking into account, among other things, all

 



-42-   legal, financial, regulatory, timing and other aspects of the Acquisition
Proposal or offer and this Agreement, and taking into account any improved
terms that Deutsche Borse (in the case of an Acquisition Proposal for NYSE
Euronext) or NYSE Euronext (in the case of an Acquisition Proposal for
Deutsche Borse) may have offered pursuant to this Section 7.2 deemed relevant
by such Board or Boards (including conditions to and expected timing and
risks of consummation and the ability of the party making such proposal to
obtain financing for such Acquisition Proposal) are more favorable to the
stockholders of NYSE Euronext or Deutsche Borse, as applicable, than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after taking into account
any such improved terms).

Section 7.3.  _Stockholders Meeting; Offer Recommendation_.

(a) NYSE Euronext will take, in accordance with applicable Law and the NYSE
Euronext Organizational Documents, all action necessary to convene a meeting
of its stockholders (the " _NYSE Euronext Stockholders Meeting_ ") the day
prior to the date of the scheduled Expiration Time (the " _NYSE
Euronext Meeting Date_ "), which date shall be after the Registration
Statement is declared effective; _provided_ that NYSE Euronext may adjourn or
postpone the NYSE Euronext Stockholders Meeting for up to two weeks in the
event that the acceptance period for the Offer is extended by two weeks. The
Board of Directors of NYSE Euronext shall make the NYSE Euronext
Recommendation and include the NYSE Euronext Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. In the event that on or subsequent to the date hereof
and prior to the NYSE Euronext Stockholders Meeting (including any adjournment
thereof), the Board of Directors of NYSE Euronext determines either to make no
recommendation for the Merger, or to withdraw, modify or qualify its
recommendation for the Merger in a manner that is adverse to Deutsche Borse or
Holdco (such determination not to make a recommendation or any such
withdrawal, modification or qualification, a " _Change in NYSE
Euronext Recommendation_ "), which Change in NYSE Euronext Recommendation
shall be made only in accordance with Section 7.2(c), then Deutsche Borse
shall have a right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with 9.4(a). Any
Change in NYSE Euronext Recommendation shall not limit or modify the
obligation of NYSE Euronext to present this Agreement for adoption at the NYSE
Euronext Stockholders Meeting prior to the date of the scheduled Expiration
Time, and, if this Agreement is not otherwise terminated by either NYSE
Euronext or Deutsche Borse in accordance with the terms hereof, this Agreement
shall be submitted to the stockholders of NYSE Euronext at the NYSE Euronext
Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of voting on adopting this Agreement.

(b) Each of the Deutsche Borse Boards has determined that, subject to its
duties under applicable Law, it will recommend, in its statement on the Offer
under Section 27 of the Takeover Act, that the Deutsche Borse shareholders
accept the Offer and tender their Deutsche Borse Shares in the Offer. In the
event that on or after the date hereof and prior to the Expiration Time,
either of the Deutsche Borse Boards fails to recommend, in its statement on
the Offer under Section 27 of the Takeover Act, that the Deutsche Borse
shareholders accept the Offer and tender their Deutsche Borse

 



-43-   Shares in the Offer, or, after such recommendation, withdraws, modifies or
qualifies such recommendation in a manner that is adverse to NYSE Euronext or
Holdco (such failure to make such recommendation or any such withdrawal,
modification or qualification, a " _Change in Deutsche B orse
Recommendation_"), which Change in Deutsche Borse Recommendation shall be made
only in accordance with Section 7.2(c), then NYSE Euronext shall have a right
to terminate this Agreement in accordance with 9.3(a). Any Change in Deutsche
Borse Recommendation shall not limit or modify the obligation of Deutsche
Borses representative to Holdco Board to consent, to Holdcos commencement,
continuation and completion of the Offer in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and, if this Agreement is not otherwise terminated by either NYSE
Euronext or Deutsche Borse in accordance with the terms hereof, Holdco shall
be obligated to commence, continue and complete the Offer in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement (and Deutsche Borse agrees to consent to such
actions by Holdco).

(a) _Reasonable Best Efforts; Regulatory Filings_. Holdco, NYSE Euronext and
Deutsche Borse shall cooperate with each other and use (and shall cause their

the Merger) as soon as practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly
as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and
other filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents,
registrations, approvals, authorizations and other Permits (including all

under the Exon-Florio Amendment, and from the SEC and the Regulatory
Authorities) (collectively, " _Consents_ ") necessary or advisable to be
obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity or Self-
Regulatory Organization (if any) in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; it being understood that, to the
extent legally by applicable Law, neither of the Deutsche Borse Boards nor the
NYSE Euronext Board shall take any action that could prevent the consummation
of the Offer or the Merger, except as otherwise permitted under this
Agreement. Nothing in this Section 7.4 shall require, or be construed to
require, Holdco, NYSE Euronext or Deutsche Borse to (A) proffer to, or agree
to, sell or hold separate and agree to sell, or take any other action with
respect to, before or after the Effective Time, any assets, businesses, or
interests in any assets or businesses of Holdco, NYSE Euronext, Deutsche Borse
or any of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates (or to consent to any
sale, or agreement to sell, by Holdco, NYSE Euronext or Deutsche Borse or any
of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates, as the case may be, of any of
its assets or businesses), if such action would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Substantial Detriment to NYSE
Euronext, Deutsche Borse or Holdco or (B) agree to any changes or restriction
in the 

 



-44-   market or regulatory structure of Holdco, NYSE Euronext or Deutsche Borse or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates or in any of their
respective operations of any such assets or businesses, if such changes or
restrictions would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to result in a Substantial Detriment to NYSE Euronext, Deutsche Borse or
Holdco. Subject to applicable Law and the instructions of any Governmental
Entity, Holdco, NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse shall keep each other
apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the

respective Subsidiaries, from or to any Governmental Entity with respect to
such transactions.

adverse effect on (A) the business, continuing results of operations or
financial condition of such Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or

as a whole, to operate consistently with past practice or as reasonably
expected to be operated after the Effective Time, including with respect to
operating the markets that they currently operate and the amounts and types
of products listed, traded or otherwise made available in such markets. It is
understood that a Substantial Detriment shall be deemed to exist with respect
to any action requiring Holdco, NYSE Euronext or Deutsche Borse, before or
after the Effective Time, (i) to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of,
or to agree to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of, assets, businesses
or subsidiaries, or (ii) to take or refrain from taking, or to agree to take
or to refrain from taking, any actions that, in each of cases (i) and (ii),
would reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to materially
impair the value of the combined businesses of NYSE Euronext and
Deutsche Borse after the Effective Time (taking into account the parties
contemplated plans for combining such businesses after the Effective Time and
any value which is reasonably expected to be realized in connection with such
combination or integration) such that either of the parties would not
reasonably have decided to enter into the transaction in light of the
anticipated economics of the transaction.

(b) _Market and Regulatory Structure Matters_. Unless otherwise required by
fiduciary obligations under applicable Law, the Board of Directors of NYSE
Euronext and the Deutsche Borse Boards shall each consider and make such
determination with respect to the other party, its Related Persons (as defined

Deutsche Borse and NYSE Euronext are Related Persons, as required by any
Governmental Entity and, in the case of NYSE Euronext, any Self-Regulatory
Organization whose consent is required for the consummation of the Merger.
NYSE Euronext and its Board of Directors and Deutsche Borse and the Deutsche
Borse Boards shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to provide
such information to the SEC, the Regulatory Authorities and any other
Governmental Entity as is required with respect to the consideration by the
SEC, the Regulatory Authorities and any other Governmental

any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the completion of the
Offer and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

notices or other communications received by NYSE Euronext or Deutsche Borse,
as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from any third

applicable), with respect to such transactions. NYSE Euronext and Deutsche
Borse each shall give prompt notice to the other of any change that is
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on NYSE Euronext or a
Material Adverse Effect on Deutsche Borse, respectively, or to result in a
Substantial Detriment to NYSE Euronext or Deutsche Borse.

Effective Time, to its properties, books, contracts and records and, during
such period, each shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly

that the foregoing shall not require NYSE Euronext or Deutsche Borse (i) to
permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable
judgment of NYSE Euronext or Deutsche Borse, as the case may be, would result
in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any of its
obligations with respect to confidentiality if NYSE Euronext or Deutsche
Borse, as the case may be, shall have used reasonable best efforts to obtain
the consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure, (ii) to
disclose any privileged information of NYSE Euronext or Deutsche Borse, as the

or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement
by NYSE Euronext pursuant to the NYSE Euronext Organizational Documents, NYSE
Euronext Subsidiary Organizational Documents and indemnification agreements,
if any, in existence on the date hereof with any directors, officers and
employees of NYSE Euronext and its Subsidiaries and (B) without limitation to

to be maintained in effect in Holdcos (or any successors) certificate of
incorporation and bylaws after the Effective Time, provisions regarding

and employees and advancement of expenses which are, in the aggregate, no
less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding
provisions contained in the current certificate of incorporation and
constitution of NYSE Euronext and (iii) cause to be maintained for a period of
six years after the Effective Time the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
NYSE Euronext (provided that Holdco (or any successor) may substitute therefor

terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the
insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on
or before the Effective Time;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall Holdco be required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 250%
of the annual premiums (such 250% amount, the " _Maximum NYSE Euronext
Insurance Amount_ ") currently paid by NYSE Euronext for such insurance; and,
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, Holdco shall be obligated to obtain a policy with
the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. Holdco
may, in lieu of maintaining the insurance described in clause (iii) of this
Section 7.10(a), purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on terms and 

 



-49-   conditions no less advantageous to the insured than the current directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained
by NYSE Euronext;  _provided_ that the amount paid by Holdco shall not exceed
six times the Maximum NYSE Euronext Insurance Amount. The obligations of
Holdco under this Section 7.10(a) shall not be terminated or modified in such
a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this Section 7.10(a)
applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly
agreed that the indemnitees to whom this Section 7.10(a) applies shall be
third-party beneficiaries of this Section 7.10(a)).

harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, all past and present

by Deutsche Borse pursuant to the Deutsche Borse Organizational Documents,
Deutsche Borse Subsidiary Organizational Documents and indemnification
agreements, if any, in existence on the date hereof with any directors,
officers and employees of Deutsche Borse and its Subsidiaries and (B) without
limitation to clause (A), to the fullest extent permitted by law, in each case
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including

certificate of incorporation and bylaws after the Effective Time, provisions
regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of officers,
directors and employees and advancement of expenses which are, in
the aggregate, no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the
corresponding provisions contained in the current certificate of incorporation
and bylaws of Deutsche Borse and (iii) cause to be maintained for a period of
six years after the Effective Time the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
Deutsche Borse (provided that Holdco (or any successor) may substitute
therefor one or more policies of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, no less
advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or before the Effective Time;  _provided_ , _however_
, that in no event shall Holdco be required to expend in any one year an
amount in excess of 250% of the annual premiums (such 250% amount, the "
_Maximum Deutsche B orse Insurance Amount_") currently paid by Deutsche Borse
for such insurance (which annual premiums are set forth in Section 7.10(b) of
the Deutsche Borse Disclosure Letter); and, _provided_ , _further_ , that if
the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Holdco
shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for
a cost not exceeding such amount. Holdco may, in lieu of maintaining the
insurance described in clause (iii) of Section 7.10(b), purchase a six-year
"tail" prepaid policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the
insured than the current directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance maintained by Deutsche Borse; _provided_ that
the amount paid by Holdco shall not exceed six times the Maximum Deutsche
Borse Insurance Amount. The obligations of Holdco under this Section 7.10(b)
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely

 



-50-   affect any indemnitee to whom this Section 7.10(b) applies without the
consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the
indemnitees to whom this Section 7.10(b) applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 7.10(b)).

Section 7.11. _Other Actions by NYSE Euronext and Deutsche B orse_.

(a) _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, NYSE Euronext
and Deutsche Borse shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of NYSE Euronext Shares (including derivative securities with
respect to NYSE Euronext Shares) or acquisitions of Holdco Shares (including
derivative securities with respect to Holdco Shares) resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject
to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with
respect to NYSE Euronext to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

(b) _Advice of Changes_. Until the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, (i) NYSE Euronext
shall promptly advise Deutsche Borse of any change or event that it believes
would or would reasonably be likely to cause or constitute a Material Adverse
Effect on NYSE Euronext; and (ii) Deutsche Borse shall promptly advise NYSE
Euronext of any change or event that it believes would or would reasonably be
likely to cause or constitute a Material Adverse Effect on Deutsche Borse;
_provided_ that failure to so promptly advise shall itself not constitute a
material breach or failure of a condition unless the underlying change or
event shall also constitute a material breach or failure.

 

(c) _Agreement to Tender._ Deutsche Borse agrees that as promptly as
practicable after the commencement of the Offer, and in any event no later
than 10 business days following the recommendation of the Offer by either of
the Deutsche Borse Boards, it shall tender into the Offer all of the Deutsche
Borse Treasury Shares (and any Deutsche Borse Shares acquired after the date
hereof) in accordance with the terms of the Tender Offer Prospectus, free and
clear of all liens and encumbrances. Deutsche Borse agrees that once the
Deutsche Borse Treasury Shares are tendered into the Offer, it shall not
withdraw the tender of such Deutsche Borse Treasury Shares unless the Offer
shall have been terminated or shall have expired, in each case, in accordance
with the terms of the Tender Offer Prospectus or in the case of a Change
in Recommendation.

Section 7.12. _Holdco Capital Increase_. Prior to the Effective Time, Holdco
shall take or cause to be taken all such steps as may be required for Holdco
to issue the Holdco Shares, Holdco Stock Options (and Holdco Shares underlying
such options) and the Holdco Stock-Based Awards (and Holdco Shares underlying
such awards) in respect of the Merger and the Offer (the " _Holdco Capital
Increase_ "), including the due preparation the of (i) shareholders
resolutions, (ii) instruments of issuance and (iii) descriptions of
contribution and receipt of accountants statements pursuant to section 2:94b
of the Dutch Civil Code confirming the valuation of the in-kind capital raise.

 



-51-  Section 7.13. _Employee Matters_

 

(a) For the one-year period beginning on the Effective Time (the " _Benefit
Continuation Period_ "), Holdco shall provide or cause to be provided to each
individual who is employed as of the Effective Time by NYSE Euronext and its
Subsidiaries or by Deutsche Borse and its Subsidiaries and who remains
employed by NYSE Euronext and its Subsidiaries or by Deutsche Borse and its
Subsidiaries (such employees collectively, the " _Affected Employees_ ") (i)
base salary in an amount no less than the base salary provided to the Affected
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) an annual bonus
opportunity that is no less favorable than the annual bonus opportunity
provided to the Affected Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
(iii) other compensation opportunities and employee benefits that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than those provided to the Affected Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, during the Benefit Continuation Period, (x) Holdco shall
provide to each Affected Employee who suffers a termination of employment by
Holdco and its Subsidiaries severance benefits in amounts and on terms and
conditions no less favorable in the aggregate to such Affected Employee than
such Affected Employee would have received under the severance plans,
programs, policies and arrangements applicable to such Affected Employee as of
the date hereof, and (y) defined contribution retirement plan benefits
provided to Affected Employees no less favorable to Affected Employees than
such benefits on the date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
provisions of this Section 7.13(a) shall not apply with respect to Affected
Employees whose employment is governed by a collective bargaining or similar
agreement.

(b) Prior to the end of the Benefit Continuation Period, Holdco shall review,
evaluate and analyze NYSE Euronext Benefit Plans and Deutsche Borse Benefit
Plans with a view towards developing appropriate new Benefit Plans for
Affected Employees. It is the intention of Deutsche Borse and NYSE Euronext,
to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, to develop new Benefit Plans, as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, which, among other
things, (A) treat similarly situated Affected Employees on a substantially
equivalent basis, taking into account all relevant factors, including duties,
geographic location, tenure, qualifications, and abilities, and (B) do not
discriminate between Affected Employees who were covered by NYSE Euronext
Benefit Plans, on the one hand, and those covered by Deutsche Borse Benefit
Plans, on the other, at the Effective Time.

(c) With respect to any Benefit Plans in which any Affected Employees first
become eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time, and in which
such Affected Employees did not participate prior to the Effective Time (the "
_New Plans_ "), Holdco shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries (subject to
applicable Law and applicable tax qualification requirements) to: (i) waive
all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Affected Employees
and their eligible dependents under any New Plans in which such Affected
Employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, except to
the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods 

 



-52-   would apply under the analogous NYSE Euronext Benefit Plan or Deutsche Borse
Benefit Plan, as the case may be; (ii) provide each Affected Employee and his
or her eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles
paid prior to the Effective Time under an NYSE Euronext Benefit Plan or
Deutsche Borse Benefit Plan (to the same extent that such credit was given
under the analogous NYSE Euronext Benefit Plan or Deutsche Borse Benefit
Plan, as applicable, prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any New Plans in which such
Affected Employee may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time for
the same plan year; and (iii) recognize all service of the Affected Employees
with NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse and their respective affiliates for all
purposes (including, purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting credit,
entitlement to benefits) in any New Plan in which such employees may be
eligible to participate after the Effective Time, including any severance
plan, to the extent such service is taken into account under the applicable
New Plan (to the extent recognized under the corresponding NYSE Euronext
Benefit Plan or Deutsche Borse Benefit Plan); provided that the foregoing
shall not apply for purposes of benefit accrual under final average pay
defined benefit plans or to the extent it would result in duplication of
benefits.

(d) Subject to Section 7.13(a), no provision of this Section 7.13 shall be
construed as a limitation on the right of Holdco and its Subsidiaries to amend
or terminate any specific NYSE Euronext Benefit Plan or Deutsche Borse Benefit
Plan that NYSE Euronext or Deutsche Borse would otherwise have under the
terms of such NYSE Euronext Benefit Plan or Deutsche Borse Benefit Plan, or
shall any provision of this Section 7.13 be construed to require the
continuation of the employment of any particular Affected Employee. The
provisions of this Section 7.13 are solely for the benefit of the parties to
this Agreement, and no current or former director, officer, employee or
independent contractor or any other person shall be a third-party beneficiary
of this Section 7.13 of this Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed
as an amendment to any Deutsche Borse Benefit Plan, NYSE Euronext Benefit Plan
or other compensation or benefit plan or arrangement for any purpose.

 

(e) NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse shall consult with each other in a good
faith and in a reasonably timely manner in advance of any material
communications with Affected Employees regarding the impact of the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement on the NYSE Euronext Benefit
Plans, Deutsche Borse Benefit Plans or the New Plans, as the case may be.

by such party in whole or in part to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

(b) NYSE Euronext shall waive the condition described in clause (i) of the
first sentence of paragraph II.(b) of Annex II in the event NYSE Euronext
shall have received an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to NYSE Euronext, on the basis of representations and warranties
set forth or referred to in such opinion, dated as of the date referred to in
Section 10.3(d) hereof, to the effect that the Merger will qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and/or the
Merger and the Offer, taken together, will qualify as an exchange within the
meaning of Section 351(a) of the Code. NYSE Euronext shall waive the condition
described in clause (ii) of the first sentence of paragraph II.(b) of Annex
II in the event NYSE Euronext shall have received an opinion of counsel, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to NYSE Euronext, on the basis of
representations and warranties set forth or referred to in such opinion,
dated as of the date referred to in Section 10.3(d) hereof, to the effect that
each transfer of NYSE Euronext stock to Holdco by a stockholder of NYSE
Euronext (other than a stockholder that is a "five percent
transferee shareholder" with respect to Holdco within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii)) pursuant to the Merger will not be
subject to Section 367(a)(1) of the Code. In rendering such opinions, such
counsel may require and shall be entitled to rely upon representations of
NYSE Euronext, Deutsche Borse and Holdco.

(c) Deutsche Borse shall waive the condition described in paragraph III.(b)
of Annex II in the event Deutsche Borse shall have received an opinion of
counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Deutsche Borse, on
the basis of representations and warranties set forth or referred to in such
opinion, dated as of the date referred to in Section 10.3(d) hereof, to the
effect that the Offer will qualify as a transaction described in Section 351
of the Code and/or the Offer and the Merger, taken together, will qualify as
transaction described in Section 351(a) of the Code. In rendering such
opinion, such counsel may require and shall be entitled to rely upon
representations of NYSE Euronext, Deutsche Borse and Holdco.

(d) To the extent the conditions described in paragraph II.(b) and paragraph
III.(b) of Annex II shall not have been satisfied or waived pursuant to
Section 10.3(b) or Section 10.3(c), as applicable, on or prior to the fourth
day prior to the date on which the Expiration Time is scheduled to occur (or
such later date as permitted by the BaFin), the parties shall discuss in good
faith whether such conditions shall be waived (it being agreed that there
shall not be any obligation to waive any of such conditions

 



-59-   pursuant to this paragraph (d)). Any waiver, in whole or in part, of the
conditions described in paragraph II.(b) or paragraph III.(b) of Annex II
shall be made no later than four days prior to the date on which the
Expiration Time is scheduled to occur (or such later date as permitted by the
BaFin).

(e) If either NYSE Euronext or Deutsche Borse requests a waiver of the
condition described in paragraph I.(h) of Annex II, the timing of any such
waiver shall be subject to mutual agreement of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche
Borse; _provided_ that, if no agreement is reached on the timing of any such
waiver, and either NYSE Euronext or Deutsche Borse requests a waiver of such
condition, then Holdco shall waive such condition at the latest time during
the Offer permitted by applicable Law. 

Section 10.4. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
separate counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to be an original
instrument, and all such counterparts shall together constitute the same
agreement.

 

Section 10.5. _GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE_.

DEFINED IN SECTION 6.1(a) OF THIS AGREEMENT, WHICH SHALL BE INTERPRETED,
CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF DELAWARE WITHOUT

CHAPTER VIII

THE BOARD 



   14 | Composition; remuneration 
---|--- 



   14.1 |

Until the end of the annual General Meeting of Shareholders occurring in 2015
(the "Initial Board Term"), the Board shall consist of seventeen (17)
members, constituted as follows: one (1) Executive Director A, being the Group
CEO; one (1) Director B, being the Group Chairman; and fifteen (15) Non-
Executive Directors, consisting of six (6) Non-Executive Directors A and nine
(9) Non-Executive Directors B. Immediately following the expiry of the Initial
Board Term, the number of Directors will be decreased and the Board shall
consist of twelve (12) members (without designations as either Directors A or
Directors B), constituted as follows: one (1) Executive Director, being the
Group CEO; one (1) Director, being the Group Chairman; and ten (10) Non-
Executive Directors. Only natural persons can be Directors. To the extent
permitted under the laws of the Netherlands and subject to the terms of the
articles and the Board Rules, and to the extent a Director is not appointed
prior to the Closing Date as either an Executive Director or a Non-Executive
Director, the Board shall determine whether a Director shall be designated as
an Executive Director or as a Non-Executive Director. 

---|--- 



   14.2 |

Each of the Directors shall be appointed by the General Meeting for a term
that will expire at the end of the next annual General Meeting
of Shareholders or until his or her successor is elected or, if earlier, upon
such Directors resignation, removal or death. During the Initial Board Term,
each of the Directors (or his or her replacement pursuant to article 14.5)
shall be nominated by the Board for re-election to the Board pursuant to a
binding nomination at each of the annual General Meetings of Shareholders
occurring in 2012, 2013 and 2014; provided, however, that the Group Chairman
and the Group CEO shall each be nominated by the Board pursuant to a binding
nomination for re-election to the Board at the annual General Meetings of
Shareholders occurring in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 in accordance with
articles 15.1 and 16.1. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
article 14.2, in the event that the Board determines prior to the Closing Date
that (i) the Company will qualify as a "foreign private issuer" as defined in
Rule 3b-4(c) promulgated under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act (such status,
"FPI Status") and will maintain FPI Status on an ongoing basis following the
Closing Date through the end of the Initial Chairman Term, and (ii) the
Directors may be appointed by the General Meeting for a term that expires in
2015 (or in 2016 in the case of the Group Chairman and the Group CEO) and
Directors are not otherwise required by applicable law, regulation or stock
exchange listing standards to be elected at each annual General Meeting, then
the Directors shall be appointed on or prior 

---|--- 
 



10  to the Closing Date by the General Meeting for a term ending at the end of
the annual General Meeting of Shareholders occurring in 2015, except that the
Group Chairman and the Group CEO shall each initially be appointed on or
prior to the Closing Date for a term ending at the end of the annual General
Meeting of Shareholders occurring in 2016. 

---|--- 
 



   14.3 | Directors shall be appointed by the General Meeting by the vote
in favour of at least two-thirds majority of the votes cast, representing more
than one-half of the Companys issued share capital or, in the case of any
person nominated by the Board for appointment as a Director, by the vote in
favour of at least a majority of the votes cast. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Board may submit a binding nomination in accordance with
Section 2:133 of the Dutch Civil Code to nominate persons for appointment as
Directors at the General Meeting of Shareholders and, in the event of any such
binding nomination, the General Meeting shall appoint Directors solely from
such binding nominations; provided, however, that the General Meeting may, by
a resolution passed with at least a two-thirds majority of the votes cast,
representing more than one-half of the Companys issued capital, resolve that
the candidates proposed pursuant to any binding nomination shall not be
appointed as Directors, in which case the Board shall have the right to submit
a new binding nomination with respect to any Board seats which are to be
filled for the appointment of Director(s) at a further General Meeting of
Shareholders. A Director may be reappointed with due observance of the
previous sentences. 
---|--- 



   14.4 | A Director may be suspended or removed by the General Meeting at
any time by a resolution passed with at least a two-thirds majority of the
votes cast, representing more than one-half of the Companys issued capital.
If permitted under the laws of the Netherlands, a Director may also be
suspended by the Board. Any suspension may not last longer than three (3)
months in the aggregate. If, at the end of that period, no decision has been
taken on termination of the suspension, the suspension shall end. 
---|--- 



   14.5 | In the event of a Directors resignation, removal or death prior
to the end of the Initial Board Term, the Directors A shall make a
recommendation to the Nominations, Governance and Corporate Responsibility
Committee of a replacement candidate if the vacancy occurs in a Board seat
previously held by a Director A, and the Directors B shall make a
recommendation to the Nominations, Governance and Corporate Responsibility
Committee of a replacement candidate if the vacancy occurs in a Board seat
previously held by a Director B. Any person who is elected to the Board to
fill a Board seat during the Initial Board Term that was previously held by a
Director A or a Director B shall be designated as a Director A or a Director
B, respectively, for purposes of article 14.1, but such person shall not
constitute a Director A or a Director B (and shall instead have undesignated
status) for purposes of article 17.8 unless such person is the Group Chairman
or the Group CEO or is recommended by the Directors A (in the case of a
vacancy in a Director A seat) or by the Directors B (in the case of a vacancy
in a Director B seat) to fill the vacancy on the relevant Board Committee. 
---|--- 

In the event of the resignation, removal or death of the Group Chairman or
the Group CEO prior to the end of their respective Initial Chairman Term or
Initial CEO Term, the procedure under this article 14.5 shall apply mutatis
mutandis, except that the recommendation of the Directors A or the Directors
B, as applicable, shall be binding on the Nominations Governance and
Corporate Responsibility Committee and on the Board, who shall nominate such
nominee for appointment to the Board and shall appoint such nominee as the
Group Chairman or the Group CEO, as applicable, concurrently with his or her
appointment by the General Meeting until the expiration of the Initial
Chairman Term or the Initial CEO Term, as applicable. The particular rights,
authorities and responsibilities of the Group Chairman and the Group CEO
under these articles and the Board Rules will be

 



11  granted to their respective successors during the Initial Chairman Term or
the Initial CEO Term, as applicable. 

---|--- 
 



   14.6 | The Board may appoint a company secretary (the "Company
Secretary") who shall assist the Board. If a Company Secretary is appointed
during the Initial Board Term, the individual with the position of General
Corporate Counsel shall be appointed as the Company Secretary. The Company
Secretary shall have such powers as are assigned to him, subject to the
provisions of these articles of association, by the Board on or after his
appointment. 
---|--- 



   14.7 | The Company has a policy on the remuneration of the Board. The
policy shall be adopted by the General Meeting, upon a proposal of the Human
Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board. The policy on remuneration
shall, in any case, include the subjects referred to in Sections 2:383c up to
and including 2:383e of the Dutch Civil Code, insofar as these relate to the
Board.  
---|--- 



   14.8 | The Board shall determine, with due observance of the policy
referred to in article 14.7, the remuneration and further conditions of
employment for each member of the Board. 
---|--- 



   14.9 | Proposals concerning plans or arrangements for share awards or
share options to Directors shall be submitted by the Board to the General
Meeting for its approval. Such proposals must, at a minimum, state the number
of shares or share options that may be granted to the Board and the criteria
that apply to the granting of such shares or share options or the alteration
of such arrangements.  
---|--- 



   15 | Chairman of the Board 
---|--- 



   15.1 | The Board shall appoint one of the Directors to be the Chairman
of the Board (the "Group Chairman") for such period as the Board may
decide, except that the person who was the Group Chairman as of the Closing
Date shall have a term expiring at the end of the next annual General Meeting
of Shareholders and shall be re-appointed as Group Chairman by the Board at
the annual General Meetings occurring in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 (the total
term ending at the end of the annual General Meeting of Shareholders occurring
in 2016 to be referred to as the "Initial Chairman Term") concurrently with
his re-election as a Director at such meetings, subject however to his
earlier resignation, removal or death. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this article 15.1, in the event that the Board determines prior
to the Closing Date that (i) the Company will have and maintain FPI Status on
an ongoing basis following the Closing Date through the end of the Initial
Chairman Term, and (ii) the Directors may be appointed by the General Meeting
for a term that expires in 2015 (or in 2016 in the case of the Group Chairman
and the Group CEO) and Directors are not otherwise required by applicable law,
regulation or stock exchange listing standards to be elected at each annual
General Meeting, then the person who was the Group Chairman as of the Closing
Date shall be appointed for a period ending at the end of the annual General
Meeting of Shareholders occurring in 2016. During the Initial Chairman Term,
the Board shall also appoint one of its Directors A as Vice Chairman of the
Board (a "Group Vice Chairman"). The Group Vice Chairman shall only fulfil
the duties of the Group Chairman under article 15.2.1 in case of his absence
pursuant to article 15.4 and as specified in article 29.1, but shall have none

   15.3 | After the Initial Chairman Term, the Group Chairman shall be a
Non-Executive Director and the responsibilities and authorities of the Group
Chairman shall consist of the responsibilities and authorities provided for
at such time in the Board Rules. The particular responsibilities and
authorities granted to the Group Chairman in accordance with article 15.2 will
terminate at the end of the Initial Chairman Term. 
---|--- 



   15.4 | If no Group Chairman has been appointed or if the Group Chairman
is absent or unable to take the chair, a meeting of the Board shall be
presided over by the Group Vice-Chairman or, in the event of his absence or

purpose by the meeting to be entrusted with the duties of the Group Chairman
at such meeting.

concurrently with his re-election as a Director at such meetings, subject
however to his earlier resignation, removal or death. Notwithstanding the

shall become effective only upon a change of these articles of association. 
---|--- 



   17.7 | The Board may establish such committees as it may deem
necessary, which committees may consist of one or more members of the Board.
The Board appoints the members of each committee and determines the tasks of

any such changes shall require a resolution passed with the vote in favour of
more than sixty-six percent (66%) of the total number of Directors that would

provided that if the seat for the Group CEO is vacant or the Group CEO is
unable to perform his duties, the Group CEOs duties and responsibilities
shall be temporarily fulfilled by the Non-Executive Directors or by a person
to be designated for that purpose by the Non-Executive Directors. If all seats
on the Board are vacant or all Directors or the sole Director, as the case
may be, are unable to perform their duties, the management of the business and
affairs of the Company shall be temporarily entrusted to one or more persons
designated for that purpose by the General Meeting.

 



   21 | Indemnity 
---|--- 



   21.1 | Subject to the provisions of article 21.3, the Company shall
indemnify each current and former Director who is conducting a defense against
(threatening) claims or who is subject to (threatening) investigations based
on acts or failures to act in the exercise of his or her duties or any other
duties currently or previously performed by him or her at the Companys
request, or who is appearing in other legal proceedings in which he or she is
involved as a current or former Director or based on any other duties
currently or previously performed by him or her at the Companys request, with
the exception of proceedings primarily aimed at pursuing a claim on his or
her own behalf (not including any claim for recourse in relation to claims or
investigations referred to above in this article 21.1) against all costs and
expenses reasonably incurred by him or her and shall pay any damages or fines
payable by the (former) Director as a result of an act or failure to act as
referred to above in this article 21.1. This indemnification shall also apply
to any claims by the Company or by a shareholder of the Company.  
---|--- 



   21.2 | Costs, damages and fines incurred by the (former) Director as
referred to under article 21.1 shall be paid by the Company upon having
received a specification of those costs, damages and fines subject to an
undertaking in writing by the (former) Director that he or she shall repay any
reimbursed amount to the Company if it shall ultimately be determined that he
or she is not entitled to indemnification under the provisions of this
article 21 or if and to the extent an insurer subsequently also pays out the
costs, damages and/ or fines to the (former) Director. 
---|--- 



    21.3 | There shall be no entitlement to indemnity under this article
21: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | if and to the extent the laws of the Netherlands would not
permit such indemnification; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | if and to the extent a competent court has established in a
final and conclusive decision that the act or failure to act of the (former)
Director may be characterized as wilful ( _opzettelijk_ ), intentionally
reckless ( _bewust roekeloos_ ) or seriously culpable ( _ernstig verwijtbaar_
), unless the laws of the Netherlands provide otherwise or this would, in view
of the circumstances of the case, be unacceptable according to standards of
reasonableness and fairness; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | if and to the extent the costs, damages or fines payable by
the (former) Director are covered by any liability insurance and the insurer
has paid out the costs, damages or fines. 
---|---|--- 



   21.4 | An amendment of this article 21 shall not prejudice any rights
of a (former) Director if acquired under this article 21 before such
amendment, unless the (former) Director specifically agrees with such
amendment. If there is no specific agreement, the obligations of the Company
under this article 21 shall apply as if the amendment was not implemented but
only insofar as such amendment is a deterioration of the rights of such
(former) Director. The indemnity shall also be for the benefit of any heirs of
the (former) Director. 
---|--- 
 



17 instructions relating to the manner of his or her defense and consult with the
Company in advance about the manner of such defense. The person concerned
shall not: (i) acknowledge any personal liability, (ii) waive any defense, or
(iii) agree on a settlement, without the Companys prior written consent.  
---|--- 



   21.6 | The Company may take out liability insurance for the benefit of
the (former) Directors. In case the Company has taken out liability insurance
for the benefit of the (former) Director, the (former) Director shall, to the
extent reasonable, act in accordance with the provisions of the insurance
policy. 
---|--- 



   21.7 | Any rights and obligations under this article 21 shall be
governed by the laws of the Netherlands. Disputes between the Company and a
(former) Director arising in relation to this indemnity shall be finally
settled in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Netherlands
Arbitration Institute. The arbitral tribunal shall be composed of three
arbitrators. The place of arbitration shall be Amsterdam. The procedure shall
be conducted in the English language. The arbitral tribunal shall decide in
accordance with the rules of law ( _naar de regelen des rechts_ ). 
---|--- 
 



   21.8 | The Board may, by agreement or otherwise, give further
implementation to the indemnity.

reflected in the annual accounts or otherwise disclosed to the General
Meeting prior to the adoption of the annual accounts, shall be brought up
separately for discussion at such General Meeting of Shareholders or at a
subsequent General Meeting of Shareholders. 
---|--- 
 



   24 | Profits and distributions 
---|--- 



   24.1 | Out of the profits earned in a financial year, primarily and

on each Preference Share in an amount equal to (i) twelve (12) months
EURIBOR, increased by (ii) a premium to be determined by the Board in line
with market conditions per the date of the first issue of the Preference

purpose over the period ending on the day this amount is made payable. 
---|---|---

satisfied as apparent from the interim statement of assets and liabilities
referred to in article 24.9.

be adopted at the proposal of the Board. 
---|--- 



   24.7 | Distributions on Shares payable in cash shall be paid in euro,
unless the Board determines that payment shall be made in another currency.  
---|--- 



   24.8 | Any distribution on Shares may be paid in kind in the form of
Shares instead of in cash, provided that this will at all times require the
approval of the Board and, if and to the extent the Board is not authorised
to issue Shares and to limit or exclude the rights of pre-emption, a
resolution of the body of the Company authorised to issue Shares and to limit
or exclude the rights of pre-emption.

distribution on Shares shall be barred after five (5) years have elapsed from
the date such payment became due. 
---|--- 



   24.11 | No distributions shall be made on Shares held by the Company in
its own capital, unless these Shares have been pledged or a usufruct has been
created in these Shares and the authority to collect distributions or the
right to receive distributions, respectively, accrues to the pledgee or the
usufructuary, respectively. For the computation of distributions, the Shares,
on which no distributions shall be made pursuant to this article 24.11, shall
not be taken into account.

articles of association. 
---|--- 
 



   32 | Voting 
---|--- 



   32.1 | All voting shall take place orally. The chairman is, however,
entitled to decide that votes be cast by a secret ballot. Any vote on a person

anyone present at the meeting with voting rights may demand a vote by a
secret ballot. Votes by secret ballot shall be cast by means of secret,
unsigned ballot papers. 
---|--- 



   32.2 | Blank and invalid votes shall not be counted as votes. 
---|--- 



   32.3 | If a majority of the votes cast is not obtained in an election
of persons, a second free vote shall be taken. If a majority is not obtained
again, further votes shall be taken until either one person obtains a
majority of the votes cast or the election is between two persons only, both
of whom receive an equal number of votes. In the event of such further
elections (not including the second free vote), each election shall be
between the candidates in the preceding election, with the exclusion of the
person who received the smallest number of votes in such preceding election.
If in the preceding election more than one person has received the
smallest number of votes, it shall be decided which candidate should not
participate in the new election by randomly choosing a name. If votes are
equal in an election between two persons, it shall be decided who is elected
by randomly choosing a name.  
---|--- 



   32.4 | Resolutions may be adopted by acclamation if none of the persons
with voting rights present or represented at the meeting objects. 
---|--- 
 



   32.5 | The Board may decide that each person entitled to vote is
authorised to vote by electronic means of communication, either in person or
by proxy. In such case, it shall be required that the person entitled to vote
can be identified through the electronic means of communication and can take
knowledge of the discussions at the meeting directly. The Board may attach
conditions to the use of the electronic means of communication, which
conditions will be announced when convening the meeting and will be published
on the Companys website. 
---|--- 
 



23 vote shall be final and conclusive. However, if the correctness of such
decision is challenged immediately after it is pronounced, a new vote shall
be taken if either the majority of the persons with voting rights present or
represented at the meeting or, where the original vote was not taken by roll
call or in writing, any person with voting rights present or represented at
the meeting, so demands. The legal consequences of the original vote shall be
made null and void by the new vote. 
---|--- 



   33 | Meetings of holders of Preference Shares 
---|--- 



   33.1 | Meetings of holders of Preference Shares are held as frequently
as a resolution is required by the meeting in question and as frequently as is
deemed desirable by the Board, or by one or more holder(s) of Preference
Shares. 
---|---

The provisions of articles 25 through 32 apply mutatis mutandis, provided that

preceding the meeting, (ii) in deviation from the provisions of article 29,

a demerger may only be adopted on the basis of a demerger proposal to be
prepared by the management boards of the parties to the demerger. Within the
Company, the resolution to effect a demerger shall be adopted by the General
Meeting by a resolution passed with at least a two-thirds majority of the

i ---|--- 



     | 1.1 | These Board Rules are established pursuant to Article 17.6
of the Articles and are complementary to, and subject to, the provisions
regarding the Board and each of its members contained in applicable law,
regulation and the Articles. The Board and each of its members shall observe
and comply, and shall procure observance and compliance, with the Board Rules. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 1.2 | These Board Rules are posted on the Companys website. 
---|---|--- 



     | 1.3 | The meaning of certain capitalised terms used in these Board
Rules are set forth in the List of Definitions attached as Appendix 1.  
---|---|--- 



   2 | Composition of the Board, Appointment and Resignation 
---|--- 



     | 2.1 | Each of the Directors shall be appointed by the annual
General Meeting for a term that will expire at the end of the next annual
General Meeting or until his or her successor is elected or, if earlier, upon
such Directors resignation, removal or death. During the Initial Board Term,
each of the Directors (or his or her replacement pursuant to article 14.5 of
the Articles) shall be nominated by the Board for re-election to the Board
pursuant to a binding nomination at each of the annual General Meetings
occurring in 2012, 2013 and 2014; provided, however, that the Group Chairman
and the Group CEO shall each be nominated by the Board pursuant to a binding
nomination for re-election to the Board at the annual General Meetings
occurring in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 in accordance with articles 15.1 and
16.1 of the Articles. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this clause
2.1, in the event that the Board determines prior to the Closing Date that
(i) the Company will qualify as a "foreign private issuer" as defined in Rule
3b-4(c) promulgated under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act (such status,
"FPI Status") and will maintain FPI Status on an ongoing basis following the
Closing Date through the end of the Initial Chairman Term, and (ii) the
Directors may be appointed by the General Meeting for a term that expires at
the end of the annual General Meeting of Shareholders occurring in 2015 (or
in 2016 in the case of the Group Chairman and the Group CEO) and Directors are
not otherwise required by applicable law, regulation or stock exchange listing
standards to be elected at each annual General Meeting, then the Directors
shall be appointed on or prior to the Closing Date by the General Meeting for
a term ending at the end of the annual General Meeting of Shareholders
occurring in 2015, except that the Group Chairman and the Group CEO shall
each initially be appointed on or prior to the Closing Date for a term ending
at the end of the annual General Meeting of Shareholders occurring in 2016. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 2.2 | Until the end of the annual General Meeting occurring in
2015 (the "Initial Board Term"), the Board shall consist of 17 (seventeen)
members, constituted as follows: 
---|---|--- 



     | 2.2.1 | 1 (one) Executive Director A, who shall be the Group CEO; 
---|---|--- 



     | 2.2.2 | 1 (one) Director B, who shall be the Group Chairman; and 
---|---|--- 



     | 2.2.3 | 15 (fifteen) Non-Executive Directors, consisting of six
(6) Non-Executive Directors A and nine (9) Non-Executive Directors B. 
---|---|--- 
  



1 Term, the number of Directors will be decreased and the Board shall consist of
12 (twelve) members (without designations as either Directors A or Directors
B), constituted as follows: 
---|---|--- 



     | 2.3.1 | 1 (one) Executive Director, being the Group CEO; 
---|---|--- 



     | 2.3.2 | 1 (one) Director shall be the Group Chairman; and 
---|---|--- 



     | 2.3.3 | 10 (ten) Non-Executive Directors. 
---|---|--- 



     | 2.4 | Only natural persons can be Directors. To the extent
permitted under the laws of the Netherlands and subject to the terms of the
Articles and these Board Rules, and to the extent a Director is not appointed
prior to the Closing Date as either an Executive Director or a Non-Executive
Director, the Board shall determine which Directors shall be designated as
Executive Director and which Directors shall be designated as Non-Executive
Directors. 
---|---|--- 



     | 2.5 | After expiry of the Initial Board Term, the Board shall be
constituted with members without having regard to a specific ratio of members
who were recommended by or initially appointed as Directors A or Directors B,
and shall be constituted so as to provide for an international character of
the Board. Any restrictions in relation to a specific ratio of nationality of
Board members shall be avoided in the interest of having the Board be
composed of the best candidates without regard to nationality. 
---|---|--- 



     | 2.6 | Directors shall be appointed by the General Meeting by the
vote in favour of at least two-thirds majority of the votes cast, representing
more than one-half of the Companys issued share capital or, in the case of
any person nominated by the Board for appointment as a Director, by the vote
in favour of at least a majority of the votes cast. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Board may submit a binding nomination in accordance with
section 2:133 of the Dutch Civil Code to nominate persons for appointment as
Directors at the General Meeting and, in the event of any such binding
nomination, the General Meeting shall appoint Directors solely from such
binding nominations; provided, however, that the General Meeting may, by a
resolution passed with at least a two-thirds majority of the votes cast,
representing more than one-half of the Companys issued capital, resolve that
the candidates proposed pursuant to any binding nomination shall not be
appointed as Directors, in which case the Board shall have the right to submit
a new binding nomination with respect to any Board seats which are to be
filled for the appointment of Director(s) at a further General Meeting. A
Director may be reappointed with due observance of the previous sentences. 
---|---|--- 



     | 2.7 | A Director may be suspended or removed by the General
Meeting at any time by a resolution passed with at least a two-thirds majority
of the votes cast, representing more than one-half of the Companys issued
capital. If permitted under the laws of the Netherlands, a Director may also
be suspended by the Board. Any suspension may not last longer than three (3)
months in the aggregate. If, at the end of that period, no decision has been
taken on termination of the suspension, the suspension shall end. 
---|---|--- 



     | 2.8 |

In the event of a Directors resignation, removal or death prior to the end of
the Initial Board Term, the Directors A shall make a recommendation to the
Nominations, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee of a
replacement candidate if the vacancy occurs in a Board seat previously held by
a Director A, and the  

---|---|--- 
 



2  Directors B shall make a recommendation to the Nominations, Governance and
Corporate Responsibility Committee of a replacement candidate if the vacancy
occurs in a Board seat previously held by a Director B. Any person who is
elected to the Board to fill a Board seat during the Initial Board Term that
was previously held by a Director A or a Director B shall be designated as a
Director A or a Director B, respectively, for purposes of clause 2.2, but
such person shall not constitute a Director A or a Director B (and shall
instead have undesignated status) for purposes of clause 12.5 unless such
person is the Group Chairman or Group CEO or is recommended by the Directors A
(in the case of a vacancy in a Director A seat) or by the Directors B (in the
case of a vacancy in a Director B seat) to fill the vacancy on the relevant
Board Committee. 

---|--- 
 



     | 2.9 | In the event of the resignation, removal or death of the
Group Chairman or the Group CEO prior to the end of their respective Initial
Group Chairman or Group CEO Term, the procedure under this clause 2.9 shall
apply mutatis mutandis, except that the recommendation of the Directors A or
the Directors B, as applicable, shall be binding on the Nominations,
Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee and on the Board, who shall
nominate such nominee for appointment to the Board and shall appoint such
nominee as the Group Chairman or the Group CEO, as applicable, concurrently
with his or her appointment by the General Meeting until the expiration
of the Initial Chairman Term or the Initial CEO Term, as applicable. The
particular rights, authorities and responsibilities of the Group Chairman and
the Group CEO under the Articles and these Board Rules will be granted to
their respective successors during the Initial Chairman Term or the Initial
CEO Term, as applicable.
