any of its Affiliates is a party which are related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Debt Financing that would or would reasonably be expected to (i)&nbsp;prevent or substantially delay the availability of the
full amount of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter at the Closing or (ii)&nbsp;affect the enforceability of the Debt Commitment Letter. Assuming the Debt Financing is funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter,
the net proceeds contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter will in the aggregate, together with Parent&#146;s available cash and cash equivalents, be sufficient for Parent to satisfy all of the payment obligations of Parent under this Agreement,
including (i)&nbsp;paying the Aggregate Initial Merger Consideration and (ii)&nbsp;paying all fees and expenses incurred by it or for which it is responsible in connection with this Agreement. As of the date hereof, Parent does not have any reason
to believe that any of the conditions to the Debt Financing will fail to timely be satisfied or that the full amount of the Debt Financing will be unavailable on or prior to the Closing Date. The Debt Commitment Letter is not subject to any
conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make the applicable amount of the Debt Financing available to Parent at the Closing other than as set forth therein. Parent has no Knowledge, as of the date hereof, that any Debt
Financing Source will not perform its funding obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with its terms and conditions. </P>
