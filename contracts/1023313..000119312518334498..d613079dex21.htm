with the Preferred Stock, the " _Company Capital Stock_ ") of the Company
(other than the Company Capital Stock to be canceled pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 1.5(c)_ and other than the Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the
right to receive a portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration (as defined
herein) upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and
based upon the applicable rights, preferences and privileges of the Company
Capital Stock as set forth in the Company Charter.

B. The board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, unanimously
(i) determined that the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, the
Company and the Stockholders (as defined herein), (ii) declared the
advisability of and approved the execution of this Agreement, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) recommended
that the Stockholders adopt this Agreement and approve the consummation of the

C. The holders of Preferred Stock have unanimously determined to approve
and adopt this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises, representations,
warranties and agreements set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

(iii) All shares of Company Capital Stock, when converted and canceled

Sellers pursuant thereto. The parties further agree that the Stockholder
Representative shall be required to update the Allocation Schedule from time

shall constitute a complete discharge of the applicable payment obligations of
Parent and Acquisition Corp. hereunder to the Sellers. The Company and the
Stockholder Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, agree that neither
Parent, Acquisition Corp., the Surviving Corporation nor any of their
respective Affiliates shall be liable for any Losses to any Person, including

Allocation Schedule, including any failure of the Company or the Stockholder
Representative to correctly calculate the amounts owing to a Seller or to
correctly distribute to any Seller the amounts of any payments made by (or on
behalf of) Parent to or for the benefit of the Sellers.

(vii) to the Paying Agent, to be held in a segregated bank account for the
benefit of the Stockholders that do not receive payment pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 1.6(a)(v)_ or _Section_ __ _ 1.6(a)(vi)_ and used solely and
exclusively for purposes of distribution to the Stockholders as set forth in
this  _Section_ __ _ 1.6(a)_, in respect of each share, the Initial Per
Share Merger Consideration (as applicable) not paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _
1.6(a)(v)_ or _Section_ __ _ 1.6(a)(vi)_ (the " _Payment Fund_ ");

Recipients and to be used solely and exclusively for purposes of distribution
to such Founder Proceeds Recipients (and applicable Tax withholding payments),
the Founder Proceeds Amount, pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.12_.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, for a period of eighteen (18)
following the Effective Time, upon a Stockholders delivery to the Paying
Agent of a Letter of Transmittal and Certificate(s) representing (immediately
prior to the Effective Time) the shares of Company Capital Stock held by
such Stockholder set forth in such Letter of Transmittal, such Stockholder
shall be entitled to receive from the Paying Agent, and the Paying Agent shall
pay or cause to be paid to such Stockholder, within three (3) Business Days
after such delivery and in exchange therefor, in respect of each such share,
the Initial Per Share Merger Consideration (and any portion of the Additional
Per Share Merger Consideration that has, as of such time, already been finally
determined), in each case as applicable, attributable to such shares of
Company Capital Stock, in cash by check or wire transfer of immediately
available funds in accordance with the wire or other delivery instructions
provided in writing by such Stockholder. No interest or dividends will be
paid or accrued on the consideration payable upon the surrender or transfer of
any Certificate. If the consideration provided for herein is to be delivered
in the name of a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate was surrendered, it shall be a condition of such delivery that
the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in
proper form for transfer accompanied by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid or are not yet payable. Until surrendered in
accordance with the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 1.6(b)_, each
Certificate (other than those representing Dissenting Shares or Company
Capital Stock to be canceled pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.6(c)_) shall
represent, for all purposes after the Effective Time, only the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the amounts payable in respect thereof
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.6(a)_ in respect of the Company Capital Stock
formerly evidenced by such Certificate, without any interest or dividends
thereon.

 

(c) Any portion of the Payment Fund deposited with or otherwise made
available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement that remains
unclaimed by the former Stockholders eighteen (18) months after the Effective
Time shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any such
holder who has not exchanged its shares of Company Capital Stock for a
portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for, and the Surviving
Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of the portion of Aggregate
Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to a holder of Certificates or any other Person in
respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates shall not have
been properly surrendered or transferred prior to the date on which any
consideration in respect thereof would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of a Governmental Authority, any such shares, cash, dividends or
distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



6

    

(d) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of a lost stock certificate affidavit and
indemnity agreement (in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent
(prior to the Effective Time) or the Surviving Corporation (following the
Effective Time)) of that fact by the Person (who shall be the record owner of
such Certificate) claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed,
the Surviving Corporation and Parent will pay or cause to be paid to such
Person, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration attributable to such Certificate
pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(e) All amounts paid pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.6_ shall be treated
as adjustments to the Aggregate Merger Consideration for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law.

(f) Each of the Company, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any holder of Company Capital Stock or Stock Options or otherwise pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any applicable
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law; _provided_ that prior to
deducting and withholding any such amounts, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as applicable, shall provide Stockholder Representative
with prior written notice of its intent to deduct and withhold within a
reasonable period before the Closing Date, shall cooperate in good faith
with Stockholder Representative to reduce (or eliminate) the deduction or
withholding of such amounts, and shall remit any such deducted and withheld
amounts to the appropriate Tax Authority. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax Authority by the
Company, the Surviving Corporation and Parent, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom
such amounts would otherwise have been paid. 

1.7 _Stock Options_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary and
appropriate actions to cause the Stock Options identified on _Section_ __ _
1.7(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule to become fully vested and exercisable and
therefore to constitute In-the-Money Options for purposes of this Agreement.
As of the Effective Time, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement (i) each In-the-Money Option shall automatically be canceled and
extinguished, no longer be outstanding and cease to represent the right to
acquire shares of Common Stock, and in consideration therefor, the holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash (collectively, the "
_Option Payments_ "), without interest, equal to the excess, if any, of (x)
(A) the Initial Per Share Merger Consideration _plus_ (B) the Additional Per
Share Merger Consideration (if any) attributable thereto over (y) the
exercise price of such Stock Option in respect of a share of Common Stock and
(ii) each Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and that is not an In-the-Money Option (and, for avoidance of doubt,
including each portion of an In-the-Money Option that is not vested
or exercisable as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (but after
giving effect to any vesting acceleration resulting from the Merger in
accordance with its terms as in effect on the date of this Agreement or
described in the first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 1.7(a)_)) shall
automatically be canceled and extinguished, no longer be outstanding and cease
to represent the right to acquire

 



7

    

 Common Stock, without any payment of any consideration therefor. The Company
shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all actions as are reasonably
necessary in order to effectuate the actions contemplated by this _Section_
__ _ 1.7_; _provided_ that such actions shall expressly be conditioned upon
the consummation of the Merger and shall be of no force or effect if this
Agreement is terminated. The Option Payments attributable to the Initial Per
Share Merger Consideration shall be paid through the Surviving Companys
payroll system on the first normal payroll date of the Surviving Company
occurring at least five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time to
each Person entitled to receive Option Payments, subject in each case to the
withholding described in _Section_ __ _ 1.7(b)_, and any additional portion
of the Option Payments payable to the In-the-Money Optionholders shall be paid
through the Surviving Companys payroll system on the first normal payroll
date of the Surviving Company occurring at least three (3) Business Days
following receipt of such additional portion of the Option Payments to each
Person entitled to receive Option Payments, subject in each case to the
withholding described in _Section_ __ _ 1.7(b)_. For avoidance of doubt (1)
to the extent such additional portion of the Option Payments arises from the
Expense Reserve Amount, the Stockholder Representative shall pay such
additional portion to the Surviving Corporation for further distribution in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 1.7(a)_ and (2) to the extent such
additional portion of the Option Payments arises under _Section_ __ _
1.11(d)_ and is payable from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund, the
Parties shall cause the Escrow Agent to pay such additional portion to the
Surviving Corporation for further distribution in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 1.7(a)_.

 

(b) The Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable or deliverable to any In-the-Money
Optionholder pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.7(a)_ such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. If the
Company so withholds such amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the In-the-Money
Optionholders in respect of which the Company made such deduction and
withholding.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary and
appropriate actions to cause the individuals identified on _Section_ __ _
1.7(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedule to execute a written consent with respect
to the treatment of their Stock Options hereunder.

 

1.8 _No Further Ownership Rights in the Company Capital Stock_. The
portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration paid in respect of the
surrender for exchange of the Company Capital Stock in accordance with the
terms hereof shall be deemed to be full satisfaction of all rights pertaining
to such Company Capital Stock, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of the Company Capital
Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

1.9 _Indebtedness; Company Transaction Expenses_.

 

It is contemplated by the parties that, upon the Closing, the Indebtedness set
forth on _Section_ __ _ 1.9_ of the Disclosure Schedule and Transaction
Expenses of the Company and its Subsidiaries will be fully repaid or paid (as
applicable). No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the anticipated
Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall obtain and deliver

 



8

    

 to Parent a payoff letter in customary form and reasonably acceptable to
Parent with respect to all Indebtedness set forth on _Section_ __ _ 1.9_ of
the Disclosure Schedule (together with all instruments, documents and UCC
financing statements relating thereto, the " _Payoff Letter_ ") and final
invoices for the Transaction Expenses, which Payoff Letter and invoices will
set forth the amounts necessary (and applicable payment instructions) to
fully discharge such liability and, in the case of the Payoff Letter, provide
for the complete release of all Encumbrances and guarantees with respect to
such Indebtedness. In connection with the Closing, Parent shall make (or
cause to be made) (a) the payments referenced in such Payoff Letter on the
Closing Date and (b) payment of the Transaction Expenses set forth on the
invoices described above on the Closing Date in order to discharge the
amounts payable thereunder.

1.10 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares
of Company Capital Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that are held by the holders of Company Capital Stock who
have not voted in favor of the Merger, consented thereto in writing or
otherwise contractually waived their rights to appraisal and who have
demanded properly in writing appraisal for such shares in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not
be converted into, or represent the right to receive, any portion of
the Aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement. Such holders of Company Capital Stock shall be entitled to receive
payment of the appraised value of such shares of Company Capital Stock held by
them in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except
that all Dissenting Shares held by the holders of Company Capital Stock who
shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost
their rights to appraisal of such shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall
thereupon cease to be Dissenting Shares and be deemed to have been converted
into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right
to receive any portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement, without any interest thereon, upon delivery of
a Letter of Transmittal and surrender, in the manner provided herein, of the
Certificate or Certificates that formerly evidenced such shares or the
execution and delivery of a lost stock certificate affidavit and indemnity
agreement to the Company as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 1.6(d)_.

 

(b) The Company shall give Parent and the Stockholder Representative prompt
written notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company,
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Company. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

1.11 _Closing Adjustment, _ _etc._

(a) _Determination of Closing Adjustment_. No later than three (3)
Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the chief financial
officer of the Company shall have delivered to Parent a certificate (the "
_Estimated Closing Statement_ ") setting forth (i) the Companys good faith
estimate of (A) the aggregate amount of Company Cash as of the Year-End
Measurement Time (" _Estimated Company Cash_ "), (B) the aggregate amount of
Net Working Capital as of the Year-End Measurement Time (" _Estimated Net
Working Capital_ "),

 



9

    

 (C) the aggregate amount of Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries
as of the Year-End Measurement Time (to the extent not being paid by
the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to Closing) (" _Estimated Indebtedness_
"), and (D) the aggregate amount of unpaid Transaction Expenses as of the
Measurement Time (to the extent not being paid by the Company or its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing) (" _Estimated Transaction Expenses_ ") and
(ii) the Allocation Schedule. The Estimated Closing Statement shall be based
upon the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and shall be
prepared in accordance with the definitions contained in this Agreement and
GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the methodologies and principles used
in the preparation of the Financial Statements and the accounting practices,
principles, policies, judgments, and methodologies set forth on, and used in
the calculation of, _Schedules II_ and _III_ hereto (all of which accounting
practices, principles, policies, judgments, and methodologies shall be, unless
otherwise specifically identified on such Schedules, consistent with GAAP,
and, in the case of any conflict, unless otherwise specifically identified on
such Schedules, GAAP shall control). Parent and its agents shall be provided
with reasonable access, during regular business hours and upon reasonable
prior notice, to the financial books and records on which the Estimated
Closing Statement is based and to the employees and agents of the Company and
its Affiliates who prepared the Estimated Closing Statement so as to enable
it to verify the amounts set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement. The
form and content of the Estimated Closing Statement shall be reasonably
acceptable to Parent and, subject to Parents reasonable satisfaction, shall
be conclusive for purposes of determining the consideration pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.6_.

 

(b) _Determination of Post-Closing Adjustment_. No later than ninety (90)
days following the Closing, Parent shall deliver to the Stockholder
Representative a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth the
calculation of (i) the actual Company Cash as of the Year-End
Measurement Time (" _Actual Company Cash_ "), (ii) the actual Net Working
Capital as of the Year-End Measurement Time (" _Actual Net Working Capital_
"), (iii) the actual Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the Year-End Measurement Time (to the extent not paid by the Company or its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing) (" _Actual Indebtedness_ "), and (iv)
the actual amount of unpaid Transaction Expenses as of the Measurement Time
(to the extent not paid by the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing) (" _Actual Transaction Expenses_ "), in each case, together with
reasonably detailed supporting documentation. The Closing Statement shall be
based upon the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and shall
be prepared in accordance with the definitions contained in this Agreement and
GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the methodologies and principles used
in the preparation of the Estimated Closing Statement (including in accordance
with the accounting practices, principles, policies, judgments and
methodologies set forth on, and used in the calculation of, _Schedules II_
and _III_ hereto (all of which accounting practices, principles, policies,
judgments, and methodologies shall be, unless otherwise specifically
identified on such Schedules, consistent with GAAP, and, in the case of any
conflict, unless otherwise specifically identified on such Schedules, GAAP
shall control)).

 

(c) _Disputed Final Adjustment_.

 

(i) No later than forty-five (45) days following the delivery by Parent of
the Closing Statement, the Stockholder Representative shall notify Parent in
writing whether it accepts or disputes the accuracy of any calculation set
forth in the Closing

 



10

    

 Statement. During such forty-five (45) day period, the Stockholder
Representative and its agents shall be provided with reasonable access, during
regular business hours and upon reasonable prior notice, to the financial
books and records on which the Closing Statement is based and to the employees
and agents of the Surviving Company and its Affiliates who prepared the
Closing Statement. If the Stockholder Representative accepts the Closing
Statement, or if the Stockholder Representative fails within such forty-five
(45) day period to so notify Parent of any dispute with respect thereto, then
the calculation of Actual Company Cash determined pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
1.11(b)_ shall be the " _Final Company Cash_ ," the calculation of Actual Net
Working Capital determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.11(b)_ shall be the "
_Final Net Working Capital_ ," the calculation of Actual Indebtedness
determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.11(b)_ shall be the " _Final
Indebtedness_ ," and the calculation of Actual Transaction Expenses determined
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.11(b)_ shall be the " _Final Transaction
Expenses,_ " which, in each case, shall deemed final and conclusive and
binding upon all parties in all respects.

 

(ii) If the Stockholder Representative disputes the accuracy of any
calculation set forth in the Closing Statement, the Stockholder
Representative shall provide written notice (the " _Dispute Notice_ ") to
Parent no later than forty-five (45) days following the delivery by Parent to
the Stockholder Representative of the Closing Statement, setting forth in
reasonable detail those items set forth in the Closing Statement that the
Stockholder Representative disputes. During the thirty (30) day period
following delivery of a Dispute Notice, (A) any aspect of the Closing
Statement that is not disputed in the Dispute Notice shall become final and
binding and (B) Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall negotiate in
good faith with a view to resolving their disagreements over the disputed
items. During such thirty (30) day period or until the earlier final
determination of Final Company Cash, Final Net Working Capital, Final
Indebtedness, and Final Transaction Expenses in accordance with this 
_Section_ __ _ 1.11(c)(ii)_, the Stockholder Representative and its agents
shall be provided with reasonable access, during regular business hours and
upon reasonable prior notice, to the financial books and records on which
the Closing Statement is based and to the employees and agents of the
Surviving Company and its Affiliates who prepared the Closing Statement so as
to enable it to verify the amounts set forth in the Closing Statement. If
Parent and the Stockholder Representative resolve their differences over such
disputed items in accordance with the foregoing procedure, Final Company Cash,
Final Net Working Capital, Final Indebtedness, and Final Transaction Expenses
shall be the amounts agreed upon by them. If the Parent and the Stockholder
Representative fail to resolve their differences over such disputed items
within such thirty (30) day period, then each of Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall be entitled to request that Ernst and Young LLP (or
another nationally recognized independent public accounting firm or valuation
firm as shall be mutually agreed by the Parent and the Stockholder
Representative) (the " _Accounting Expert_ "), acting as an expert and not
as an arbitrator, make a final and binding determination as to only the
disputed items in accordance with this Agreement; _provided_ that the Party
submitting the disputed items to the Accounting Expert provides prior written
notice of such submission to the nonsubmitting Party.

 



11

    

(iii) The Accounting Expert will, under the terms of its engagement, have
no more than thirty (30) days from the date of referral and no more than ten
(10) Business Days from the final submission of information by Parent and the
Stockholder Representative with respect to the unresolved disputed items
within which to render its written decision with respect to the disputed items
(and only with respect to any unresolved disputed items set forth in the
Dispute Notice). Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall deliver
written submissions to the Accounting Expert, if at all, no later than ten
(10) Business Days after the date of referral of the disputed matters to the
Accounting Expert. The Accounting Expert, acting as an expert and not as an
arbitrator, shall review such written submissions and base its determination
solely on such written submissions, and not by independent review. In
resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Expert shall resolve all disputed
items in accordance with the defined terms and other provisions of this
Agreement (including _Schedules II_ and _III_ hereto) and may not assign a
value to any item greater than the maximum value for such item claimed by
either Party or less than the minimum value for such item claimed by either
Party. Absent manifest error, the decision of the Accounting Expert shall be
final and binding upon the Parties and enforceable by any court of competent
jurisdiction and the Accounting Experts final determination of Company
Cash, Net Working Capital, Indebtedness, and Transaction Expenses, as
applicable, shall be deemed the Final Company Cash, Final Net Working Capital,
Final Indebtedness, and Final Transaction Expenses, respectively. The fees of
the Accounting Expert will be shared by Parent, on the one hand, and the
Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the Sellers), on the other hand, in
the percentage that is inversely proportionate to the percentage of the
aggregate amount of all items submitted to the Accounting Expert as disputed
that are resolved in such Partys favor. The Accounting Expert shall include
such apportionment of its fees and expenses in its written report to Parent
and the Stockholder Representative.

 

(d) _Payment following Calculation of the Final Adjustment Amount_.

 

(i) If the Final Adjustment Amount is positive and is equal to or greater
than $250,000, the Aggregate Initial Merger Consideration shall be adjusted
upwards in an amount equal to the Final Adjustment Amount and the Sellers
shall be entitled to receive such Final Adjustment Amount in accordance with
their respective Pro Rata Shares. In such event, (A) within five (5) Business
Days of the final determination of the Final Adjustment Amount, Parent shall
pay such Final Adjustment Amount to the Paying Agent, and the Paying Agent
shall distribute to the applicable Sellers each such Sellers respective
portion of the Final Adjustment Amount in accordance with such Sellers Pro

Representative and Parent shall promptly (but in any event within five (5)
Business Days of the final determination of the Final Adjustment Amount)
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow

Agent, and the Paying Agent shall distribute to the applicable Sellers each
such Sellers respective portion of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds
in accordance with such Sellers Pro Rata Share as set forth on the Allocation

an In-the-Money Option, the Paying Agent shall deposit with the Surviving
Corporation any portion of such amounts that are payable to such holder, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, through the Surviving
Corporations payroll system, no later than the first regularly scheduled
payroll date occurring not earlier than five (5) Business Days

 



12

portion of such amount payable in accordance with such holders Pro Rata Share
specified in the Allocation Schedule, and in such circumstances, the amount
deposited with the Paying Agent shall be reduced accordingly.

 

(ii) If the Final Adjustment Amount is negative (in which case the "Final
Adjustment Amount" for purposes of this clause (ii) shall be deemed to be
equal to the absolute value of such amount) and the absolute value thereof is
equal to or greater than $250,000, the Aggregate Initial Merger Consideration
shall be adjusted downwards in an amount equal to the Final Adjustment
Amount, and Parent shall be entitled to receive such Final Adjustment Amount.

 

(A) If such Final Adjustment Amount does not exceed the amount of available
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds, Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days
of the final determination of the Final Adjustment Amount) deliver a joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent to pay to Parent the Final Adjustment
Amount by wire transfer from the funds available in the Escrow Account to one
(1) or more accounts designated in writing by Parent to the Escrow Agent, and
the remaining Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds shall be paid to the
Paying Agent, and the Paying Agent shall promptly distribute to each Seller
its respective portion of the remaining Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds
in accordance with such Sellers Pro Rata Share as set forth on
the Allocation Schedule; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any
payment to a former holder of an In-the-Money Option, the Paying Agent shall
deposit with the Surviving Corporation any portion of such amount payable to
such holder, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, through the
Surviving Corporations payroll system, no later than the first regularly
scheduled payroll date occurring not earlier than five (5) Business Days
following such deposit, to distribute to each such holder such holders
portion of such amount payable in accordance with such holders Pro Rata Share
specified in the Allocation Schedule, and in such circumstances, the amount
deposited with the Paying Agent shall be reduced accordingly.

 

(B) If such Final Adjustment Amount exceeds the amount of available
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds, Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days
of the final determination of the Final Adjustment Amount) deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent to pay to Parent all of the Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Funds by wire transfer from the funds available in the
Escrow Account to one (1) or more accounts designated in writing by Parent to
the Escrow Agent, and the Sellers, on a several and not a joint basis, shall
promptly (but in any event within ten (10) Business Days of the final
determination of the Final Adjustment Amount) pay to Parent the remaining
amount of the Final Adjustment Amount that exceeds the amount of the Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Funds.

 



13

    

(iii) If the Final Adjustment Amount is positive and is less than
$250,000, or if the Final Adjustment Amount is negative and the absolute value
of the Final Adjustment Amount is less than $250,000, then (A) the Aggregate
Initial Merger Consideration shall not be adjusted and no portion of
the Final Adjustment Amount shall be payable to any Party; and (B) the
Stockholder Representative and Parent shall promptly (but in any event within
five (5) Business Days of the final determination of the Final Adjustment
Amount) deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the
Escrow Agent to deliver the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds to the
Paying Agent, and the Paying Agent shall distribute to the applicable Sellers
each such Sellers respective portion of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Funds in accordance with such Sellers Pro Rata Share as set forth on the
Allocation Schedule; _provided_ that, with respect to any payment to a former
holder of an In-the-Money Option, the Paying Agent shall deposit with the
Surviving Corporation any portion of such amounts that are payable to such
holder, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, through the
Surviving Corporations payroll system, no later than the first regularly
scheduled payroll date occurring not earlier than five (5) Business Days
following such deposit, to distribute to each such holder such holders
portion of such amount payable in accordance with such holders Pro Rata Share
specified in the Allocation Schedule, and in such circumstances, the amount
deposited with the Paying Agent shall be reduced accordingly.

 

1.12 _Founder Proceeds Payments_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, each of the undersigned Founder Stockholders
hereby agrees and directs that such portion of the Aggregate Initial Merger
Consideration otherwise payable to such Founder Stockholder at the Closing
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.6(a)_ as is set forth on _Section_ __ _ 1.12_
of the Disclosure Schedule, which schedule shall set forth the specific amount
to be deducted with respect to each Founder Stockholder (such amount, which
shall include the amount of the Companys share of employment tax withholding
due in respect of the payments described below, in aggregate, the " _Founder
Proceeds Amount_ ") shall, in lieu of being paid to such Founder Stockholder,
instead be paid to the Company in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.6(a)(ix)_
for further distribution to such Persons, in such respective amounts, and
subject to such conditions, in each case, as is set forth on _Section_ __ _
1.12_ of the Disclosure Schedule (such Persons, the " _Founder Proceeds
Recipients_ "). The Founder Proceeds Amount payable to the Founder Proceeds
Recipients shall be paid through the Surviving Companys payroll system on the
first regularly scheduled payroll date occurring not earlier than five (5)
Business Days following the Effective Time, subject in each case to deduction
or withholding with respect to the making of such payment under any Tax Law.
For avoidance of doubt, (A) such distribution of the Founder Proceeds Amount
to the Founder Proceeds Recipients shall not reduce or affect in any way the
Pro Rata Share of any of the Founder Stockholders (or any other Seller) or
Founder Proceeds Recipients, nor shall it increase, decrease, or affect in
any way the calculations of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, the Aggregate
Common Stock Merger Consideration, or the Aggregate Preferred Stock Merger
Consideration (other than by decreasing the actual amounts payable to
the Founding Stockholders pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.6(a)(vi)_); (B) no
Founder Proceeds Recipient shall be deemed to be a "Seller" for purposes of
this Agreement unless such Founder Proceeds Recipient is otherwise a "Seller"
in connection with such Founder Proceeds Recipients status as a Stockholder
or a holder of In-the-Money Stock Options; and (C) the Founder Proceeds
Amount shall be excluded in its entirety from the definitions of Indebtedness,
Net Working Capital and

 



14

    

 Transaction Expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no payment of any
Founder Proceeds Amount shall be made to the extent any such payment would
constitute an "excess parachute payment" as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of
the Code. The Company, the Founder Stockholders, and the Stockholder
Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, agree that neither Parent,
Acquisition Corp., the Surviving Corporation, nor any of their respective
Affiliates shall be liable for any Losses to any Person, including any Founder
Proceeds Recipient, arising out of a claim asserted by any Founder Proceeds
Recipient, any Seller, or any third party, in each case, in connection
with the payment of the Founder Proceeds Amount, including any failure of the
Company or any Founder Stockholder to correctly calculate or allocate payment
of the Founder Proceeds Amount and any Taxes arising out of the payment of the
Founder Proceeds Amount to the Founder Proceeds Recipients as directed
hereby.

1.13 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,

(a) On or prior to the date hereof, Parent has delivered to the Company a
correct and complete copy of an executed commitment letter (including all
exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto, and as amended, modified,
supplemented, replaced or extended from time

 



37

    

 to time after the date hereof in compliance with _Section_ __ _ 4.7_, the "
_Debt Commitment Letter_ ") from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the "
_Initial Lender_ "), to provide Parent with the financing described therein,
subject to the terms and conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter (the " _Debt
Financing_ "), and the related fee letter (as amended, modified,
supplemented, replaced or extended from time to time after the date hereof in
compliance with _Section_ __ _ 4.7_, the " _Fee Letter_ "); provided that the
Fee Letter may be redacted to remove any fees, pricing and other
economic terms and other sensitive information that would not adversely
affect the conditionality, availability or enforceability of the Debt
Financing.

 

(b) The Debt Commitment Letter is a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Parent, and to the knowledge of Parent, each other party thereto, enforceable
against each such party in accordance with its terms, in each case except as
such enforceability may be limited by applicable insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting creditors rights
generally, and applicable equitable principles (whether considered in a
proceeding at law or in equity). As of the date hereof, (i) the Debt
Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified, (ii) no such amendment or
modification is pending or contemplated (other than any amendment or
modifications that would not be prohibited by _Section_ __ _ 4.7_), (iii) the
respective commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letter have not
been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect, (iv) no event has
occurred that would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent under
any term or condition of the Debt Commitment Letter and (v) no other contracts
or arrangements to which Parent is a party as of the date hereof exist which
would impose conditions to the funding in full of the Debt Financing under the
Debt Commitment Letter or could otherwise reasonably be expected to affect the
availability of the funding in full of the Debt Financing under the Debt
Commitment Letter.

(c) Parent has fully paid or caused to be fully paid any and all
commitment fees or other fees required to be paid in connection with the Debt
Commitment Letter that are payable on or prior to the date hereof. There are

reasonably be expected to (i) prevent or substantially delay the availability
of the full amount of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter at the Closing or (ii) affect the enforceability of the Debt Commitment
Letter. Assuming the Debt Financing is funded in accordance with the Debt
Commitment Letter, the net proceeds contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter will in the aggregate, together with Parents available cash and cash
equivalents, be sufficient for Parent to satisfy all of the payment
obligations of Parent under this Agreement, including (i) paying the
Aggregate Initial Merger Consideration and (ii) paying all fees and expenses
incurred by it or for which it is responsible in connection with this
Agreement. As of the date hereof, Parent does not have any reason to believe
that any of the conditions to the Debt Financing will fail to timely be
satisfied or that the full amount of the Debt Financing will be unavailable on
or prior to the Closing Date. The Debt Commitment Letter is not subject to
any conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make
the applicable amount of the Debt Financing available to Parent at the Closing
other than as set forth therein. Parent has no Knowledge, as of the date
hereof, that any Debt Financing Source will not perform its funding
obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with its terms and
conditions.

obligation to contemplate the transactions contemplated hereby is not
conditioned or contingent on Parents ability to obtain any Debt Financing or
any financing in lieu thereof.

except for the specific representations and warranties made by the Company in
_Article_ __ _ 2_ hereof and the related portions of the Disclosure Schedule
and any representations or warranties made pursuant to the Ancillary
Agreements and other agreements and documents contemplated hereby, it is not

officer, director, employee, agent or advisor thereof, nor upon the accuracy
of any record, projection or statement made available or given to Parent
or Acquisition Corp. in the performance of such investigation and (b) it has
had such opportunity to seek accounting, legal or other advice or information
in connection with its entry into this Agreement and the other documents
referred to herein relating to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby as it has seen fit.

satisfied), and (iv) of any expiration or termination of the Debt Commitment
Letter. Parent shall provide the Company executed copies of the Financing
Agreements entered into prior to the Closing Date (provided that any fee
letters, engagement letters or other agreements that are confidential by their
terms may be redacted in a manner so as not to disclose such terms that are so
confidential, including to remove fees, pricing and other economic terms)
and copies of any of the written notices or communications described in the
preceding sentence; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this sentence or
the immediately preceding sentence shall require Parent to disclose any
information that (A) is subject to attorney-client privilege or consists of
attorney work product, (B) the disclosure of which would result in the breach
of any of Parents confidentiality obligations set forth in any Contract, or
(C) the disclosure of which would be prohibited under applicable Law.

(c) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes, or would reasonably be
expected to become, unavailable for any reason on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to obtain alternative financing, including from alternative sources,
on terms not materially less favorable, taken as a whole, than those set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, in an amount sufficient to replace any
unavailable portion of the Debt Financing and which do not include any
conditions to the consummation of such alternative debt financing that are
more onerous than the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter
(other than conditions that would not reasonably be expected to prevent,
impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby) (" _Alternative Financing_ ") as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event. Thereafter, all references to the Debt Financing
shall be deemed to include such Alternative Financing, and all references to
the Debt Commitment Letter and Debt Documents shall include the commitment
letter and any applicable documents for the Alternative Financing, as
applicable. Promptly following the Companys reasonable request, Parent shall
use reasonable best efforts to update the Company regarding the status of its
efforts to arrange any Alternative Financing; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent shall not be required to disclose any information that (A) is subject
to attorney-client privilege or consists of attorney work product, (B) the
disclosure of which would result in the breach of any of Parents
confidentiality obligations set forth in any Contract, or (C) the disclosure
of which would be prohibited under applicable Law.

(d) Parent shall not permit, without the prior written consent of the
Company, any material amendment, modification, supplement, replacements or
restatement to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the
Debt Commitment Letter or any Financing Agreement that would or would
reasonably be expected to (i) reduce the aggregate amount of net cash
proceeds available from the Debt Financing below the amount necessary to
finance the transactions to be consummated on the Closing Date, or (ii) impose
any new or additional condition, or otherwise amend, modify or expand any
condition, to the receipt of any portion of the Debt Financing, in each case,
in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (A) materially delay or
prevent consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby to be
consummated on the Closing Date, (B) make the funding of any portion of the
Debt Financing (or satisfaction of any condition to obtaining any portion of
the Debt Financing) materially less likely to occur, or (C) adversely affect
the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against any other party to any
Financing Agreement (collectively, with the Debt Commitment Letter, the "
_Debt Documents_ ") or the ability of Parent to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, (y) Parent shall be permitted to amend the Debt Commitment Letter
to add lenders, agents, co-agents, arrangers, bookrunners, managers or other
roles under the Debt Commitment Letter and (z) any amendment or modification
to any Debt Documents in connection with the exercise of any "market flex"
shall not be prohibited or otherwise limited by this  _Section_ __ _
4.7(d)_.

4.8 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their
respective representatives to, at Parents sole expense, provide to Parent
such cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is customary in
connection with Parents efforts to obtain the Debt Financing ( _provided_
that such requested cooperation is consistent with applicable Law and does not
unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries), including: (i) furnishing Parent and its Debt
Financing Sources as promptly as practicable with unaudited consolidated
balance sheets and related statements of income, stockholders equity, and
cash flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries, for each fiscal quarter ended
after the date of the Most Recent Financial Statements but at least forty
(40) calendar days before the Closing Date (collectively, the " _Required
Information_ "); (ii) making members of senior management with appropriate
seniority and expertise available (including by conference call) for a
reasonable number of meetings, presentations, and due diligence sessions;
(iii) providing all information reasonably requested by Parent or the Debt
Financing Sources regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries under applicable
"know your customer," anti-terrorism and anti-money laundering rules and

each case, requested at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date; (iv) assisting with the preparation of any Debt Documents as may be
reasonably requested by Parent; _provided_ that no obligation of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries under any such documentation shall be effective
until the Closing (other than as set forth in any authorization letter with
respect to the Debt Financing); and (v) assisting Parent and the
Debt Financing Sources in the preparation of bank information memoranda
(including, to the extent necessary, an additional bank information memorandum
that does not include material non-public information and executing customary
authorization letters) for any of the Debt Financing to the extent reasonably
requested by Parent. None of the Company or any of its respective Subsidiaries
or any of their respective representatives shall be required, under
the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 4.8(a)_ or otherwise in connection
with the Debt Financing (x) to pay any commitment or other similar fee prior
to the Closing that is not advanced by Parent or (y) to incur any
expense unless such expense is promptly reimbursed by Parent following
written request by the Company. Parent shall indemnify the Company and its
respective Subsidiaries and their respective representatives from and against
any and all losses, damages, awards, fines, penalties, expenses, fees, costs
and amounts paid in settlement in accordance with this Agreement (including
reasonable fees and reasonable expenses of counsel) suffered or incurred by
them in connection with (1) any action taken by them at the request of Parent
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.8_ or in connection with the arrangement of
the Debt Financing or (2) any information utilized in connection therewith,
except to the extent arising from (i) information provided by or on behalf of
the Company or its Affiliates or (ii) the bad faith, willful misconduct or
gross negligence of the Company or its Affiliates. Nothing contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 4.8_ or otherwise shall require the Company to be an issuer
or other obligor with respect to the Debt Financing prior to the Closing and,
until the Closing occurs, neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries nor their
respective representatives shall (1) be required to take any action that will
conflict with or violate their respective certificate of incorporation, by-
laws or comparable organizational documents or any Laws or orders or (2)
be required to pass resolutions or consents, approve or authorize the
execution of, or execute any document, agreement, certificate or instrument or
take any other corporate action with respect to the Debt Financing that is not
contingent on the Closing or that would be effective prior to the Closing
Date (other than customary authorization letters as described in clause (v)
above).

 



46

    

(b) All material, non-public information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries provided to Parent or its respective representatives pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 4.8_ shall be kept confidential by them in accordance
with  _Section_ __ _ 9.11(b)_, except for disclosure to Debt Financing
Sources and potential Debt Financing Sources as required in connection with
the Debt Financing subject to customary confidentiality protections.

Affiliates or any Person acting at the direction of the Parent or any of its
Affiliates taken or omitted to be taken on or after the date hereof pursuant
to this Agreement in the markets in which the Company operates shall not be
the basis for a Material Adverse Effect, shall not be a basis upon which the
Parents closing conditions set forth in _Sections 5.2(a)_ or _5.2(b)_ shall
fail to be satisfied and shall not excuse the Parent from performing its
obligations under this Agreement and consummating the transactions
contemplated hereby.

4.10 _Public Announcements_. Prior to the Closing, none of any of the
Stockholder Representative, the Company, the Parent or any of their respective

public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without prior consultation with the Parent, the
Stockholder Representative and any Seller to be named in such release or
announcement; _provided_ that the Parties hereto may make disclosures with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (a) as may
be required by applicable Law or listing agreement with or listing rule of a
national securities exchange, (b) to their respective employees, accountants,
advisors and other representatives as necessary in connection with the
ordinary conduct of their respective businesses to the extent such Persons
have a need to know the information contained in such disclosure(s), and (c)
in order to comply with the covenants contained in this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent and the Company shall cooperate to
prepare a joint press release to be issued on the Closing Date, which press
release shall be mutually acceptable to the Parent and the Company. After the
Closing Date, except as may be required by applicable Law or listing
agreement with or listing rule of a national securities exchange, no press
release related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein, or
other announcements to the employees or customers of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, shall be issued without prior written consent of the Parent,
the Stockholder Representative and any Seller to be named in such release or
announcement.

and representatives regarding, any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase
of equity interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any
merger, consolidation or other business combination involving the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, and the Company shall not, and shall take all action
necessary to ensure that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries, Affiliates or
representatives shall, directly or indirectly:

(a) solicit, initiate, consider, encourage or accept any other proposals or
offers from any Person (i) relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase of all or any portion of the shares of Company Capital Stock or other

 substantially all of the assets of the Company, other than services sold in
the Ordinary Course or (ii) to enter into any merger, consolidation or other
business combination relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or

(b) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish
to any other Person any information with respect to, or facilitate or
encourage any effort or attempt by any other Person to seek to do any of the
foregoing.

 

4.12 _R andW Insurance Policy_. The Parent shall purchase, on or prior to
the Closing Date a buyer-side representation and warranty insurance policy
(the " _R andW Insurance Policy_") to insure against Losses incurred by the
Parent as a result of the failure of any representation or warranty made by
the Company in this Agreement or by any Stockholder in a Letter of
Transmittal to be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and as of
the Closing Date (or as of a particular date, where such representation or
warranty is made only as of such particular date). Parent shall negotiate
such RandW Insurance Policy and shall provide the Stockholder Representative
with (a) the opportunity to review the RandW Insurance Policy prior to
finalizing and binding or issuing such policy and (b) a copy of the
RandW Insurance policy at the Closing. One half of the premium and associated

acknowledges and agrees that the Sellers shall not be liable as a result of
any rights of subrogation under the RandW Insurance Policy other than in the
case of fraud (as such term is defined in the RandW Insurance Policy) and that
Parent shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates not to) amend, terminate, or
waive any provision of the RandW Insurance Policy regarding the waiver of
subrogation against the Sellers set forth in the RandW Insurance Policy without
the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative.

4.13 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the date

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as determined immediately prior to
the Closing, " _Company Group Employee_ ") who remains employed immediately

welfare benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those
provided by Parent immediately prior to the Closing to similarly situated
employees of Parent or its Affiliates; and (iv) severance benefits (if any)
that are no less favorable than the practice, plan or policy in effect for
similarly situated employees of Parent.

 

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan or program maintained by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates (including, but
not limited to, any vacation or paid time-off) for any Continuing Employee,
for purposes of determining eligibility

 



48

    

 to participate, vesting, and levels of severance pay, vacation pay and other
paid time off entitlements, each Continuing Employees service with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as all service with any
predecessor employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary, to the extent
service with the predecessor employer is recognized by the Company or such
Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and/or an Affiliate thereof; _provided_ that such
service need not be recognized for benefit accrual purposes under any defined
benefit pension plan or to the extent such recognition would result in any
duplication of benefits or compensation.

maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates
for the benefit of any Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents), Parent, the Surviving Company or such Affiliate shall (i) cause
to be waived any eligibility waiting periods, actively-at-work requirements,
evidence of insurability requirements and the application of any pre-existing
conditions or limitations under such plan or program, and (ii) cause each
Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) to be given credit
under such plan or program for all amounts paid by such Continuing Employee
(or his or her eligible dependents) under any similar Employee Benefit Plans
for the plan year that includes the Closing Date for purposes of applying
deductibles, co-payments, coinsurance and out-of-pocket maximums as though
such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
applicable plan maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or such
Affiliate for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs.

(d) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that all
provisions contained in this _Section_ __ _ 4.13_ with respect to Company
Group Employees and Continuing Employees are included for the sole benefit of
the Company and Parent and that nothing in this _Section_ __ _
4.13_, whether express or implied, shall (i) be treated as an amendment or
other modification to any Employee Benefit Plan or other benefit or
compensation plan, agreement or other arrangement or (ii) create any third
party beneficiary or other rights (A) in any Person other than the parties to
this Agreement, including any Company Group Employees, former Company Group
Employees, Continuing Employees or any participant in any Employee Benefit
Plan (in each case who become bound by this Agreement) or any dependent or
beneficiary of any such Person, or (B) to continued employment, any separate
right to employment or any particular term of condition of employment of any
Person with the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries or

satisfactory written evidence thereof to Parent. Each of the Stockholders

"disqualified individual" under Section 280G(c) of the Code and who has a
right to any severance payments,

 



49

    

 accelerated vesting and payment of Stock Options, and other payments, which
would be deemed to constitute "parachute payments" under Section 280G of the
Code (the " _Potential 280G Payments_ "), a waiver (in a form reasonably
acceptable to Parent) of such persons rights to some or all of the potential
280G benefits (the " _Waived Benefits_ ") so that all remaining
Potential 280G Payments applicable to such person shall not be deemed to be
"parachute payments" that would not be deductible under Section 280G of the
Code and subject to the imposition of additional Tax under Section 4999 of the
Code; and (b) seek (in a form and manner reasonably acceptable to Parent)
approval of the Stockholders of payment of the Potential 280G Payments in a
manner that complies with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and Treasury

to start the period of twenty (20) days during which a Stockholder must
demand appraisal of such Stockholders Company Capital Stock as contemplated
by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL. All materials mailed to Stockholders
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 4.16_ shall be subject to Parents review

fully set forth herein. Any disclosure made in any Section of the Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosure made with respect to all
representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement,

the Disclosure Schedule. Such additional matters are set forth
for informational purposes and do not necessarily include other matters of a
similar nature. All references in the Disclosure Schedule to the
enforceability of agreements with third parties, the existence or non-
existence of third-party rights, the absence of breaches or defaults by third
parties, or similar matters or statements, are not intended to be admissions
against interests, be admissible against any Party by any Person who is not a

In addition, the disclosure of any matter in the Disclosure Schedule is not to
be deemed an admission that such matter actually constitutes noncompliance
with, or a violation of any Law, Order, Material Permit or Contract or other
topic to which such disclosure is applicable. The headings contained in the
Disclosure Schedule are for convenience of reference only and shall not be
deemed to modify or influence the interpretation of the information contained

9.11 _Waiver of Conflict_.

 

(a) Parent, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation) acknowledges and agrees that DLA Piper
LLP (US) (" _DLA Piper_ ") has acted as counsel for the Sellers and the
Company in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (the " _Acquisition Engagement_ "), and in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, DLA Piper has not acted as
counsel for Parent or any Affiliate thereof.

 

(b) Only the Sellers, the Company (prior to the Effective Time) and their
respective Affiliates shall be considered clients of DLA Piper in the
Acquisition Engagement. Parent, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates
(including after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) acknowledges and
agrees that all confidential communications between the Sellers, the
Company and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and DLA Piper, on
the other hand, in the course of the Acquisition Engagement, and any attendant
attorney-client privilege, attorney work product protection, and expectation
of client confidentiality applicable thereto, shall be deemed to belong
solely to the Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the Company), and not
the Company, and shall not pass to or be claimed, held, or used by the Parent
or the Surviving Corporation upon or after the Closing. Accordingly, the
Parent shall not have access to any such communications, or to the files of
DLA Piper relating to the Acquisition Engagement, whether or not the Closing
occurs. Without limiting the generality of the 

 



76

    

 foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (i) to the extent that files of DLA
Piper in respect of the Acquisition Engagement constitute property of the
client, only the Sellers and their Affiliates shall hold such property rights
and (ii) DLA Piper shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any
such attorney-client communications or files to the Surviving Corporation or
the Parent by reason of any attorney-client relationship between DLA Piper
and the Company or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding
the foregoing, DLA Piper shall not disclose any such attorney-client
communications or files to any third parties (other than representatives,
accountants and advisors of the Sellers and their Affiliates; _provided_ that
such representatives, accounts and advisors are instructed to maintain the
confidence of such attorney-client communications). If and to the
extent that, at any time subsequent to Closing, the Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) shall have
the right to assert or waive any attorney-client privilege with respect to any
communication between the Company or its Affiliates and any Person
representing them that occurred at any time prior to the Closing, the Parent,
on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the
Surviving Corporation) shall be entitled to waive such privilege only with
the prior written consent of the Sellers (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(c) The Parent, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including after the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation) acknowledges and agrees that DLA Piper
has acted as counsel for one or more of the Sellers, the Company and their
respective Affiliates for several years and that the Sellers reasonably
anticipate that DLA Piper may continue to represent them and/or their
Affiliates in future matters. Accordingly, the Parent, on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation)
expressly consents to DLA Pipers representation of the Sellers and/or their
Affiliates and/or any of their respective agents (if any of the foregoing
Persons so desire) in any post-Closing matter arising from this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement in which the interests of the Parent and the Surviving
Corporation, on the one hand, and the Sellers or any of their Affiliates, on
the other hand, are adverse.

(d) The Sellers, the Company and the Parent consent to the arrangements in
this _Section_ __ _ 9.11_ and waive any actual or potential conflict of
interest that may be involved in connection with any representation by DLA
Piper permitted hereunder.

HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF SUCH DISPUTE OR ANY
SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATED THERETO SHALL BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN

PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH THEY MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER
HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUCH DISPUTE BROUGHT IN SUCH COURT OR ANY

PROVIDED BY LAW.

 

9.13 _Specific Performance_. The Parties hereto agree that, if any of the
provisions of this Agreement or any other document contemplated by this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at law
would exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and, therefore, the
Parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof and
thereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties hereby acknowledge
and agree that the Company shall be entitled to specific performance to cause
Parent and Acquisition Corp. to effect the Closing if and only if (a) all of
the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.1_ and _Section_ __
_ 5.2_ have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature
would be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to

 



78

    

 such conditions being satisfied assuming a Closing would occur); (b) the
Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to Parent that the
Company stands ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing if specific
performance is granted and the Debt Financing is funded and Parent complies
with its obligations to effect the Closing pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, then the Closing would occur, (c) the amounts committed to be
funded under the Debt Commitment Letter have been funded or will be funded at
the Closing, and (d) Parent fails to consummate the Closing in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 1.2_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event
shall the Company or any Seller be entitled to (i) obtain both specific
performance pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.13_ and the Termination Fee or
(ii) seek specific performance after the Termination Fee has been paid in
full.

9.14 _No Third_ _-Party Beneficiary_. This Agreement is being entered
into solely for the benefit of the Parties, and, except as otherwise set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, the Parties do not intend that any other Person
shall be a third-party beneficiary of the covenants by either the Company or
the Parent contained in this Agreement.

 

9.15 _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment of any provision of this
Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by
the Parent and the Stockholder Representative. No waiver by any party of any
provision of this Agreement or any default, misrepresentation, or breach of
warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be valid
unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Party making such
waiver, nor shall such waiver be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent
default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder
or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent
such occurrence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_, _Section_ __ _ 6.3(b)_,  _Section_ __ _ 9.7_,
_Section_ __ _ 9.12(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.12(c)_, this _Section_ __ _ 9.15_
and _Section_ __ _ 9.18_ may not be amended, modified, waived or terminated
in a manner adverse in any material respect to any Debt Financing Source
without the prior written consent of such Debt Financing Source, and the Debt
Financing Sources shall be express third party beneficiaries of, and entitled
to enforce, such sections.

9.16 _Stockholder Representative_.

 

(a) By the execution and delivery of its respective Letter of Transmittal,
each Seller hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints Fortis Advisors LLC
as the true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact of such Seller with full
power of substitution to act jointly in the name, place and stead of the
Sellers with respect to the transfer of the shares of Company Capital Stock
owned by the Sellers to Parent in accordance with the terms and provisions of
this Agreement, and to act on behalf of the Sellers in any litigation
or arbitration involving this Agreement, to do or refrain from doing all such
further acts and things, and to execute all such documents as the Stockholder
Representative shall deem necessary or appropriate in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the power to (i)
execute and deliver all amendments, waivers, ancillary agreements, stock
powers, certificates and documents that the Stockholder Representative deems
necessary or appropriate in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) receive funds, make payments
of funds, and to withhold a portion of any amounts to be paid to the Sellers
hereunder or any other payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement to pay
any amounts that the Stockholder Representative has incurred or reasonably
expects to incur in connection with the

 



79

    

 Sellers obligations under this Agreement, including amounts required to pay
the fees and expenses of professionals incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) do or refrain from doing
any further act or deed on behalf of the Sellers that the Stockholder
Representative deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion relating
to the subject matter of this Agreement as fully and completely as the
Sellers could do if personally present, and (iv) receive service of process in
connection with any claims under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Stockholder Representative shall have no obligation to act
on behalf of the Sellers, except as expressly provided herein, in the Paying
Agent Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and in the Stockholder Representative
Engagement Agreement, and for purposes of clarity, there are no obligations of
the Stockholder Representative in any ancillary agreement, schedule, exhibit
or the Disclosure Schedule. The Stockholder Representative shall be entitled
to: (i) rely upon the Allocation Schedule, (ii) rely upon any signature
believed by it to be genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a signatory
has proper authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable Seller or other
Party.

 

(b) The appointment of the Stockholder Representative and the powers,
immunities and rights to indemnification granted to the Stockholder
Representative Group hereunder: (i) shall be deemed coupled with an interest
and shall be irrevocable, and survive the death, incompetence, bankruptcy or
liquidation of any Seller and shall be binding on any successor thereto, and
(ii) shall survive the delivery of an assignment by any Seller of the whole or
any fraction of his, her or its interest in the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Funds. Parent and any other Person may conclusively and
absolutely rely, without inquiry and without any liability whatsoever, upon
any action of the Stockholder Representative in all matters referred to
herein. The Sellers hereby confirm all that the Stockholder Representative
shall do or cause to be done by virtue of its appointment as the Stockholder
Representative of Sellers. All actions taken by the Stockholder Representative
under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement, or the
Stockholder Representative Engagement Agreement shall be binding upon each
Seller and such Sellers successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in
writing by such Seller, and all defenses which may be available to any Seller
to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the Stockholder Representative
taken in good faith under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Paying
Agent Agreement, or the Stockholder Representative Engagement Agreement are
waived.

 

(c) Certain Sellers have entered into an engagement agreement (the "
_Stockholder Representative Engagement Agreement_ ") with the Stockholder
Representative to provide direction to the Stockholder Representative in
connection with its services under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the
Paying Agent Agreement, and the Stockholder Representative Engagement
Agreement (such Sellers, including their individual representatives,
collectively hereinafter referred to as the " _Advisory Group_ "). The
Stockholder Representative shall act for all Sellers on all of the matters
set forth in this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement,
and the Stockholder Representative Engagement Agreement in the manner the
Stockholder Representative believes to be in the best interest of the Sellers
and consistent with the obligations under this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement, and the Stockholder Representative
Engagement Agreement but neither the Stockholder Representative nor its
members, managers, directors, officers, contractors, agents and employees nor
any member of the Advisory Group (collectively, the " _Stockholder
Representative Group_ ") shall be responsible to the Sellers for any losses or
damages the Sellers 

 



80

    

 may suffer by the performance of its duties under this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement, or the Stockholder Representative
Engagement Agreement. The Sellers shall fully indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Stockholder Representative Group from and against any losses,
claims, liabilities, fees, costs, expenses (including fees, disbursements and
costs of counsel and other skilled professionals and in connection with
seeking recovery from insurers), judgments, fines, amounts paid in settlement
or damages (collectively, the " _Stockholder Representative Expenses_ "),
other than any such Stockholder Representative Expenses arising from
willful violation of any applicable Law or gross negligence in the
performance of its duties as the Stockholder Representative under this
Agreement. Such Stockholder Representative Expenses may be recovered first,
from the Expense Reserve Account, and, second, from the Sellers. The
Stockholder Representative may, in all questions arising hereunder, rely on
the advice of counsel and other professionals, and for anything done, omitted
or suffered in good faith by the Stockholder Representative based on such
advice, the Stockholder Representative Group shall not be liable to anyone.
The Sellers acknowledge that the Stockholder Representative shall not be
required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial
liability in the exercise or performance of any of its powers, rights,
duties, or privileges or pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the
Paying Agent Agreement, the Stockholder Representative Engagement Agreement,
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Furthermore, the
Stockholder Representative shall not be required to take any action unless the
Stockholder Representative has been provided with funds, security, or
indemnities which, in its determination, are sufficient to protect
the Stockholder Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities
which may be incurred by the Stockholder Representative in performing such
actions. The immunities and rights to indemnification shall survive the
resignation or removal of the Stockholder Representative or any member of the
Advisory Group and the Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement.

 

(d) An amount equal to $250,000 or such lesser amount determined to be
reasonable by the Stockholder Representative (and set forth in a written
notice delivered by the Stockholder Representative to the Parent and the
Sellers at least three (3) days prior to the Closing Date) (the " _Expense
Reserve Amount_ ") shall be deducted from the Aggregate Initial Merger
Consideration to be distributed to the Sellers at the Closing, which Expense
Reserve Amount shall be maintained by the Stockholder Representative in a
segregated account (the " _Expense Reserve Account_ "). The Stockholder
Representative is not providing any investment supervision, recommendations or
advice and shall have no responsibility or liability for any loss of principal
of the Expense Reserve Account other than as a result of its gross negligence
or willful misconduct. The Stockholder Representative is not acting as a
withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection with the Expense
Reserve Account, and has no tax reporting or income distribution obligations.
The Stockholder Representative may withhold additional proceeds from the
Transactions from time to time received by it for deposit in the Expense
Reserve Account as it deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion to
ensure that sufficient funds are on deposit therein to satisfy any amounts
owed by the Sellers or the Stockholder Representative hereunder. In addition,
from time to time upon the request of the Stockholder Representative, each
Seller agrees to contribute such Sellers Pro Rata Share of any additional
amount that the Stockholder Representative deems necessary or advisable in its
sole discretion to deposit into the Expense Reserve Account. The Stockholder
Representative may use the funds in the Expense Reserve Account to pay the
Stockholder Representative Expenses incurred by the

 



81

    

 Stockholder Representative under the authorization granted in _Section_ __ _
9.16(a)_. Any Expense Reserve Amount remaining after payment of all of the
Stockholder Representatives expenses following the later of (i) the
resolution of all adjustments under _Section_ __ _ 1.11_ hereof and the
determination by the Stockholder Representative that such funds are no longer
necessary and (ii) the payment of the maximum amount recoverable by the
Parent from the Sellers, if any, shall be distributed to the Paying Agent
(prior to the date that is twelve (12) months following the Closing Date) or
the Surviving Corporation (following the date that is twelve (12) months
following the Closing Date) for further distribution to the Sellers, subject
to the terms of this Agreement and in accordance with each Sellers Pro Rata
Share, as set forth in the Allocation Schedule. The Stockholder
Representative shall hold, invest, reinvest, and disburse the Expense Reserve
Account in trust for all of Sellers, and the Expense Reserve Account shall not
be used for any other purpose and shall not be available to the Parent to
satisfy any claims hereunder. The Sellers will not receive any interest on the
Expense Reserve Account and assign to the Stockholder Representative any such
interest. Any Stockholder Representative Expense, Liability, or obligation
that the Stockholder Representative incurs or pays on behalf of a Seller or
group of Sellers shall be promptly reimbursed by the Seller(s) on whose behalf
such expenses were paid. In the event any Seller does not promptly reimburse
the Stockholder Representative for any such Stockholder Representative
Expense, Liability, or obligation, the Stockholder Representative shall have
the right to withhold and keep such amount from any payments to be made to
such Seller hereunder

 

(e) The Stockholder Representative shall promptly notify Parent in the
event of its replacement by a successor Stockholder Representative. If the
Stockholder Representative shall resign, dissolve, cease to exist or otherwise
be unable to fulfill its responsibilities as representative of the Sellers,
the Stockholders as of immediately prior to the Effective Time representing a
majority of the voting power of all such Capital Stock then outstanding (a "
_Stockholders Majority_ ") shall, within ten (10) days after the occurrence of
such event, appoint a successor representative and, promptly thereafter,
shall notify the Company of the identity of such successor. Any such successor
shall become the "Stockholder Representative" for purposes of this Agreement,
the Letters of Transmittal and the other documents contemplated hereby and
thereby. If for any reason there is no Stockholder Representative at any time,
all references herein or in the Letters of Transmittal or the other documents
contemplated hereby and thereby to the Stockholder Representative shall be
deemed to refer to the Stockholders themselves acting by a vote or written
consent of the Stockholders Majority, as applicable.

 

(f) Neither Parent, nor any of Parents Related Parties nor any agent,
consultant, legal, accounting, financial or other advisor or other
representative of such Person will be liable to the Company, any Seller, any
of their respective Affiliates, or any other Person as a result of, in
connection with, or relating to the performance of the
Stockholder Representatives duties and obligations under this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement or the Paying Agent Agreement, including with respect to any
errors in judgment, negligence, oversight, breach of duty or otherwise of the
Stockholder Representative. From and after the Closing, neither Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, nor any of Parents Related Parties nor any agent,
consultant, legal, accounting, financial, or other advisor or other
representative of such Person shall have any liability to the Stockholder
Representative, any Seller, or any other Person for (i) any calculation or
allocation under the Allocation Schedule, (ii) any amounts that have been paid
to the Sellers in accordance with the terms of the Allocation Schedule and
this Agreement, or (iii) any Stockholder Representative Expenses or funds,
security, or indemnities provided pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.16(c)_.

 



82

    

9.17 _Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The Fundamental
Representations made by the Company shall survive the Closing for a period
equal to the lesser of (y) six (6) years or (z) the applicable statute of
limitations, and all other representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement shall terminate at the Closing. Each covenant or agreement contained
in this Agreement that is to be performed prior to the Closing shall terminate
at the Closing, and each covenant or agreement of the Parties contained in
this Agreement that by its terms contemplates performance after the Closing
shall survive the Closing until termination thereof or completion of
performance thereof in accordance with their respective
terms. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this
_Section_ __ _ 9.17_ shall not limit any Partys right to bring claims or
seek recovery for Fraud in connection with any such representation or warranty
set forth in this Agreement. In addition, the Sellers shall, on a several and
not joint basis, indemnify and hold harmless Parent, Acquisition Corp., the
Surviving Corporation, and each of their respective Affiliates, against any
Losses arising from, resulting from, in connection with, or relating to (a)
any claim asserted by the Stockholder Representative, any Seller, or any third
party, in each case, in connection with any inaccuracy, error, or omission in
the Allocation Schedule, including any failure of the Company or the
Stockholder Representative to correctly calculate the amounts owing to a
Seller or to correctly distribute to any Seller the amounts of any payments
made by (or on behalf of) Parent to or for the benefit of the Sellers; (b)
any breach of duty or obligation by the Stockholder Representative in the
performance of the Stockholder Representatives duties and obligations under
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, or the Paying Agent Agreement; (c) any
Leakage (unless _Section_ __ _ 4.17_ has terminated pursuant to the last
sentence of _Section_ __ _ 4.17(c)_); and (d) any claim asserted by any
Founder Proceeds Recipient or any Seller in connection with the payment of
the Founder Proceeds Amount, including any failure of the Company or any
Founder Stockholder to correctly calculate or allocate payment of the Founder
Proceeds Amount and any Taxes arising out of the payment of the Founder
Proceeds Amount to the Founder Proceeds Recipients as directed by _Section_ __
_ 1.12_. The Parent acknowledges and agrees that, (i) from and after the
Closing, the Parent and its Affiliates shall not have any remedy against the
Sellers or their Affiliates, and neither the Sellers nor any other Person
shall have any liability to the Parent or any Affiliate thereof, for any
Losses arising out of or relating to (A) omissions, misstatements,
inaccuracies or breaches of the representations and warranties made by the
Company contained in this Agreement (other than with respect to the
Fundamental Representations made by the Company, for which the Sellers shall
be liable, on a several and not joint basis, subject to and in accordance
with this _Section_ __ _ 9.17_, and other than with respect to Fraud in
connection with any such representation or warranty), or (B) violations,
breaches or non-performance of any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement that is to be performed prior to the Closing, in each case,
regardless of the legal theory under which such liability or obligation
may be sought to be imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether
at law or in equity, or otherwise, and no claims with respect thereto may be
made against the Sellers or any Affiliate thereof; (ii) the Parents and
its Affiliates sole and exclusive remedy for such matters set forth in the
preceding _clause (i)(A)_ shall be against the RandW Insurance Policy; (iii) the
amount of any Losses under this _Section_ __ _ 9.17_ for which Sellers may
be liable shall be determined net of any amounts actually recovered (net of
all costs of collection) by the Parent and its Affiliates with respect to such
Losses under any insurance policy, including the RandW Insurance Policy; (iv)
the Parent and its

 Affiliates shall use commercially reasonably efforts to obtain full recovery
under the RandW Insurance Policy for any Loss indemnifiable under this _Section_
__ _ 9.17_ prior to seeking recovery from the Sellers, on a several and not
joint basis, in respect thereof; (v) the Sellers shall not become liable with
respect to the matters set forth in the preceding _clause (i)(A)_ (including
with respect to any Fundamental Representation) as a result of any rights of
subrogation under the RandW Insurance Policy (other than in the case of fraud,
as such term is defined in the RandW Insurance Policy), which subrogation rights
shall be limited to the rights of the Parent under this Agreement; and (vi)
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any Ancillary
Agreement, except in the case of Fraud, (A) in no event shall the maximum
amount of all Losses for which the Sellers may be liable under this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement exceed the Aggregate Merger Consideration and in no
event shall the maximum individual liability of any Seller under this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to which such Seller is a party exceed
such Sellers Pro Rata Share of the Aggregate Merger Consideration actually
paid to such Seller. The Parties hereto agree that, from and after the
Closing, except in the case of Fraud, and except with respect to disputes
under  _Section_ __ _ 1.11_ (which shall be resolved pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 1.11_), the sole and exclusive remedies of the parties for any Losses
based upon, arising out of, or otherwise in respect of this
Agreement (including representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements)
and the transactions contemplated hereby, whether based in contract, tort,
equity, or Law, or otherwise, are the indemnification and reimbursement
obligations of the parties set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 9.17_ and the
RandW Insurance Policy.

9.18 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may be enforced only against, and any
claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, may be brought only against, the
entities that are expressly named as Parties hereto and then only with respect
to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such Party.
With respect to each named Party to this Agreement, except in the case of
Fraud, no past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator,
member, manager, general or limited partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney, advisor, financing source or representative or Affiliate of any of
the foregoing Persons (each, a " _Non-Recourse Party_") shall have any
liability (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) for any one or more of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or
liabilities of such named Party or for any claim based on, arising out of, or
related to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the
rights of any Party against the other Parties to this Agreement, in no event
shall any Party or any of its Affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement
against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against, or (except in
the case of Fraud) seek to recover monetary damages from, any Non-Recourse
Party. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in no event shall any
party hereto be entitled to enforce this Agreement against, or raise any
action, claim, cause of action, suit, inquire, proceeding or investigation
against the Debt Financing Sources arising out of or related to the
transactions contemplated hereby, the Debt Financing or the performances of
the services with respect thereto); _provided_ that nothing in this _Section_
__ _ 9.18_ shall in any way limit or qualify the obligations and liabilities
of the parties to the Debt Commitment Letter to each other thereunder or in
connection therewith.
