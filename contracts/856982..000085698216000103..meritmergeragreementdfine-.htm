extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of
any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(e) For U.S. federal income and other applicable Tax purposes, and pursuant to
the terms of the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Funds shall be treated as the
property of the Parent and any income earned in respect of the Escrow Funds
shall be taxable to Parent and any Taxes owed in respect of the Escrow Funds
shall be paid by Parent, until such time as any Escrow Funds are released to
the Priority Preferred Stockholders (along with the amount of any interest or
other amounts earned thereon and less any disbursements therefrom, including,
without limitation, disbursements that shall be made to Parent for the payment
of any Taxes paid or payable by Parent with respect to any income earned in
respect of the Escrow Funds, in accordance with the Escrow Agreement).

Section 2.13 No Further Ownership Rights in Capital Stock.

All Merger Consideration, if any, paid or payable upon the surrender of

the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of
shares of Capital Stock on the stock transfer books of the Surviving

forth, in this Article II and elsewhere in this Agreement.

Section 2.14 Withholding Rights.

Each of Parent, the Distribution Agent, the Escrow Agent, Merger Sub and the

and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of
applicable Tax Law; provided, that, (i) the appropriate party shall give the
Stockholder Representative written notice of its intention to withhold and the
basis for any withholdings that are required to be made as soon as reasonably
practicable prior to the date of the applicable payment, and (ii) the parties
will use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or eliminate any such
required Tax withholdings to the fullest extent possible. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted and withheld by Parent, the Distribution Agent, the
Escrow Agent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, and
properly paid over to the applicable Governmental Authority such amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which Parent, the Distribution Agent, Escrow Agent,
Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, made such
deduction and withholding.

Section 2.15 Lost Certificates.

If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
H (a "Lost Certificate Affidavit") and, if required by the Parent or the
Distribution Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Parent or the Distribution Agent shall direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Distribution Agent, shall issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the portion of the Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the Priority Preferred Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate as contemplated under this Article II.

Section 2.16 Working Capital Adjustment.

(a) Closing Statement. The Company has prepared and delivered to Parent a
statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth its good faith estimate, as
of immediately prior to the Closing, of (i) Cash ("Estimated Cash"), (ii)
Working Capital ("Estimated Working Capital"), (iii) Indebtedness ("Estimated
Indebtedness"), (iv) Transaction Expenses ("Estimated Transaction Expenses"),
and (v) the resulting Closing Merger Consideration, which statement shall also
contain an estimated balance sheet of the Acquired Companies as of immediately
prior to the Closing (without giving effect to the transactions contemplated
herein). The estimated balance sheet upon which the calculations set forth in
the Closing Statement are based shall be prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Principles.

(b) Post-Closing Adjustment. Within 45 days after the Closing Date, Parent
shall prepare and deliver to the Stockholder Representative a statement (the
"Parent Closing Statement") setting forth its calculation, as of immediately
prior to the Closing, of the actual amount of (i) Cash ("Actual Cash"), (ii)
Working Capital ("Actual Working Capital"), (iii) Indebtedness ("Actual
Indebtedness"), (iv) Transaction Expenses ("Actual Transaction Expenses"), and
(v) the resulting Adjusted Closing Merger Consideration and Post-Closing
Adjustment, which statement shall also contain an actual balance sheet of the
Acquired Companies as of immediately prior to the Closing (without giving
effect to the transactions contemplated herein). The actual balance sheet upon
which the calculations set forth in the Parent Closing Statement are based
shall be prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles.

(c) Examination and Review.

(i) Examination. After receipt of the Parent Closing Statement, the
Stockholder Representative shall have thirty (30) days (the "Review Period")
to review the Parent Closing Statement. During the Review Period, the
Stockholder Representative shall have access to the books and records of the
Surviving Corporation, the personnel of, and work papers prepared by, Parent
and/or its accountants to the extent that they relate to the Parent Closing
Statement and to such historical financial information (to the extent in
Parent's possession) relating to the Parent Closing Statement as the
Stockholder Representative may reasonably request for the purpose of reviewing
the Parent Closing Statement and to prepare a Statement of Objections (defined below), provided, that, such access shall be
in a manner that does not interfere with the business operations of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation.

(ii) Objection. On or prior to the last day of the Review Period, the
Stockholder Representative may object to the Parent Closing Statement by
delivering to Parent a written statement setting forth his objections in
reasonable detail, indicating each disputed item or amount and the basis for
its disagreement therewith (the "Statement of Objections"). If the Stockholder
Representative fails to deliver the Statement of Objections before the
expiration of the Review Period, the Parent Closing Statement and the Post-
Closing Adjustment, as the case may be, reflected in the Parent Closing
Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Stockholder
Representative. If the Stockholder Representative delivers the Statement of
Objections before the expiration of the Review Period, Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such
objections within 30 days after the delivery of the Statement of Objections
(the "Resolution Period"), and, if the same are so resolved within the
Resolution Period, the Post-Closing Adjustment and the Parent Closing
Statement with such changes as may be agreed in writing by Parent and the
Stockholder Representative, shall be final and binding.

(iii) Resolution of Disputes. If the Stockholder Representative and Parent
fail to reach an agreement with respect to all of the matters set forth in the
Statement of Objections before expiration of the Resolution Period, then any
amounts remaining in dispute ("Disputed Amounts" and any amounts not so
disputed, the "Undisputed Amounts") shall be submitted for resolution to the
San Jose office of Grant Thornton or, if the San Jose office of Grant Thornton
is unable to serve, by an office of Grant Thornton appointed by mutual
agreement of the Parent and the Stockholder Representative, or no such other
office of Grant Thornton is able to serve, the Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall appoint by mutual agreement the office of an impartial
nationally recognized firm of independent certified public accountants (the
"Independent Accountant") who, acting as experts and not arbitrators, shall
resolve the Disputed Amounts only and make any adjustments to the Post-Closing
Adjustment, as the case may be, and the Parent Closing Statement. The parties
hereto agree that all adjustments shall be made without regard to materiality.
The Independent Accountant shall only decide the specific items under dispute
by the parties and their decision for each Disputed Amount must be within the
range of values assigned to each such item in the Parent Closing Statement and
the Statement of Objections, respectively.

(iv) Fees of the Independent Accountant. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountant shall be paid by the Stockholder Representative (on
behalf of the Stockholders) from the Stockholder Representative Expense Fund,
on the one hand, and by Parent, on the other hand, based upon the percentage
that the amount contested but not awarded to the Stockholder Representative or
Parent, respectively, bears to the aggregate amount contested by the
Stockholder Representative and Parent.

(v) Determination by Independent Accountant. The Independent Accountant shall
make a determination as soon as practicable within 30 days (or such other time
as the parties hereto shall agree in writing) after its engagement, and its
resolution of the Disputed Amounts and any adjustments to the Parent Closing
Statement and/or the Post-Closing Adjustment shall be consistent with the
Accounting Principles and shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties
hereto, absent manifest error.

(d) Payment of Post-Closing Adjustment.

(i) If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative number, the Stockholder
Representative and Parent shall, within three (3) Business Days after the
final determination of the Post-Closing Adjustment, jointly instruct the
Escrow Agent to disburse from the Escrow Fund by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to Parent, the positive amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment.

(ii) If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive number, Parent shall, within
three (3) Business Days after the final determination of the Post-Closing
Adjustment, deposit with the Distribution Agent, for distribution to the Preferred Stockholders in accordance with their
Pro Rata Shares, the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment.

(e) Adjustments for Tax Purposes. Any payments made pursuant to Section 2.16
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration by the parties
for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

Section 2.17 Consideration Spreadsheet.

(a) The Company has prepared and delivered to Parent a spreadsheet (the
"Consideration Spreadsheet"), certified by the Chief Financial Officer of the
Company (solely in his capacity as such), which sets forth, as of the Closing
Date, the following:

(i) the name and last known address of all Stockholders and the number, class
and series of Capital Stock held by each Stockholder;

(A) the Closing Merger Consideration, (B) any Post-Closing Adjustment, (C) any
returned Indemnification Escrow Funds, (D) any returned Integration Cost
Escrow Funds and (E) any returned Seller Representative Expense Funds.

(b) The parties agree that Parent, Distribution Agent and Merger Sub shall be
entitled to rely on the Consideration Spreadsheet in making payments under
Article II and Parent, Distribution Agent and Merger Sub shall not be
responsible for the calculations or the determinations regarding such
calculations in such Consideration Spreadsheet. The parties acknowledge and
agree that the Closing Merger Consideration, as adjusted from time to time
pursuant to this Agreement and giving effect to amounts released to the
Priority Preferred Stockholders from the Escrow Funds are intended to be
allocated among the Priority Preferred Stockholders consistent with the
Company Charter Documents and the DGCL, and the Stockholder Representative is
hereby authorized to update and deliver to Parent, the Distribution Agent, the
Escrow Agent and any other applicable Persons the Consideration Spreadsheet
from time to time to effectuate the foregoing, as necessary in the Stockholder
Representative's good faith judgment to provide for an allocation consistent
with the foregoing; provided, that, Parent, the Distribution Agent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to rely on the updated Consideration
Spreadsheet in making payments under Article II and Parent, the Distribution
Agent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be responsible for the
calculations or the determinations regarding such calculations in any updated
Consideration Spreadsheet.

Section 2.18 Integration Procedures.

(a) Integration Costs. Attached to this Agreement is an Integration Cost
Schedule, which sets forth the following estimated restructuring and
integration costs (the costs specified in clauses (i) through (iv) below and
no other costs, the "Integration Costs") that will be incurred by the
Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates during the nine (9) month period
immediately following the Closing Date (without duplication, the "Integration
Period"), as more fully described in the Integration Cost Schedule:

(i) the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with
terminating (or continuing until such time as all waiting periods under the
WARN Act or other applicable Law have expired, including any requirements
related to any work council, labor organization or Governmental Authority) the
employment of all employees of the Acquired Companies who are set forth on
Section 2.18(a)(i) of the Integration Cost Schedule (including the payment of
all accrued but unpaid wages and accrued but untaken paid time off, and the
payment of severance required by Law or otherwise consistent with the written policies, agreements or plans of the Acquired Companies) and any
amounts paid as severance to the Key Employees pursuant to their employment
agreements;

(ii) the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with
terminating or subleasing all Leased Real Property, less any amounts received
or saved in connection with subleasing any such Leased Real Property, as

(iii) the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with
winding down or terminating the Company's third party contracts set forth on
and as contemplated by Section 2.18(a)(iii) of the Integration Cost Schedule;
and

(iv) the other reasonable out-of-pocket restructuring and integration costs
(not to exceed $1,000,000 in the aggregate) associated with the winding down
of the Company's operations as contemplated by Section 2.18(a)(iv) of the
Integration Cost Schedule.

(b) Covenants During Integration Period.

(i) During the Integration Period, Parent shall, or shall cause Surviving
Corporation, within ten (10) Business Days of each monthly anniversary of the
Closing Date, prepare and deliver to the Stockholder Representative, a
statement setting forth in reasonable detail, (i) a detailed determination of
the Integration Costs incurred to date and (ii) a good faith estimate of the
Integration Costs required to be incurred through the remainder of the
Integration Period.

(ii) During the Integration Period, the Chief Executive Officer of Parent
shall, within ten (10) Business Days of the end of each fiscal quarter
commencing with the quarter ending September 30, 2016, meet with Greg Barrett
(or another individual designated by the Stockholder Representative) to review
the status of the winding down of the Company and the Integration Costs.

(c) Determination of Integration Costs; Distribution of the Integration Cost
Escrow Fund. On the last day of the Integration Period, Parent shall, or shall
cause Surviving Corporation to, prepare in good faith and deliver to the
Stockholder Representative an updated Integration Cost Schedule detailing all
Integration Costs incurred by the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates
during the Integration Period. After receipt of the updated Integration Cost
Schedule, the Stockholder Representative shall have a thirty (30) day Review
Period to review the updated Integration Cost Schedule and deliver a Statement
of Objections of the type contemplated by Section 2.16(c)(ii); provided, that,
the Stockholder Representative may only object with respect to expenses that:
(i) it believes, acting in good faith, were not incurred by the Surviving
Corporation or its Affiliates or (ii) are not Integration Costs. During such
Review Period, the Stockholder Representative shall have access to the books
and records of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, the personnel of, and
work papers prepared by Parent and/or its accountants to the extent that they
relate to the Integration Costs and to such historical financial information
(to the extent in Parent's or its Affiliates possession) relating to the
Integration Costs as the Stockholder Representative may reasonably request for
the purpose of reviewing the updated Integration Cost Schedule, provided,
that, such access shall be in a manner that does not interfere with the
business operations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation. If the Stockholder
Representative disputes whether an expense was incurred by the Surviving
Corporation or its Affiliates or was an Integration Cost, such dispute shall
be resolved in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.16(c)(iii), (iv)
and (v), as if (i) the disputed amount were the Disputed Amount, (ii) the
amount or eligibility of disputed expense were substituted for the definition
of Post-Closing Adjustment, and (iii) the definition of Integration Costs were
substituted for the definition of Accounting Principles. If the Stockholder
Representative fails to deliver a Statement of Objections during the Review
Period, then the Stockholder Representative shall be deemed to have consented
to Parent's determination of the actual amount of Integration Costs. Following
resolution of the actual amount of Integration Costs in accordance with this
Section 2.18(c): (x) if the Integration Costs do not exceed the Integration
Cost Target, then Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall promptly,
but in any event within three (3) Business Days of such determination, jointly
instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse (A) 50% of the Integration Cost Escrow Funds to the Surviving Corporation to be used for payment to the
participants in the Management Bonus Plan in accordance with the terms
thereof, (B) 50% of the Integration Cost Escrow Funds, less the employer
portion of Taxes (including amounts under FICA, Medicare or other Laws) owed
by the Surviving Corporation with respect to the amounts payable pursuant to
the Management Bonus Plan in accordance with the foregoing clause (A), to the
Distribution Agent for further payment to the Priority Preferred Stockholders
in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares of such amount, and (C) to the
Surviving Corporation, the amount deducted from the foregoing clause (B) for
the employer portion of Taxes as therein described; or (y) if the Integration
Costs exceed the Integration Cost Target, then Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall promptly, but in any event within three (3) Business Days
of such determination, jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse to (A)
Parent, solely from and only to the extent of the Integration Cost Escrow
Funds, the amount of such excess, and to the extent any Integration Cost
Escrow Funds remain following payment of any such excess, (B) (x) 50% of such
remaining Integration Cost Escrow Funds to the Surviving Corporation to be
used for payment to the participants in the Management Bonus Plan in
accordance with the terms thereof, (y) 50% of such remaining Integration Cost
Escrow Funds, less the employer portion of Taxes (including amounts under
FICA, Medicare or other Laws) owed by the Surviving Corporation with respect
to the amounts payable pursuant to the Management Bonus Plan in accordance
with the foregoing clause (x), to the Distribution Agent for further payment
to the Priority Preferred Stockholders in accordance with their Pro Rata
Shares of such amount, and (z) to the Surviving Corporation, the amount
deducted from the foregoing clause (y) for the employer portion of Taxes as
therein described.

(d) The sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and its Affiliates for
reimbursement in respect of any Excess Integration Costs shall be to seek
recovery from the Integration Cost Escrow Funds in accordance with this
Section 2.18; provided, that, the foregoing limitation shall not prohibit any
Parent Indemnitee from exercising any of its rights under Article VII, except
to the extent of any indemnifiable Losses actually recovered by Parent or any
of its Affiliates from the Integration Cost Escrow Funds.

of or default under), or, except as otherwise expressly provided for in this
Agreement, has provided or received any notice of any intention to terminate,

Leased Real Property, the current annualized rent payment thereunder
(including any property tax or other obligations determined by formula, which
may be set forth at the amount actual paid in 2015) and the expiration date of
the applicable lease. Except as set forth in Section 3.10(b) of the Disclosure

other instrument granting to any other Person any right to the possession,
lease, occupancy or enjoyment of any Leased Real Property. The use and
operation of the Leased Real Property in the conduct of the Acquired
Companies' business do not violate in any material respect any Law, covenant,
condition, restriction, easement, license, permit or agreement. No material
improvements constituting a part of the Leased Real Property encroach on real
property owned or leased by a Person other than an Acquired Company. There are
no Actions pending nor, to the Company's Knowledge, threatened against or
affecting the Leased Real Property or any portion thereof or interest therein
in the nature or in lieu of condemnation or eminent domain proceedings.

(d) The Leased Real Property comprises all of the Real Property used in, or
otherwise related to, the Acquired Companies' businesses; and no Acquired

Section 3.11 Title to Assets; Condition And Sufficiency of Assets.

The Acquired Companies own or have a valid right to use their property and
assets free and clear of all Liens, except for Permitted Encumbrances. With
respect to the property and assets they lease, the Acquired Companies are in
compliance with such leases and hold a valid leasehold interest. The
buildings, plants, structures, furniture, fixtures, machinery, equipment,
vehicles and other items of tangible personal property of the Acquired
Companies are in good operating condition and repair, and are adequate for the
uses to which they are being put, and none of such buildings, plants,
structures, furniture, fixtures, machinery, equipment, vehicles and other
items of tangible personal property is in need of maintenance or repairs
except for ordinary, routine maintenance and repairs that are not material in
nature or cost. The buildings, plants, structures, furniture, fixtures,
machinery, equipment, vehicles and other items of tangible personal property
currently owned or leased by the Acquired Company, together with all other
properties and assets of the Acquired Companies, are sufficient for the
continued conduct of the Acquired Companies' business after the Closing in
substantially the same manner as conducted prior to the Closing and constitute all of the rights, property and assets necessary to conduct the business of
the Acquired Companies as currently conducted.

Section 3.12 Intellectual Property.

application number, application date, registration/issue number,

required filings and fees related to the Company IP Registrations, which have
a due date prior to the Closing, have been timely filed with and paid to the
relevant Governmental Authorities and authorized registrars, and all Company
IP Registrations are otherwise in good standing (except where any of the
Acquired Companies has, in its reasonable business judgment and with Parent's
prior written consent, decided to cancel, abandon, allow to lapse or not renew
such Company IP Registrations and such Company IP Registrations are listed as
Intentionally Lapsed Registrations on Section 3.12(a) of the Disclosure
Schedules). The Company has provided Parent with physical access to true and
complete copies of file histories, documents, certificates, office actions,
correspondence and other materials related to all Company IP Registrations.

Agreements other than Off-the-Shelf Agreements, including all modifications,
amendments and supplements thereto and waivers thereunder. Each Company IP
Agreement is valid and binding on the respective Acquired Company in
accordance with its terms and is in full force and effect. Neither the
respective Acquired Company nor, to the Company's Knowledge, any other party
thereto is in breach of or default under (or is alleged to be in breach of or
default under), or has provided or received any notice of breach or default of
or any intention to terminate, any Company IP Agreement.

(c) The Acquired Companies are the sole and exclusive legal and beneficial,
and with respect to the Company IP Registrations, record, owner of all right,
title and interest in and to the Company Intellectual Property, and have the
valid right to use all other Intellectual Property used in or necessary for
the conduct of the Acquired Companies' current business or operations, in each
case, free and clear of Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances. For
the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing is not a representation or warranty
regarding infringement of third party Intellectual Property and such
representation and warranty is set forth exclusively in clause (f) below.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, an Acquired Company has
entered into binding, written agreements, substantially in the forms made
available to Parent, with every current and former employee and independent
contractor involved in the creation or development of any Intellectual
Property for or on behalf of any Acquired Company, whereby such employees and
independent contractors (i) assign to the respective Acquired Company any
ownership interest and right they may have in the Company Intellectual
Property; and (ii) acknowledge the respective Acquired Company's exclusive
ownership of all Company Intellectual Property. The Company has provided
Parent access to true and complete copies of all such agreements.

(d) The consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder will not
result in the loss or impairment of or payment of any additional amounts with
respect to, nor require the consent of any other Person in respect of, any
Acquired Company's right to own, use or hold for use any Intellectual Property
as owned, used or held for use in the conduct of the Acquired Companies'
business or operations as currently conducted.

(e) The Acquired Companies' rights in the Company IP Registrations (excluding
any applications therefor) are valid, subsisting and enforceable. The Acquired
Companies have taken all reasonable steps to maintain, protect and preserve
the confidentiality of all trade secrets included in the Company Intellectual Property, including requiring all Persons having access
thereto to execute written non-disclosure agreements.

(f) Except as disclosed on Section 3.12(f) of the Disclosure Schedules, the
conduct of the Acquired Companies' business as currently and formerly
conducted, and the products, processes and services of the Acquired Companies,
have not infringed, misappropriated, diluted or otherwise violated, and do not
currently infringe, dilute, misappropriate or otherwise violate the
Intellectual Property or other rights of any Person. To the Company's
Knowledge, no Person has infringed, misappropriated, diluted or otherwise
violated or is currently infringing, misappropriating, diluting or otherwise
violating, any Company Intellectual Property.

(g) There are no Actions (including any oppositions, interferences or re-
examinations) settled, pending, threatened in writing (including in the form
of offers to obtain a license), or to the Knowledge of the Company orally
threatened: (i) alleging any infringement, misappropriation, dilution or
violation of the Intellectual Property of any Person by any Acquired Company;
(ii) challenging the validity, enforceability, registrability or ownership of
any Company Intellectual Property or an Acquired Company's rights with respect
to any Company Intellectual Property; or (iii) by an Acquired Company alleging
any infringement, misappropriation, dilution or violation by any Person of the
Company Intellectual Property. No Acquired Company is subject to any
outstanding or prospective Governmental Order (including any motion or
petition therefor) that does or would restrict or impair the use of any
Company Intellectual Property.

distributed as "free software," "open source software" or under a similar

in the conduct of its current business. None of the Open Source Materials
creates, or purports to create, obligations for the Parent or any Acquired
Companies with respect to grant to any third party, any rights or immunities
under any Company Intellectual Property (including by requirement, as a
condition of use, modification or distribution of the Open Source Materials
that other software incorporated into, derived from or distributed with the

rise or serve as a basis for any such Action.

ARTICLE V 

COVENANTS

Section 5.01 Stockholders Consent.

(a) On the Closing Date, the Company shall obtain the Requisite Company Vote
pursuant to written consents of the Stockholders in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit I (the "Written Consent"). The materials submitted
to the Stockholders in connection with the Written Consent shall include the
Company Board Recommendation and all other materials required by the DGCL.
Promptly following receipt of the Written Consent, on the Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver a copy of such Written Consent to Parent.

(b) The Company has prepared and delivered to Parent a notice (the
"Stockholder Notice") to be sent to every Stockholder that did not execute the
Written Consent. The Stockholder Notice (i) includes a statement to the effect
that the Company Board unanimously determined that the Merger is advisable in
accordance with Section 251(b) of the DGCL and in the best interests of the
Stockholders and unanimously approved and adopted this Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) provides the Stockholders
to whom it will be sent with notice of the actions taken in the Written
Consent, including the approval and adoption of this Agreement, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with Section 228(e)
of the DGCL and the bylaws of the Company and (iii) notifies such Stockholders
of their dissent and appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, to
the extent not previously waived. The Stockholder Notice includes therewith a
copy of Section 262 of Delaware Law and all such other information as Parent
reasonably requested, and is sufficient in form and substance to start the
twenty (20) day period during which a Stockholder must demand appraisal of
such Stockholder's Capital Stock as contemplated by Section 262(d)(2) of the
DGCL.

(c) Promptly following the Closing Date, Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, the Stockholder Notice to each
Stockholder that did not execute the Written Consent at the addresses of each
such Stockholder set forth in the Consideration Spreadsheet.

Section 5.02 Public Announcements.

For a period of twenty (20) days following the Closing, Parent shall give the
Stockholder Representative a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
prior to making any press release or public announcement relating to the
existence or the subject matter of this Agreement. Except as otherwise
required by Law, the Priority Preferred Stockholders shall not issue any press
release or make any public announcement relating to the existence or the
subject matter of this Agreement, and shall keep the existence of this
Agreement and its terms confidential, until after July 6, 2016; provided,
that, any such press releases or public announcements made after such date
shall include only factually accurate information. Section 5.03 Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation by each Acquired Company now existing
in favor of each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date
hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer, managing member,
manager, director or equivalent Person of any Acquired Company (each, a "DandO
Indemnified Party") as provided in the Organizational Documents, in each case
as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other Contracts
in effect on the date hereof and disclosed in Section 3.09 of the Disclosure
Schedules, shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger,
without further action, at the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and
shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and, in
the event that any proceeding is pending or asserted or any claim made during
such period, until the final disposition of such proceeding or claim.

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, Parent shall not, and
shall not permit the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to,
amend, repeal or modify any provision in their respective certificate of
incorporation, by-laws or other organizational documents (collectively, the
"Organizational Documents") relating to the indemnification, exculpation or
advancement of expenses of any DandO Indemnified Parties (unless required by
applicable Law), it being the intent of the parties that the officers,
managing members, managers, directors and equivalent Persons of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and any other person who is entitled to indemnification
under the Organizational Documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the date of this Agreement, as applicable, that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than the relevant provisions in place in such Organizational
Documents as applicable immediately prior to the Closing, and shall continue
to be entitled to such exculpation and indemnification to the full extent of
applicable Law.

(c) Effective as of the Closing, the Acquired Companies have obtained "tail"
insurance policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from the
Effective Time with at least the same coverage and amount and containing terms
and conditions that are not less advantageous to the DandO Indemnified Parties
as the Acquired Companies' existing policies with respect to claims arising
out of or relating to events which occurred before or at the Effective Time
(including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement)
(the "DandO Tail Policy"). The Company shall bear the cost of the DandO Tail
Policy, and such costs, to the extent not paid prior to the Closing, shall be
included in the determination of Transaction Expenses. During the term of the
DandO Tail Policy, Parent shall not (and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
not to) take any action following the Closing to cause the DandO Tail Policy to
be cancelled or any provision therein to be amended or waived; provided, that
neither Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor any Affiliate thereof shall be
obligated to pay any premiums or other amounts in respect of such DandO Tail
Policy.

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, honor the indemnification and other
obligations set forth in this Section 5.03.

Section 5.04 Documents and Information. Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall, until the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date, retain all
books, records and other documents pertaining to the business of the Acquired
Companies in existence on the Closing Date and make the same available for
inspection and copying by the Stockholder Representative (at the Stockholder
Representative's own expense) solely for bona fide reporting and compliance
purposes during normal business hours of Parent and the Surviving Corporation,
upon reasonable request and reasonable notice. ARTICLE VI 

TAX MATTERS

Section 6.01 Tax Covenants.

(a) Without the prior written consent of Parent, prior to the Closing, the
Acquired Companies shall not make, change or rescind any Tax election, or
amend any Tax Return, or otherwise take any action, that would have the effect
of materially increasing the Tax liability of Parent or the Acquired Companies
in respect of any Post-Closing Tax Period other than elections made and
actions taken that are consistent with the past Tax accounting and reporting
practices of the Acquired Companies.

(b) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, or stamp taxes, and any other
similar Taxes imposed in connection with the transfer of shares of Capital
Stock pursuant to this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents shall be borne
and paid by the applicable Stockholder to which such Taxes relate when due.
The Person(s) required to do so by applicable Law shall timely file any Tax
Return or other document with respect to such Taxes, as necessary or
appropriate (and Parent shall cooperate with respect thereto as necessary).

(c) Parent shall not without the prior written consent of the Stockholder
Representative (i) cause or permit any Acquired Company to take any action
outside the ordinary course of business on the Closing Date if such action
increases the Taxes for which Stockholders are responsible under this Article
VI or (ii) make any election under Code Sections 336(e) or 338, or under any
similar provisions of state or local or other applicable Tax Laws, with
respect to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.02 Tax Returns.

(a) Parent shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed by any of the Acquired Companies
after the Closing Date with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and for any
Straddle Period. Any such Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with past practice (unless otherwise required by Law) and, if such Tax Return
may give rise to a reimbursement or indemnification obligation on the part of
the Priority Preferred Stockholders under Section 7.02, such Tax Return shall
be submitted by Parent to the Stockholder Representative (together with
schedules, statements and, to the extent requested by the Stockholder
Representative, supporting documentation) at least sixty (60) days prior to
the due date (including extensions) of such Tax Return. If the Stockholder
Representative objects to any item on any such Tax Return that relates to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period, it shall, within thirty (30) days after delivery of
such Tax Return, notify Parent in writing that it so objects, specifying with
particularity any such item and stating the specific factual or legal basis
for any such objection. If the Stockholder Representative fails to object to
such position within such thirty (30) day period, the Stockholder
Representative shall be deemed to have agreed in writing to the position. If a
notice of objection shall be duly delivered, Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall negotiate in good faith and use their reasonable efforts
to resolve such items. If Parent and the Stockholder Representative are unable
to reach such agreement within ten (10) days after receipt by Parent of such
notice, the disputed items shall be resolved by the Independent Accountant and
any determination by the Independent Accountant shall be final. The
Independent Accountant shall resolve any disputed items within twenty (20)
days of having the item referred to it pursuant to such procedures as it may
require. The costs, fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be
borne by Parent and the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the Priority
Preferred Stockholders) in proportion to the relative level of conformity with
the positions ultimately adopted by the Independent Accountant (such that if a
party's original proposed positions are the same as the positions ultimately
adopted by the Independent Accountant, then such party shall bear no portion
of the relevant costs, fees, and expenses). The preparation and filing of any
Tax Return of any of the Acquired Companies that does not relate to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period shall be exclusively within the control
of Parent. Parent shall not amend any Tax Return with respect to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period or Straddle Period, or otherwise take any position on any Tax Return (other than a position ultimately adopted by the
Independent Accountant in accordance with this Section 6.02(a)) that may be
reasonably expected to result in an indemnification obligation of the Priority
Preferred Stockholders in respect of Indemnifiable Taxes under Section 7.02,
without the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative.

Section 6.03 Straddle Period.

In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a taxable period that
begins before and ends after the Closing Date (each such period, a "Straddle
Period"), the portion of any such Taxes that are treated as Pre-Closing Taxes
for purposes of this Agreement shall be:

(a) in the case of Taxes (i) based upon, or related to, income, receipts,
profits, wages, capital or net worth, (ii) imposed in connection with the
purchase, acquisition, sale, transfer or assignment of property, or (iii)
required to be withheld or otherwise relating to payroll, deemed equal to, in
each case, the amount which would be payable if the taxable year ended at the
close of the Closing Date; and

(b) in the case of other Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the
entire period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
days in the period ending through and including the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire period.

Section 6.04 Contests.

Parent agrees to give written notice to the Stockholder Representative of the
receipt after Closing of any written notice by any of the Acquired Companies,
Parent or any of Parent's Affiliates which involves the assertion of any
claim, or the commencement of any Action, in respect of which an indemnity may
be sought by Parent pursuant to Article VII (a "Tax Claim"). The Stockholder
Representative shall have the ability to elect to control the contest or
resolution of any Tax Claim for which the Priority Preferred Stockholders may
be liable for indemnification under Section 7.02; provided, however, that the
Stockholder Representative shall obtain the prior written consent of Parent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
before entering into any settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend such
claim; and, provided, further, that Parent shall be entitled to participate in
the defense of such claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such
purpose, the fees and expenses of which separate counsel shall be borne solely
by Parent.

Section 6.05 Cooperation and Exchange of Information.

The Stockholder Representative, the Company and Parent shall provide each
other with such cooperation and information as either of them reasonably may
request of the others in filing any Tax Return pursuant to this Section 6.05
or in connection with any audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes of the
Acquired Companies. Such cooperation and information shall include providing
copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with accompanying
schedules, related work papers and documents relating to rulings or other
determinations by tax authorities. Each of the Stockholder Representative, the
Company and Parent shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers,
records and other documents in its possession relating to Tax matters of the
Acquired Companies for any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until the expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to
which such Tax Returns and other documents relate, without regard to
extensions except to the extent notified by any of the other parties in
writing of such extensions for the respective Tax periods. Prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any Tax Returns, schedules and work
papers, records and other documents in its possession relating to Tax matters
of the Acquired Companies for any taxable period beginning before the Closing
Date, the Stockholder Representative, the Company or Parent (as the case may
be) shall provide the other parties with reasonable written notice and offer
the other parties the opportunity to take custody of such materials.

Section 6.06 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Any indemnification payments pursuant to Article VII shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Merger Consideration by the parties for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by Law.

ARTICLE VII 

INDEMNIFICATION

Section 7.01 Survival. Subject to the limitations and other provisions of this
Agreement, the representations and warranties contained herein shall survive
the Closing and shall remain in full force and effect until the date that is
eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date and shall expire at such time;
provided, however, that (a) the Fundamental Representations and the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.19 (Environmental
Matters) and Section 3.20 (Employee Benefit Matter) shall survive the Closing
until thirty (30) days after expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations and shall expire at such time and (b) the representations and
warranties contained in Section 3.22 (Taxes) shall survive the Closing until
thirty (30) days after the date on which no Tax Return for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period may be audited under applicable United States federal law, but not
later than the seven (7) year anniversary of the Closing Date, and shall
expire at such time. All covenants and agreements of the parties contained
herein shall survive the Closing until fully performed and shall expire when
fully performed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claims asserted in good
faith and in compliance with the requirements of this Agreement prior to the
expiration date of the applicable survival period shall not thereafter be
barred by the expiration of the relevant representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement and such claims shall survive until finally resolved. It is the
express intent of the parties that, if an applicable survival period as
contemplated by this Section 7.01 is shorter than the statute of limitations
that would otherwise have been applicable, then, by contract, the applicable
statute of limitations shall be reduced to the shortened survival period
contemplated hereby.

Section 7.02 Indemnification of Parent Indemnitees. Subject to the other terms
and conditions of this Article VII, each of Parent and its Affiliates
(including the Surviving Corporation) and their respective Representatives
(collectively, the "Parent Indemnitees"), shall be indemnified, reimbursed and
held harmless by the Priority Preferred Stockholders and pursuant to the RandW
Insurance Policy for any and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed
upon any of them based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of:

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of
the Company contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or instrument
delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this Agreement;

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation to
be performed by the Company (prior to the Effective Time) or by the Priority
Preferred Stockholders or the Stockholder Representative pursuant to this
Agreement;

(c) any claim made by any Stockholder, any Optionholder, any Equity Rights
Holder or any other alleged holder of any Capital Stock or rights to acquire
Capital Stock relating to such Person's rights with respect to the Merger
Consideration or the calculations and determinations set forth on the
Consideration Spreadsheet;

(d) any amounts (including costs and attorneys' fees) paid to the holders of
Dissenting Shares, including any interest required to be paid thereon, that
are in excess of what such holders would have received hereunder had such
holders not been holders of Dissenting Shares and all costs, expenses and
other Losses associated with any Actions or related correspondence,
discussion, investigations or other matters associated therewith;

(e) any Transaction Expenses or Indebtedness of any Acquired Company
outstanding as of the Closing to the extent not paid or satisfied by any
Acquired Company prior to the Closing, or if paid by Parent or Merger Sub at or prior to the Closing, to the extent not deducted in
the determination of Closing Merger Consideration or Adjusted Merger
Consideration;

(f) any Indemnifiable Taxes; or

(g) any fraud in the inducement by the Company prior to the Closing in
connection with the negotiation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 7.03 Indemnification of Stockholder Indemnitees. Subject to the other
terms and conditions of this Article VII, each Priority Preferred Stockholder
and its Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives (collectively,
the "Stockholder Indemnitees") shall be indemnified, reimbursed and held
harmless by Parent for any and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed
upon any of them based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of:

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of
Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or
instrument delivered by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or (following the
Effective Time) the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this Agreement; or

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation to
be performed by the Company or the Surviving Corporation (in each case, after
the Effective Time), Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 7.04 Certain Limitations. The indemnification provided for in Section
7.02 and Section 7.03 shall be subject to the following limitations:

(a) The Parent Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover any Losses
pursuant to Section 7.02(a) (except in the case of Losses resulting from (i)
breaches of the Fundamental Representations or (ii) fraud or intentional
misrepresentation by the Company) until the aggregate amount of Losses that
are indemnifiable pursuant to Section 7.02(a) exceed $975,000 (the
"Deductible"), in which case the Parent Indemnitees shall only be entitled to
recover Losses in excess of the Deductible;

(b) The Stockholder Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover any Losses
pursuant to Section 7.03(a) (except in the case of Losses resulting from (i)
breaches of the Fundamental Representations, (ii) fraud or intentional
misrepresentation by Parent or Merger Sub or (iii) fraud or intentional
misrepresentation by Surviving Corporation, but only with respect to actions
taken by Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time) until the aggregate
amount of Losses that are indemnifiable pursuant to Section 7.03(a) exceed the
Deductible, in which case the Stockholder Indemnitees shall only be entitled
to recover Losses in excess of the Deductible.

(c) The Parent Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover Losses pursuant to
Section 7.02(a) (except in the case of Losses resulting from (i) breaches of
the Fundamental Representations or (ii) fraud or intentional misrepresentation
by the Company) which in the aggregate exceed the Indemnification Escrow
Amount (the "Cap"); provided, however, that the aggregate amount of Losses
which the Parent Indemnitees may be entitled to recover (x) pursuant to
Section 7.02(a) resulting from breaches of the Fundamental Representations,
(y) pursuant to Section 7.02(a) resulting from fraud or intentional
misrepresentation by the Company, or (z) pursuant to Section 7.02(b), (c),
(d), (e) or (f) shall not exceed the Enterprise Value.

(d) No Priority Preferred Stockholder shall be liable hereunder for any Losses
which in the aggregate exceed such Priority Preferred Stockholder's
Indemnification Obligation Pro Rata Share of the Merger Consideration. (e) For purposes of this Article VII, any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty (other than those set forth in Section 3.06 or
Section 3.08) shall be determined without regard to any materiality, Material
Adverse Effect or other similar qualification contained in such representation
or warranty.

Section 7.05 Indemnification Procedures. The party making a claim under this
Article VII is referred to as the "Indemnified Party", and the party against
whom such claims are asserted under this Article VII is referred to as the
"Indemnifying Party". For purposes of this Article VII, (i) if Parent (or any
other Parent Indemnitee) comprises the Indemnified Party, then the
Indemnifying Party is the Priority Preferred Stockholders, and any references
to Indemnifying Party (except provisions relating to an obligation to make, or
right to receive, payments) shall be deemed to refer to the Stockholder
Representative acting on behalf of the Priority Preferred Stockholders, and
(ii) if Parent comprises the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party is
the Priority Preferred Stockholders, and any references to the Indemnified
Party shall be deemed to refer to Stockholder Representative acting on behalf
of the Priority Preferred Stockholders. Any payment due to the Priority
Preferred Stockholders as the Indemnified Party shall be paid by Parent to the
Distribution Agent for further distributions to the Priority Preferred
Stockholder(s) in accordance with this Agreement and the Distribution Agent
Agreement.

(a) Third Party Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives notice (whether or
not in writing) of the assertion or commencement of any Action made or brought
by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party
to this Agreement or a Representative of the foregoing (a "Third Party Claim")
against such Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is
obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified
Party shall give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice
thereof, but in any event not later than 30 calendar days after the
Indemnified Party's receipt of such notice of such Third Party Claim. The
failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by reason of such
failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Third Party
Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material written
evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, or by
giving written notice to the Indemnified Party within 30 days of its receipt
of written notice of such Third Party Claim from the Indemnified Party, to
assume the defense of any Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party's
expense and by the Indemnifying Party's own counsel, and the Indemnified Party
shall cooperate in good faith in such defense; provided, that, if the
Indemnifying Party is the Priority Preferred Stockholders, such Indemnifying
Party shall not have the right to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim
that (x) is asserted directly by or on behalf of a Person that is a supplier
or customer of any Acquired Company, or (y) seeks an injunction or other
equitable relief against the Indemnified Parties. In the event that the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, subject to
Section 7.05(b), it shall have the right to take such action as it deems
necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining
to any such Third Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the
defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the
Indemnifying Party's right to control the defense thereof. The fees and
disbursements of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified
Party, provided, that if in the reasonable opinion of outside counsel to the
Indemnified Party, (A) there are legal defenses available to an Indemnified
Party that are different from or additional to those available to the
Indemnifying Party; or (B) there exists a material conflict of interest
between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying
Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel to
the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or
defend such Third Party Claim, fails to notify the Indemnified Party in
writing of its election to defend as provided in this Section 7.05(a), or
fails to diligently prosecute the defense of such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party may, subject to Section 7.05(b), pay, compromise and defend
such Third Party Claim and seek indemnification for any and all Losses based
upon, arising from or relating to such Third Party Claim. The Stockholder
Representative and Parent shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable
respects in connection with the defense of any Third Party Claim, including
making available records relating to such Third Party Claim and furnishing, without
expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the
defending party, management employees of the non-defending party as may be
reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third Party
Claim.

(b) Settlement of Third Party Claims. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
except as provided in this Section 7.05(b). If a firm offer is made to settle
a Third Party Claim without leading to liability or the creation of a
financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party and
provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified
Party from all liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third Party
Claim and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such offer,
the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that effect to the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm
offer within ten days after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party
may continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim and in such event,
the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party under this Agreement as to
such Third Party Claim shall not exceed fees and costs incurred through such
date and the amount of such settlement offer. If the Indemnified Party fails
to consent to such firm offer and also fails to assume defense of such Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle the Third Party Claim upon the
terms set forth in (or upon terms substantially similar to) such firm offer to
settle such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the
defense thereof, it shall not agree to any settlement without the written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(c) Direct Claims. Any Action by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be
asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably
prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than 30 days after
the Indemnified Party becomes aware of facts or circumstances reasonably
likely to give rise to such Direct Claim. The failure to give such prompt
written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by reason of such failure. Such
notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable
detail, shall include copies of all written evidence thereof and shall
indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has
been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party
shall have 30 days after its receipt of such written notice to respond in
writing to such Direct Claim. The Indemnified Party shall allow the
Indemnifying Party and its professional advisors to investigate the matter or
circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what
extent any amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim and the
Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Party's investigation by
giving such information and assistance (including access to any Acquired
Company's premises and personnel and the right to examine and copy any
accounts, documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its
professional advisors may reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party does
not so respond within such 30 day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be
deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case the Indemnified Party shall
be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party
on the terms and subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

Section 7.06 Tax Claims. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the control of any Third Party Claim in respect of Taxes of any
Acquired Company shall be governed exclusively by Section 6.04 hereof.

Section 7.07 Payments; RandW Insurance Policy; Indemnification Escrow Fund.

(a) Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party, finally determined to
be payable pursuant to this Article VII or is required to be paid pursuant to
any Governmental Order, (i) if Parent is the Indemnifying Party, Parent shall
make payment of the full amount of indemnifiable Losses to the Indemnified
Party within five (5) Business Days of such determination by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Indemnified Party, or (ii) if the Priority
Preferred Stockholders are the Indemnifying Party, then, subject to Section 7.07(b) and Section 7.07(c), within five (5)
Business Days of such agreement, final determination or Governmental Order,
the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall jointly instruct the Escrow
Agent to pay promptly the full amount of indemnifiable Losses to the
Indemnified Party, up to the amount then remaining in the Indemnification
Escrow Fund, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
Indemnified Party.

(b) Any Losses payable to a Parent Indemnitee pursuant to Section 7.02(a)
(except in the case of Losses resulting from fraud or intentional
misrepresentation by the Company) or Section 7.02(f) shall be satisfied: (i)
first, from the Indemnification Escrow Fund, but only up to the RandW Insurance
Policy Retention Amount, (ii) second, to the extent coverage is available
under the RandW Insurance Policy, pursuant to the RandW Insurance Policy, up to
the RandW Insurance Policy Coverage Limit, and (iii) finally, from the

only in the case of Losses resulting from fraud or intentional
misrepresentation by the Company), or pursuant to Section 7.02(b), (c), (d),
(e) or (g), shall be satisfied: (i) first, from the amount then remaining in
the Indemnification Escrow Fund, and (ii) finally, by the Priority Preferred
Stockholders, severally but not jointly, in accordance with their respective
Indemnification Obligation Pro Rata Share of the amount by which such Losses
exceed the amount recovered pursuant to the foregoing clause (i).

(d) On the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent and the

the foregoing, and to the extent required by applicable law, each of the
parties shall take commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any of its
Losses. Except pursuant to a settlement agreed to by the Indemnifying Party,
the Indemnified Party will not waive or release any contractual right to
recover from any third party any Loss subject to indemnification hereunder
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party. Any Losses

any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation
set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement, shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in
this Article VII. Nothing in this Section 7.10 shall limit any party's right
to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which such party shall be entitled
or to seek any remedy on account of any fraud or intentional
misrepresentation. ARTICLE VIII 

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 8.01 Stockholder Representative

(a) By executing this Agreement, and by the consummation of the Merger and
receiving the benefits thereof, including the right to receive a portion of
the consideration payable in connection with the Merger, each Priority
Preferred Stockholder shall have irrevocably authorized and appointed the
Stockholder Representative as such Person's representative, agent and
attorney-in-fact to act on behalf of such Person with respect to this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Distribution Agent Agreement, and to
take any and all actions and make any decisions required or permitted to be
taken by the Stockholder Representative pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement or the Distribution Agent Agreement, including without limitation
the exercise of the power to:

(i) give and receive notices and communications on behalf of such Person;

(ii) authorize delivery to Parent of cash from the Integration Cost Escrow
Fund in satisfaction of any amounts owed to Parent pursuant to Section 2.18 or
from the Indemnification Escrow Fund in satisfaction of any amounts owed to
Parent pursuant to Section 2.16 or in respect of claims for indemnification
made by Parent pursuant to Article VII;

(iii) agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and
comply with orders or otherwise handle any other matters described in Section
2.16, Section 2.18 or Article VII;

(iv) litigate, arbitrate, resolve, settle or compromise any claim for
indemnification pursuant to Article VII;

(v) execute and deliver all documents necessary or desirable to carry out the
intent of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Distribution Agent
Agreement;

(vi) make all elections or decisions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement and the Distribution Agent Agreement;

(vii) engage, employ or appoint any agents or representatives (including
attorneys, accountants and consultants) to assist the Stockholder
Representative in complying with its duties and obligations; and

(viii) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the good faith judgment of
the Stockholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing.

Parent shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the Stockholder
Representative on all matters relating to this Agreement (including Article
VII) and shall be entitled to rely conclusively (without further evidence of
any kind whatsoever) on any document executed or purported to be executed on
behalf of any Priority Preferred Stockholder by the Stockholder
Representative, and on any other action taken or purported to be taken on
behalf of any Priority Preferred Stockholder by the Stockholder
Representative, as being fully binding upon such Person. Notices or
communications to or from the Stockholder Representative shall constitute
notice to or from each of the Priority Preferred Stockholders. Any decision or
action by the Stockholder Representative hereunder, including any agreement
between the Stockholder Representative and Parent relating to the defense,
payment or settlement of any claims for indemnification hereunder, shall
constitute a decision or action of all Priority Preferred Stockholders and
shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such Person. No Priority
Preferred Stockholder shall have the right to object to, dissent from, protest
or otherwise contest the same. The provisions of this Section 8.01, including
the power of attorney granted hereby, are independent and severable, are
irrevocable and coupled with an interest and shall not be terminated by any act of any one or Priority
Preferred Stockholders, or by operation of Law.

(k) The Stockholder Representative may resign at any time, and may be removed
for any reason or no reason by the vote or written consent of a majority in
interest of the Priority Preferred Stockholders according to each Priority
Preferred Stockholder's Pro Rata Share of the Closing Merger Consideration
(the "Majority Holders"); provided, however, in no event shall the Stockholder
Representative be removed without the Majority Holders having first appointed
a new Stockholder Representative who shall assume such duties immediately upon
the removal of the Stockholder Representative. In the event of the death,
incapacity, resignation or removal of the Stockholder Representative, a new
Stockholder Representative shall be appointed by the vote or written consent
of the Majority Holders. Notice of such vote or a copy of the written consent
appointing such new Stockholder Representative shall be sent to Parent, such
appointment to be effective upon the later of the date indicated in such
consent or the date such notice is received by Parent; provided, that until
such notice is received, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to rely on the decisions and actions of the prior Stockholder
Representative as described in Section 8.01(a) above.

(l) The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable to the Priority
Preferred Stockholders for actions taken or omitted in connection with this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Distribution Agent Agreement, except to
the extent such actions shall have been determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have constituted gross negligence or involved fraud, willful
misconduct or bad faith (it being understood that any act done or omitted
pursuant to the advice of counsel, accountants and other professionals and
experts retained by the Stockholder Representative shall be conclusive
evidence of good faith). The Priority Preferred Stockholders shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Stockholder Representative from and against any
and all losses, liabilities, claims, actions, damages, penalties, fines,
forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses ("Representative Losses"),
including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, arising out of or in
connection with the Stockholder Representative's execution and performance of
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Distribution Agent Agreement, in
each case as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; provided, that
in the event it is finally adjudicated that a Representative Loss was
primarily caused by the gross negligence, fraud, willful misconduct or bad
faith of the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholder Representative shall
reimburse the Priority Preferred Stockholders the amount of such indemnified
Representative Loss attributable to such gross negligence, fraud, willful
misconduct or bad faith. If not paid directly to the Stockholder
Representative by the Priority Preferred Stockholders, any such Representative
Losses may be recovered by the Stockholder Representative from (i) the funds
in the Stockholder Representative Expense Fund, (ii) the amounts in the
Indemnification Escrow Fund or the Integration Cost Escrow Fund, in each case,
at such time, if at all, as remaining amounts would otherwise be distributable
to the Priority Preferred Stockholders therefrom in accordance with the terms
hereof; provided, that, while this Section 8.01(c) allows the Stockholder
Representative to be paid from the Stockholder Representative Expense Fund,
the Indemnity Escrow Fund and the Integration Cost Escrow Fund, this does not
relieve the Priority Preferred Stockholders from their obligation to promptly
pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it
prevent the Stockholder Representative from seeking any remedies available to
it at law or otherwise. In no event will the Stockholder Representative be
required to advance its own funds on behalf of the Shareholders or otherwise.
Any restrictions or limitations on indemnity contained elsewhere in this
Agreement are not intended to be applicable to the indemnities provided to the
Stockholder Representative in this paragraph. The foregoing indemnities will
survive the resignation or removal of the Stockholder Representative or the
termination of this Agreement. The Priority Preferred Stockholders will not
receive any interest or earnings on the Stockholder Representative Expense
Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign to the Stockholder Representative any
ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any such interest or
earnings. The Stockholder Representative will not be liable for any loss of
principal of the Stockholder Representative Expense Fund other than as a
result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Stockholder
Representative will hold these funds separate from its corporate funds, will
not use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes
and will not voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the
event of bankruptcy. For tax purposes, the Stockholder Representative Expense
Fund will be treated as having been received and voluntarily set aside by the
Priority Preferred Stockholders at the time of Closing. The Stockholder
Representative Expense Fund shall be retained by the Stockholder
Representative until the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date
at which time the Stockholder Representative shall pay any amounts remaining
in the Stockholder Representative Expense Fund to the Distribution Agent for
further payment to the Priority Preferred Stockholders in accordance with
their Pro Rata Shares of any such amount; provided, that the Stockholder
Representative may, in its sole and reasonable discretion, retain all or any
portion of the Stockholder Representative Expense Fund for such longer period
as is reasonable necessary to satisfy its obligations hereunder (and shall
thereafter pay any amounts remaining in the Stockholder Representative Expense
Fund to the Distribution Agent for further payment to the Priority Preferred
Stockholders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares of any such amount).

Section 8.02 Expenses.

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all costs and expenses,
including, without limitation, fees and disbursements of counsel, financial
advisors and accountants, incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such
costs and expense.

Section 8.03 Notices.

All notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been
given (a) when delivered by hand (with written confirmation of receipt); (b)

For purposes of this Agreement, (a) the words "include," "includes" and
"including" shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation";
(b) the word "or" is not exclusive; and (c) the words "herein," "hereof,"
"hereby," "hereto" and "hereunder" refer to this Agreement as a whole. Unless
the context otherwise requires, references herein: (x) to Articles, Sections,
Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits mean the Articles and Sections of, and
Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits attached to, this Agreement; (y) to an
agreement, instrument or other document means such agreement, instrument or
other document as amended, supplemented and modified from time to time to the

construed without regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction or
interpretation against the party drafting an instrument or causing any
instrument to be drafted. The Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits referred to
herein shall be construed with, and as an integral part of, this Agreement to
the same extent as if they were set forth verbatim herein.

Section 8.05 Headings.

The headings in this Agreement are for reference only and shall not affect the
interpretation of this Agreement. Section 8.06 Severability.

If any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this
Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any
other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated
to the greatest extent possible.

supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings and agreements, both

inconsistency between the statements in the body of this Agreement and those
in the Ancillary Documents (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Exclusivity Fee Cancellation Agreement), the Exhibits and Disclosure Schedules
(other than an exception expressly set forth as such in the Disclosure
Schedules), the statements in the body of this Agreement will control.

Section 8.08 Successors and Assigns.

This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. No party

Affiliates or to any Person acquiring a material portion of the assets,
business or securities of Parent, whether by merger, consolidation, sale of
assets or securities or otherwise.

Section 8.09 No Third-party Beneficiaries.

This Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or

by reason of this Agreement, except as provided in Section 5.03 and Article
VII.

Section 8.10 Amendment and Modification; Waiver.

in writing signed by Parent and the Stockholder Representative; provided,
however, there shall be no amendment or waiver that, pursuant to applicable
Law, requires further approval of the Stockholders (or any subset thereof),
without the receipt of such further approvals. Any failure of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, on the one hand, or the Priority Preferred Stockholders
or the Stockholder Representative, on the other hand, to comply with any
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein may be waived by Parent
(with respect to any failure by the Priority Preferred Stockholders or the
Stockholder Representative) or by the Stockholder Representative (with respect
to any failure by Parent or the Surviving Corporation), respectively, only by
a written instrument signed by the party granting such waiver, but such waiver
or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

Section 8.11 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. (a) Except for provisions necessarily governed by the DGCL, this Agreement
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the
State of New York without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law
provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other
jurisdiction).

(b) ANY LEGAL SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS
AGREEMENT, THE ANCILLARY DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR

AMERICA LOCATED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK OR THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW
YORK, AND EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH
COURTS IN ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. SERVICE OF PROCESS, SUMMONS,
NOTICE OR OTHER DOCUMENT BY MAIL TO SUCH PARTY'S ADDRESS SET FORTH HEREIN
SHALL BE EFFECTIVE SERVICE OF PROCESS FOR ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING
BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT. THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE
ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR ANY PROCEEDING IN
SUCH COURTS AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE AND AGREE NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY SUCH
COURT THAT ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS
BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE

The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the
parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof to
prevent any breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement, in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties
hereto agree not to assert that a remedy of specific performance or other
equitable relief is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for
any reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide
an adequate remedy or that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at
law. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
this Section 8.12 shall not be required to provide any bond or other security
in connection with any such order or injunction. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, in no event shall this Section 8.12 be used, alone or
together with any other provision of this Agreement, to require any party to
remedy any breach of any representation or warranty of such party contained
herein.

an original, but all of which together shall be deemed to be one and the same
agreement. A signed copy of this Agreement delivered by facsimile, e-mail or
other means of electronic transmission shall be deemed to have the same legal
effect as delivery of an original signed copy of this Agreement.

(ii)To determine, consistent with Section 2(e), whether or not a transaction
or related series of transactions constitutes a Change of Control.

(iii)To determine eligibility for benefits and to determine bonus amounts
available under the Plan.

(iv)To establish, change and adjust, in its sole discretion but subject to the
last sentence of Section 2(m), the Bonus Amount for each Participant.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator shall not have the authority
to, and may not execute and deliver any Participation Agreement(s) that would
cause, or take any action that would otherwise result in, the aggregate Bonus
Amounts of all Participants to exceed the Bonus Pool at any time.

(c)The Administrator may delegate some or all of its powers and
responsibilities under the Plan, with the Board's consent, to one or more
officers of the Company, in which case references herein to the
"Administrator" shall also be deemed to refer to such delegated person(s).

(d)No member of the Board or any person acting in the capacity of
Administrator will be liable for any action or determination made by the
Administrator with respect to the Plan or any distribution paid under the
Plan. All expenses and liabilities that the Administrator incurs in connection
with the administration of this Plan shall be borne by the Company or its
successor. No members of the Board or person acting in the capacity of
Administrator shall be personally liable for any action, determination or
interpretation made in good faith with respect to this Plan or any
distribution paid hereunder, and all members of the Board and each person
acting in the capacity of Administrator shall be fully indemnified and held
harmless by the Company or its successor in respect of any such action,
determination or interpretation.



4.Eligibility.

Service Providers will only become "Participants" in the Plan by executing a
Participation Agreement provided to them by the Administrator. Other than any
Service Provider who ceases to be a Service Provider pursuant to a written
agreement or instrument (including but not limited to a letter or resignation,
a notice of termination or a severance agreement) terminating such
individual's service to the Company subject to, conditioned upon and effective
at or immediately prior to the Closing (such individual, a "Transition Service
Provider"), a Service Provider will cease to be a Participant at such time as
he or she ceases to be a Service Provider for any reason at any time prior to
the Closing. Any Transition Service Provider shall be deemed to be a Service
Provider and Participant at the Closing for purposes of this Plan. Only
Participants who are Service Providers at the Closing may receive payments
pursuant to the Plan.

| 
---|--- 

5.

|

Allocation of Bonus Pool. 

(a)The allocation of the Bonus Pool to individuals designated as Participants
shall be set forth in writing from time to time as determined by the
Administrator and specified in the applicable Participant's Participation
Agreement. Each Participant's payment under the Plan (his or her "Bonus
Amount") will be the amount set forth in such Participant's Participation
Agreement, as such amount may be modified pursuant to the terms of the Plan.
The aggregate of the Bonus Amounts set forth in the Participation Agreements
with all Participants may not exceed the Bonus Pool at any time.

(b)If a former Participant ceases to be a Participant at any time prior to the
Closing, such former Participant's Bonus Amount shall be forfeited and be
available for reallocation and distribution under this Plan at or prior to the
Closing as determined by the Administrator or pursuant to Section 5(c).

(c)In the event that the sum of the Bonus Amounts of all Participants at the
Closing is less than the amount of the Bonus Pool, then the amount by which
the Bonus Pool exceeds such sum (the "Unallocated Portion") 

shall be allocated among all Participants at the Closing by way of ratably
increasing the Bonus Amount of each such Participant in proportion to such
Participants' Bonus Amount immediately prior to such allocation of the
Unallocated Portion, so that after such allocation of the Unallocated Portion,
the sum of the Bonus Amounts of all Participants at the Closing is equal to
the Bonus Pool.



6.Distributions.

(a)If the conditions for distribution set forth in the Plan and a
Participant's Participation Agreement are satisfied, then on or after the
Closing Date, each Participant shall be entitled to receive from the Company
his or her Bonus Amount in one distribution at Closing.

(b)The Bonus Amounts shall be distributed to Participants as soon as
practicable after the Closing Date.

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, in the event that the
benefits provided for in this Plan, when taken together with any other
benefits otherwise payable to a Participant (such benefits, collectively, the
"Payments") (1) constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section
280G of the Code and (2) but for this Section 6(c), would be subject to the
excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, then the Participant's
Payments will be reduced and delivered as to such lesser extent which would
result in no portion of the Payments being subject to excise tax under Section
4999 of the Code (the "Excise Tax"). Unless the Company and the Participant
otherwise agree in writing, any determination required under this Section will
be made in writing by a nationally or regionally recognized certified public
accounting firm selected by the Company or such other person or entity to
which the Company and the Participant mutually agree (the "Firm"), whose
determination will be conclusive and binding upon the Participant and the
Company for all purposes. If a reduction in payments or benefits constituting
"parachute payments" is necessary so that no portion of the Payments is
subject to the Excise Tax, the reduction shall occur in the following order:
(1) reduction of cash payments under this Plan; (2) reduction of cash payments
constituting severance payable upon termination of employment; (3) reduction
of cash payments pursuant to other benefits paid or provided to the
Participant in connection with or as a result of a Change of Control; and (4)
acceleration of equity awards. In the event that acceleration of vesting of
equity awards is to be reduced, such acceleration of vesting shall be
cancelled in the reverse order of the date of grant for the Participant's
equity awards. If two or more equity awards are granted on the same date, each
award will be reduced on a pro‑rata basis. In no event shall the Participant
have any discretion with respect to the ordering of reductions in payments or
benefits. In the event of any reduction in the payment of any Bonus Amount to
a Participant under the Plan as a result of this Section 6(c), the amount of
such reduction shall be reallocated among all other Participants at the time
of such reduction by way of ratably increasing the Bonus Amounts of each such
other Participant in proportion to such other Participants' Bonus Amounts,
subject to the limitations of this Section 6(c); in the event that any portion
of any Bonus Amount remains unallocated after the application of this sentence
to each reduction in Bonus Amounts pursuant to this Section 6(c), such
unallocated portion shall not be payable under this Plan and the Bonus Pool
shall be reduced by such unallocated portion.



For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section, the Firm may
make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and
may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application
of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. The Company and the Participant will
furnish to the Firm such information and documents as the Firm may reasonably
request in order to make a determination under this Section. The Company will
bear all costs the Firm may reasonably incur in connection with any
calculations contemplated by this Section. Any good faith determinations of
the Firm made hereunder shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the
Company and the Participant.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent the Company submits any portion
of the Payments payable to such Participant to the Company's stockholders for
approval in accordance with Treasury Reg. Section 1.280G‑1 QandA 7, the
foregoing provisions shall not apply following such submission and the portion
of the Payments will be treated in accordance with the results of such vote,
except that any reduction in, or waiver of, any portion of the Payments
required by the results of such vote will be applied without any application
of discretion by the Participant and in the order prescribed by this Section
6(c).

| 
---|--- 

7.

|

Amendment or Termination of the Plan. 

(a)The Board may, at any time prior to the Closing, amend the Plan; provided,
however, that in no event may any amendment unilaterally impair the rights of
Participants (including, without limitation, reducing the Bonus Amount of any
Participant) without such Participant's written consent except as may be
required by applicable law or as necessary to correct an administrative error.
This Plan shall be assumed by any successor to or acquirer of the Company to
the extent that benefits remain payable under this Plan. 

(b)The Plan shall automatically terminate upon the completion of all payments
under the terms of the Plan. The Plan (including any obligation by the Company
to make payments under all then-outstanding Participation Agreements) shall
automatically terminate upon earlier to occur of any of the following events
if such event occurs prior to the Closing: (i) the closing date of a
recapitalization of the Company that results in the elimination of the
existing liquidation preferences with respect to all the outstanding shares of
the Company's preferred stock, (ii) the closing date of the Company's initial
public offering of its common stock pursuant to an effective registration
statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended; or (iii)
December 31, 2016.



| 
---|--- 

8.

|

No Equity Interest. 

Neither the Plan nor any distribution hereunder creates or conveys any equity
or ownership interest in the Company or any rights commonly associated with
such interests, including, without limitation, the right to vote on any
matters put before the stockholders of the Company.

| 
---|--- 

9.

|

No Guarantee of Future Service. 

Neither the designation of a Service Provider as a Participant nor the
execution of a Participation Agreement shall provide any guarantee or promise
of continued service of the Participant with the Company (or any Parent or
Subsidiary), and the Company (or any Parent or Subsidiary employing a
Participant) retains the right to terminate the employment or service of any
Service Provider at any time, with or without cause, for any reason or no
reason, except as may be restricted by law or contract.

| 
---|--- 

10.

|

Tax Withholding. 

The Company shall withhold or cause to be withheld from any distributions
under the Plan any amount required to satisfy the Company's income, employment
and other tax withholding obligations under federal, state and other
applicable law. By executing a Participation Agreement, Participant
acknowledges that the Company cannot and has not guaranteed that the Internal
Revenue Service will determine that the Plan benefits are not deferred
compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the
regulations and guidance thereunder ("Section 409A"). Each Service Provider
agrees that if the Internal Revenue Service determines that the Plan benefits
are deferred compensation, Participant shall be solely responsible for
Participant's costs related to such a determination, if any.

| 
---|--- 

11.

|

Funding. 

The Plan shall be funded out of the Company's general assets. No provision of
the Plan shall require the Company, for the purpose of satisfying any
obligations under the Plan, to purchase assets or place any assets in a trust
or other entity to which contributions are made or otherwise to segregate any
assets, nor shall the Company maintain separate bank accounts, books, records
or other evidence of the existence of a segregated or separately maintained or
administered fund for such purposes. Participants shall have no rights under
the Plan other than as unsecured general creditors of the Company.

| 
---|--- 

12.

|

Bonus Plan. 

The Plan is intended to be a "bonus program" as defined under U.S. Department
of Labor Regulation 2510.3‑2(c) and shall be construed and administered in
accordance with such intention.

| 
---|--- 

13.

|

Nonassignability. 

The Company may not assign, sell, transfer, delegate or otherwise dispose of
any rights or obligations under any Participation Agreement unless the Board
reasonably believes that the assignee or transferee has sufficient resources
to satisfy the obligations under such Participation Agreement. No Participant
may assign, sell, transfer, delegate or otherwise dispose of, whether
voluntarily or involuntarily, or by operation of law, any rights or
obligations under any Participation Agreement without the Administrator's
prior written consent other than by will, by the laws of descent and
distribution or pursuant to a domestic relations order.

| 
---|--- 

14.

|

Code Section 409A. 

The Company and each Participant will work together in good faith to consider
either (i) amendments to the Plan; or (ii) revisions to the Plan with respect
to the payment of any bonus amounts, which are necessary or appropriate to
avoid imposition of any additional tax or income recognition prior to the
actual payment to the Participant under Section 409A. It is intended that this
Plan is exempt from or comply with Section 409A to the extent applicable. 

| 
---|--- 

15.

|

Choice of Law. 

All questions concerning the construction, validation and interpretation of
the Plan will be governed by the law of the State of California without regard
to its conflict of laws provisions.

| 
---|--- 

16.

|

Headings.

deemed to constitute a part hereof nor to affect the meaning thereof.

| 
---|--- 

17.

|

Successors and Assigns. 

Subject to Section 13, the Plan shall be binding upon and shall inure to the
benefit of the Company and its successors and assigns, and upon a Change of
Control the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
acquirer to assume the Company's obligations and liabilities hereunder.
Subject to Section 13, each Participation Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the Participant and his or her heirs, executors,
administrators or permitted successors or assigns.

EXHIBIT A

DFINE, Inc.

2016 CHANGE OF CONTROL Incentive Plan

PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT

To: _________________

DFine, Inc. (the "Company") has designated you as a "Participant" who is
eligible to participate in the DFine, Inc. 2016 Change of Control Incentive
Plan (the "Plan"). By signing and returning this Participation Agreement, you
will become a "Participant" in the Plan. Your participation in the Plan is
contingent upon your continued employment with or service as service provider
to the Company up to the date of a "Change of Control" (as defined in the
Plan) and your agreement to the terms of the Plan and this Participation
Agreement. The terms of the Plan are incorporated by reference and, in the
case of any conflict between this Participation Agreement and the terms of the
Plan, the terms of the Plan will govern. Defined terms capitalized but not
defined in this Participation Agreement have the meanings assigned to them in
the Plan.

For purposes of the Plan, your "Bonus Amount" is $_______________________.

As noted in the Plan, Bonus Amounts may only be earned if there is a Closing
of a Change of Control transaction. Whether you earn the right to receive your
potential Bonus Amount is governed by the Plan. You hereby acknowledge that
the Company is an "at will" employer. That means that you and the Company have
the right to terminate your employment or consulting relationship at any time,
with or without advance notice, and with or without cause. Nothing in this
Participation Agreement changes the "at will" nature of your employment or
consultancy.

In consideration of your designation as a Participant and as a material
inducement to the Company entering into this Participation Agreement and
providing you with the opportunity to receive the Bonus Amount, which you
acknowledge exceeds any amounts to which you otherwise may be entitled under
the Company's policies and practices or applicable law, you and your
representatives completely release from, and agree to not file, cause to be
filed or pursue against, the Company, its affiliated, related, parent or
subsidiary companies, and its present and former directors, officers,
stockholders and employees (the "Released Parties") all claims, complaints,
grievances or charges of any kind, known and unknown, which you may now have
or have ever had against any of them, or arising out of your relationship with
any of them, including all claims for compensation and bonuses, attorneys'
fees, and all claims arising from your employment with the Company or the
termination of your employment, whether based on contract, tort, statute,
local ordinance, regulation or any comparable law in any jurisdiction
("Released Claims"). By way of example and not limitation, Released Claims
shall include any claims arising under Title VII of the Civil 

Rights Act of 1964, the federal Worker Adjustment Retraining Notification Act
("WARN Act") under 29 U.S.C. § 2102 et seq., the California WARN Act,
California Labor Code § 1400 et seq., the Americans with Disabilities Act, the
Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and the California Fair Employment and
Housing Act (or any comparable law in any jurisdiction). You represent that
you have not filed or initiated or caused to be filed or initiated any
lawsuits, claims, complaints, administrative grievances or charges against any
Released Party in any court or with any government agency. You expressly
covenant and warrant that you have not assigned or transferred to any person
or entity any portion of any claims that are waived, released and/or
discharged herein.

You also agree that because this release specifically covers known and unknown
claims, you waive your rights under Section 1542 of the California Civil Code
or any other comparable statute of any jurisdiction, which states as follows:

A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT TO THE DEBTOR.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, you and the Company acknowledge and agree that
you are not waiving or being required to waive any right that cannot be waived
as a matter of law, including the right to file a charge with or participate
in an investigation by a governmental administrative agency; provided,
however, that you hereby disclaim and waive any right to share or participate
in any monetary award resulting from the prosecution of such charge or
investigation. You further agree that, to the extent permissible by law, you
will provide the Company at least five (5) days prior written notice of any
such charge or investigation.

You and the Company agree that this Participation Agreement is not an
admission of guilt or liability on the part of you or the Company under any
federal, state or local law, whether statutory or common law. Liability for
any and all claims is expressly denied by you and the Company.

You agree that you will keep information about the Plan confidential both
within and outside of the Company except to the extent necessary to enforce
your rights hereunder or as otherwise required under applicable law. This
information includes, but is not limited to, your participation levels and
benefits and confidential information about employees, the Company's
operations, strategies and management, information related to the Plan and
non-public information related to the Change of Control transaction
("Confidential Information"). You understand and agree that you will not
reveal any Confidential Information without the express written consent of the
Company except to the extent necessary to enforce your rights hereunder or as
otherwise required under applicable law, provided, however, that you may
disclose Confidential Information to your personal lawyer or tax and financial
advisors for the purposes of personal legal, tax, financial and estate
planning advice. The Company has the right to cancel any Bonus Amounts
otherwise payable to you under the Plan following any unauthorized disclosure
of any Confidential Information by you.

You understand and agree that discussing, revealing or in any way
communicating the Confidential Information to a non‑authorized person or
entity is grounds for immediate termination of employment or other service
relationship.

You acknowledge and agree that payments under the Plan shall be subject to all
applicable federal, state and local withholding taxes that the Company
reasonably determines should be withheld with respect to such payments.

By their signatures below, you and the Company agree that the Plan and any
Bonus Amounts are governed by this Participation Agreement and by the
provisions (specifically including, but not limited to, the conditions
precedent to receiving a distribution under the Plan and the amendment
provisions) of the Plan, a copy of which is attached to and made a part of
this document. You acknowledge receipt of a copy of the Plan, represent that
you have read and are familiar with its provisions and acknowledge that
decisions and determinations by the Administrator under the Plan shall be
final and binding on you.

In consideration of the promises and agreements of the Parties and the Escrow

sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties and the Escrow Agent
agree as follows:



ARTICLE 1

ESCROW DEPOSIT



Section 1.1. Deposit and Receipt of Escrow Property. At the Closing, Parent
shall deliver to the Escrow Agent (i) $9,750,000 representing the
Indemnification Escrow Amount, and (ii) $5,000,000 representing the
Integration Cost Escrow Amount (the Indemnification Escrow Amount and the
Integration Cost Escrow Amount, collectively, the "Escrow Property"). The
Escrow Agent agrees to hold the Indemnification Escrow Amount and the
Integration Cost Escrow Amount (together with any additional Escrow Property
earned thereon) in separate accounts. The Escrow Property in the account into
which the Indemnification Escrow Amount is deposited shall hereafter be
referred to as the "Indemnification Escrow Fund" and the Escrow Property in
the account into which the Integration Cost Escrow Amount is deposited shall
hereafter be referred to as the "Integration Cost Escrow Fund". This Escrow
Agreement shall not change or modify in any way the events or circumstances
which give rise to the obligation to make any payments under the Merger
Agreement, the conditions thereto or limitations thereon, but shall solely
provide Parent Indemnitees security therefor.



Section 1.2. Investments.



(a) The Escrow Agent is authorized and directed to deposit, transfer, hold and
invest the Escrow Property and any investment income thereon as set forth in
Exhibit A hereto or as set forth in any subsequent written instruction signed

disbursed in accordance with Section 1.3, Section 1.5(a) or Section 1.6 of
this Escrow Agreement.



(b) The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized and directed to sell or redeem any
such investments as it deems necessary to make any payments or distributions
required under this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall have no
responsibility or liability for any loss which may result from any investment
or sale of investment made pursuant to this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent
is hereby authorized, in making or disposing of any investment permitted by
this Escrow Agreement, to deal with itself (in its individual capacity) or
with any one or more of its affiliates, whether it or any such affiliate is
acting as agent of the Escrow Agent or for any third person or dealing as
principal for its own account. The Parties acknowledge that the Escrow Agent
is not providing investment supervision, recommendations, or advice.



(c) The Parties agree that confirmations of permitted investments are not
required to be issue by the Escrow Agent for each month in which a monthly

if no activity occurred in such fund or account during such month. The Parties
may obtain confirmations at no additional cost upon its written request.



Section 1.3. Disbursements. The Escrow Agent shall disburse the Escrow
Property as follows:



(a) Payment of Post-Closing Adjustment. Pursuant to Section 2.16(d)(i) of the
Merger Agreement, if the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative number, the
Stockholder Representative and Parent shall, within three (3) Business Days
after the final determination of the Post-Closing Adjustment, provide Joint
Direction (as defined in Section 1.3(d)) to the Escrow Agent to disburse to
Parent from the Indemnification Escrow Fund, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, an amount equal to the absolute value of the Post-Closing
Adjustment. Within two (2) Business Days following the Escrow Agent's receipt
of such Joint Direction, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to Parent from the
Indemnification Escrow Amount the positive amount of the Post-Closing
Adjustment as set forth in such Joint Direction and pursuant to wire
instructions delivered by Parent to the Escrow Agent.

(b) Indemnification Escrow Claims.



(i) If, at any time, and from time to time, on or before 5:00 p.m. MT on
January 1, 2018, (the "Indemnification Release Date"), Parent determines that
Parent or any Parent Indemnitee it is entitled to indemnification under
Article VII of the Merger Agreement (an "Indemnification Claim"), Parent shall
deliver a written notice (an "Indemnification Claim Notice") to the
Stockholder Representative, with a copy to the Escrow Agent, which sets forth
a description of such Indemnification Claim and the estimated amount (which
may be updated from time to time), if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that
has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party (the "Indemnification
Claim Amount").

Period, or if the Stockholder Representative acknowledges the validity of the
Indemnification Claim by written notice to Parent and the Escrow Agent during
the Objection Period, within two (2) Business Days following the earlier of

Escrow Agent to disburse (A) to Parent, solely from and only to the extent of
the Integration Cost Escrow Fund, the amount of such excess, and (B) to the

Section 1.4. Security Procedure For Funds Transfers. The Escrow Agent shall
confirm each funds transfer instruction received in the name of a Party by
means of the security procedure selected by such Party and communicated to the
Escrow Agent through a signed certificate in the form of Exhibit B-1 or
Exhibit B-2 attached hereto, which upon receipt by the Escrow Agent shall
become a part of this Escrow Agreement. Once delivered to the Escrow Agent,
Exhibit B-1 or Exhibit B-2 may be revised or rescinded only by a writing
signed by an authorized representative of the Party. Such revisions or
rescissions shall be effective only after actual receipt and following such
period of time as may be necessary to afford the Escrow Agent a reasonable
opportunity to act on it. If a revised Exhibit B-1 or B-2 or a rescission of
an existing Exhibit B-1 or B-2 is delivered to the Escrow Agent by an entity
that is a successor-in-interest to such Party, such document shall be
accompanied by additional documentation satisfactory to the Escrow Agent
showing that such entity has succeeded to the rights and responsibilities of
the Party under this Escrow Agreement.



The Parties understand that the Escrow Agent's inability to receive or confirm
funds transfer instructions pursuant to the security procedure selected by
such Party may result in a delay in accomplishing such funds transfer, and
agree that the Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any loss caused by any
such delay.



Section 1.5. Income Tax Allocation and Reporting.



(a) The Parties agree that, for tax reporting purposes, all interest and other
income from investment of the Escrow Property shall, as of the end of each
calendar year and to the extent required by the Internal Revenue Service, be
reported as having been earned by Parent, whether or not such income was
disbursed during such calendar year. Notwithstanding anything in this Escrow
Agreement to the contrary, in connection with any distribution of Escrow
Property pursuant to Section 1.3, the Escrow Agent shall calculate the amount
of interest and other taxable income from investment of the Escrow Property
being distributed as of such date and distribute 35% of such amount to Parent
prior to making any further distribution of Escrow Property.

(b) For certain payments made pursuant to this Escrow Agreement, the Escrow
Agent may be required to make a "reportable payment" or "withholdable payment"
and in such cases the Escrow Agent shall have the duty to act as a payor or
withholding agent, respectively, that is responsible for any tax withholding
and reporting required under Chapters 3, 4, and 61 of the United States
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). The Escrow Agent shall
have the sole right to make the determination as to which payments are
"reportable payments" or "withholdable payments." All parties to this Escrow
Agreement shall provide an executed IRS Form W-9 or appropriate IRS Form W-8
(or, in each case, any successor form) to the Escrow Agent prior to the date
hereof, and shall promptly update any such form to the extent such form
becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect. The Escrow Agent shall have the
right to request from any party to this Escrow Agreement, or any other person
or entity entitled to payment hereunder, any additional forms, documentation
or other information as may be reasonably necessary for the Escrow Agent to
satisfy its reporting and withholding obligations under the Code. To the
extent any such forms to be delivered under this Section 1.5(b) are not
provided prior to the date hereof or by the time the related payment is
required to be made or are determined by the Escrow Agent to be incomplete
and/or inaccurate in any respect, the Escrow 

Agent shall be entitled to withhold (without liability) a portion of any
interest or other income earned on the investment of the Escrow Property or on
any such payments hereunder to the extent withholding is required under
Chapters 3, 4, or 61 of the Code, and shall have no obligation to gross up any
such payment.



(c) To the extent that the Escrow Agent becomes liable for the payment of any
taxes in respect of income derived from the investment of the Escrow Property,
the Escrow Agent shall satisfy such liability to the extent possible from the
Escrow Property. Parent and the Stockholder Representative (solely on behalf
of the Priority Preferred Stockholders and in its capacity as the Stockholder
Representative, not in its individual capacity), jointly and severally, shall
indemnify, defend and hold the Escrow Agent harmless from and against any tax,
late payment, interest, penalty or other cost or expense that may be assessed
against the Escrow Agent on or with respect to the Escrow Property and the
investment thereof unless such tax, late payment, interest, penalty or other
expense was directly caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the Escrow Agent. The indemnification provided by this Section 1.5(c) is in
addition to the indemnification provided in Section 3.1 and shall survive the
resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent and the termination of this Escrow
Agreement.



(d) The Parties hereto acknowledge that, in order to help fight the funding
of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all
financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that
identifies each person or corporation who opens an account and /or enters into
a business relationship. The Parties hereby agree that they shall provide the
Escrow Agent with such information as the Escrow Agent may request including,
but not limited to, each Party's name, physical address, tax identification
number and other information that will assist the Escrow Agent in identifying
and verifying each Party's identity such as organizational documents,
certificates of good standing, licenses to do business, or other pertinent
identifying information.



Section 1.6. Termination. This Escrow Agreement shall terminate on the later
of (i) January 30, 2018, or (ii) upon the disbursement of all of the Escrow
Property in accordance with the terms of Section 1.3, including any interest
and investment earnings thereon, except that the provisions of Sections
1.5(c), 3.1 and 3.2 hereof shall survive termination and the Escrow Agent is
authorized and directed to disburse the Escrow Property in accordance with
Section 1.3 of this Escrow Agreement.

confirm transactions, including funds transfer instructions, on behalf of
["___________"], and that the option checked in Part III of this Exhibit B-1
is the security procedure selected by ["___________"] for use in verifying
that a funds transfer instruction received by the Escrow Agent is that of
["___________"].



["___________"] has reviewed each of the security procedures and has
determined that the option checked in Part III of this Exhibit B-1 best meets
its requirements; given the size, type and frequency of the instructions it
will issue to the Escrow Agent. By selecting the security procedure specified
in Part III of this Exhibit B-1, ["___________"] acknowledges that it has
elected to not use the other security procedures described and agrees to be
bound by any funds transfer instruction, whether or not authorized, issued in
its name and accepted by the Escrow Agent in compliance with the particular
security procedure chosen by ["___________"].



NOTICE: The security procedure selected by ["___________"] will not be used to
detect errors in the funds transfer instructions given by ["___________"]. If
a funds transfer instruction describes the beneficiary of the payment
inconsistently by name and account number, payment may be made on the basis of
the account number even if it identifies a person different from the named
beneficiary. If a funds transfer instruction describes a participating
financial institution inconsistently by name and identification number, the
identification number may be relied upon as the proper identification of the
financial institution. Therefore, it is important that ["___________"] take
such steps as it deems prudent to ensure that there are no such
inconsistencies in the funds transfer instructions it sends to the Escrow
Agent.

The security procedure to be used with respect to funds transfer instructions
is checked below:



¨Option 1. Confirmation by telephone call-back. The Escrow Agent shall confirm
funds transfer instructions by telephone call-back to a person at the
telephone number designated on Part II above. The person confirming the funds
transfer instruction shall be a person other than the person from whom the
funds transfer instruction was received, unless only one person is designated
in both Parts I and II of this Exhibit B-1.

¨CHECK box, if applicable:

If the Escrow Agent is unable to obtain confirmation by telephone call-back,
the Escrow Agent may, at its discretion, confirm by e-mail, as described in
Option 2.

¨Option 2. Confirmation by e-mail. The Escrow Agent shall confirm funds
transfer instructions by e-mail to a person at the e-mail address specified
for such person in Part II of this Exhibit B-1. The person confirming the
funds transfer instruction shall be a person other than the person from whom
the funds transfer instruction was received, unless only one person is
designated in both Parts I and II of this Exhibit B-1. ["___________"]
understands the risks associated with communicating sensitive matters,
including time sensitive matters, by e-mail. ["___________"] further
acknowledges that instructions and data sent by e-mail may be less
confidential or secure than instructions or data transmitted by other methods.
The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any loss of the confidentiality of
instructions and data prior to receipt by the Escrow Agent.

¨CHECK box, if applicable:

If the Escrow Agent is unable to obtain confirmation by e-mail, the Escrow
Agent may, at its discretion, confirm by telephone call-back, as described in
Option 1.



¨*Option 3. Delivery of funds transfer instructions by password protected file
transfer system only - no confirmation. The Escrow Agent offers the option to
deliver funds transfer instructions through a password protected file transfer

["___________"] chooses this Option 3, it agrees that no further confirmation
of funds transfer instructions will be performed by the Escrow Agent.



¨*Option 4. Delivery of funds transfer instructions by password protected file
transfer system with confirmation. Same as Option 3 above, but the Escrow
Agent shall confirm funds transfer instructions by telephone call-back or
e-mail (must check at least one, may check both) to a person at the telephone
number or e-mail address designated on Part II above. By checking a box in the
prior sentence, the party shall be deemed to have agreed to the terms of such
confirmation option as more fully described in Option 1 and Option 2 above.

EXHIBIT B-2



The Stockholder Representative certifies that the names, titles, telephone
numbers, e-mail addresses and specimen signatures set forth in Parts I and II
of this Exhibit B-2 identify the persons authorized to provide direction and
initiate or confirm transactions, including funds transfer instructions, on
behalf of the Stockholder Representative, and that the option checked in Part
III of this Exhibit B-2 is the security procedure selected by the Stockholder
Representative for use in verifying that a funds transfer instruction received
by the Escrow Agent is that of the Stockholder Representative.



The Stockholder Representative has reviewed each of the security procedures
and has determined that the option checked in Part III of this Exhibit B-2
best meets its requirements; given the size, type and frequency of the
instructions it will issue to the Escrow Agent. By selecting the security
procedure specified in Part III of this Exhibit B-2, the Stockholder
Representative acknowledges that it has elected to not use the other security
procedures described and agrees to be bound by any funds transfer instruction,
whether or not authorized, issued in its name and accepted by the Escrow Agent
in compliance with the particular security procedure chosen by the Stockholder
Representative.



NOTICE: The security procedure selected by the Stockholder Representative will
not be used to detect errors in the funds transfer instructions given by the
Stockholder Representative. If a funds transfer instruction describes the
beneficiary of the payment inconsistently by name and account number, payment
may be made on the basis of the account number even if it identifies a person
different from the named beneficiary. If a funds transfer instruction
describes a participating financial institution inconsistently by name and
identification number, the identification number may be relied upon as the
proper identification of the financial institution. Therefore, it is important
that the Stockholder Representative take such steps as it deems prudent to
ensure that there are no such inconsistencies in the funds transfer
instructions it sends to the Escrow Agent.

power, subject to, and within the limitations of, the express provisions of
the Plan:

(i)To determine from time to time which Service Providers shall be designated
as Participants entitled to participate in the Plan and the terms under which

agreement or instrument (including but not limited to a letter or resignation,
a notice of termination or a severance agreement) terminating such
individual's service to the Company subject to, conditioned upon and effective
at or immediately prior to the Closing (such individual, a "Transition Service
Provider"), a Service Provider will cease to be a Participant at such time as
he or she ceases to be a Service Provider for any reason at any time prior to

Provider and Participant at the Closing for purposes of this Plan. Only
Participants who are Service Providers at the Closing may receive payments
pursuant to the Plan.

| 
---|--- 

5.

|

Allocation of Bonus Pool. 

(a)The allocation of the Bonus Pool to individuals designated as Participants
shall be set forth in writing from time to time as determined by the
Administrator and specified in the applicable Participant's Participation
Agreement. Each Participant's payment under the Plan (his or her "Bonus
Amount") will be equal to (x) his or her Bonus Percentage (as may be adjusted
pursuant to the Plan), multiplied by (y) the amount of the Bonus Pool. The
aggregate of the Bonus Percentages set forth in the Participation Agreements
with all Participants may not exceed 100% at any time.

(b)If a former Participant ceases to be a Participant at any time prior to the
Closing, such former Participant's Bonus Percentage shall be forfeited and be
available for reallocation and distribution under this Plan at or prior to the
Closing as determined by the Administrator or pursuant to Section 5(c).

(c)In the event that the sum of the Bonus Percentages of all Participants at
the Closing is less than 100%, then the amount by which 100% exceeds such sum
(the "Unallocated Portion") shall be allocated among all Participants at the
Closing by way of ratably increasing the Bonus Percentage of each such
Participant in proportion to such Participants' Bonus Percentage immediately
prior to such allocation of the Unallocated Portion, so that after such
allocation of the Unallocated Portion, the sum of the Bonus Percentages of all
Participants at the Closing is equal to 100%.

| 
---|--- 

6.

|

Distributions. 

(a)If the conditions for distribution set forth in the Plan and a
Participant's Participation Agreement are satisfied, then on or after the
Closing Date, each Participant shall be entitled to receive from the Company
his or her Bonus Amount in in one or more distributions.

(b)The Bonus Amounts shall be distributed to Participants as soon as
practicable after disbursement of the Bonus Pool from the Integration Cost
Escrow Fund, but in no event later than the time that amounts disbursed from
the Integration Cost Escrow Fund to the Paying Agent for further payment to
the Priority Preferred Stockholders are paid to the Priority Preferred
Stockholders.

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, in the event that the
benefits provided for in this Plan, when taken together with any other
benefits otherwise payable to a Participant (such benefits, collectively, the
"Payments") (1) constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section
280G of the Code and (2) but for this Section 6(c), would be subject to the
excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, then the Participant's
Payments will be reduced and delivered as to such lesser extent which would
result in no portion of the Payments being subject to excise tax under Section
4999 of the Code (the "Excise Tax"). Unless the Company and the Participant
otherwise agree in writing, any 

determination required under this Section will be made in writing by a
nationally or regionally recognized certified public accounting firm selected
by the Company or such other person or entity to which the Company and the
Participant mutually agree (the "Firm"), whose determination will be
conclusive and binding upon the Participant and the Company for all purposes.
If a reduction in payments or benefits constituting "parachute payments" is
necessary so that no portion of the Payments is subject to the Excise Tax, the
reduction shall occur in the following order: (1) reduction of cash payments
under this Plan; (2) reduction of cash payments constituting severance payable
upon termination of employment; (3) reduction of cash payments pursuant to
other benefits paid or provided to the Participant in connection with or as a
result of a Change of Control; and (4) acceleration of equity awards. In the
event that acceleration of vesting of equity awards is to be reduced, such
acceleration of vesting shall be cancelled in the reverse order of the date of
grant for the Participant's equity awards. If two or more equity awards are
granted on the same date, each award will be reduced on a pro‑rata basis. In
no event shall the Participant have any discretion with respect to the
ordering of reductions in payments or benefits. In the event of any reduction
in the payment of any Bonus Amount to a Participant under the Plan as a result
of this Section 6(c), the amount of such reduction shall be reallocated among
all other Participants at the time of such reduction by way of ratably
increasing the Bonus Amounts of each such other Participant in proportion to
such other Participants' Bonus Percentages, subject to the limitations of this
Section 6(c); in the event that any portion of any Bonus Amount remains
unallocated after the application of this sentence to each reduction in Bonus
Amounts pursuant to this Section 6(c), such unallocated portion shall not be
payable under this Plan and instead be disbursed from the Integration Cost
Escrow Fund to the Paying Agent for further payment to the Priority Preferred
Stockholders.

For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section, the Firm may
make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and
may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application
of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. The Company and the Participant will
furnish to the Firm such information and documents as the Firm may reasonably
request in order to make a determination under this Section. The Company will
bear all costs the Firm may reasonably incur in connection with any
calculations contemplated by this Section. Any good faith determinations of
the Firm made hereunder shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the
Company and the Participant.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent the Company submits any portion
of the Payments payable to such Participant to the Company's stockholders for
approval in accordance with Treasury Reg. Section 1.280G‑1 QandA 7, the
foregoing provisions shall not apply following such submission and the portion
of the Payments will be treated in accordance with the results of such vote,
except that any reduction in, or waiver of, any portion of the Payments
required by the results of such vote will be applied without any application
of discretion by the Participant and in the order prescribed by this Section
6(c).

| 
---|--- 

7.

|

Amendment or Termination of the Plan. 

(a)The Board may, at any time prior to the Closing, amend the Plan; provided,
however, that in no event may any amendment unilaterally impair the rights of
Participants (including, without limitation, reducing the Bonus Percentage of
any Participant) without such Participant's written consent except as may be
required by applicable law or as necessary to correct an administrative error.
This Plan shall be assumed by any successor to or acquirer of the Company to
the extent that benefits remain payable under this Plan.

(b)The Plan shall automatically terminate upon the completion of all payments
under the terms of the Plan. The Plan (including any obligation by the Company
to make payments under all then-outstanding Participation Agreements) shall
automatically terminate upon earlier to occur of any of the following events
if such event occurs prior to the Closing: (i) the closing date of a
recapitalization of the Company that results in the elimination of the
existing liquidation preferences with respect to all the outstanding shares of
the Company's preferred stock, (ii) the closing date of the Company's initial
public offering of its common stock pursuant to an effective registration
statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended; or (iii)
December 31, 2016.

| 
---|--- 

8.

|

No Equity Interest. 

Neither the Plan nor any distribution hereunder creates or conveys any equity
or ownership interest in the Company or any rights commonly associated with
such interests, including, without limitation, the right to vote on any
matters put before the stockholders of the Company. 

| 
---|--- 

9.

|

No Guarantee of Future Service. 

Neither the designation of a Service Provider as a Participant nor the
execution of a Participation Agreement shall provide any guarantee or promise
of continued service of the Participant with the Company (or any Parent or
Subsidiary), and the Company (or any Parent or Subsidiary employing a
Participant) retains the right to terminate the employment or service of any
Service Provider at any time, with or without cause, for any reason or no
reason, except as may be restricted by law or contract.

| 
---|--- 

10.

|

Tax Withholding. 

The Company shall withhold or cause to be withheld from any distributions
under the Plan any amount required to satisfy the Company's income, employment
and other tax withholding obligations under federal, state and other
applicable law. By executing a Participation Agreement, Participant
acknowledges that the Company cannot and has not guaranteed that the Internal
Revenue Service will determine that the Plan benefits are not deferred
compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the
regulations and guidance thereunder ("Section 409A"). Each Service Provider
agrees that if the Internal Revenue Service determines that the Plan benefits
are deferred compensation, Participant shall be solely responsible for
Participant's costs related to such a determination, if any.

| 
---|--- 

11.

|

Funding. 

The Plan shall be funded out of the Company's general assets. No provision of
the Plan shall require the Company, for the purpose of satisfying any
obligations under the Plan, to purchase assets or place any assets in a trust
or other entity to which contributions are made or otherwise to segregate any
assets, nor shall the Company maintain separate bank accounts, books, records
or other evidence of the existence of a segregated or separately maintained or
administered fund for such purposes. Participants shall have no rights under
the Plan other than as unsecured general creditors of the Company.

| 
---|--- 

12.

|

Bonus Plan. 

The Plan is intended to be a "bonus program" as defined under U.S. Department
of Labor Regulation 2510.3‑2(c) and shall be construed and administered in
accordance with such intention.

| 
---|--- 

13.

|

Nonassignability. 

The Company may not assign, sell, transfer, delegate or otherwise dispose of
any rights or obligations under any Participation Agreement unless the Board
reasonably believes that the assignee or transferee has sufficient resources
to satisfy the obligations under such Participation Agreement. No Participant
may assign, sell, transfer, delegate or otherwise dispose of, whether
voluntarily or involuntarily, or by operation of law, any rights or
obligations under any Participation Agreement without the Administrator's
prior written consent other than by will, by the laws of descent and
distribution or pursuant to a domestic relations order.

| 
---|--- 

14.

|

Code Section 409A. 

The Company and each Participant will work together in good faith to consider
either (i) amendments to the Plan; or (ii) revisions to the Plan with respect
to the payment of any bonus amounts, which are necessary or appropriate to
avoid imposition of any additional tax or income recognition prior to the
actual payment to the Participant under Section 409A. It is intended that this
Plan is exempt from or comply with Section 409A to the extent applicable.

| 
---|--- 

15.

|

Choice of Law. 

All questions concerning the construction, validation and interpretation of
the Plan will be governed by the law of the State of California without regard
to its conflict of laws provisions.

| 
---|--- 

16.

|

Headings. 

The headings in the Plan are inserted for convenience only and shall not be
deemed to constitute a part hereof nor to affect the meaning thereof.

| 
---|--- 

17.

|

Successors and Assigns. 

Subject to Section 13, the Plan shall be binding upon and shall inure to the
benefit of the Company and its successors and assigns, and upon a Change of
Control the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
acquirer to assume the Company's obligations and liabilities hereunder.
Subject to Section 13, each Participation Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the Participant and his or her heirs, executors,

EXHIBIT A

DFINE, Inc.

2016 MANAGEMENT BONUS Plan

PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT

To: _________________

DFine, Inc. (the "Company") has designated you as a "Participant" who is
eligible to participate in the DFine, Inc. 2016 Management Bonus Plan (the
"Plan"). By signing and returning this Participation Agreement, you will
become a "Participant" in the Plan. Your participation in the Plan is
contingent upon your continued employment with or service as service provider
to the Company up to the date of a "Change of Control" (as defined in the
Plan) and your agreement to the terms of the Plan and this Participation
Agreement. The terms of the Plan are incorporated by reference and, in the
case of any conflict between this Participation Agreement and the terms of the
Plan, the terms of the Plan will govern. Defined terms capitalized but not
defined in this Participation Agreement have the meanings assigned to them in
the Plan. 

For purposes of the Plan, your "Bonus Percentage" (the percentage of the Bonus
Pool that has been allocated to you) is _______________________ percent
(_______%).

As noted in the Plan, Bonus Amounts may only be earned if there is a Closing
of a Change of Control transaction and only if there is a disbursement from
the Integration Cost Escrow Fund to the Surviving Corporation for further
payment to participants in the Plan, as provided in Section 2.18 of the Merger
Agreement. Whether you earn the right to receive your potential Bonus Amount
is governed by the Plan and the Merger Agreement. You hereby acknowledge that
the Company is an "at will" employer. That means that you and the Company have
the right to terminate your employment or consulting relationship at any time,
with or without advance notice, and with or without cause. Nothing in this
Participation Agreement changes the "at will" nature of your employment or
consultancy.

In consideration of your designation as a Participant and as a material
inducement to the Company entering into this Participation Agreement and
providing you with the opportunity to receive the Bonus Amount, which you
acknowledge exceeds any amounts to which you otherwise may be entitled under
the Company's policies and practices or applicable law, you and your
representatives completely release from, and agree to not file, cause to be
filed or pursue against, the Company, its affiliated, related, parent or
subsidiary companies, and its present and former directors, officers,
stockholders and employees (the "Released Parties") all claims, complaints,
grievances or charges of any kind, known and unknown, which you may now have
or have ever had against any of them, or arising out of your relationship with
any of them, including all claims for compensation and bonuses, attorneys'
fees, and all claims arising from your employment with the Company or the
termination of your employment, whether based on contract, tort, statute,
local ordinance, regulation or any comparable law in any jurisdiction
("Released Claims"). By way of example and not limitation, Released Claims
shall include any claims arising under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, the federal Worker Adjustment Retraining Notification Act ("WARN Act")
under 29 U.S.C. § 2102 et seq., the California WARN Act, California Labor Code
§ 1400 et seq., the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act, and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (or any
comparable law in any jurisdiction). You represent that you have not filed or
initiated or caused to be filed or initiated any lawsuits, claims, complaints,
administrative grievances or charges against any Released Party in any court
or with any government agency. You expressly covenant and warrant that you
have not assigned or transferred to any person or entity any portion of any
claims that are waived, released and/or discharged herein.

You also agree that because this release specifically covers known and unknown
claims, you waive your rights under Section 1542 of the California Civil Code
or any other comparable statute of any jurisdiction, which states as follows:

A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT TO THE DEBTOR.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, you and the Company acknowledge and agree that
you are not waiving or being required to waive any right that cannot be waived
as a matter of law, including the right to file a charge with or participate
in an investigation by a governmental administrative agency; provided,
however, that you hereby disclaim and waive any right to share or participate
in any monetary award resulting from the prosecution of such charge or
investigation. You further agree that, to the extent permissible by law, you
will provide the Company at least five (5) days prior written notice of any
such charge or investigation.

You and the Company agree that this Participation Agreement is not an
admission of guilt or liability on the part of you or the Company under any
federal, state or local law, whether statutory or common law. Liability for
any and all claims is expressly denied by you and the Company. 

You agree that you will keep information about the Plan confidential both
within and outside of the Company except to the extent necessary to enforce
your rights hereunder or as otherwise required under applicable law. This
information includes, but is not limited to, your participation levels and
benefits and confidential information about employees, the Company's
operations, strategies and management, information related to the Plan and
non-public information related to the Change of Control transaction
("Confidential Information"). You understand and agree that you will not
reveal any Confidential Information without the express written consent of the
Company except to the extent necessary to enforce your rights hereunder or as
otherwise required under applicable law, provided, however, that you may
disclose Confidential Information to your personal lawyer or tax and financial
advisors for the purposes of personal legal, tax, financial and estate
planning advice. The Company has the right to cancel any Bonus Amounts
otherwise payable to you under the Plan following any unauthorized disclosure
of any Confidential Information by you.

You understand and agree that discussing, revealing or in any way
communicating the Confidential Information to a non‑authorized person or
entity is grounds for immediate termination of employment or other service
relationship.

You acknowledge and agree that payments under the Plan shall be subject to all
applicable federal, state and local withholding taxes that the Company
reasonably determines should be withheld with respect to such payments.

By their signatures below, you and the Company agree that the Plan and any
Bonus Amounts are governed by this Participation Agreement and by the
provisions (specifically including, but not limited to, the conditions
precedent to receiving a distribution under the Plan and the amendment
provisions) of the Plan, a copy of which is attached to and made a part of
this document. You acknowledge receipt of a copy of the Plan, represent that
you have read and are familiar with its provisions and acknowledge that
decisions and determinations by the Administrator under the Plan shall be
final and binding on you.

YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE ANY MERGER CONSIDERATION UNTIL YOU HAVE DELIVERED THIS
LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL ALONG WITH YOUR COMPANY STOCK CERTIFICATE(S). DELIVERY
OF THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL TO AN ADDRESS OTHER THAN AS SET FORTH ABOVE WILL
NOT CONSTITUTE A VALID DELIVERY. YOU MUST SIGN THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL IN
THE APPROPRIATE SPACE PROVIDED BELOW, WITH SIGNATURE GUARANTEE (IF REQUIRED),
AND COMPLETE THE SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9 SET FORTH BELOW (IF REQUIRED). YOU SHOULD
CAREFULLY READ THE INSTRUCTIONS SET FORTH IN THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL BEFORE
COMPLETING THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL.



Ladies and Gentlemen:

This Letter of Transmittal is being delivered to you in connection with the
merger (the "Merger") of MMS Transaction Co. ("Merger Sub"), a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Merit Medical Systems, Inc.
("Parent"), a Utah Corporation, with and into DFine, Inc. (the "Company"), a
Delaware corporation pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Priority Preferred Stockholders
identified therein and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, as the
Stockholder Representative (the "Merger Agreement"), dated July 6, 2016 (the
"Effective Time"). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have
the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement. If you would like
to request an additional copy of the Merger Agreement, please contact the
office of the Corporate Secretary of Parent at Merit Medical Systems, Inc.,
1600 West Merit Parkway, South Jordan, Utah 84095, Attn: Corporate Secretary.



Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into the Company
pursuant to Section 251 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"),
with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.
Other than any shares of Common Stock or Preferred 

Stock of the Company (collectively "Capital Stock") owned by the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiaries (collectively, the "Exception Shares") or any shares of Capital
Stock held by a holder who properly exercises appraisal rights of such shares
in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL or dissenters' rights in accordance
with Chapter 13 of the California Corporations Code (the "Dissenting Shares"
until such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such
holder's appraisal rights under the DGCL or dissenters' rights under the
California Corporations Code (the "CCC"), with respect to such shares in which
case such shares of Capital Stock will no longer be Dissenting Shares), at the
Effective Time, each share of Capital Stock of the Company that was issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the
"Shares") was cancelled and automatically converted into the right to the
Closing Per Share Merger Consideration, if any, associated with the respective
class and series of Capital Stock in cash, without interest, together with any
amounts that may become payable in respect of such share of Capital Stock in
the future from the Escrow Funds or in respect of the Post-Closing Adjustment
or the Stockholder Representative Expense Fund, in each case, at the
respective times and subject to the contingencies and terms specified in the
Merger Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (collectively, the "Per Share
Consideration"). The Exception Shares were cancelled without payment at the
Effective Time in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Merger
Agreement. The Dissenting Shares will be addressed as provided in Section 2.10
of the Merger Agreement, Section 262 of the DGCL and Chapter 13 of the CCC.
Due to the liquidation preferences associated with the Series E Preferred
Stock and Series F Preferred Stock, the Per Share Consideration associated
with the Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock,
Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock is zero. Each registered
holder of Shares of Series E Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred Stock (the
"Priority Preferred Stock") is entitled to receive in exchange for the
surrender of such Shares an amount equal to the Per Share Consideration
associated with such series of Priority Preferred Stock multiplied by the
number of Shares surrendered, all on the terms and conditions set forth in the
Merger Agreement (the "Merger Consideration").



Each registered holder of Shares, including each registered holder of any
stock certificate(s) representing Shares as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time ("Certificate(s)"), who wishes to surrender such Shares for the
Merger Consideration must complete this Letter of Transmittal in its entirety
and comply with all of its terms and conditions. Please read this entire
Letter of Transmittal carefully. The instructions included in this Letter of
Transmittal must be followed. Delivery of this Letter of Transmittal other
than as set forth herein will not constitute a valid delivery. You must sign
this Letter of Transmittal where indicated below (with signature guarantee, if
required) and complete the Substitute Form W-9 provided herein (if required).

The undersigned hereby surrenders the above-described Shares for the purpose
of receiving the Merger Consideration in exchange for such Shares, pursuant to
and subject to the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement and this Letter of
Transmittal, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged. The undersigned agrees
that the surrender of such Shares shall be irrevocable. Delivery of any
Certificate(s) shall be effected, and risk of loss with respect to such
Certificate(s) shall pass, only upon proper delivery thereof in accordance
with this Letter of Transmittal. The Disbursing Agent shall be Citibank, N.A.
The undersigned understands that surrender is not made in acceptable form
until the receipt by Parent, of this Letter of Transmittal, or copy hereof,
duly completed and signed, and of the Shares surrendered hereby, together with
all accompanying evidences of authority, which evidences of authority shall be
in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent.

The undersigned hereby confirms that (i) the undersigned has full power and
authority to execute and deliver this Letter of Transmittal and to surrender,
sell, assign and transfer the Shares surrendered herein, (ii) immediately
prior to consummation of the Merger, the undersigned had good and unencumbered
title to such Shares, free and clear of all liens, restrictions, charges and
encumbrances and not subject to any adverse claim, and (iii) the payment of
the Merger Consideration in exchange for such Shares surrendered hereby will
discharge completely any and all obligations of Parent, the Company and the
Disbursing Agent with respect to such Shares. The undersigned will, upon
request, execute and deliver any additional 

documents deemed by Parent to be necessary or desirable to complete the
surrender of such Shares and the delivery of any Certificate(s) for the Merger
Consideration.

The undersigned acknowledges and agrees (i) to the appointment of Shareholder
Representative Services LLC as the undersigned's representative and agent
pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and (ii) to be bound by the
terms and conditions set forth in Articles VII and VIII of the Merger
Agreement as a Priority Preferred Stockholder, including without limitation
the indemnification provisions in favor of the Stockholder Representative in
Section 8.01(c) thereof.



Unless otherwise indicated herein under "Special Payment Instructions," the
Disbursing Agent will mail a check (or if wire instructions are indicated on
the signature page hereof, send a wire transfer) for the Merger Consideration
in the name(s) of the undersigned. Similarly, unless otherwise indicated under
"Special Delivery Instructions," the Disbursing Agent will mail a check (or if
wire instructions are indicated on the signature page hereof, send a wire
transfer) for the Merger Consideration for the Shares (and accompanying
documents as appropriate) to the undersigned at the address shown below the
undersigned's signature(s). In the event that both "Special Payment
Instructions" and "Special Delivery Instructions" are completed, the
Disbursing Agent will issue the check (or if wire instructions are indicated
on the signature page hereof, send a wire transfer) for the Merger
Consideration for the Shares surrendered hereby in the name(s) of, and mail
the check to, the person so indicated.



All questions as to the validity of any surrender of Shares or mailing or
delivery of this Letter of Transmittal will be determined by Parent (which may
delegate power to make such determination in whole or in part to its legal
counsel), and such determination will be final and binding. Parent reserves
the absolute right to reject any or all Shares surrendered hereby or Letters
of Transmittal to the extent not in the form required by the Merger Agreement
or the instructions hereto or the payment for which is unlawful. Parent also
reserves the absolute right to waive any defect or irregularity in the
surrender of any Shares, Certificate(s) or Letters of Transmittal. None of the
Company, Parent (or any of its affiliates), the Disbursing Agent nor any other
person will be under any duty to give notification of any defects or
irregularities in any surrender of Shares, Certificate(s) or Letter of
Transmittal or will incur any liability for failure to give any such
notification to any person (even if such notification is given to other
persons). A surrender will not be deemed to have been made until all
irregularities have been cured or waived.



If any Certificate(s) you are surrendering has been mutilated, lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit (in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent) of that fact by you claiming such Certificate(s) to be
mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the payment
by you of any applicable fees of Parent, Parent will, in exchange for such
mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate(s), pay or cause to be paid
the consideration deliverable in respect of the Shares formerly represented by
such Certificate(s) pursuant to the Merger Agreement. If any Certificate(s)
you are surrendering has been mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, see
Instruction 8.





IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THE MERGER CONSIDERATION, YOU MUST FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS

TO YOU.

INSTRUCTIONS

1\. Guarantee of Signatures. Signatures on this Letter of Transmittal need not
be guaranteed (i) if this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered
holder(s) of the Shares surrendered herewith and such holder(s) has not
completed either the box entitled "Special Payment Instructions" or the box
entitled "Special Delivery Instructions" on this Letter of Transmittal or (ii)
if Shares surrendered herewith are surrendered for the account of an Eligible
Institution. See Instruction 4. Except as provided in the preceding sentence,
all signatures on this Letter of Transmittal must be guaranteed by a financial
institution (including most banks, savings and loan associations and brokerage
houses) that is a member in good standing of a recognized Medallion Program
approved by The Securities Transfer Association, Inc., including the
Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program (STAMP), the Stock Exchange
Medallion Program (SEMP) and the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. Medallion
Signature Program (MSP) or any other "eligible guarantor institution" (as such
term is defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended) (each an "Eligible Institution").

2\. Delivery of Letter of Transmittal and Certificate(s). This Letter of
Transmittal should be completed and signed by the record holder or holders of
the Shares listed in the box marked "Description of Shares Surrendered"
beginning on page 2 of this Letter of Transmittal (unless the listed Shares
have been transferred or assigned, in which case this Letter of Transmittal
should be signed by the transferee or assignee). This Letter of Transmittal,
together with any surrendered Certificate(s) listed on this form, should be
delivered in the manner provided on page 1 of this Letter of Transmittal.



The method of delivery of this Letter of Transmittal, the Shares surrendered
hereby and all other required documents is at the option and risk of the
surrendering shareholder and the delivery will be deemed made only when
actually received by Parent and otherwise in accordance with the terms of this
Letter of Transmittal. If delivery is by mail, we recommend that any
Certificate(s) and documents be sent by registered mail, properly insured,
with return receipt requested.



All questions as to the validity of any surrender of Shares or Certificate(s)
or mailing or delivery of this Letter of Transmittal will be determined by
Parent (which may delegate power to make such determination in whole or in
part to its legal counsel)), and such determination will be final and binding.
Parent reserves the absolute right to reject any or all Shares or
Certificate(s) surrendered hereby or Letters of Transmittal to the extent not
in the form required by the Merger Agreement or the instructions hereto or the
payment for which is unlawful. Parent also reserves the absolute right to
waive any defect or irregularity in the surrender of any Shares or
Certificate(s) or Letters of Transmittal. None of the Company, Parent (or any
of its affiliates), the Disbursing Agent nor any other person will be under
any duty to give notification of any defects or irregularities in any
surrender of Shares or Certificate(s) or Letter of Transmittal or will incur
any liability for failure to give any such notification to any person (even if
such notification is given to other 

persons). A surrender will not be deemed to have been made until all
irregularities have been cured or waived.

3\. Inadequate Space. If the space provided herein is inadequate, the
Certificate numbers and/or the number of Shares and any other relevant
information should be listed on a separate signed schedule attached hereto.

4\. Signatures on Letter of Transmittal; Stock Powers and Endorsements.

(a) Exact Signatures.

If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) of the
Shares surrendered hereby, the signature(s) must correspond with the name(s)
as written on the face of the certificates without alteration, enlargement or
any change whatsoever.

(b) Joint Holders.

If any of the Shares surrendered hereby are held of record by two or more
persons, all such persons must sign this Letter of Transmittal.

(c) Different Names on Certificates.

If any of the Shares surrendered hereby are registered in different names on
different certificates or (in the case of Shares not represented by
certificates) in different accounts, it will be necessary to complete, sign
and submit as many separate Letters of Transmittal as there are different
registrations of Shares.

(d) When Endorsements or Stock Powers are Not Required.

If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) of the
Shares surrendered hereby, no endorsements of certificates or separate stock
powers are required unless payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made
in the name of any person other than the registered holder(s). Signatures on
any such certificates or stock powers must be guaranteed by an Eligible
Institution.

(e) When Endorsements or Stock Powers are Required.

If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by a person other than the registered
holder(s) of the Shares surrendered hereby, certificates must be endorsed or
accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in either case, signed exactly as the
name(s) of the registered holder(s) appear(s) on the certificates for such
Shares. Signature(s) on any such certificates or stock powers must be
guaranteed by an Eligible Institution. See Instruction 1.

(f) Evidence of Fiduciary or Representative Capacity.

If this Letter of Transmittal or any certificate or stock power is signed by a
trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, attorney-in-fact, officer of a
corporation or other person acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity,
such person should so indicate when signing. Parent may, in its discretion,
demand proper evidence satisfactory to Parent of the authority of such person
so to act must be submitted.

5\. Stock Transfer Taxes. Parent will pay any stock transfer taxes imposed on
the sale and transfer of any Shares to it or its order (for the avoidance of
doubt, transfer taxes do not include U.S. federal income taxes or backup
withholding taxes). If, however, payment of the Merger Consideration is to be
made to any person other than the registered holder(s), or if a transfer tax
is imposed for any reason other than the sale or transfer of Shares to Parent
pursuant to the Merger, then the amount of any stock transfer taxes (whether 

imposed on the registered holder(s) or otherwise) will be deducted from the
Merger Consideration unless satisfactory evidence of the payment of such
taxes, or exemption therefrom, is submitted.

Except as provided in this Instruction 5, it will not be necessary for
transfer tax stamps to be affixed to the Share certificates listed in this
Letter of Transmittal.

6\. Special Payment and Delivery Instructions. If payment for the Merger
Consideration related to any Shares surrendered hereby is to be issued (or if
wire instructions are indicated on the signature page hereof, the wire
transfer is to be made) in the name of a person other than the person(s)
signing this Letter of Transmittal, or if the check for the Merger
Consideration is to be sent to an address different from that of the person
signing this Letter of Transmittal, then the "Special Payment Instructions" on
page 8 of this Letter of Transmittal and/or "Special Delivery Instructions" on
page 9 of this Letter of Transmittal must be completed. To complete your
transfer request you must also indicate above a Transfer Reason by executing
the Transfer Reason box above.

7\. Tax Information and Substitute Form W-9. Under U.S. federal income tax
law, a stockholder that is a non-exempt U.S. person who surrenders Shares is
required by law to provide Parent with its correct taxpayer identification
number. Failure to provide Parent with the correct taxpayer identification
number may subject the stockholder to penalties. In addition, under the U.S.
federal income tax laws, Parent may be required to (or cause the Disbursing
Agent to) withhold and pay over to the Internal Revenue Service backup
withholding at a rate of 28% from any payments of the Merger Consideration
made in respect of Shares surrendered hereby.

To avoid penalties and backup withholding, surrendering U.S. stockholders and,
if applicable, any other payee, must provide Parent with the correct taxpayer
identification number and certify that it is not subject to such backup
withholding by completing the Substitute Form W-9 included in this Letter of
Transmittal or Internal Revenue Service Form W-9. In general, if a stockholder
or payee is an individual, the taxpayer identification number is the social
security number of such individual.

Certain stockholders or payees (including, among others, corporations and
certain foreign individuals) are not subject to these backup withholding
requirements. Non-U.S. stockholders should certify their non-U.S. status on
the appropriate Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 (a copy of which may be
obtained from Parent or online at www.irs.gov) to avoid backup withholding.
Such stockholders should consult a tax advisor to determine which Form W-8 is
appropriate. For further information concerning backup withholding and
instructions for completing the Substitute Form W-9 (including how to obtain a
taxpayer identification number if you do not have one and how to complete the
Substitute Form W-9 if Shares are held in more than one name), consult the
enclosed Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on
Substitute Form W-9.

Failure to complete and provide Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or the
Substitute Form W-9 will not, by itself, cause Shares to be deemed invalidly
surrendered, but may require Parent to (or cause the Disbursing Agent to)
withhold 28% of the amount of any payments made pursuant to the Offer. Backup
withholding tax is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the
backup withholding tax rules from a payment generally will be allowed as a
credit against that holder's U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle
the holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely
furnished to the Internal Revenue Service. Failure to complete and return
Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or the Substitute Form W-9 may result in
backup withholding of 28% from any payments of Merger Consideration made to
you in respect of Shares surrendered hereby. Please review the enclosed
Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute
Form W-9 for additional details.

8\. Mutilated, Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If the certificate(s)
representing Shares to be surrendered have been mutilated, lost, stolen or
destroyed, stockholders should (i) complete this Letter of Transmittal and
check the appropriate box above and contact Bryan Allen, at Parr Brown Gee and
Loveless, 

counsel to Parent, at (801) 257-7963, for further instructions on replacing
your certificate(s). This Letter of Transmittal and related documents cannot
be processed until the procedures for replacing lost, mutilated, destroyed or
stolen certificates have been completed.

9\. Requests for Assistance or Additional Copies. Requests for assistance or
additional copies of this Letter of Transmittal may be obtained from Bryan
Allen, at Parr Brown Gee and Loveless, counsel to Parent, at (801) 257-7963.

NOTE:

|

FAILURE TO COMPLETE AND RETURN THIS FORM MAY RESULT IN BACKUP WITHHOLDING ON
PAYMENTS OF MERGER CONSIDERATION MADE TO YOU IN RESPECT OF SHARES SURRENDERED
HEREBY. PLEASE REVIEW ENCLOSED GUIDELINES FOR CERTIFICATION OF TAXPAYER
IDENTIFICATION NUMBER ON SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9 FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS.


 

 

GUIDELINES FOR CERTIFICATION OF TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION

NUMBER ON SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9

Use Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (available online at www.irs.gov) or the
Substitute Form W-9 included in this Letter of Transmittal to (1) provide your
correct taxpayer identification number to the payer, (2) certify that the
taxpayer information number you are giving is correct (or you are waiting for
a number to be issued), (3) certify that you are not subject to backup
withholding, or (4) claim exemption from backup withholding.

Parent will provide the Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 instructions upon
request. These guidelines are intended to help payees complete the Substitute
Form W-9 included in this Letter of Transmittal.

GUIDELINES FOR DETERMINING WHETHER YOU ARE A U.S. PERSON-For U.S. federal tax
purposes, you are considered a U.S. person if you are: (a) an individual who
is a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien, (b) a partnership, corporation,
company, or association created or organized in the U.S. or under the laws of
the U.S., (c) an estate (other than a foreign estate), or (d) a domestic trust
(as defined in Treasury Regulations section 301.7701-7).

Resident aliens may be subject to special rules. Such stockholders should
consult a tax advisor to determine their taxpayer identification number and
the applicability of certain treaty benefits to them.

If you are not a U.S. person, do not complete Internal Revenue Service Form
W-9 or the Substitute Form W-9. Instead, use the appropriate Internal Revenue
Service Form W-8 (a copy of which may be obtained from the Depositary or
online at www.irs.gov). Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN is the version of
the Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 that is most likely to apply to non-U.S.
stockholders claiming an exemption from backup withholding, but all non-U.S.
stockholders should consult a tax advisor to determine which Internal Revenue
Service Form W-8 is appropriate.

GUIDELINES FOR DETERMINING THE PROPER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER TO GIVE THE PAYER
IN PART 1-Social Security numbers have nine digits separated by two hyphens:
i.e., 

000-00-0000. Employer identification numbers have nine digits separated by
only one hyphen: i.e., 00-0000000. The table below will help determine the
number to give the payer.

Taxpayer Identification Number.

GUIDELINES FOR DETERMINING WHETHER A PAYEE CAN CHECK THE "EXEMPT PAYEE" BOX IN

and sign and date the form. Generally, individuals are not exempt from backup
withholding. Even if you are exempt from backup withholding, you should submit

erroneous backup withholding.

Privacy Act Notice

Section 6109 requires most recipients of dividend, interest or other payments
to give their correct taxpayer identification numbers to payers who must
report the payments to the Internal Revenue Service. The Internal Revenue
Service uses the numbers for identification purposes and to help verify the
accuracy of tax returns. It may also provide this information to the
Department of Justice for civil and criminal litigation, and to cities,
states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. possessions to carry out their tax
laws. It may also disclose this information to other countries under a tax
treaty, to federal and state agencies to enforce federal nontax criminal laws,
and to federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to combat terrorism.

Payees must provide payers with their taxpayer identification numbers whether
or not they are required to file a U.S. tax return. Payers must generally
withhold 28% of taxable interest, dividend and certain other payments to a
payee who does not furnish a taxpayer identification number to a payer.
Certain penalties may also apply.

Penalties

(1) Penalty for Failure to Furnish Taxpayer Identification Number-If you fail
to furnish your correct taxpayer identification number to a payer, you are
subject to a penalty of $50 for each such failure unless your failure is due
to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.

(2) Civil Penalty for False Information With Respect to Withholding-If you
make a false statement with no reasonable basis which results in no imposition
of backup withholding, you are subject to a penalty of $500.

(3) Criminal Penalty for Falsifying Information-Willfully falsifying
certifications or affirmations may subject you to criminal penalties including
fines and/or imprisonment.

FORM W-8, CONTACT YOUR TAX ADVISOR.

The undersigned to this Affidavit of Lost Certificate (this "Affidavit"),
being duly sworn, upon his or her oath, hereby deposes and says as follows:

Holder has conducted or caused to be conducted a thorough and diligent search
and has failed to find or recover the Lost Certificate. Holder believes that
the Lost Certificate has been lost, mislaid, stolen or destroyed at some time

has signed any power of attorney, assignment or authorization respecting the
Lost Certificate which is now outstanding and in force. To the knowledge of
Holder, no person, firm, company, agency, government or other entity has

Holder hereby requests that, and confirms that this Affidavit is made for the
purpose of inducing the Company (i) to refuse to recognize any person other
than Holder as the owner of the Lost Certificate, (ii) to refuse to take any
other action with respect to the Lost Certificate pursuant to the request or
demand of any person other than Holder or its attorneys-in-fact and (iii) to
issue, execute and deliver to Holder a replacement stock certificate in form
and substance identical to the Lost Certificate (the "Replacement
Certificate") in substitution for the Lost Certificate; provided, however, if
this Affidavit is being delivered together with a completed and executed
