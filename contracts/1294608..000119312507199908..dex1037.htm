iv ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT

This Asset Purchase Agreement (this " _Agreement_ ") is entered into on
September 7, 2007, by and among KHOF Acquisitions, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Buyer_ "); Solo Cup Company, a Delaware corporation ("
_Solo Cup_ "); SF Holdings Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _SF
Holdings_ "); and Solo Cup Operating Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("
_SCOC_ " and, together with Solo Cup and SF Holdings, the " _Solo Parties_ ").
The Buyer and the Solo Parties are referred to collectively herein as the "
_Parties_."

This Agreement contemplates a transaction in which the Buyer will purchase
substantially all of the assets (and assume substantially all of
the liabilities) of the Hoffmaster Division currently owned and operated by
the Solo Parties (the " _Division_ ") in return for cash.

Now, therefore, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises
herein made, and in consideration of the representations, warranties, and
covenants herein contained, the Parties agree as follows.

1\. DEFINITIONS.

For purposes of this Agreement, capitalized terms and variations thereof have
the meanings specified or referenced in APPENDIX A.

2. PURCHASE AND SALE OF ACQUIRED ASSETS; ASSUMPTION OF ASSUMED LIABILITIES.

(a) _Purchase and Sale of Assets_. On and subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, the Buyer agrees to purchase from the Solo Parties free and
clear of all Security Interests (other than Permitted Security Interests), and
the Solo Parties agree to sell, transfer, convey, and deliver to the Buyer
free and clear of all Security Interests (other than Permitted Security
Interests), all of the Acquired Assets at the Closing for the consideration
specified below in this Section 2\.

(b) _Assumption of Liabilities_. On and subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the Buyer agrees to assume and become responsible for all of
the Assumed Liabilities at the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Buyer will not assume or have any responsibility with respect to any
obligations or liabilities that are Excluded Liabilities and the Solo Parties
shall pay, perform, and discharge all Excluded Liabilities.

(c) _Preliminary Purchase Price_. The Buyer agrees to pay to the Solo Parties
at the Closing $170,000,000 (the " _Preliminary Purchase Price_ ") by
delivery of cash in the amount of the Preliminary Purchase Price payable by
wire transfer or delivery of other immediately available funds. The
Preliminary Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Solo Parties as set
forth in Section 2(c) of the Disclosure Schedule. The Preliminary Purchase
Price will be subject to post-Closing Adjustment as set forth below in this
Section 2\.

(d) _The Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Bell, Boyd and
Lloyd LLP in Chicago, Illinois, commencing at 9:00 a.m. local time on the
second business day following the satisfaction or  



 

1  waiver of all conditions to the obligations of the Parties to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby (other than conditions with respect to
actions the respective Parties will take at the Closing itself) or such other
date as the Parties may mutually determine (the " _Closing Date_ ").

(e) _Deliveries at the Closing_. At the Closing, (i) the Solo Parties will
deliver to the Buyer the various certificates, instruments, and documents
referred to in Section 7(a) below; (ii) the Buyer will deliver to the Solo
Parties the various certificates, instruments, and documents referred to in
Section 7(b) below; (iii) the Solo Parties will execute, acknowledge (if
appropriate), and deliver to the Buyer (A) assignments (including real
property and intellectual property transfer documents) in the forms attached
hereto as EXHIBITS A-1 through A-7 and (B) such other instruments of sale,
transfer, conveyance, and assignment as the Buyer and its counsel reasonably
may request; (iv) the Buyer will execute, acknowledge (if appropriate), and
deliver to the Solo Parties (A) an assumption in the form attached hereto as
EXHIBIT B and (B) such other instruments of assumption as the Solo Parties
and their counsel reasonably may request; and (v) the Buyer will deliver to
the Solo Parties the consideration specified in Section 2(c) above.

(f) _Preparation of Working Capital Statement_

(i) Within 45 days after the Closing Date, the Buyer will prepare and deliver
to the Solo Parties a draft working capital statement, which will include a
calculation of the Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the " _Draft
Working Capital Statement_ ") for the Division as of the close of business on
the Closing Date (determined on a pro forma basis as though the Parties had
not consummated the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). The Buyer
will prepare the Draft Working Capital Statement on the same basis and using
the same principles, practices, methods, and assumptions utilized in
determining the Estimated Net Working Capital (as set forth in EXHIBIT C), in
accordance with the schedule set forth in EXHIBIT C attached hereto.

(ii) Unless the Solo Parties deliver written objections to the Draft Working
Capital Statement in reasonable detail containing all objections and the basis
thereof to the Buyer within 30 days after receiving the Draft Working Capital
Statement and the calculation of the Net Working Capital contained therein,
the Solo Parties shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the Draft
Working Capital Statement. The Buyer and the Solo Parties will use reasonable
efforts to resolve any such objections themselves and any resolution by them
of such objections shall be final, conclusive and binding. If the Parties do
not obtain a final resolution within 15 days after the Buyer has received the
statement of objections, however, the Buyer and the Solo Parties
will mutually select an independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to
them to resolve any remaining objections. If the Buyer and the Solo Parties
are unable to agree on the choice of an accounting firm, they will select a
nationally-recognized accounting firm by lot (after excluding their
respective regular outside accounting firms). The determination of any
accounting firm so selected will be set forth in writing and will be final,
conclusive, and binding upon the Parties. The accounting firm shall not
assign a value to any of the remaining items in dispute that is greater than
the greatest value or lower than the lowest value assigned by the Buyer and
the Solo Parties. The accounting firm review will be limited solely to the
items in the statement of objections that are still in dispute between  



 

2  the parties and presentations by Buyer and the Solo Parties, and not by
independent review. The accounting firm shall render its written decision,
upon which a judgment may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
thereof, within 45 days after its selection pursuant to this Section 2(f)(ii).
The Buyer will revise and promptly deliver to the Solo Parties the Draft
Working Capital Statement as appropriate to reflect the resolution of any
objections thereto pursuant to this Section 2(f)(ii), which shall include the
calculation of the finally determined Net Working Capital amount. The "
_Working Capital Statement_ " shall mean the Draft Working Capital Statement
together with the revisions thereto, if any, pursuant to this Section
2(f)(ii).

(iii) In the event the Parties submit any unresolved objections to an
accounting firm for resolution as provided in Section 2(f)(ii) above, the
Buyer and the Solo Parties will share responsibility for the fees and expenses
of the accounting firm as follows:

(A) if the accounting firm resolves all of the remaining objections in favor
of the Buyer (the Net Working Capital so determined is referred to herein as
the " _Low Value_ "), the Solo Parties will be responsible for all of the fees
and expenses of the accounting firm;

(B) if the accounting firm resolves all of the remaining objections in favor
of the Solo Parties (the Net Working Capital so determined is referred to
herein as the " _High Value_ "), the Buyer will be responsible for all of the
fees and expenses of the accounting firm; and

(C) if the accounting firm resolves some of the remaining objections in favor
of the Buyer and the rest of the remaining objections in favor of the Solo
Parties (the Net Working Capital so determined is referred to herein as the "
_Actual Value_ "), the Solo Parties will be responsible for that fraction of
the fees and expenses of the accounting firm equal to a quotient equal to (x)
the difference between the High Value and the Actual Value divided by (y) the
difference between the High Value and the Low Value, and the Buyer will be
responsible for the remainder of the fees and expenses.

(iv) The Buyer will make the work papers and back-up materials used in
preparing the Draft Working Capital Statement, and the books, records, and
financial staff of the Division, available to the Solo Parties and their
accountants and other representatives at reasonable times and upon reasonable
notice at any time during (A) the preparation by the Buyer of the Draft
Working Capital Statement, (B) the review by the Solo Parties of the Draft
Working Capital Statement, and (C) the resolution by the Parties of any
objections thereto.

(g) _Adjustment to Preliminary Purchase Price_. The Preliminary Purchase
Price will be adjusted as follows:

(i) If the Net Working Capital exceeds, by an amount in excess of $500,000,
the Estimated Net Working Capital, the Buyer will pay to the Solo Parties an
amount equal to the difference between (A) such excess minus (B) $500,000, by
wire transfer or  



 

3  delivery of other immediately available funds within three business days
after the date on which the Net Working Capital is finally determined pursuant
to Section 2(f) above. This additional amount shall be allocated among the
Solo Parties in accordance with Section 2(c) of the Disclosure Schedule. In
the event that the Net Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Net Working
Capital by an amount of $500,000 or less, no adjustment to the Preliminary
Purchase Price shall be made.

(ii) If the Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds, by an amount in excess of
$500,000, the Net Working Capital, the Solo Parties will pay to the Buyer an
amount equal to the difference between (A) such excess minus (B) $500,000, by
wire transfer or delivery of other immediately available funds within three
business days after the date on which the Net Working Capital is finally
determined pursuant to Section 2(f) above. In the event that the Estimated Net
Working Capital exceeds the Net Working Capital by an amount of $500,000 or
less, no adjustment to the Preliminary Purchase Price shall be made.

The Preliminary Purchase Price as so adjusted is referred to herein as the "
_Purchase Price_."

(h) _Allocation_. The Parties agree to allocate the Purchase Price (and all
other capitalizable costs) among the Acquired Assets for all purposes
(including financial accounting and tax purposes) in accordance with the
allocation schedule attached hereto as EXHIBIT D. 

3\. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SOLO PARTIES.

The Solo Parties represent and warrant, jointly and severally, to the Buyer
that the statements contained in this Section 3 are correct and
complete, except as set forth in the disclosure schedule accompanying this
Agreement (the " _Disclosure Schedule_ "). The Disclosure Schedule will be
arranged in paragraphs corresponding to the lettered and numbered paragraphs
contained in this Section 3\.

(a) _Organization of the Solo Parties_. Each of the Solo Parties and CEGI
(Hong Kong) Limited (" _CEGI_ ") is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing, and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation (or, in the case of CEGI, has a status equivalent to the
foregoing under applicable Hong Kong law).

(b) _Authorization of Transaction_. Each of the Solo Parties has full power
and authority (including full corporate power and authority) to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder. Assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Buyer, this Agreement constitutes
the valid and legally binding obligation of each of the Solo Parties,
enforceable in accordance with its terms and conditions.

(c) _Noncontravention_. Except as set forth in Section 3(c) of the Disclosure
Schedule, neither the execution and the delivery of this Agreement, nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
assignments and assumptions referred to in Section 2 above), will (i)
violate any constitution, statute, regulation, rule, injunction, judgment,
order, decree, ruling, charge, or other restriction of any government,
governmental agency, or court to which any of the Solo Parties or CEGI is
subject or any provision of the charter or  



 

4  bylaws of any of the Solo Parties or CEGI or (ii) violate, result in a
breach of, constitute a default under, result in the acceleration of, create
in any party the right to accelerate, terminate, modify, or cancel, or
require any notice under any agreement, contract, lease, license, instrument,
or other arrangement to which any of the Solo Parties or CEGI is a party or by
which it is bound or to which any of its assets is subject (or result in the
imposition of any Security Interest other than a Permitted Security Interest
upon any of its assets), including the Material Contracts and the Customer and
Supplier Agreements, except with respect to clause (ii) where the violation,
breach, default, acceleration, termination, modification, cancellation,
failure to give notice, or Security Interest would not be material to the
Division. None of the Solo Parties needs to give any notice to, make any
filing with, or obtain any authorization, consent, or approval of any
government or governmental agency or third party in order for the Parties to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
assignments and assumptions referred to in Section 2 above), except (A) for
compliance with the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, (B) where the failure to give
notice, to file, or to obtain any authorization, consent, or approval would
not be material to the Division, and (C) as disclosed in Section 3(c) of the
Disclosure Schedule.

(d) _Brokers  Fees_. The Solo Parties have no liability or obligation to pay
any fees or commissions to any broker, finder, or agent with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which the Buyer could become
liable or obligated. Except as set forth in Section 3(d) of the Disclosure
Schedule, none of the Solo Parties has any liability or obligation to pay any
fees or commissions to any broker, finder, or agent with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) _Assets_. (i) Except as disclosed in Section 3(e) of the Disclosure
Schedule, the Solo Parties have good title to, or a valid leasehold interest
in, the material tangible assets they used in the conduct of the business of
the Division, (ii) the Acquired Assets include all assets reasonably required
for the continued conduct of the Division by Buyer as the Division
is currently being conducted, and (iii) all material tangible personal
property included in the Acquired Assets is in good operating condition and
repair (except for ordinary wear and tear), free from defects (except such
defects as do not materially interfere with the value thereof or the use
thereof in the conduct of normal operations).

(f) _CEGI_. For purposes of this Section 3(f), the terms "capital stock" and
"shares" shall be deemed to include such other form of equity ownership as are
appropriate for CEGI. Section 3(f) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth for
CEGI (i) its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, (ii) the number
of authorized shares of each class of its capital stock, (iii) the number of
issued and outstanding shares of each class of its capital stock, the names of
the holders thereof, and the number of shares held by each such holder, (iv)
the number of shares of its capital stock held in treasury, and (v) its
directors and officers or, as appropriate, managers. CEGI is duly authorized
to conduct business and is in good standing under the laws of each
jurisdiction where such qualification is required, except where the lack of
such qualification would not have a Material Adverse Effect. CEGI has full
corporate power and authority to carry on the businesses in which it is
engaged and to own and use the properties owned and used by it. All of the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of CEGI have been duly
authorized and are validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable. SF Holdings
holds of record and owns beneficially all of the outstanding shares of CEGI.
Other than the outstanding shares of CEGI, the Acquired Assets do not include
any shares of capital stock or equity interests in or of any Person.



 

5 (g) _Financial Statements_. Attached hereto as EXHIBIT E are the
following financial statements (collectively the " _Financial Statements_ "),
which reflect the financial condition and results of operations of the
Division on a pro forma basis, as "carved out" from the consolidated
financial statements of Solo Cup: (i) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet
as of December 31, 2004 for the Division; (ii) audited consolidated balance
sheets, statements of income, and statements of cash flow as of and for the

statement of cash flow (the " _Most Recent Financial Statements_ ") as of and

Disclosure Schedule, the Financial Statements (including the notes
thereto) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent
basis throughout the periods covered thereby and present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial condition of the Division as of such dates
and the results of operations of the Division for such periods; _provided,
however_ , that the Financial Statements include allocations of overhead and
other items that are not reflective of the Division as a "stand-alone" entity,
and that the Most Recent Financial Statements are subject to normal year-end
adjustments and lack footnotes and other customary presentation items.

required to pay any commitment or similar fee or incur any other liability in
connection with the Debt Financing.

(j) _Establishment of Buyer Employee Benefit Plans_. Notwithstanding anything
else contained herein to the contrary, the Buyer agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to establish and implement Employee Benefits Plans for the
benefit of the Division Employees hired by the Buyer as of the Closing Date
(collectively, the " _Transferred Employees_ "), in order to provide the
Transferred Employees with coverage under Employee Welfare Benefit Plans
substantially similar to the coverage provided to the Transferred Employees
under the Employee Benefit Plans sponsored and maintained by the Solo Parties
as of the Closing. Consistent with the foregoing, Buyer agrees to
take commercially reasonable action as may be reasonably required under the
circumstances to cause the establishment and implementation of such
arrangements immediately after the Closing, but which shall in no event become
effective later than November 1, 2007, including, but not limited to, the
engagement of service providers, adoption of Employee Benefit Plan documents
and ancillary instruments, implementation of the required administrative
processes and procedures, and preparation of the required employee
communications. Upon the Solo Parties reasonable request, the Buyer agrees to
provide the Solo Parties with pertinent information as to the Buyers progress
in establishing and implementing Employee Benefit Plans as required by this
Section 5(j). The Solo Parties agree to cooperate and provide reasonable
assistance to the Buyer to accomplish the actions in the preceding sentence.

6\. POST-CLOSING COVENANTS.

The Parties agree as follows with respect to the period following the
Closing.

(a) _General_. In case at any time after the Closing any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each of
the Parties will take such further action (including the execution and
delivery of such further instruments and documents) as the other Party
reasonably may request, all at the sole cost and expense of the requesting
Party (unless the requesting Party is entitled to indemnification therefor
under Section 8 below).

  

 

18 (b) _Litigation Support_. In the event and for so long as any Party actively
is contesting or defending against any action, suit, proceeding, hearing,
investigation, charge, complaint, claim, or demand in connection with (i) any
transaction contemplated under this Agreement or (ii) any fact, situation,
circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event,
incident, action, failure to act, or transaction on or prior to the Closing
Date involving the Division, the other Party will cooperate with the
contesting or defending Party and its counsel in the contest or defense, make
available its personnel, and provide such testimony and access to its books
and records as shall be necessary in connection with the contest or defense,
all at the sole cost and expense of the contesting or defending Party (unless
the contesting or defending Party is entitled to indemnification therefor
under Section 8 below).

(c)  _Transition_.

(i) During the Non-Compete Period (as defined in Section 6(d)), none of the
Solo Parties will take any action that is designed or intended to have the
effect of discouraging any lessor, licensor, customer, supplier, or other
business associate of any of the Division and the Division Subsidiaries from
maintaining the same business relationships with the Buyer and the Division
Subsidiaries after the Closing as it maintained with the Division and the
Division Subsidiaries prior to the Closing.

(ii) The Buyer and the Solo Parties agree to furnish or cause to be furnished
to each other, and each at their own expense, as promptly as practicable, such
information (including access to books and records) and assistance, including
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanations of any material provided, relating to
the Division, the Acquired Assets and the Assumed Liabilities as is reasonably
necessary for the filing of any Income Tax Return and elections in respect
thereof, for the preparation for any audit, and for the prosecution or defense
of any claim, suit, or proceeding relating to any adjustment or proposed
adjustment with respect to any Income Tax.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, for the
period beginning as of the Closing Date and ending on October 31, 2007 (the "
_Benefits Transition Period_ "), upon the Buyers written request, the Solo
Parties shall permit the Transferred Employees to continue active
participation solely in the Employee Benefit Plans set forth on Section
6(c)(iii) of the Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the " _Solo Plans_ "), to
the extent set forth in such written request. The Solo Parties agree to amend
the Solo Plans as required to facilitate the continued Solo Plan participation
by the Transferred Employees, and further agree to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the approval and consent of the applicable
insurers and service providers as required for the Transferred Employees
continued participation. The Parties agree that notwithstanding the
Transferred Employees continued active participation in the Solo Plans during
the Benefits Transition Period, at no time during such period shall the
Transferred Employees be deemed as common law nor leased employees of the
Solo Parties as of and after the Closing Date. Neither shall the Solo Parties
have any liability  



 

19  whatsoever for the cost of the Transferred Employees coverage under the
Solo Plans nor for any claims or administrative expenses attributable to
the Transferred Employees participation in the Solo Plans during the
Benefits Transition Period, _provided that_ the Solo Parties shall act in good
faith and provide the level of services as in effect immediately prior to the
Closing Date. Nor shall the Solo Parties have any liability for COBRA
continuation coverage for any Transferred Employees who terminate employment
with the Buyer during the Benefit Transition Period. As a condition of the
Transferred Employees continued participation in the Solo Plans during the
Benefits Transition Period, the Buyer agrees (y) to comply with the
indemnification requirements of Section 8(d)(iii) hereof as well as the terms
and conditions of the Transition Services Agreement by and between the Buyer
and the Solo Parties, and (z) to deposit with a mutually agreeable escrow
agent a cash lump sum amount equal to the claims paid in connection with the
Solo Plans, in which the Transferred Employees continue to participate after
the Closing Date, for the first six months of the 2007 calendar year,
annualized and prorated based upon the number of days in the Benefit
Transition Period multiplied by 1.15 (the " _Transition Benefits
Escrow Amount_ "). Within a reasonable period of time following the end of
the Benefits Transition Period, after which the Solo Parties determine in good
faith that all pending claims under the Solo Plans in connection with the
Transferred Employees have been properly submitted and paid, but in no event
later than January 31, 2008, the Solo Parties shall return the remaining
Transition Benefits Escrow Amount to the Buyer. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in the Section 6(c)(iii) shall relieve the Buyer from complying with
the terms and conditions of the CBAs expressly assumed by the Buyer under this
Agreement, nor the terms of this Agreement as they relate to the CBAs and the
liability thereunder, as of and after the Closing.

(d) _Covenant Not to Compete_.

(i) In consideration of and as an inducement to the Buyer to enter into this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, for a period
of two years from and after the Closing Date (the " _Non-Compete Period_ "),
the Solo Parties agree that they will not, and will cause their controlled
Affiliates not to, engage, directly or indirectly, whether as a partner,
stockholder, member, principal, agent, or consultant, in any business
involving the sale of napkins (excluding napkins contained in cutlery or
"take-away" packets), table covers, tray covers, doilies, placemats, coasters,
fluted bake cups, Mylar balloons, party favors, or other tissue-based
products in or throughout North America (the " _Competing Business_ ");
_provided, however_ , that no owner of less than 5% of the outstanding stock
of any publicly traded corporation shall be deemed to engage solely by reason
thereof in any such business and _provided further_ that the activity
described in Section 6(d) of the Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to
violate this Section 6(d). The covenant set forth in this Section 6(d)
excludes all other businesses of the Solo Parties other than the Competing
Business.

(ii) If any Solo Party breaches the provisions of Section 6(d)(i) (the "
_Restrictive Covenant_ "), the Buyer shall have the right and remedy without
regard  



 

20  to any other available remedy to (x) have the Restrictive Covenant
specifically enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction and (y) have
issued an injunction restraining any such breach; it being agreed that any
breach of the Restrictive Covenant would cause irreparable and material loss
and damage to the Buyer, the amount of which cannot be readily determined and
as to which it will not have an adequate remedy at law or in damages.

(iii) It is the desire and intent of the Parties that the Restrictive Covenant
will be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public
policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought.
Accordingly, if any Restrictive Covenant or any portion thereof shall be
adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, such Restrictive Covenant shall
be deemed amended to the extent necessary in order that such provision be
valid and enforceable, such amendment to apply only with respect to the
operation of such Restrictive Covenant in the particular jurisdiction in
which such adjudication is made.

(e) _Multiemployer Plan; Bond_. Throughout the Multiemployer Plan Period, the
Buyer shall (i) make the contributions required by section 4204(a)(1)(A) of
ERISA to such Multiemployer Plan pursuant to the terms of the CBAs; (ii) pay
any withdrawal liability properly assessed to Buyer by such Multiemployer
Plan; (iii) maintain in full force and effect each Bond, in the Required Bond
Amount; and (iv) comply in all material respects with the requirements of
section 4204 of ERISA. Subject to Section 8(d)(i) of this Agreement, in the
event that the Buyer breaches one or more of the covenants set forth in
clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 6(e), the Solo Parties will be
secondarily liable for any withdrawal liability they would have had to any
such Multiemployer Plan with respect to the operations of the Division (but
for section 4204 of ERISA). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Section 6(e) shall prohibit Buyer from effecting a consolidation, shut down,
or reduction in force that would result in a withdrawal liability, subject to
Section 8(c)(iii).

(f) _COBRA and WARN Obligations_. Buyer covenants to the Solo Parties that it
will hire such of the Division Employees so as to not result in the Solo
Parties being subject to an obligation to issue WARN notices, provided that
the Solo Parties are not in breach of the representation set forth in Section
3(r)(vi) of this Agreement. Buyer further covenants that, subject to Section
6(c)(iii), Buyer shall offer group health plan coverages (excluding retiree
medical coverage) comparable in the aggregate to those currently offered by
the Solo Parties to such Division Employees and shall be primarily
responsible for providing such Division Employees who become employees of the
Buyer after the Closing, whose "qualifying event," within the meaning of
section 4980B(f) of the Code, occurs after the Closing Date (and such
employees "qualified beneficiaries" within the meaning of section 4980B(f) of
the Code) with continuation of group health coverage required by section
4980B(f) of the Code. Buyer will notify the Solo Parties of any Division
Employee not hired by the Buyer within five calendar days after the Closing
Date. The Solo Parties will be responsible for providing Division Employees
and their "qualified beneficiaries" who do not become employees of the Buyer
with continuation of group health care coverage required under section
4980B(f) of the Code.

(g) _Assumption of Employer Responsibilities_. With respect to the
Transferred Employees (as defined in Section 6(c)(iii)), (i) Buyer shall
assume on the Closing Date all  



 

21  liabilities of the Solo Parties to such Division Employees for wages,
incentive compensation, vacations, perquisites, workers compensation
benefits, statutory benefits, and entitlement including, without limitation,
all obligations to such Division Employees under applicable federal, state, or
local law that have accrued on or prior to the Closing Date solely to the
extent such amounts have been included and are set forth in reasonable detail
in the Working Capital Statement or as set forth in Section 6(g)(i) of the
Disclosure Schedule and (ii) the Solo Parties shall retain all liabilities to
the Transferred Employees and any Division Employees who are not Transferred
Employees for wages, incentive compensation, vacations, perquisites, workers
compensation benefits, statutory benefits, and entitlement including, without
limitation, all obligations to the Transferred Employees and any Division
Employees who are not Transferred Employees under applicable federal, state,
or local law that have accrued on or prior to the Closing Date to the extent
such amounts have not been included in the Working Capital Statement or set
forth in Section 6(g)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Buyer will only assume vacations to the extent that the Division
Employees authorize a transfer of such accrued vacations from the Solo
Parties to the Buyer.

(h) _Non-Solicitation of Division Employees Non-Solicitation by the Solo
Parties_. For a period of 18 months from the Closing Date, the Solo Parties,
including their Affiliates, may not, without the prior written consent of the
Buyer, directly or indirectly solicit any salaried or management Transferred
Employee who is actively providing services to the Division as of the Closing
Date (collectively, the " _Covered Division Employees_ "). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 6(h), general employment
solicitations made via broadly disseminated media, such as radio, internet,
or newspaper advertisements, shall not be deemed to violate this Section 6(h),
provided that such solicitations are not specifically targeted at Covered
Division Employees.

(i) _Non-Solicitation by the Buyer_. For a period of 18 months from the
Closing Date, the Buyer, including its Affiliates, may not, without the prior
written consent of the Solo Parties, directly or indirectly solicit any
salaried or management employee of the Solo Parties who is actively providing
services to the Solo Parties as of the Closing Date or any other employee with
whom the Buyer or its Affiliates came into contact as part of the process
leading to the execution of this Agreement (collectively, the " _Covered Solo
Employees_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6(i),
general employment solicitations made via broadly disseminated media, such as
radio, internet, or newspaper advertisements, shall not be deemed to violate
this Section 6(i), provided that such solicitations are not specifically
targeted at Covered Solo Employees.

(j) _Mail and Other Communications_. The Solo Parties agree that at any time
and from time to time after the Closing, the Buyer and its Affiliates shall
have the right and authority to open all mail and other communications, in all
formats (both tangible and intangible) (collectively, " _Mail_ "), including
service of process, received by the Buyer or its Affiliates pertaining to the
Division, even if addressed to the Solo Parties or any of their Affiliates,
for processing or forwarding to the Solo Parties. The Solo Parties further
agree to promptly forward to the Buyer all Mail pertaining to the Division
received by the Solo Parties or any of their Affiliates at any time and from
time to time after the Closing.



 

22 (k) _Collection of Accounts Receivable_. The Solo Parties agree that, from and
after the Closing, the Buyer shall have the right and authority to collect
for the Buyers own account or for the account of its Affiliates all accounts
receivable relating to the Division. The Buyer and its Affiliates shall have
the right to endorse with the name of the Solo Parties and their Affiliates
on any checks received on account of any such accounts receivable. The Solo
Parties agree to promptly transfer and deliver to the Buyer, any cash or
property that the Solo Parties and their Affiliates may receive in respect of
any such accounts receivable.

(l) _Confidentiality_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
after the Closing, no Solo Party shall disclose to third persons any
information concerning the operation of the Division and the transfer of the
Acquired Assets hereunder, which information was disclosed to and transferred,
assigned, licensed, or otherwise made available to Buyer or its Affiliates.
Without limitation, this obligation of confidentiality shall apply to
information related to the products, business plans, strategies, technologies,
and future business relationships of the Division. This obligation of
confidentiality shall not apply to the extent any such information (i) is or
becomes part of the public domain through no fault of the Solo Parties (but
only after and only to the extent that it is published or otherwise becomes
part of the public domain); (ii) after the Closing, comes into the possession
of the Solo Parties from a third person, other than Buyer or its Affiliates,

confidence to the disclosing party; (iii) is disclosed to advisors to the Solo
Parties in connection with the preparation of financial statements or internal
reports or documents, (iv) is disclosed to governmental or regulatory
authorities to the extent deemed necessary or appropriate in the reasonable
judgment of the Solo Parties; or (v) is disclosed by the Solo Parties pursuant
to any judicial compulsion, provided that Buyer is notified at the time
such judicial action is initiated.

warranties, and covenants contained in this Agreement and if there is an
applicable survival period pursuant to Section 8(a) above, provided that the
Buyer makes a written claim for indemnification against the Solo Parties
pursuant to Section 10(g) below within such survival period, then the Solo
Parties, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify the Buyer from and against
the entirety of any Adverse Consequences the Buyer shall suffer by the breach;
_provided, however_ , that the Solo Parties shall not have any obligation to
indemnify the Buyer from and against any Adverse Consequences caused by the
breach of any representation or warranty (determined without regard to any
materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifiers) of the Solo Parties listed
in Sections 8(a)(ii) and 8(a)(iii) above (whether or not notice of such breach
was provided pursuant to Section 5(e)) until the Buyer has suffered Adverse
Consequences by reason of all such breaches in excess of $4,000,000 (the "
_Basket_ ") (after which point the Solo Parties will be obligated only to
indemnify the Buyer from and against such Adverse Consequences in excess of
the Basket), and _provided further_ that, with respect to breaches of
the representations or warranties listed in Sections 8(a)(ii) and 8(a)(iii),
the maximum amount of Adverse Consequences of the Buyer for which the Solo
Parties may be liable under this Section 8(c)(i) shall not exceed an aggregate
ceiling of $10,000,000 (the " _Cap_ ") (after which point the Solo Parties
will have no obligation to indemnify the Buyer under this Section 8(c)(i) with
respect to breaches of the representations and warranties identified in
Sections 8(a)(ii) and 8(a)(iii) from and against such Adverse Consequences in
excess of the Cap). Breaches of the covenants and breaches of the

26  any Excluded Liability (including any liability of the Solo Parties that
becomes a liability of the Buyer under any bulk transfer law of any
jurisdiction, under any common law doctrine of de facto merger or successor
liability, or otherwise by operation of law).

(iii) 

(A) Notwithstanding the above provisions of this Section 8(c) and anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Solo Parties agree to
jointly and severally indemnify and hold Buyer harmless from and against the
imposition of partial withdrawal liability, as such term is defined under
section 4205 of ERISA, imposed by PACE Industry Union-Management Pension Fund
(" _PIUMPF_ ") on Buyer [**]. The indemnity obligations of the Solo Parties
pursuant to this Section 8(c)(iii) shall be subject to neither the Basket nor
the Cap. In addition, Section 8(e) and the first and last sentences of
Section 8(f) shall not apply to the indemnity obligations of the Solo Parties
pursuant to this Section 8(c)(iii). The foregoing limitations on the amount of
the Solo Parties indemnification obligation shall be applied notwithstanding
the actual amount of the assessment.

(B) In the event withdrawal liability is imposed by PIUMPF on the Buyer for a
complete withdrawal under Section 4203 of ERISA that is triggered by or
results from any action of Buyer [**] the Solo Parties shall jointly and
severally indemnify the Buyer from such portion of such liability, subject to
the Maximum Withdrawal Indemnification. For the avoidance of doubt, the
liability of the Solo Parties under this Section 8(c)(iii) shall not in the
aggregate exceed the Maximum Withdrawal Indemnification.

** Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to certain portions
of this exhibit. Omitted portions have been filed separately with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.



 

27 (C) Buyer agrees that, as a condition precedent to the Solo Parties
indemnification obligation under this Section 8(c)(iii): (x) Buyer shall
notify the Solo Parties in writing within thirty business days of Buyers
receipt of a withdrawal liability assessment from PIUMPF [**] or of Buyers
receipt of written notification from PIUMPF that a withdrawal liability
assessment [**]; (y) the Solo Parties are allowed an opportunity to review the
accuracy of the withdrawal liability assessment information in Buyers
possession, including the underlying assumptions, amount, timing, and form of
payment including access to information provided to Buyer by PIUMPF for
underlying data as it relates to the assessment and the Solo Parties
responsibilities hereunder, prior to Buyer responding to PIUMPF; (z) Buyer
will cooperate with the Solo Parties to dispute the amount of any such
assessment provided that Buyer shall have the sole discretion to enter into an
agreement with PIUMPF regarding the amount of the withdrawal liability;
and (aa) in the event the Solo Parties indemnification obligation arises
under this Section 8(c)(iii), Buyer shall provide the Solo Parties with
documentation evidencing Buyers remittance of payment to PIUMPF [**]. In the
event the Solo Parties indemnification obligation under this Section
8(c)(iii) arises, such obligation shall be satisfied by the Solo Parties
pursuant to the methodology applicable to Buyer as established by PIUMPF or as
agreed to between Buyer and PIUMPF; _provided, however_ , that the Solo
Parties reimbursement obligation shall be satisfied in the form of
reimbursement to Buyer for the allocable amount that Buyer has remitted to
PIUMPF [**], within three business days after Buyer has provided the Solo
Parties with documentation evidencing Buyers remittance of such payment to
PIUMPF.

(D) The indemnification obligation of the Solo Parties under this Section
8(c)(iii) shall not apply to any assertion or claim of a right to contribution
related solely to the imposition of withdrawal liability on a facility [**].
Any such PIUMPF assessment shall be the obligation of Buyer without a right
of contribution from the Solo Parties. The Solo Parties indemnification
obligation under this Section 8(c)(iii) shall apply to any event [**] that
occurs during the five years commencing with the date of the Closing provided
written notice if such event has been provided to the Solo Parties by Buyer
within such five year period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Solo Parties
shall continue to be secondarily liable to PIUMPF under Section 4204 of
ERISA.

(d) _Indemnification Provisions for Benefit of the Solo Parties_.

(i) In the event the Buyer breaches any of its representations, warranties,
and covenants contained in this Agreement, and, if there is an applicable
survival period pursuant to Section 8(b) above, provided that the Solo Parties
make a written claim for indemnification against the Buyer pursuant to Section
10(g) below within the applicable survival period, then the Buyer agrees to
indemnify the Solo Parties from and against the entirety of any Adverse
Consequences the Solo Parties shall suffer through and after the

** Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to certain portions
of this exhibit. Omitted portions have been filed separately with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.



 

28  date of the claim for indemnification caused proximately by the breach. With
respect to any breach by the Buyer of Section 6(e) of this Agreement
during the Multiemployer Plan Period, with respect to any Multiemployer Plan
covering Division Employees, in the event that the Solo Parties become
secondarily liable to any such Multiemployer Plan for any withdrawal liability
the Solo Parties would have had pursuant to section 4204 of ERISA (but for
such section), the survival period shall be the period beginning on the
Closing Date and ending on the last day of the applicable Multiemployer Plan
Period.

(ii) The Buyer agrees to indemnify the Solo Parties from and against the
entirety of any Adverse Consequences the Solo Parties shall suffer in respect
of any Assumed Liability.

(iii) The Buyer agrees to indemnify the Solo Parties from and against
the entirety of any Adverse Consequences the Solo Parties shall suffer in
respect of the Transferred Employees participation in Employee Benefit Plans
sponsored by the Solo Parties during the Benefits Transition Period as set
forth in Section 6(c)(iii), _provided that_ (y) the Solo Parties act in good
faith and provide the same level of service as in effect prior to the Closing
Date, and (z) the Solo Parties do not suffer such Adverse Consequences due to
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any of the Solo Parties.

(e) _Matters Involving Third Parties_.

(i) If any third party shall notify any Party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ")
with respect to any matter (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") which may give rise to
a claim for indemnification against the other Party (the " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") under this Section 8, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly (and
in any event within five business days after receiving notice of the Third
Party Claim) notify the Indemnifying Party thereof in writing (the " _Third
Party Claim Notice_ ").

(ii) The Indemnifying Party will have the right at any time within 30 days
following its receipt of a Third Party Claim Notice to assume and thereafter
conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice;
_provided, however_ , that the Indemnifying Party will not consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to
be withheld unreasonably) unless the judgment or proposed settlement provides
solely for the payment of money damages and does not impose an injunction or
other equitable relief and the Indemnified Party receives an unconditional
release with respect to such claim or settlement.

(iii) Unless and until the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the Third
Party Claim as provided in Section 8(e)(ii) above, however, the Indemnified
Party may defend against the Third Party Claim in any manner it reasonably may

Capital Statement (so as to directly reduce the Purchase Price), tax benefits
as and when actually received arising from facts and circumstances giving rise

respect to Adverse Consequences for purposes of this Section 8\. All
indemnification payments under this Section 8 shall be deemed adjustments to
the Purchase Price. Each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate any claim asserted under this Section 8; _provided, however_ , that
under no circumstances will any Party be under a duty to instigate litigation
proceedings in connection with such mitigation efforts.

equitable remedy to which a party may be entitled with respect to any claims
or causes of action arising from the breach of any covenants or agreements of
a party hereto that is to be performed subsequent to the Closing, the Buyer

provisions in this Section 8 shall be the exclusive remedy of the Buyer and
the Solo Parties with respect to the Division, the Division Subsidiaries, and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

above, the Buyer understands and agrees that its right to indemnification

Solo Parties with respect to any environmental, health, or safety matter
relating to the past, current or future facilities, properties or operations
of the Division, the Division Subsidiaries, and all of their respective
predecessors or Affiliates, including without limitation any such matter
arising under any Environmental, Health, and Safety Requirements. Aside from
such right to indemnification, the Buyer hereby waives any right, whether
arising at law or in equity, to seek contribution, cost recovery, damages, or
any other recourse or remedy from the Solo Parties, and hereby releases the
Solo Parties from any claim, demand or liability, with respect to any such
environmental, health, or safety matter (including without limitation any

(i) Any agreement between the Solo Parties (other than the Division

payment of taxes or amounts in lieu of taxes shall be deemed terminated at and
as of the Closing.

 



 

33 (ii) The Solo Parties will be responsible for the preparation and filing of
all tax returns for the Division and the Division Subsidiaries for all
periods as to which tax returns are due after the Closing Date (including the
consolidated, unitary, and combined tax returns of the Solo Parties that
include the operations of the Division and the Division Subsidiaries) for any
period ending on or before the Closing Date. The Solo Parties will make all
payments required with respect to any such tax return.

(iii) The Buyer will be responsible for the preparation and filing of all tax
returns for the Division and the Division Subsidiaries for all periods as to
which tax returns are due after the Closing Date (other than (x) for taxes
with respect to periods for which the consolidated, unitary, and combined tax
returns of the Solo Parties will include the operations of the Division and
the Division Subsidiaries and (y) tax returns described above in Section
10(n)(ii)). The Buyer will make all payments required with respect to any such
tax return; _provided, however_ , that the Solo Parties will reimburse
the Buyer concurrently therewith to the extent any payment the Buyer is
making relates to the operations of any of the Division and the Division
Subsidiaries for any period ending on or before the Closing Date.

(iv) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any taxes of the Division
and the Division Subsidiaries that are payable with respect to any tax period
that begins before and ends after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "),
the portion of any such taxes that are allocable to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall: (i) in the case of taxes
that are either (1) based upon or related to income or receipts, or (2)
imposed in connection with any sale, transfer, or assignment or any deemed
sale, transfer, or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible,
or intangible), be deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the
tax year or period ended on the Closing Date; and (ii) in the case of all
other taxes, be deemed to be the amount of such taxes for the entire Straddle
Period (or, in the case of such taxes determined on an arrears basis, the
amount of such taxes for the immediately preceding tax period) multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion
of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period.

(v) The Solo Parties shall have furnished the Buyer with a certificate
stating that the Solo Parties are not "foreign" persons within the meaning of
section 1445 of the Code, which certificate shall set forth all information
required by, and otherwise be executed in accordance with, Treasury
Regulation section 1.1445-2(b)(2).

(o) _Employee Benefits Matters_.

(i) The Buyer will become a contributing employer to the Multiemployer Plan
and will adopt and assume at and as of the Closing each of the Employee
Benefit Plans (excluding any retiree medical plan or arrangement) that the
Solo Parties maintain with respect to any Division Employee (including each
trust, insurance contract, annuity contract, or other funding arrangement that
the Solo Parties have established with respect thereto) which are exclusive
to the Division (collectively, the " _Exclusive Plans_ "). The Buyer will
ensure that the Transferred Employees are credited with their employment  



 

34  with any of the Solo Parties prior to the Closing Date the same as
employment with any of the Buyer and its Affiliates from and after the Closing
Date for purposes of eligibility, vesting, and benefit accrual (except as
would result in a duplication of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of
Buyer. The Solo Parties will transfer (or cause the appropriate plan
administrator through the trustee, if any, to transfer) to the Buyer (or
applicable trustee) at and as of the Closing all of the corresponding assets
associated with the Exclusive Plans and at that time the Buyer shall assume
all liabilities associated with such Division Employees with respect to such
Exclusive Plans. With respect to each Multiemployer Plan, the Parties shall
take all actions necessary to comply with the requirements of ERISA section
4204. The Solo Parties shall indemnify and hold Buyer harmless for
all operational errors associated with the administration of the Exclusive
Plans prior to the Closing.

(ii) For each Employee Benefit Plan that is not exclusive to the Division
(collectively, the " _Shared Plans_ "), the Solo Parties agree to permit each
Transferred Employee to effect a "direct rollover" (within the meaning of
section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of his or her account balances under any
Shared Plan of the Solo Parties that is a defined contribution plan intended
to qualify under section 401(a) of the Code, including a qualified cash or
deferred arrangement under section 401(k) of the Code (the " _Solo 401(k)
Plan_ ") if such rollover is elected in accordance with applicable law by such
Transferred Employee. The Buyer agrees to establish a defined contribution
plan that includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the
meaning of section 401(k) of the Code (the " _Buyer 401(k) Plan_ ") to accept
a direct rollover to the Buyer 401(k) Plan of such Transferred Employees
account balances under the Seller 401(k) Plan if such rollover is elected in
accordance with applicable law by such Transferred Employee.

(iii) Pursuant to Section 5(j), and subject to Section 6(c)(iii), as of the
Closing Date or November 1, 2007, the Buyer shall cause each Transferred
Employee to be credited under the Buyers Flexible Spending Account Plan ("
_Buyer s FSA_") with amounts available for reimbursement between the Closing
Date and December 31, 2007 equal to such amounts as were credited under the
Solo Parties Flexible Spending Account (" _Solo FSA_ ") with respect to such
Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date. The Buyer shall
give effect under the Buyers FSA to calendar year 2007 elections made by the
Transferred Employees with respect to the Solo FSA.

(iv) Pursuant to Section 5(j), and subject to Section 6(c)(iii), as of the
Closing Date or November 1, 2007, the Buyer shall cause each Transferred
Employee to be credited under the Buyers Major Medical Plan (" _Buyer s
Medical Plan_") with the amount of the Transferred Employees co-pays,
deductibles and similar cost-sharing amounts paid under the Solo Parties
Major Medical Plan (" _Solo Medical Plan_ ") as a condition of the Transferred
Employees entitlement to medial coverage between January 1, 2007 and the
Closing Date. The Buyer shall also give effect under the Buyers Medical Plan
to calendar year 2007 elections made by the Transferred Employees with respect
to the Solo Medical Plan. Buyer shall cause any pre-existing condition
limitation exclusions and any other limitations or exclusions applicable to
the Transferred Employees under Buyers Medical Plan to be waived.



 

35 (p) _Bulk Transfer Laws_. Without limiting its right to indemnity under
Article 8, the Buyer acknowledges that the Solo Parties will not comply with
the provisions of any bulk transfer laws of any jurisdiction in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(q) _Arbitration_. Any controversy or claim arising out of, relating to, or in
connection with this Agreement or any related agreement shall be settled by
arbitration in accordance with the following provisions:

(i) The agreement of the Parties to arbitrate covers all disputes of every
kind relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any related agreement, or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the interpretation,
breach, termination, or validity hereof or thereof, except that any Party may
apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for emergency or provisional
relief in order to prevent irreparable harm to such Party pending the
appointment of the arbitrators hereunder, including a temporary restraining
order, preliminary injunction, or other similar relief, in connection with
any matter for which equitable relief is specifically provided in this
Agreement or any other related agreement. Disputes include actions for breach
of contract with respect to this Agreement or the related agreements, as well
as any claim based upon tort or any other causes of action relating to the
negotiation, execution, delivery, or performance of this Agreement or to the
transactions contemplated hereby, such as claims based upon an allegation of
fraud or misrepresentation and claims based upon a federal or state statute.
In addition, the arbitrators selected according to the procedures set forth
below shall determine the arbitrability of any matter covered by this Section
10(q), and their decision shall be final and binding on the Parties.

(ii) The forum for the arbitration shall be Chicago, Illinois.

(iii) The governing law for the arbitration shall be the law of the State of
Delaware, without reference to its conflicts of laws provisions.

(iv) There shall be three arbitrators, unless the Parties are able to
agree on a single arbitrator. In the absence of such agreement within ten
days after the initiation of an arbitration proceeding, the Solo Parties shall
select one arbitrator and the Buyer shall select one arbitrator, and those two
arbitrators shall then select, within ten days, a third arbitrator. If those
two arbitrators are unable to select a third arbitrator within such ten-day
period, a third arbitrator shall be appointed from the commercial panel of the
American Arbitration Association in accordance with the selection rules of
the American Arbitration Association. The decision in writing of at least two
of the three arbitrators shall be final and binding upon the Parties, unless
the arbitrators shall have committed a gross and manifest error with respect
to applicable law, in which case a party may appeal such error to the Federal
District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The Parties submit to
the exclusive jurisdiction of such court in connection with any such appeal,
and waive any and all objections to such jurisdiction that it may have under
the laws of the United States or of any state.



 

36 (v) The rules of arbitration shall be the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
American Arbitration Association, as modified by any other instructions that
the Parties may agree upon at the time. If there is any conflict between those
Rules and the provisions of this section, the provisions of this section shall
prevail.

(vi) The arbitrators decision shall be in writing and shall provide a
reasoned basis, including all relevant findings of fact and conclusions of
law, for the resolution of each dispute and for any award.

(vii) Each Party to any arbitration pursuant to this Section 10(q) shall pay
the fees and expenses of the arbitrator selected by such Party, and shall
share equally the fees and expenses of the American Arbitration Association
and the third arbitrator contemplated by Section 10(q)(iv). 

(viii) The arbitrators shall have power and authority to award any remedy or
judgment that could be awarded by a court of law in Illinois. The award
rendered by arbitration shall be final and binding upon the Parties, and
judgment upon the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction
in the United States. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the arbitrators shall
have no authority to award any remedy or judgment that is expressly proscribed
by this Agreement.
