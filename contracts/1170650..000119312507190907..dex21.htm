iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of August 27, 2007 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is among MEDCO HEALTH SOLUTIONS, INC., a Delaware corporation
(" _Parent_ "), MACQ CORP., a Massachusetts corporation and a wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and POLYMEDICA CORPORATION, a
Massachusetts corporation (the " _Company_ "). Certain terms used in this
Agreement are used as defined in Section 8.11.

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of the Company and Merger Sub has
approved and declared advisable, and in the best interests of the Company and
Merger Sub, as applicable, and the Board of Directors of Parent has approved,
this Agreement and the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "
_Merger_ ") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

WHEREAS, prior to or contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, certain executives of the Company have executed and delivered to
Parent certain letter agreements confirming that they will remain employed by
the Company following the Closing contemplated by this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

_The Merger_

SECTION 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Massachusetts Business
Corporation Act (the " _MBCA_ "), at the Effective Time Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company, and the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and the Company shall be the surviving
corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

SECTION 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at 10:00 a.m. (New York time) on a date to be specified by the
parties, which date shall be no later than the second business day after
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time), at
the offices of Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, 100 Federal Street, 34th Floor,
Boston, Massachusetts 02110, unless another time, date or place is agreed to
in writing by the parties hereto. The date on which the Closing actually
occurs hereinafter is referred to as the " _Closing Date_ ".

SECTION 1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
soon as practicable on the Closing Date the parties shall file with the
Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts articles of merger, executed in
accordance with, and in    such form as is required by, the relevant provisions of the MBCA (the "
_Articles of Merger_ "). The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of
the Articles of Merger or at such later time and date as is agreed to by the
parties hereto (the time and date at which the Merger becomes effective is
herein referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

SECTION 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth herein and in applicable provisions of the MBCA. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all
the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities
and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities
and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

SECTION 1.5  _Articles of Organization and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation_. The articles of organization of the Company shall be amended and
restated in their entirety at the Effective Time to be substantially in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit A. At the Effective Time, the by-laws of the
Company shall be amended in their entirety at the Effective Time to be
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B.

SECTION 1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

(a) Each of the parties hereto shall take all necessary action to cause the
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective
Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with
the articles of organization and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) Each of the parties hereto shall take all necessary action to cause the
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time to be
the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors
are duly appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the articles of organization and by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation. 

ARTICLE II

_Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Corporations;_

_Exchange of Certificates; Company Stock Options_

SECTION 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") or any shares of capital stock of Merger
Sub:

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.



 

2 (b) _Parent-Owned Stock_. Any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent
or Merger Sub shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares)
shall be converted into the right to receive $53.00 in cash, without interest
(the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (or
evidence of shares in book-entry form) which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "
_Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration
therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2(b),
without interest.

SECTION 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate
Equiserve Trust Company or another bank or trust company reasonably acceptable
to the Company to act as agent for the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive, on
terms reasonably acceptable to the Company, for the benefit of holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, the aggregate Merger Consideration to which
holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall become entitled pursuant to
Section 2.1(c). Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, such aggregate
Merger Consideration with the Paying Agent at or prior to the Effective Time.
The Paying Agent shall invest such aggregate Merger Consideration in any of
(i) direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii) obligations for
which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to
provide for the payment of principal and interest, (iii) commercial paper
rated the highest quality by either Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Ratings Services or (iv) money market funds investing
solely in a combination of the foregoing. Any net profit resulting from, or
income or interest produced by, such investments, shall be payable to Parent.

(b) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event
more than five business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Common
Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in such
form and shall have such other customary provisions (including customary
provisions with respect to delivery of an "agents message" with respect to
shares held in book-entry form) as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions (and such other customary documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger  



 

3  Consideration, without interest, for each share of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any
amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. If payment of the
Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and be accompanied by all
documents required to evidence such transfer and (y) the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason
of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate surrendered or shall have established
to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes
either have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this Article II, without interest.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of
this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented
by such Certificates, and at the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates that evidenced ownership of shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common
Stock, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. Subject
to the last sentence of Section 2.2(e), if, at any time after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, as
contemplated by this Article II.

(e) _Termination of Fund_. At any time following the six-month anniversary of
the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with
respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and which
have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such
holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as
 



 

4  general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger
Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates held by
such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest
thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which
such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

(g) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "
_Code_ "), or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. The
withholding party shall timely remit such withheld amounts to the appropriate
taxing authority, and such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. If any withholding obligation may be
avoided by such holder providing information or documentation to Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such information shall be requested
prior to any such withholding.

SECTION 2.3 _Appraisal/Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a
shareholder who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in
writing) and who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
shares (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all
respects with, the provisions of Part 13 of the MBCA (the " _Dissenting
Shareholders_ "), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead such holder shall be
entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the
provisions of Part 13 of the MBCA (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Part 13 of the
MBCA), unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost rights to appraisal under the MBCA. If any
Dissenting Shareholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost such right, such holders shares of Company Common Stock
shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and become
exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger
Consideration for each such share of Company Common Stock, in accordance with
Section 2.1, without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent (i)
prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company
Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other  



 

5  instruments served pursuant to the MBCA and received by the Company relating
to shareholders rights of appraisal, and (ii) the opportunity to participate
in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under the MBCA.

SECTION 2.4  _Company Stock Options and Restricted Shares_.

(a) The Company shall provide that, at the Effective Time, all options
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that represent the right
to acquire shares of Company Common Stock (each, an " _Option_ ") granted
under any plan listed in Section 2.4 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (a "
_Company Stock Plan_ ") shall be cancelled and each holder of an Option,
whether or not vested, shall be paid in full satisfaction of such Option, a
cash amount equal to the Option Consideration for each share of Company Common
Stock then subject to the Option, including any such shares as to which the
Option has not vested. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Option
Consideration_ " means, with respect to any share of Company Common Stock
issuable under a particular Option, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of
(i) the Merger Consideration per share of Company Common Stock over (ii) the
exercise price payable in respect of such share of Company Common Stock
issuable under such Option. The cash payments to be made to holders of
Options pursuant to this Section 2.4(a) shall be made by the Surviving
Corporation as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date.

(b) The Company shall provide that each share of Company Common Stock granted
subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions pursuant to any Company Stock
Plan (the " _Company Restricted Common Stock_ ") which is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest and become free of such
restrictions as of the Effective Time and at the Effective Time the holder
thereof shall, subject to this Article II, be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration with respect to each such Company Restricted Common Stock.

(c) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to a holder of any Option or any shares of Company
Restricted Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law. The withholding party shall timely remit such withheld amounts to the
appropriate taxing authority, and such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made. If any withholding obligation
may be avoided by such holder providing information or documentation to
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such information shall
be requested prior to any such withholding.

(d) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors and
the compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and
take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the provisions of Section
2.4(a) and 2.4(b). The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that
from and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
will be required to deliver shares of Company Common Stock or other
capital stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in  



 

6  settlement of Company Options or Company Restricted Common Stock after the
Effective Time.

SECTION 2.5 _Treatment of the Warrants_. The Warrants shall be treated as set
forth in Section 5.14.

SECTION 2.6 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Article II to
the contrary, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of the occurrence or
record date of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or
similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted
to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction.

ARTICLE III

_Representations and Warranties of the Company_

Except as disclosed in (a) the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company
to Parent (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") prior to the execution of
this Agreement (with specific reference to the section of this Agreement to
which the information stated in such disclosure relates; _provided_ that (i)
disclosure in any section of such Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed
to be disclosed with respect to any other section of this Agreement only to
the extent that it is reasonably apparent on the face of the Company
Disclosure Schedule that such disclosure is applicable to such other section
notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross reference thereto and
(ii) the mere inclusion of an item in such Company Disclosure Schedule as an
exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission
that such item represents a material exception or material fact, event or
circumstance or that such item has had, would have or would reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect) or (b) in the Company SEC
Documents filed on or after June 13, 2005 and prior to the date of this
Agreement, but excluding (x) any risk factor disclosure contained in any such
Company SEC Documents under the heading "Risk Factors" or "Cautionary Note
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" or similar heading and (y) all exhibits
and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein, the
Company hereby represents and warrants, on behalf of itself and each of its

SECTION 3.1 _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_.

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and has all
requisite corporate power and authority necessary to own, lease and operate
all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted. The Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business and
is in good standing (or equivalent status) in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification  



 

7  necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good
standing (or equivalent status) does not have, or would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Material Adverse
Effect_ " means any change, circumstance, event, occurrence or effect that has
occurred that, when taken together with all other adverse changes,
circumstances, events, occurrences or effects that have occurred, is or is
reasonably likely to be, materially adverse to the business, assets,
liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of the Company and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, except to the extent resulting from (i) (A)
the general economic conditions in the United States or any change in any
United States federal or state statute, rule or regulation or any change in
Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental healthcare reimbursement policy, or
(B) the commencement, continuation or escalation of a war or a material act of
terrorism; _provided_ that with respect to clauses (i)(A) and (i)(B), such
changes, circumstances, events, occurrences or effects do not adversely affect
the Company and its Subsidiaries in a meaningfully disproportionate manner as
compared to other companies of similar size in such industries in which the
Company and its Subsidiaries operate; (ii) resulting from or attributable to
any loss of, or adverse change in, the relationship of the Company with its
customers, employees or suppliers that was proximately caused by the
announcement of this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions or
(iii) any decline in the market price or change in trading volume of the
capital stock of the Company or any failure to meet publicly announced revenue
or earnings projections (it being understood that the underlying cause or
causes of any such decline, change or failure may be deemed to constitute, in
and of itself or themselves, a Material Adverse Effect and may be taken into
consideration when determining whether there has occurred a Material Adverse
Effect).

(b) Each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. The
name and jurisdiction of organization of each Subsidiary is set forth on
Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. All the outstanding shares
of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each such Subsidiary are
owned directly or indirectly by the Company free and clear of all liens,
pledges, security interests and transfer restrictions, except for such
transfer restrictions of general applicability as may be provided under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (the " _Securities Act_ "), and other applicable securities Laws.
Each of the Companys Subsidiaries has all requisite corporate power and
authority necessary to own, lease and operate all of its properties and assets
and to carry on its businesses as they are now being conducted. Each of the
Companys Subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do business in, and
is in good standing (or equivalent status) in, each jurisdiction in which the
nature of the business conducted by such Subsidiary, or the character or
location of the properties and assets owned or leased by such Subsidiary,
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be so licensed, qualified or in good standing (or equivalent status) does not
have, or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

(c) The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of
the articles of organization and by-laws of the Company and the
organizational documents of each of its Subsidiaries, as amended to the date
of this Agreement (the " _Company Charter Documents_ ").

of grant, term, number of shares of Company Common Stock and, where
applicable, exercise price and vesting schedule, including whether
the vesting will be accelerated by the execution of this Agreement or
consummation of the Merger or by termination of employment or change of
position following consummation of the Merger. Section 3.2(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule contains a correct and complete list of Options and
Company Restricted Stock granted or issued since July 31, 2007, including,
with respect to each, the information specified in the previous sentence. All
outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Company have been duly

options or other rights of any kind which obligate the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue or deliver any shares of capital stock, voting
securities or other equity interests of the Company or any securities or
obligations convertible into or exchangeable into or exercisable for any
shares of capital stock, voting securities or other equity interests of the
Company (collectively, " _Company Securities_ "); (B) there are no outstanding
obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or

(or convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote)
on any matters on which the holders of capital stock of the Company may vote
are issued and outstanding.

(b) Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock, voting securities or
other equity interests of each Subsidiary of the Company is duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of any preemptive rights,
and all such securities are owned by the Company or another wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company and are owned free and clear of all liens, charges,
pledges, security interests, claims or other encumbrances (each, a " _Lien_
"). There are no (i) preemptive rights, outstanding options, warrants,  



 

9  conversion rights, stock appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase
rights, agreements, arrangements, calls, commitments or other rights of any
kind which obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or
deliver any shares of capital stock, voting securities or other equity
interests of any Company Subsidiary or any securities or obligations
convertible into or exchangeable into or exercisable for any shares of
capital stock, voting securities or other equity interest of a Company
Subsidiary, (ii) outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any securities

Company owns any Company Common Stock.

(c) Except as described in Section 3.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries directly or indirectly owns
5% or more of the outstanding equity or similar interests in, or any interest
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for 5% or more of the equity
or similar interests in, any corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture or other business association or entity (other than the
Company Subsidiaries).

The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement, and
the consummation by it of the Transactions, have been duly authorized and
approved by its Board of Directors, and except for obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval, no other corporate action on the part of the Company is
necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by the Company
of this Agreement and the consummation by it of the Transactions. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming
due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the other parties hereto,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable

Company with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i) conflict with or
violate any provision of the Company Charter Documents or the comparable

Section 3.4 are made, (x) violate any Law, Order, license or permit of any
Governmental Authority applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
(y) violate or constitute a default under, give to others any right of

provisions of any loan or credit agreement, debenture, note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, deed of trust, lease, contract, permit, license, arrangement,
instrument, obligation, restricted stock award, option agreement or other
agreement (each, a " _Contract_ ") to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any property or asset of any of them is bound or affected, except, in the case
of clause (ii), for such violations or defaults that do not have, or would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect.

(d) The affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of at least
two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock at the

of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
Transactions, other than such other consents, approvals, filings,
declarations or registrations that, if not obtained, made or given, would not
have, or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the consummation of the Transactions.

SECTION 3.5 _Company SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries have filed all registration statements,
forms, reports, schedules, statements, proxy statements and other similar  



 

11  documents required to be filed with the SEC since January 1, 2005
(collectively, and in each case including all amendments, supplements,
exhibits, financial statements and schedules thereto and documents
incorporated by reference therein, the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). As of
their respective filing dates, the Company SEC Documents complied or, if not
yet filed, will comply in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the case may be, applicable to such
Company SEC Documents, and none of the Company SEC Documents as of such
respective dates (or, if amended or superseded prior to the date of this
Agreement, the date of the filing of such amendment, with respect to the
disclosures that are amended or superseded) contained, and none of the Company
SEC Documents filed with the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement
will contain as of the date of filing, any untrue statement of a material fact
or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading.

(b) All of the financial statements of the Company included in the Company SEC
Documents, in each case, including any related notes thereto, have been (or,
in the case of Company SEC Documents not filed as of the date hereof, will be)
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly
present (or, in the case of Company SEC Documents not filed as of the date
hereof, will fairly present) the consolidated financial position of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then
ended (subject, in the case of unaudited interim statements, as may be
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC and subject, in the case of such

Sheet Date_ ") (including the notes thereto) included in the Company SEC
Documents, (ii) incurred after the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course
of business, (iii) incurred pursuant to this Agreement or (iv) that have not
had, or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the consummation of the Transactions.

(d) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable

Oxley Act, neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates has made, arranged or
modified (in any material way) any extensions of credit in the form of a
personal loan to any executive officer or director of the Company.

(e) The Company has established and maintains internal controls over
financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are
defined in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act); such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information
relating to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to
be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits  



 

12  under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Companys
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure; and such disclosure controls
and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in SEC rules and forms. The Companys principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed, based on their
most recent evaluation, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of
the Board of Directors of the Company (x) all significant deficiencies in the
design or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect the
Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and
have identified for the Companys auditors any material weaknesses in internal
controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal
controls. The Company has made available to Parent (i) a summary of any such
disclosure made by management to the Companys auditors and audit committee
since January 1, 2005 (the " _Applicable Date_ ") and (ii) any material
communication since the Applicable Date made by management or the Companys
auditors to the audit committee required or contemplated by listing standards
of the Nasdaq Stock Market, the audit committees charter or professional
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Since the
Applicable Date, no material complaints from any source regarding accounting,
internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and no material concerns
from Company employees regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters,
have been received by the Company. The Company has made available to Parent a
summary of all material complaints or material concerns relating to other
matters made since the Applicable Date through the Companys whistleblower hot
line or equivalent system for receipt of employee concerns regarding possible
violations of Law. No attorney representing the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a violation of securities laws, breach
of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company or any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents to the Companys chief legal officer, audit
committee (or other committee designated for the purpose) of the Board of
Directors or the Board of Directors pursuant to the rules adopted pursuant to
Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or any Company policy contemplating
such reporting, including in instances not required by those rules. The
principal executive officer of the Company and the principal financial officer
of the Company (and each former principal executive officer of the Company
and each former principal financial officer of the Company, as applicable)
have made the certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "
_Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder with respect to the Companys filings pursuant to the Exchange Act.
For purposes of the preceding sentence, "principal executive officer" and
"principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

SECTION 3.6 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since the Balance Sheet Date (a)
the Company and its Subsidiaries have carried on and operated their respective

there has not been any event, change or occurrence that has had, or
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect, and (c) there has not been (i) any declaration,
setting aside or payment of any dividend or any other distribution with
respect to any of the  



 

13  capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any material
change in accounting methods, principles or practices employed by the
Company or (iii) any other action of the type described in Sections 5.2(a) or
5.2(b) which, had such action been taken after the date of this Agreement,
would require approval of Parent.

SECTION 3.7 _Legal Proceedings_. There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, threatened, legal or administrative proceeding, claim, suit,
litigation, action, investigation, audit, hearing, indictment, arbitration or
other similar proceedings (" _Litigation_ ") against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective executive officers or directors
that, if determined adversely to the Company or such officers or directors,
would reasonably be expected to (a) involve fines, penalties, payments, costs
or expenses in excess of $100,000 in the case of any single matter or
$500,000 in the case of any group of related matters, (b) result in any such
Person being excluded from participation in any federal health care program or
state health care program, (c) materially impair the ability of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to conduct their businesses, or use any of their
material properties or assets, as presently conducted or used, (d) prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or (e) have a Material Adverse Effect.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any injunction,
or is subject to any order, directive, judgment, award, ruling, settlement,
stipulation or decree imposed by or before any Governmental Authority ("
_Order_ ") that has resulted in, or would reasonably be expected to result in,
any material detriment to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

SECTION 3.8 _Compliance With Laws; Permits_. The Company and its Subsidiaries
are in compliance with all federal, state and local laws, statutes,
ordinances, codes, rules, regulations, directives, decrees and Orders of
Governmental Authorities (collectively, " _Laws_ ") (excluding compliance with
Laws regarding the payment of Taxes, which is governed by Section 3.10,
compliance with Laws applicable to the Company Plans, which is governed by
Section 3.11, compliance with Environmental Laws, which is governed by Section
3.12, and compliance with Health Care Laws, which is governed by Section
3.22), applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any
property, business or asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound
or affected, except for such non-compliance that is not, and would not
reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, materially
detrimental to the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the
Transactions. No investigation by any Governmental Authority with respect to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, has any United
States federal or state Governmental Authority indicated an intention to
conduct the same. To the Knowledge of the Company, no material change is
required in the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries processes, properties or
procedures in connection with any such Laws, and the Company has not received
any overt notice or communication of any material noncompliance with any such
Laws that has not been cured as of the date of this Agreement. The Company and
its Subsidiaries each has obtained and is in compliance with all permits,
licenses, certifications, approvals, registrations, consents, authorizations,
franchises, variances, exemptions and orders issued or granted by a
Governmental Authority (" _Licenses_ ") necessary to conduct its business as
presently conducted,  



 

14  except those the absence of which would not reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, materially detrimental to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the consummation of the Transactions.

SECTION 3.9  _Information Supplied_. The Proxy Statement will not, on the
date it is first mailed to shareholders of the Company and at the time of the
Company Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply as to
form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no
representation or warranty with respect to information supplied by or on
behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Proxy Statement.

SECTION 3.10 _Tax Matters_.

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has timely filed, or has caused
to be timely filed on its behalf (taking into account any extension of time
within which to file), all federal income and other material Tax Returns (as
hereinafter defined) required to be filed by it under applicable Laws, all
such filed Tax Returns are correct and complete in all material respects, and
all Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Returns and all other material Taxes due
have been paid, except for those Taxes being contested in good faith (as set
forth on Section 3.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule) and for which
adequate reserves have been established in the Companys financial statements.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is the beneficiary of any
extension of time with which to file any material Tax Return. No deficiency
with respect to any amount of Taxes has been proposed, asserted or assessed
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which has not been fully paid
or adequately reserved for in the Company SEC Documents. There are no Liens
for Taxes (other than taxes not yet due and payable) upon any assets of the
Company or its Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of the Company, since December
31, 2003, the Company has not received written notice from an authority in a
jurisdiction where the Company or any of its Subsidiaries does not file Tax
Returns that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be subject to
taxation by that jurisdiction.

(b) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has withheld and paid over to the
relevant taxing authority all Taxes required to be withheld and paid in
connection with any amounts paid or owing to employees, independent
contractors, creditors, shareholders or any other third party except for such
Taxes that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have, or be
reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of any proposed or
threatened Tax Claims by any Governmental Authority to assess any additional
Taxes for any period for which Tax Returns have been filed that, if unpaid,
would have, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, no audits or
administrative or judicial Tax Proceedings are pending or being conducted with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Governmental
Authority and no notice of a deficiency or proposed adjustment for any  



 

15  amount of Tax has been received. The Company Disclosure Schedule lists all
federal, state, local and foreign income Tax Returns filed with respect to
the Company or its Subsidiaries for taxable periods ended on or after
December 31, 2002. Further, the Company has made available to Parent copies of

deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period ending after the
Closing as a result of any: (i) change in method of accounting for a period
ending on or prior to Closing; (ii) intercompany transaction or excess loss
account described in U.S. Treasury Regulations under Section 1502 of the Code
(or any corresponding or similar provisions of state, local or foreign income
Tax law); (iii) installment sale or open transaction disposition made on or
prior to Closing; or (iv) prepaid amount received on or prior to Closing.

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has distributed stock
of another Person, or has had its stock distributed by another Person, in a
transaction that was purported or intended to be governed in whole or in part
by Sections 355 or 361 of the Code after December 31, 1999.

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any Contract
that (i) has resulted or could result in the payment of any "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code (or any corresponding
provision of state, local, or foreign Tax Law) or (ii) has resulted in any
amount paid not having been fully deductible as a result of Section 162(m) of
the Code (or any corresponding provision of state, local or foreign Tax law).
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into, or otherwise
participated (directly or indirectly) in, any "reportable transaction" within
the meaning of U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b) or has received a
written opinion from a tax advisor that was intended to provide protection
against a tax penalty. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
been a United States Real Property Holding Corporation within the meaning of
Section 897(c)(2) of the Code during the applicable period specified in
Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code. As of the Closing, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries will be a party to or bound by any Tax allocation
or sharing agreement pursuant to which it will have any potential liability to
any Person (other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) after the
Closing Date.

(h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has been a member of
an Affiliated Group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other
than a group the common parent of which was the Company) or (ii) has any
liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) under U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local, or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by
contract or otherwise.



 

16 (i) As of the date hereof, no closing agreement pursuant to Section 7121 of
the Code (or any other similar provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law),

the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries have all licenses, franchises, permits, certificates, approvals

for the conduct of their respective businesses and the use of their properties
and assets as presently conducted and used, and the Companys and
its Subsidiaries respective employees and agents have all Permits necessary
for the conduct of their professional activities. Except as would not be
reasonably likely to be materially detrimental to the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have
had at all times during the previous three years all Permits necessary for the

effect.

Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective businesses or operations.
Except as would not be reasonably likely to be materially detrimental to the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, no aspect of the Companys or
any of its Subsidiaries respective businesses or operations is reasonably
likely to cease to comply with any Health Care Law or the terms of any Permit.

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor to the Knowledge of
the Company, any director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, is currently, or has been at any time since February 6, 2005:

health care program, (ii) convicted of any criminal offense in respect of any
Health Care Law, other than those individuals identified in Section

line (the " _Compliance Plan_ ") for coming into compliance with all Health
Care Laws that have been passed or adopted prior to the date of this Agreement
but which are not yet applicable, or contain provisions that are not yet
applicable, to the Company but which are reasonably likely to be become
applicable to the Company or its Subsidiaries within twelve months of the date
hereof and have implemented, or are currently implementing, the provisions of
the Compliance Plan to ensure that the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
will be in compliance with such Laws at such time as they become applicable to
the Company, except for failures to comply with any of the foregoing that are
not, and would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in
the aggregate, materially detrimental to the Company and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole.

(e) Except as would not be reasonably likely to be materially detrimental to
the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable Laws, including all Health
Care Laws, governing marketing or promotional activities, including, without

Federal Communications Commission, the Centers for  



 

28  Medicare and Medicaid, and other federal and state regulatory agencies such
as "do not call" and "do not fax" registries.

(f) Except as would not be reasonably likely to be materially detrimental to
the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, and except in

reasonably likely to result in or constitute a Material Breach of the
Corporate Integrity Agreement (as defined therein) among the Company, certain
of its Subsidiaries and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department
of Health and Human Services (" _OIG_ ") dated November 8, 2004 (" _CIA_ "),
including, without limitation, the training and education obligations,
disclosure program, screening requirements, notification requirements and
reporting obligations set forth therein, except as disclosed to the OIG,
_provided_ that the foregoing representation and warranty is not made with
respect to any business, operation or Subsidiary at a time when such
business, operation or Subsidiary was not owned, directly or indirectly, by
the Company. No Stipulated Penalty has been assessed, and no Material Breach
has occurred under the CIA. The Company has provided Parent with, and
specifically identified to Parent, true and complete copies of (i) all
notices, reports, certifications and other communications submitted by the
Company to the OIG pursuant to the CIA, and (ii) all notices, demand letters
and other communications received by the Company from the OIG pursuant to the
CIA.

SECTION 3.23 _Ethical Business Practices_. None of the Company, any
Subsidiary, or to the Knowledge of the Company, any directors, officers,
agents or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has, on behalf
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (a) used any funds for unlawful
contributions, unlawful gifts, unlawful entertainment or other unlawful
expenses relating to political activity, (b) made any unlawful payment to
foreign or domestic government officials or employees or to foreign or
domestic political parties or campaigns or violated any provision of the

the nature of criminal bribery.

SECTION 3.24 _Insurance_. All material insurance policies (" _Policies_ ")

are in full force and effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
is in material breach or default, and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries have taken any action or failed to take any action which, with
notice or the lapse of time, would constitute such a breach or default, or
permit termination or modification of any of the Policies. With respect to
each of the legal proceedings set forth in the Company SEC Documents, no such
insurer has informed the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any denial of
coverage. The Company and its Subsidiaries have not received any written
notice of cancellation of any of the Policies. To  



 

29  the Knowledge of the Company, all appropriate insurers under the Policies
have been timely notified of all potentially insurable material losses and
pending litigation, and all appropriate actions have been taken to timely
file all claims in respect of such insurable matters.

to Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement or any other Contract with respect
to the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective business, operations,
assets, liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects,
notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to Parent or any of its Affiliates
or representatives of any documentation, forecasts or other information with
respect to any one or more of the foregoing.

efforts to instruct and cause each investment banker, financial advisor,
attorney, accountant or other advisor, agent and representative retained by
the Company or any Subsidiary (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, cause, encourage, or knowingly
take any other action to facilitate, the making of any Takeover Proposal or
any inquiry, offer or proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead to a
Takeover Proposal or (ii) other than referring Persons to a publicly
available copy of this Section 5.3, engage in, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
Person any non-public information in connection with, any Takeover Proposal
or any inquiry, offer or proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead to,
a Takeover Proposal. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
instruct its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person previously conducted
with respect to any Takeover Proposal and will promptly request each Person
that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with
any Takeover Proposal to return or destroy all confidential information
heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing paragraph, at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, in response
to a Takeover Proposal that was not solicited by the Company in breach of
Section 5.3(a), the Company  



 

36  may (i) furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries
to the Person making a bona fide Takeover Proposal providing for
the acquisition of more than 50% of the consolidated assets or total voting
power of the equity securities of the Company (and such Persons
Representatives) pursuant to a confidentiality agreement no less restrictive
of such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that all such
information (to the extent that such information has not been previously
provided or made available to Parent) is provided or made available to Parent
prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided or made
available to such Person, as the case may be, and (ii) participate in
discussions or negotiations with the Person making such a Takeover Proposal
(and its Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal;  _provided_ that
prior to providing any such information or participating in any such
discussions or negotiations, (A) the Board of Directors of the Company, after
consultation with and having considered the advice of its
independent financial advisor, determines in good faith that such Takeover
Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal
and (B) the Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation with and
having considered the advice of outside legal counsel, determines in good
faith that failure to take such action would result in a reasonable
probability that the Board of Directors of the Company would breach its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(c) Upon receipt of any Takeover Proposal, the Company shall provide prompt
(but in no event less than twenty-four hours after receipt of any
Takeover Proposal) written notice to Parent of the receipt of any such
Takeover Proposal, indicating in connection with such notice the material
terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal, the identity of such Person
making any such Takeover Proposal and the Companys current intention with
respect to furnishing information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with, such Person, and thereafter shall promptly keep Parent
informed of the status and material terms of any such Takeover Proposal.

(d) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.3(d), the Board of
Directors of the Company shall not (i)(A) withhold, withdraw, qualify or
modify, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the unanimous recommendation of the
Board of Directors of the Company that the shareholders of the Company
adopt this Agreement (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ ") or (B) approve
or recommend or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any transaction
involving a Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i)
being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii)
approve, authorize, permit or cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement
in principle or merger, acquisition or similar agreement with respect to any
Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement that complies with
Section 5.3(b)) (each, a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to Section 5.3(c), if prior to
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the
Company makes a determination that it has received a Superior Proposal, and
after consultation with and having considered the advice of outside legal
counsel determines in good faith that failure to take such action would result
in a reasonable probability that the Board of Directors of the Company would
breach its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Board of Directors of
the Company may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, and (after
taking the steps required below) the Company or its  



 

37  Subsidiaries may enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal, if the Company shall have complied with the provisions
of this Section 5.3(d) and, concurrently with entering into such Company
Acquisition Agreement, shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(d)(ii) and paid all amounts payable under Section 7.3, but the
Company or its Subsidiaries may only enter into a Company Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal at a time that is on or after
the fifth day (or the third day, in the case of a material amendment to a
Superior Proposal) following Parents receipt of written notice advising
Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company is prepared to accept a
Superior Proposal. Such written notice shall specify the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal (and include a copy of any proposed
agreements, understandings or other accompanying documentation related
thereto), identify the Person making such Superior Proposal and state that the
Board of Directors of the Company intends to authorize the Company to
and cause the Company to enter into the Company Acquisition Agreement
attached thereto. During such five-day period (or three-day period in the case
of a material amendment), the Company shall negotiate in good faith with
Parent in order to provide an opportunity for Parent to propose such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the
Board of Directors of the Company to proceed with the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

" _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person
(other than Parent and its Subsidiaries), directly or indirectly, whether in
one transaction or a series of transactions, relating to any (A) direct or
indirect acquisition of assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including
securities of Subsidiaries, but excluding sales of assets in the ordinary
course of business) equal to 20% or more of the Companys consolidated assets
or to which 20% or more of the Companys revenues or earnings on a
consolidated basis are attributable, (B) direct or indirect acquisition of 20%
or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock, (C) tender offer or
exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially
owning 20% or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock or (D) merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, joint venture,

transaction involving the Company, in each case, other than the Transactions.

" _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited, bona fide written proposal or
offer to acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration consisting of cash
and/or securities, more than 50% of the equity securities of the Company or
all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on
a consolidated basis, made by a third party, and which is otherwise on terms
and conditions which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor
of national reputation and in light of all relevant circumstances, including
(i) all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement, (ii) any
proposed changes to this Agreement that may be proposed by Parent in response
to such Superior Proposal, (iii) whether, in the good faith judgment of the
Board of Directors of the Company, the third party is reasonably able to
finance the alternative transaction, and (iv) the ability and timing for
satisfaction of the conditions to closing the Merger and such alternative
transaction) to be more favorable to the  



 

38  Companys shareholders, from a financial point of view, than the Merger and
the other Transactions (on the most recently amended or modified terms,
if amended or modified).

(f) Nothing in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit the Board of Directors of the
Company from taking and disclosing to the Companys shareholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, or other applicable Law, if such Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that making such disclosure is necessary
for the Company or the members of the Companys Board of Directors to comply
with its or their disclosure obligations under applicable Law; _provided,
however_ , that neither the Company nor its Board of Directors shall, except
as specifically contemplated by Section 5.3(b), make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change (it being understood and agreed that any "stop, look and
listen" communication required to be provided by the Board of Directors to
the shareholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act
shall not constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and any such
communication shall publicly affirm the Company Board Recommendation). In
addition, it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this Agreement
(including Article VII), a factually accurate public statement by the Company
that only describes the Companys receipt of a Takeover Proposal and the
operation of this Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed a
withdrawal, qualification or modification, or proposal by the Board of
Directors of the Company to withdraw, qualify or modify, such Boards
recommendation of this Agreement or the Transactions, or an approval or
recommendation with respect to such Takeover Proposal, so long as such
statement publicly affirms the Company Board Recommendation.

SECTION 5.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
parties hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best
efforts to promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or
cause to be done, all things, reasonably necessary, to cause the conditions
to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable and to consummate and
make effective, as promptly as practicable, the Transactions, including
preparing and filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect all
necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions
of information, applications and other documents (including any required or
recommended filings under applicable Antitrust Laws), (ii) obtain all
approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other
confirmations from any Governmental Authority or third party reasonably
necessary to consummate the Transactions and (iii) obtain all
approvals, consents, authorizations or other confirmation from any third
party in connection with any Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party. For purposes hereof, " _Antitrust Laws_ " means the
Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the
Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all other applicable Laws issued
by a United States or federal or state Governmental Authority that are
designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the
purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of
competition through merger or acquisition.



 

39 (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each party
hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly as
practicable and in any event within five business days of the date hereof and
to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions
consistent with this Section 5.4 necessary to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act (including any
extensions thereof) as soon as practicable and (ii) the Company and Parent
shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (x) take all action reasonably
necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar Law is or
becomes applicable to any of the Transactions and (y) if any state takeover
statute or similar Law becomes applicable to any of the Transactions, take all
action reasonably necessary to enable the Transactions to be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise minimize the effect of such Law on the Transactions.

(c) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions
and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a
Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, including any
governmental inquiry, investigation or proceeding initiated by a private
party, and (ii) keep the other party informed in all material respects and on
a reasonably timely basis of any communication received by such party from, or
given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division
of the Department of Justice or any other Governmental Authority and of any
communication received or given by a private party in connection with any
governmental inquiry, investigation or proceeding, in each case regarding any
of the Transactions. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, Parent shall have the right to direct all matters with any
Governmental Entity consistent with its obligations hereunder;
_provided that_ each of the parties hereto shall have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other on, all the
information relating to the other parties and their respective Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, that appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Authority in
connection with any governmental inquiry, investigation or proceeding with
respect to the Transactions. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each party shall have the right to attend or be
promptly and fully informed following material conferences and meetings
between the other party and regulators concerning the Transactions. 

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 5.4, each of the parties hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted
by a Governmental Authority or other Person with respect to the Transactions.
Without limiting any other provision hereof, Parent and the Company shall
each use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to have
vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment that would restrain,
prevent or delay the consummation of the Transactions.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.4, neither
Parent nor the Company shall be required in order to resolve any objections
asserted by any  



 

40  Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions to divest or agree
to the divestiture of any businesses, product lines or assets, or take or
agree to take any other action or agree to any limitation or restriction,
that the Board of Directors of Parent reasonably determines in good faith,
after considering the advice of its management and legal and financial
advisors, (i) would have, or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, (A) a Material Adverse Effect or (B) a
change, circumstance, event, occurrence or effect on Parent, the Company
and/or any of their respective subsidiaries that would constitute a Material
Adverse Effect if it were to occur with respect to a comparable amount of
assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest
therein of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (ii) would materially impair
the overall benefits expected, as of the date hereof, to be realized from the
consummation of the Transactions.

SECTION 5.5  _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect
to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Thereafter, neither the
Company nor Parent shall issue or cause the publication of any press release
or other public announcement (to the extent not previously issued or made in
accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or
the other Transactions (other than, in the case of Parent, in connection with
a Takeover Proposal or Superior Proposal) without the prior consent of the
other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
except as may be required by Law or by any applicable listing agreement with
a national securities exchange or Nasdaq as determined in the good faith
judgment of the party proposing to make such release (in which case such party
shall not issue or cause the publication of such press release or other public
announcement without prior consultation with the other party).

SECTION 5.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company shall
afford to Parent and Parents Representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours to the Companys properties, books, Contracts, records and
employees, and the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent (i) a copy of
each report, schedule and other document filed by it pursuant to the
requirements of Federal or state securities Laws and (ii) other information
concerning its business and properties as Parent may reasonably request;
_provided, however_ , that (i) no information provided pursuant to this
Section 5.6 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
made by the Company herein and (ii) the Company shall not be obligated to
provide such access or information if the Company determines, in its
reasonable judgment after consultation with outside legal counsel, that doing
so would violate applicable Law or a Contract or obligation
of confidentiality owing to a third party (if the Company shall have used
reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such
inspection or disclosure) or jeopardize the protection of an attorney-client
privilege (if the Company shall have used its reasonable best efforts to
enter into an agreement that would preserve such privilege). Until the
Effective Time, the information provided will be subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

SECTION 5.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any notice or other communication
received by such  



 

41  party from any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions or
from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be
required in connection with the Transactions, if the subject matter of such
communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be
material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent and (ii) any
actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such
partys knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the
Transactions.

(b) Between the date hereof and the Effective Time, Parent will confer in good
faith on a regular basis with one or more representatives of the
Company designated to Parent regarding satisfaction of the conditions to
Closing set forth in Article VI of this Agreement. Parent acknowledges that
the Company does not and will not waive any rights it may have under this
Agreement as a result of such consultations. If any event or matter arises
after the date of this Agreement which, if existing or occurring at the date
of this Agreement, (i) would have been required to be set forth or described
by the Company in the Company Disclosure Schedule or (ii) would have caused a
representation or warranty in Article III or Article IV hereof, as applicable,
to be violated as of such date, then the Company or Parent, as applicable,
shall, for informational purposes only, deliver to Parent or the Company, as
applicable, updated disclosures to reflect such event or matter as of the
Effective Time (except that with respect to Section 3.7, the IRS audit
disclosed on Section 3.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or
any notification from a Governmental Authority with respect to federal
licensing matters, then the Company shall, for informational purposes only,
deliver to Parent updated disclosures to reflect such event or matter on or
before the first business day following the tenth day after the end of each
month prior to the Effective Time and at the Effective Time); _provided,
however,_ that such supplemental disclosure shall not be required to disclose
any such event or matter and the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be
required to be updated with respect to representations or warranties that are
expressly made as of a specific date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Section 5.7(b), the receipt or acceptance by Parent of any updated
Company Disclosure Schedule shall not constitute a waiver of any inaccuracies
or breaches of any representation or warranty made or to be made by the
Company, shall not be deemed disclosed for purposes of
determining satisfaction of the condition contained in Section 6.2(a), and
shall not prevent Parent from terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(c)(i) at any time at or prior to the Closing Date in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

(c) If any event or matter arises after the date of this Agreement that has
had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect, the
Company shall promptly after becoming aware of such event or matter
communicate the occurrence of such event or matter to Parent and in any event
shall communicate such event or matter to Parent in writing within five days
of first becoming aware of such event or matter. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Section 5.7(c), the receipt or acceptance by Parent of
any such communication shall not constitute a waiver of any inaccuracies or
breaches of any representation or warranty made or to be made by the Company,
shall not be deemed disclosed for purposes of determining satisfaction of the
condition contained in Section 6.2(a), and shall not prevent Parent from
terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i) at any time at or
prior to the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of  



 

42  this Agreement. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly
furnish to Parent notification of any pending or threatened bankruptcy or
similar proceeding known to the Company involving any party to any Material
Contract.

SECTION 5.8 _Indemnification and Insurance_. 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause (including by
providing adequate funding to) the Surviving Corporation to, and the
Surviving Corporation shall (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual
who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was,
a director or officer of the Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company (each,
an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") with respect to
all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs
(including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and shall also advance
expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law
(including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any claim,
suit, action, proceeding or investigation (whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative), whenever asserted, based on or arising out
of, in whole or in part, (A) the fact that an Indemnitee was a director or
officer of the Company or such Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions by an
Indemnitee in the Indemnitees capacity as a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the request of the Company
or such Subsidiary (including in connection with serving at the request of the
Company or such Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee
or fiduciary of another Person (including any employee benefit plan)), in each
case under (A) or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time
(including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the Transactions),
to the fullest extent permitted under the MBCA, and (ii) assume all
obligations of the Company and such Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect
of indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, in each case as provided in (x)
the Company Charter Documents and the organizational documents of such
Subsidiaries as currently in effect and (y) the indemnification
agreements listed in Section 5.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, which
shall survive the Transactions and continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their respective terms, _provided_ the Person to whom expenses
are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification; and
_provided, further_ , that any determination required to be made with respect
to whether an officers or directors conduct complies with the standards set
forth under the MBCA or the Company Charter Documents, the organizational
documents of the Companys Subsidiaries or the indemnification agreements
listed in Section 5.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, as the case may
be, shall be made by independent counsel selected by the Surviving
Corporation. Parent agrees to consult with independent legal counsel selected
by the Indemnitee in connection with any determination required to be made
with respect to whether an Indemnitees conduct complies with the standards
set forth in the MBCA or the Company Charter Documents, the organizational
documents of the Companys Subsidiaries or the indemnification agreements
listed in Section 5.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, as the case may
be.

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph
(a) of this Section 5.8, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but the
failure to so notify shall not  



 

43  relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to
such Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices the indemnifying party. In the event of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time), (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right
to assume the defense thereof and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other
counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified
Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Parent or the
Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the
Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of
interest between Parent or the Surviving Corporation and the
Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory
to them, and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees
and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as
statements therefor are received;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph (b) to
pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any
jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel for such Indemnified Parties would
present such counsel with a conflict of interest; _provided_ that the fewest
number of counsels necessary to avoid conflicts of interest shall be used,
(ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter
and (iii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without their prior written consent; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not have any
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent
jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have
become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the
manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to obtain and fully pay for
"tail" insurance policies (providing only for the Side A coverage for
Indemnified Parties where the existing policies also include Side B coverage
for the Company) with a claims period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating
as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively,
" _D andO Insurance_") with benefits and levels of coverage at least as
favorable as the Companys existing policies with respect to matters existing
or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_
, _however_ , that in no event shall the Company expend for such policies a
premium amount in excess of the amount set forth in the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

(d) If the "tail" insurance described in Section 5.8(c) is not obtained, for
the six-year period commencing immediately after the Effective Time, Parent
shall maintain in effect the Companys current directors and
officers liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time with respect to those Persons who are currently
(and any additional Persons who at or prior to the Effective Time were or
become) covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance
policies on terms with respect to such coverage, and in amount, not less
favorable to such individuals than those of such policies in effect on the
date hereof (or Parent may substitute therefor policies, issued by  



 

44  reputable insurers, of at least the same coverage with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time); _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the
aggregate premiums for such insurance shall exceed 300% of the current
aggregate annual premium, then Parent shall provide or cause to be provided
policies for the applicable individuals with the best coverage as shall then
be available at an annual premium of 300% of the current aggregate annual
premium and; _provided further_ , that any substitution or replacement of
existing policies shall not result in any gaps or lapses of coverage with
respect to facts, events, acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time.

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.8 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives, but only after the Effective Time, and (ii) in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. The
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.8
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.8 applies unless (x) such
termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected
Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification
(it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.8
applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.8).

SECTION 5.9 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as provided in Section 7.3, all fees
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions
shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not
the Transactions are consummated.

SECTION 5.10 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
such steps as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual
who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent permitted by applicable law.

SECTION 5.11  _Employee Matters_.

(a) Parent shall continue at least through December 31, 2007 to provide to
individuals who are employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time and who remain employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately after the Effective Time (the " _Company Employees_
") with compensation and benefits that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the compensation and benefits that the Company provided
immediately before the Effective Time to rank-and-file employees generally
under the Company Plans (except for compensation and benefits under
any equity compensation plans or any deferred compensation plans (other than
any 401(k) plans)). To the same extent service was recognized under the
Company Plans, Parent or one of its Subsidiaries shall recognize the service
of Company Employees with the Company prior to the Effective Time as service
with Parent and its Subsidiaries in connection with participation in any
401(k) plan and any welfare benefit plans and policies (including vacations
and holiday policies) made  



 

45  available to Company Employees by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries
following the Effective Time for purposes of satisfying any service
requirements related to waiting periods, vesting periods and eligibility
periods and any requirements for any benefits related to seniority (but
excluding benefit accruals under any pension plans or rights to post-
retirement medical benefits or post-retirement life insurance benefits).
Parent will (i) allow the Company Employees to continue to participate in the
Company Plans which provide medical benefits to such employees at the
Effective Time and which are shown on Schedule 5.11(a) (each a " _Company
Medical Plan_ ") through December 31, 2007 and (ii) (A) provide coverage under
a replacement plan or plans for each Company Medical Plan effective January 1,
2008 and either waive (if a replacement plan is self-insured) or use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause an insurance company to waive (if a
replacement plan is insured) under any such replacement plan all limitations
as to pre-existing and at-work conditions, if any, with respect to
any participation and coverage requirements applicable to each Company
Employee who was a participant in a Company Medical Plan on December 31, 2007
to the same extent such limitations were not applicable under the Company
Medical Plans and (B) provide a credit for 2008 under any replacement plan to
each Company Employee for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket
expenses paid by such employee under a Company Medical Plan during the plan
year for a Company Medical Plan which ends on December 31, 2007 unless there
were more than 12 calendar months in such plan year.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (1) be
treated as an amendment of any particular Company Plan, (2) give any third
party any right to enforce the provisions of this Section 5.11 or (3) obligate
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to (i) maintain
any particular Company Plan or (ii) retain the employment of any particular
employee.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Company to, make payments to the employees identified on Schedule 5.11(c) in
such amounts and on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
therein. 

(d) Prior to making any written or material oral communications to the
directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall provide Parent
with a copy of the intended communication, Parent shall have a reasonable
period of time to review and comment on the communication, and Parent and the
Company shall cooperate in providing any such mutually agreeable
communication.

(e) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company administering the Companys 1992 and 2001 Employee
Stock Purchase Plans (the " _ESPPs_ ")), shall adopt such resolutions or take
such other actions as may be required to provide that with respect to the
ESPPs (A) participants may not increase their payroll deductions or
purchase elections from those in effect on the date of this Agreement, (B) no
purchase period shall be commenced after the date of this Agreement, (C) each
participants outstanding right to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
under the ESPPs shall be suspended immediately following the end of the
purchase period in effect on the date of this  



 

46  Agreement or if earlier, each participants outstanding right to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock under the ESPPs shall terminate on the
day immediately prior to the day on which the Effective Time occurs;
_provided_ that, in either case, all amounts allocated to each participants
account under the ESPPs as of such date shall thereupon be used to purchase
from the Company whole shares of shares of Company Common Stock at the
applicable price for the then outstanding purchase period and (D) the ESPPs
shall terminate immediately prior to the Effective Time.

SECTION 5.12 _Delisting_. The Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Companys securities to be de-listed
from The NASDAQ Stock Market and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon
as practicable following the Effective Time.

SECTION 5.13 _No Rights Plan_. The Company shall not adopt, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries not to adopt, any shareholders rights agreement or any
similar plan or agreement that limits or impairs the ability of any person to
purchase or become the direct or indirect beneficial owner of, shares of
Company Common Stock or any other equity or debt securities of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

SECTION 5.14 _Securities and Instruments_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time the parties shall cause their respective
representatives to consult with each other regarding the tax treatment of the
Notes, the Warrants and the Convertible Note Hedge, and the Company shall not
take any actions reasonably likely to jeopardize the treatment of the Notes,
the Warrants and the Convertible Note Hedge as a synthetic debt instrument for
United States Federal income Tax purposes without Parents prior written
consent.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time the Company shall not amend, modify or
terminate any agreement or contract entered into in connection with the
Warrants or the Convertible Note Hedge, or agree to do so, without Parents
prior written consent.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time the Company shall not amend, modify or
terminate the indenture and other agreements with third parties relating to
the Notes, or agree to do so, or fail to perform its obligations pursuant to
such indenture and agreements, without Parents prior written consent.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, no provision of this Section 5.14 shall
prohibit the Company from complying with the terms of the indenture and other
agreements with third parties governing the Notes, the Warrants or the
Convertible Note Hedge.

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner any of
the amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.3, and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent makes a claim that results in a judgment against the Company,
the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable fees and expenses (including
