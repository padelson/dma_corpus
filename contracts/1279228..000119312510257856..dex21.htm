Corporation and such by-laws.

ARTICLE III

CONVERSION OF SHARES

Section 3.1 _Conversion of Shares_. 

(a) At the Effective Time, each share of the Companys common stock, par value
$0.01 per share (the " _Common Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Common Stock to be cancelled
pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ and Dissenting Shares) shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon.

(b) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Parent, be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of the common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(c) All shares of Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock
and any shares of Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent shall, at the Effective Time,
be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor.

 



20 (d) At the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration without any interest thereon
pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease
to exist, and the holders immediately prior to the Effective Time of shares
of outstanding Common Stock not represented by certificates (" _Book-Entry
Shares_ ") and the holders of certificates that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, represented shares of outstanding Common Stock (the "
_Certificates_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares
of Common Stock other than the right to receive, upon surrender of such Book-
Entry Shares or Certificates in accordance with  _Section 3.2_, the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, for each such share of Common
Stock held by them.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Merger
shall not affect the right of any holder of Common Stock (including any holder
of Company Restricted Stock) as of the record time for the AHD Distribution
to receive its share of AHD common units pursuant to the AHD Distribution. It
is understood that no Company Stock Option, Company Deferred Units, Company
RSUs or Company Phantom Stock existing as of the record time for the AHD
Distribution, all of which shall be adjusted in connection with the AHD
Distribution pursuant to Section 3.3(a), shall entitle the holder thereof to
receive any AHD common units in the AHD Distribution.

 

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates Representing Common Stock_.

 

(a) At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deliver or cause to be delivered,
in trust, to a paying agent appointed by Parent and reasonably acceptable to
the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares
of Common Stock at the Effective Time, sufficient funds for timely payment of
the aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to
as the " _Consideration Fund_ ") to be paid pursuant to _Section 3.1_.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, and in no event more than four (4)
Business Days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of record of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares whose shares were
converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
3.1_ (i) a letter of transmittal that shall specify that delivery of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed to have occurred, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable,
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration, the form and
substance of which letter of transmittal and instructions shall be
substantially as reasonably agreed to by the Company and Parent and prepared
prior to the Closing. Upon surrender of a Book-Entry Share or a Certificate
for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and
with such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions,
the holder of such Book-Entry Share or Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor,

 



21  subject to any required withholding of Taxes, the Merger Consideration
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_ , and the Book-Entry Share or
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration payable to holders of Book-Entry
Shares or Certificates. If any Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than a Person in whose name the Book-Entry Share or Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of
such exchange that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Paying
Agent any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Book-Entry
Share or Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable.

 

(c) The Consideration Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed
by Parent or the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any
such investments shall be in (i) securities issued or directly and fully
guaranteed or insured by the United States government or any agency or
instrumentality thereof and having maturities of not more than one month from
the date of investment, (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moodys Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation
respectively, having maturities of not more than one month from the date of
investment, or a combination of the securities and commercial paper
obligations set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) or (iii) money market mutual or
similar funds having assets in excess of $1,000,000,000. Earnings on
the Consideration Fund shall be the sole and exclusive property of the
Surviving Corporation and shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation, as the
Surviving Corporation directs. No investment of the Consideration Fund shall
relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from making the
payments required by this _Article III_, and following any losses from any
such investment, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares
of Common Stock at the Effective Time in the amount of such losses, which
additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Consideration Fund. If, at
any time prior to the six month anniversary of the Effective Time, any holder
of Dissenting Shares fails to perfect, or effectively withdraws or loses such
holders right to dissent from the Merger under the DGCL, Parent shall
promptly provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly provide,
additional funds to the Paying Agent in the amount of the Merger Consideration
payable with respect to Dissenting Shares held by such holder.

(d) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article III_ ,
except as otherwise provided by Law.

(e) Any portion of the Consideration Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the
Company six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation. Any holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who
have not theretofore 

 



22  complied with this _Article III_ with respect to such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation, and the
Surviving Corporation shall remain liable, for payment of their claim for
Merger Consideration in respect thereof.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Paying Agent nor any Party
hereto shall be liable to any Person in respect of cash from the Consideration
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which any Merger
Consideration in respect thereof would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in respect
of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, and any
holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share who has not theretofore
complied with this _Article III_ with respect thereto shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of its claim for Merger
Consideration in respect thereof.

(g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact (such affidavit shall be in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Paying Agent) by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by
the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which such Person
is entitled in respect of such Certificate pursuant to this _Article III_.

 

(h) Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent amounts are
so withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was
made.

 

(i) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all steps reasonably
necessary to cause the transactions contemplated hereby and any other
dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative
securities with respect to any such securities) in connection with this
Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

Section 3.3 _Equity-Based Awards_.

(a) _Adjustment of Company Equity Awards in Connection with AHD Distribution_.
In addition to any adjustments made pursuant to _Section 3.5_, the Company
shall take such actions as are necessary to provide for an equitable
adjustment of Company Equity Awards (other than Company Restricted Stock) in
connection with the AHD Distribution, to be effective coincident with the AHD
Distribution and prior to the Effective Time, as follows:

(i)  _Company Stock Options_. The per-share exercise price of each Company
Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, shall be reduced by the AHD
Distribution Adjustment Amount.

 



23 (ii)  _Company RSUs, Company Deferred Units and Company Phantom Stock_. The
number of shares of Common Stock subject to any award of Company RSUs, Company
Deferred Units and Company Phantom Stock (whether such award is vested or
unvested) shall be increased by a number (rounded down to the nearest whole
share) equal to (I) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the award
prior to such increase, _multiplied by_ (II) the AHD Distribution Adjustment
Amount, _divided by _ (III) an amount equal to (x) the average closing price
of common units of AHD on the New York Stock Exchange over the five (5)
trading days immediately preceding (but not including) the record date for the
AHD Distribution  _minus_ (y) the AHD Distribution Adjustment Amount.



     | (b) | _Treatment of Company Equity Awards in the Merger_. 
---|---|--- 

(i) _Cancellation and Cash-Out of Certain Company Stock Options and Company
RSUs_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall have taken all such
actions as may be required such that, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger, (x) each Company Stock Option and Company RSU that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, is held by an Assumed Employee or a
Former Employee and is either vested prior to the Effective Time or would
vest immediately upon the Effective Time, and (y) each Company Stock Option
and Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and held by a Pipeline Employee, whether or not then vested or
exercisable, shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to
receive: (A) with respect to each such Company Stock Option, an amount in cash
equal to the product of (I) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to
such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (II) (1) the Merger Consideration
less (2) the per-share exercise price of such Company Stock Option (as
adjusted pursuant to _Section 3.3(a)_); and (B) with respect to each such
Company RSU, an amount in cash equal to the product of (III) the number of
shares of Common Stock subject to such Company RSU (as adjusted pursuant to
_Section 3.3(a)_), _multiplied by_ (IV) the Merger Consideration, in each
case of (A) and (B) with the payment of such amount subject to applicable Tax
withholding.

(ii) _Roll-Over of Certain Company Stock Options and Company RSUs_. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, each Company Stock Option and Company
RSU that is outstanding

 



24  immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by an Assumed Employee and
that is unvested prior to the Effective Time and would not vest immediately
upon the Effective Time (the " _Company Assumed Awards_ ") shall be assumed
by Parent and converted automatically at the Effective Time into an option or
restricted stock unit, as the case may be, denominated in shares of Parent
Stock and which has other terms and conditions substantially identical to
those of the related Company Assumed Award (including any accelerated vesting
provisions therein) except that (i) the number of shares of Parent Stock
subject to each such award shall be determined by multiplying the number of
shares of Common Stock subject to such Company Assumed Award immediately prior
to the Effective Time (as adjusted pursuant to _Section 3.3(a)_ in the case
of Company RSUs) by a fraction (the " _Award Exchange Ratio_ "), the
numerator of which is the Merger Consideration and the denominator of which is
the average closing price of Parent Stock on the New York Stock Exchange over
the five (5) trading days immediately preceding (but not including) the date
on which the Effective Time occurs (rounded down to the nearest whole share)
and (ii) the exercise price per share of Parent Stock in respect of Company
Assumed Awards which are Company Stock Options (rounded upwards to
the nearest whole cent) shall equal (x) the per share exercise price of such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (as adjusted
pursuant to _Section 3.3(a)_) divided by (y) the Award Exchange Ratio; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no case shall the exchange of a Company Stock
Option be performed in a manner that is not in compliance with the adjustment
requirements of Section 409A of the Code.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall have taken all such actions
as may be required to cause each Company Deferred Unit outstanding
immediately before the Effective Time (as adjusted pursuant to _Section
3.3(a)_) to fully vest as of the Effective Time and such Company Deferred Unit
shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash equal to the Merger Consideration, with such payment to be subject to
applicable Tax withholding.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such actions as
may be required to cause each award of Company Phantom Stock outstanding
immediately before the Effective Time (as adjusted pursuant to _Section
3.3(a)_) to fully vest as of the Effective Time and such Company Phantom
Stock Award shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration, with such payment to be
subject to applicable Tax withholding.

 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such actions as
may be required to cause each award of unvested Company Restricted Stock
outstanding immediately before the Effective Time to fully vest as of the
Effective Time and to be treated in accordance with _Section 3.1(a)_, with
the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect thereof subject
to applicable Tax withholding.

 



25 (f) The Company shall take such actions as are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this _Section 3.3_ setting forth the treatment of Company
Equity Awards.

(g) Parent and the Company shall take such actions regarding the reservation,
issuance and listing of Parent Stock and Common Stock as is necessary to
effectuate the transactions contemplated by this  _Section 3.3_. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to each
holder of any Company Assumed Award an appropriate notice setting forth such
holders rights pursuant to such Company Assumed Award. Parent shall prepare
and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to the
shares of Parent Stock issuable upon exercise or settlement of the Company
Assumed Awards promptly following the Effective Time and Parent shall
exercise reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement for so long as such Company Assumed Awards remain
outstanding. The Company and its counsel shall reasonably cooperate with and
assist Parent in the preparation of such registration statement.

(h) Subject to Parents compliance with the preceding provisions of this 
_Section 3.3_, the Parties agree that, following the Effective Time, no
holder of a Company Equity Award, any participant in any Company Equity Plan
or other employee benefit arrangement of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
or party to any employment or other agreement shall have any right to acquire
any Securities or Equity Rights in the Company, any of the Company
Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation by reason of previously holding any
such Company Equity Award.

 

(i) The Parties agree that except as explicitly set forth in this _Section
3.3_ and other than pursuant to any equity or equity-related incentive
compensation award granted pursuant to a Company Equity Plan, neither Parent,
the Company, the Surviving Corporation nor any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall have any obligation or liability whatsoever with respect
to any equity or equity-related incentive compensation award granted pursuant
to any plan or agreement, including no obligations or liabilities pursuant to
the plans set forth in _Section 3.3(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
(such plans collectively, the " _Subsidiary Equity Plans_ ").

(j) Payments in respect of _Section 3.3_ shall be paid in a lump sum, as
soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more than ten
(10) Business Days following the Effective Time.

Section 3.4 _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_. Shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
has properly exercised his appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall cease to be outstanding and be
cancelled. Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration as set forth herein, unless and until the holder
shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, his
right to dissent from the Merger under the DGCL and to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting
Shares pursuant to and subject to the requirements of the DGCL. The Company
shall

 



26  provide Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any
shares of Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company related
thereto and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights under the DGCL.
The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or
agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 3.5 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that, in
connection with events other than the AHD Distribution, subsequent to the date
of this Agreement and prior to the earlier of the Closing and the termination
of this Agreement, the Company changes the number of shares of Common Stock,
or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of
Common Stock, issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result
of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), or stock
dividend or stock distribution, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted to reflect such change and as so adjusted shall, from and after the
date of such event, be the Merger Consideration, subject to further
adjustment in accordance with this sentence.

ARTICLE IV 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except as disclosed in the SEC Documents filed or furnished by the Company,
AHD or APL since January 1, 2009 and prior to the date of this Agreement
(excluding any risk factor disclosure and disclosure of risks included in any
"forward-looking statements" disclaimer or other statements included in such
SEC Documents to the extent that they are predictive, forward-looking or
primarily cautionary in nature, in each case, other than any specific factual
information contained therein, and excluding any supplement, modification or
amendment thereto made after the date hereof) or in the Company
Disclosure Letter (which Company Disclosure Letter shall in each case
specifically identify by reference to Sections of this Agreement any
exceptions to each of the representations, warranties and covenants contained
in this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any information set forth
in one section of such Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to apply to
each other section or subsection thereof or hereof to which its relevance is
reasonably apparent on its face), the Company represents and warrants to
Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware
and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now
being conducted. The Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business and
is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business
or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except for those jurisdictions in which
the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing,
individually or in the aggregate, has not resulted in and would not reasonably
be expected to result in a

 



27  Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent
true, correct and complete copies of its Constituent Documents, as amended and
in effect on the date of this Agreement. The Company is not in violation of
its Constituent Documents.

Section 4.2 _Subsidiaries_.

jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, as the case may be, and has
all requisite corporate or other power and authority, as the case may be, to
own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business

standing or to have such power and authority, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do
business and is in good standing, if applicable, in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for those
jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in
good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not resulted in and
would not reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has made available to Parent true, correct and complete
copies of the Constituent Documents of each Company Subsidiary, as
amended and in effect on the date of this Agreement. None of the Company
Subsidiaries is in violation of its Constituent Documents.

of the Code.

management or other employees who have a significant role in the Companys,

design or operation of its internal control over financial reporting. For

the term "liabilities and obligations" shall not include obligations of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to perform under or comply with any
Law, action, judgment or Contract, but would include such liabilities and
obligations if there has been a default or failure to perform or comply by the

Restructuring Company Subsidiary is party, whether written or oral, for the
benefit of any employee of the Company or any of the Post-
Restructuring Company Subsidiaries, or with respect to which the Company or
any of the Post-Restructuring Company Subsidiaries could incur any liability,
whether contingent or otherwise (each a " _Company Benefit Plan_ " and
collectively, the " _Company Benefit Plans_ "). With respect to each Company
Benefit Plan, the Company has made available to Parent, as applicable, a true
and complete copy of (i) the Company Benefit Plan document and all amendments
thereto (or in the case of any Company Benefit Plan that is not in writing, a
written description thereof, if any, that is used by the Company with respect

Except as required or permitted under the terms of this Agreement, including

Subsidiary has any legally binding commitment to create any additional Company
Benefit Plan or modify or change any existing Company Benefit Plan.

(b) Each Company Benefit Plan is now, and has at all times been, operated and
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and with
the material requirements of all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the
Code, and all contributions and premiums required to have been paid by the
Company with respect to each Company Benefit Plan have been paid within the
time prescribed under the terms of such Company Benefit Plan or applicable
Law.

(c) Each Company Benefit Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the
Code and each trust intended to qualify under Section 501(a) of the

 



44  Code has received a favorable determination or opinion letter from the IRS
with respect to each such Company Benefit Plan as to its qualified status
under the Code, and, to the knowledge of the Company, no fact or event has
occurred since the date of such determination or opinion letter that could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any Company
Benefit Plan.

 

(d) Neither the Company nor any trade or business, whether or not
incorporated, that together with the Company, would be deemed a "single
employer" within the meaning of Section 4001(b) of ERISA (any such trade or
business, an " _ERISA Affiliate_ ") maintains or has ever maintained an
employee benefit plan subject to Title IV of ERISA as to which the Company or
any Post-Restructuring Company Subsidiary could have any liability or
obligation on or following the Closing. None of the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate is subject to any unsatisfied liability under Title IV of ERISA,
Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA. To the knowledge of the
Company, no condition exists that presents a material risk to the Company or
any ERISA Affiliate of incurring a material liability under Title IV of ERISA.

 

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has been involved in
any transaction that could cause the Company, or any or its ERISA Affiliates,
or, following the Closing, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
(including the Surviving Corporation) to be subject to liability under Section
4069 or 4212 of ERISA. No event has occurred and, to the knowledge of the
Company, no condition exists that would, either directly or by reason of the
Companys affiliation with any of its ERISA Affiliates, subject the Company or
any of its ERISA Affiliates to any material Tax, fine, Lien, penalty or
other liability imposed by ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Law.

(f) There are no material pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened claims or disputes under the terms of, or in connection with, any
Company Benefit Plan (other than routine undisputed claims for benefits).

(g) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Restructuring Agreements will not, either alone or in combination with
another event, (i) entitle any current employee or Former Employee, officer,
or director of the Company or any Post-Restructuring Company Subsidiary to
severance pay, termination pay or any other payment or benefit under any
Company Benefit Plan, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting of
benefits, or materially increase the amount of compensation, due to any such
employee, officer or director under any Company Benefit Plan, (iii) result in
any forgiveness of Indebtedness owed by current or former directors,
officers, consultants or employees of the Company or any Post-Restructuring
Company Subsidiary, trigger any funding obligation under any Company Benefit
Plan or impose any restrictions or limitations on the Companys rights to
administer, amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or (iv) result in any
payment (whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) to any
"disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.280G.1) that would be construed, individually or in combination
with any other such payment, to constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as
defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). Except as 

 



45  set forth on _Section 4.16(g)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, no
director, officer, employee or independent contractor of the Company or any
Post-Restructuring Company Subsidiary is entitled to receive any gross-up or
additional payment by reason of the tax required by Section 409A or 4999 of
the Code being imposed on such person.

(h) Each Company Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (as defined for purposes of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has (i) been
maintained and operated since January 1, 2005 in good-faith compliance with
Section 409A of the Code and all applicable IRS guidance promulgated
thereunder with the intent of avoiding any Tax, penalty or interest under
Section 409A of the Code and, since January 1, 2009, has been in documentary
and operational compliance with Section 409A of the Code and all applicable
IRS guidance promulgated thereunder or (ii) as to any such plan in existence
prior to January 1, 2005, not been "materially modified" (within the meaning
of IRS Notice 2005-1) at any time after October 3, 2004.

(i) No Company Benefit Plan is a multiemployer plan within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA, a multiple employer plan within the meaning of
4063 of ERISA or a multiple employer welfare arrangement as defined in Section
3(40) or ERISA. 

(j) Neither the Company nor any of the Post-Restructuring Company Subsidiaries
has any current or contingent liability with respect to any current employee
or Former Employee with respect to post-retirement health, medical or life
insurance benefits.

 

(k) Each individual who renders or has rendered services to the Company or any
of the Post-Restructuring Company Subsidiaries and who is not or has not been
classified by the Company or any of the Post-Restructuring Company
Subsidiaries as an employee and paid on one of their respective payrolls has
at all times been properly characterized as to his or her relationship to the
Company or any of the Post-Restructuring Company Subsidiaries such that any
erroneous classification would not reasonably be anticipated to result in a
failure to satisfy any qualification requirement with respect to any Company
Benefit Plan, other than one that can be remedied at an immaterial cost, a
violation of ERISA, the imposition of a material penalty or excise tax with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan, or in any other material liability to the
Company, any of the Post-Restructuring Company Subsidiaries or any Company
Benefit Plan.

(l) Neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any of its ERISA
Affiliates has used the services of workers whose services are or were either
provided by or through third parties or who are "leased employees" (as that
term is defined in Section 414(n) of the Code), in either case who are
ineligible for any Company Benefit Plan for any reason to the extent that it
reasonably could be anticipated to result in the failure to satisfy any
qualification requirement of any Company Benefit Plan, other than one that can
be remedied at an immaterial cost, a violation of any provision of ERISA, the
imposition of material penalties or excise taxes with respect to any Company
Benefit Plan or in any other material liability to the Company, any of the 

 



46  Post-Restructuring Company Subsidiaries or any Company Benefit Plan. No
circumstances exist and no action taken by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries could result in the Company or any of its Subsidiaries being
deemed a joint employer under any applicable Law.

shall have used reasonable best efforts to obtain a consent to the requested
disclosure under such agreements or to develop an alternative to providing
such information so as to address such matters that is reasonably acceptable

not obligate the Company to incur any costs or other liabilities in
connection therewith) or (ii) waive any legal privilege so long as the Company

Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be treated in accordance with the Confidentiality

(a) The Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of the
Company Subsidiaries to, and it shall cause its and the Company Subsidiaries
respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) initiate,

which would reasonably be expected to, result in the making, submission or
announcement of, any proposal or offer that constitutes a Takeover Proposal,
(ii) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger
agreement or other agreement, arrangement or understanding relating to any

any Person any information or data or access to its properties with respect

stockholders of the Company for their approval any Takeover Proposal, or agree
or publicly announce an intention to take any of the foregoing actions.

the Company Subsidiaries provided by or on behalf of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries that was previously furnished to such Persons since
January 1, 2010 in connection with their consideration of any
Takeover Proposal to the extent that the Company or a Company Subsidiary is
entitled to have such confidential information be returned or destroyed. The
Company shall promptly inform its Representatives and the Representatives of
all Company Subsidiaries of the obligations undertaken in this _Section
6.3_. The Company agrees not to, and to cause the Company Subsidiaries not to,
release any third party from the standstill provisions of any agreement (or
terminate, amend, modify or waive any such standstill provision of any such
agreement) to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is or may become a
party, shall enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
the provisions of any such agreement, including by seeking to obtain
injunctions to prevent any breaches of such agreements and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions thereof in any court of the United
States of America or any state having jurisdiction, except, in each case, if
the board of directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors, that any of the
foregoing would be reasonably likely to violate the directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law. 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 6.3(a)_ or _Section
6.3(b)_, the Company may, prior to the Company Stockholder Approval, in
response to a bona fide written unsolicited Takeover Proposal so long as the

(1) furnish information with respect to it and the Company Subsidiaries to
the Person making such Takeover Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to
and in accordance with a confidentiality agreement (a copy of which shall be
provided to Parent promptly after its execution) containing confidentiality
restrictions that are no less restrictive to such Person than those contained
in the Confidentiality Agreement are to Parent, _provided_ that such
confidentiality agreement shall not contain any provisions that would prevent
the Company from complying with its obligation to provide the required
disclosure to Parent pursuant to _Section 6.3(d)_ and _Section 6.3(e)_, and
_provided_ _further_ that all such information provided to such Person that
is non-public has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent
prior to or substantially concurrently with the time that it is provided to
such Person; and

 



67 (2) participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person or its
Representatives regarding such Takeover Proposal;

_provided_ , in each case, prior to taking such actions referred to in
_Section 6.3(c)(1)_ or _Section 6.3(c)(2)_ (A) the board of directors of the
Company determines, in good faith, such Takeover Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal or (B) the board of directors of the Company determines, in
good faith, after consultation with the Companys financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that such Takeover Proposal would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal.

(d) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours) orally and in writing notify Parent if any inquiries, proposals or
offers are received by, any information is requested from, or any negotiations
or discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company or
any of its Representatives, in each case, in connection with, or which would
reasonably be expected to result in, a Takeover Proposal, which notice shall
identify the name of the Person making such inquiry, proposal or offer or
seeking such negotiations or discussions and, in the case of any
such inquiry, proposal or offer which is a Takeover Proposal, provide the
material terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal. The Company shall (i)
promptly keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and material terms and
conditions of any such Takeover Proposal (including any changes to such
material terms and conditions), and (ii) promptly (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours) upon receipt or delivery thereof, provide Parent with
copies of (x) all written materials provided to the Company or any of its
Representatives by the Person making such Takeover Proposal or any of its
Representatives that describe any material terms and conditions of such
Takeover Proposal (or that describe any subsequent changes to such material
terms and conditions) and (y) all drafts and final versions of agreements
(including schedules and exhibits thereto) relating to any Takeover Proposal
exchanged between the Company or any Company Representative, on the one hand,
and the Person making such Takeover Proposal or any of its Representatives, on
the other hand.

directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw (or
modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), or resolve
to or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify or qualify in a manner adverse
to Parent or Merger Sub), the Company Recommendation or otherwise take any
action or make any public statement in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that is inconsistent with the Company
Recommendation, (ii) adopt, approve, endorse or recommend, or resolve to or
publicly propose to adopt, approve, endorse or recommend, any Takeover
Proposal (any of the foregoing actions in clauses (i) and (ii), a " _Change
in Recommendation_ ") (it being agreed that a "stop, look and listen"
communication by the board of directors of the Company to the stockholders of
the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act shall
not constitute a Change in Recommendation) or (iii)

 



68  adopt, approve, endorse or recommend, or resolve to or publicly propose to
adopt, approve, endorse or recommend, or allow the Company or any Company
Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any binding or non-binding letter of
intent, option, joint venture, partnership or other arrangement or
understanding in connection with any Takeover Proposal (other than
confidentiality agreements permitted under _Section 6.3(c)_ pursuant to and
in accordance with the limitations set forth therein). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the board of directors of the Company may, prior to the Company
Stockholder Approval, make a Change in Recommendation (a) if an event, fact,
development or occurrence that is unknown to the Companys board of directors
as of the date of this Agreement becomes known to the board of directors of
the Company if the board of directors of the Company has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors,
that the failure to make a Change in Recommendation would be reasonably likely
to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law
or (b) in response to a Superior Proposal received by the Company after the
date of this Agreement that was not provided as a result of any violation by
the Company of its obligations under this _Section 6.3_ and, in response to
such Superior Proposal, if the board of directors of the Company determines
to accept such Superior Proposal, cause the Company to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ and, immediately after such
termination, enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal, subject to satisfaction of its obligations under _Section 8.3_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the board of directors of the Company shall not
be entitled to effect a Change in Recommendation or exercise its right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ until 11:59 p.m.,
New York time, on the fourth Business Day following delivery of written notice
to Parent (a " _Section 6.3(e) Notice_ ") from the Company advising Parent
that the board of directors of the Company intends to take such action,
including, in the event that the board of directors shall be effecting a
Change in Recommendation or exercising its right to terminate this Agreement
as a result of a Superior Proposal, a description of the material terms and
conditions of any Superior Proposal and a copy of the proposed transaction
agreement for any such Superior Proposal in the form to be entered into (it
being understood and agreed that, in the event of an amendment to the
financial terms or other material terms of such Superior Proposal, the board
of directors of the Company shall not be entitled to exercise such right based
on such Superior Proposal, as so amended, until 11:59 p.m., New York time, on
the second Business Day following delivery of written notice to Parent of a
Section 6.3(e) Notice with respect to such Superior Proposal as so amended).
In determining whether to terminate this Agreement in response to a Superior
Proposal or to make a Change in Recommendation, the board of directors of the
Company shall take into account any proposals made by Parent to amend the
terms of the Merger, this Agreement and the Restructuring Transactions or
Restructuring Agreements, and the Company shall, and shall cause the
Companys financial advisor and legal counsel to negotiate in good faith with
Parent regarding any such proposals.

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
board of directors of the Company from disclosing to the Companys
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or from making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from
issuing a "stop, look and 

 



69  listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder; _provided_
, _however_ , that (i) in no event shall this _Section 6.3(f)_ (1) affect
the obligations of the Company specified in _Section 6.3(a)(ii)_ and
_Section 6.3(d)_ or (2) permit the Company to make a Change in Recommendation
without complying with _Section 6.3(e)_ and (ii) any such disclosure that
addresses or relates to the approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability by the board of directors of the Company with respect to this
Agreement or a Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be a Change in
Recommendation unless the board of directors of the Company in connection
with such communication publicly states that its recommendation with respect
to this Agreement has not changed or refers to the prior recommendation of the
board of directors of the Company, without disclosing any Change in
Recommendation.

Section 6.4 _Proxy Statement; Company Stockholder Meeting_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement
(and in no event later than twenty (20) Business Days after the date of this
Agreement), the Company shall, with the cooperation of Parent, prepare and
file the preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC; _provided_ that the Company
shall not be in breach of this Agreement in the event that a delay in the
filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC shall have resulted
from Parents failure to supply the Company with any information to be
included in the Proxy Statement. Parent shall reasonably cooperate with the
Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement, including by providing the
Company with any information regarding Parent or Merger Sub that is reasonably
required to be included in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC or its staff,
to clear the preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC as promptly as
practicable after filing and to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable after responding to all
such comments to the satisfaction of the SEC. The Company will advise Parent,
promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC or its
staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or comments
thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC or its staff for
additional information. The Company will promptly provide Parent with copies
of all correspondence between the Company (or its Representatives) and the SEC
(or its staff) regarding the Proxy Statement or the Merger. No filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, or correspondence to the SEC or its staff with
respect to, the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company, without providing
Parent and Merger Sub a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon
(and the Company shall give reasonable consideration to all reasonable
comments suggested by Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel). If at any time
prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting there shall occur any event that is
required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement,
the Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable prepare and mail to
its stockholders such an amendment or supplement.

 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the clearance of the Proxy
Statement by the SEC, the Company, acting through the board of directors of
the Company, shall (i) take all lawful action necessary to duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a Company Stockholder Meeting for the purpose of
obtaining

 



70  the Company Stockholder Approval and not postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholder Meeting except to the extent required by applicable Law or to the
extent the board of directors of the Company or any committee thereof
reasonably believes that such postponement or adjournment is consistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (ii) subject to the right of the
board of directors of the Company to effect a Change in Recommendation
pursuant to _Section 6.3(e)_, use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from
its stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 6.5 _Employees and Employee Benefits_.

(a) Following the Effective Time, and for the shorter of the one (1) year
period following the Effective Time or until the termination of employment of
the applicable Assumed Employee with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, Parent shall provide or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to provide base salary to each such Assumed
Employee no less than the base salary of such Assumed Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time (as set forth on Section 6.5(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter). In addition, Parent shall provide or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide to each Assumed Employee remaining employed
with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries or
respective Affiliates an annual bonus in respect of the calendar year which
includes the Effective Time, payable on the scheduled annual bonus payment
date in respect of such calendar year of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as applicable, in an
amount no less than the annual bonus paid to such Assumed Employee by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of calendar year 2009;
_provided_ that, in the case of any Assumed Employee who did not receive a
bonus for calendar year 2009 by reason of not being an employee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates at the time necessary in order to
be eligible to receive such a bonus, such Assumed Employees bonus for the
calendar year that includes the Effective Time shall be in an amount no less
than the annual bonus paid to similarly situated Assumed Employees in respect
of calendar year 2009. Further, following the Effective Time, and for the
shorter of the one (1) year period following the Effective or until the
termination of employment of the applicable Assumed Employee with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates,
Parent shall provide or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, to
all Assumed Employees, employee benefits that are no less favorable in the
aggregate (other than _de minimis_ deviations) than those in effect on the
date hereof for such Assumed Employees under the Company Benefit Plans,
excluding for this purpose, any base salary, short-term incentive
compensation, bonus, equity, equity-related or sabbatical plan, program,
policy, agreement or arrangement. Following the Effective Time, each Assumed
Employee shall receive service credit to the extent credited under the Company
Benefit Plans prior to the Effective Time for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate and vesting (but, except with respect to any
vacation, severance, termination pay, savings or profit-sharing plan, not for
any other purpose including benefit accrual or determination of levels of
benefits purposes) for the same purposes under comparable employee benefit
plans of Parent and the Surviving Corporation in which such employees
participate following the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of the provisions contained herein 

 



71  shall operate to require coverage of any Assumed Employee under any benefit
plan of Parent or any Subsidiary thereof or to duplicate any benefit provided
to, or service credited on behalf of, any Assumed Employee. Solely to the
extent permitted under the applicable plan or contract of Parent or any
applicable Subsidiary thereof in which Assumed Employees participate following
the Effective Time, or as otherwise required under applicable Law, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation will cause all (i) pre-existing condition exclusions
for all Assumed Employees and their covered dependents as of the Closing to be
waived to the extent that such exclusions were inapplicable under
a comparable Company Benefit Plan as of the Effective Time and (ii) waiting
periods under each plan that would otherwise be applicable to newly hired
employees to be waived to the same extent waived or satisfied under the
Company Benefit Plans as of the Effective Time. In addition, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will honor or cause to be honored any expenditures
incurred by Assumed Employees and their covered dependents during the
applicable plan year that includes the Effective Time which were included in
satisfying the deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums under the
Company Benefit Plans in which such Assumed Employees participated immediately
prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any deductibles, co-payments or
out-of-pocket maximums under any plans of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
in which they are eligible to participate after the Effective Time for the
applicable plan year that includes the Effective Time.

 

(b) Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a guarantee of employment for any
Assumed Employee or any other employee of the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries, or to restrict the right of the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries to terminate or cause to be
terminated any employee at any time for any or no reason with or
without notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section
6.5_, nothing contained herein, whether expressed or implied, (i) shall be
treated as an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or
any Parent or Surviving Corporation plan or any other employee benefit plan,
program, policy or arrangement or the establishment of any employee benefit
plan, program, policy or arrangement or (ii) shall limit the right of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to

delayed) at any time from the date hereof to the earlier of the Effective Time
and the termination of this Agreement, (ii) the occurrence or non-occurrence

request, the Company shall cause the Company Subsidiaries party to the Company
Indentures to use reasonable best efforts to promptly take all
actions necessary to effect either (as specified by Parent) the satisfaction
and discharge or the defeasance of the Company Indentures with respect to the
outstanding debt securities issued thereunder, which satisfaction and
discharge or defeasance shall be effected immediately prior to the
Restructuring Transactions. In connection with such satisfaction and discharge
or defeasance, the Company shall, subject to _Section 6.13(b)_, cause such
Company Subsidiaries to (i) deposit in trust all required funds or U.S.
Government Obligations with respect to such satisfaction and discharge or
defeasance and give appropriate instructions to the Trustee to apply the
deposit toward the payment of the applicable debt securities upon redemption,
(ii) pay or cause to be paid all other sums due and payable pursuant to the
Company Indentures, and (iii) use reasonable best efforts to deliver to the
trustees under the Company Indentures such "Officers Certificates,"
"Opinions of Counsel," and accountants certificates and opinions as may be
necessary to satisfy all conditions precedent to such satisfaction and
discharge or defeasance under the Company Indentures, in each case only if
and to the extent reasonably deliverable under the facts and circumstances
then prevailing. At Parents written request, the Company also shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause such Company Subsidiaries to take such
actions as are necessary under the Company Indentures to call for redemption
all such debt securities on such date as shall be specified by Parent,
including providing notice of such redemption to the trustee under each
Company Indenture and mailing notice of redemption to the holders of such
debt securities at such time as shall be specified by Parent. Parent shall, or
shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, loan to such Company Subsidiaries all
amounts necessary to fund the payments and deposits referred to in this
_Section 6.13(a)_, such loan to be on terms reasonably satisfactory to Parent
and the Company. In no event shall the Company or such Company Subsidiaries be
obligated to make any such payments or deposits in connection with such
satisfaction and discharge or defeasance or to take any irrevocable action in
connection with the redemption of such debt securities unless the applicable
Company Subsidiary has received or will concurrently receive the proceeds of
such loan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary shall be required to take any irrevocable action pursuant to this
paragraph prior to the Closing Date.

 

(b) Any provision of _Article VII_ notwithstanding, neither compliance by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary with  _Section 6.13(a)_ nor the
satisfaction and discharge or defeasance as contemplated by _Section 6.13(a)_
shall be a condition to Parents obligation to consummate the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby. 

(c) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all documented reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries contemplated by this _Section 6.13_. Without duplication of any
amounts reimbursed by Parent pursuant to the immediately foregoing sentence,
Parent shall

 



80  indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Affiliates and their respective
officers, advisors and Representatives from and against any and all losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses, interests, awards, judgments and penalties
suffered or incurred by any of them of any type in connection with the
satisfaction and discharge or defeasance as contemplated by _Section
6.13(a)_to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law.

Section 6.14 _Appointment and Resignation of Directors_. The Company agrees
that (a) at least a majority of the board of directors of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time, who shall be Incumbent Atlas Parent
Directors shall appoint the directors of Merger Sub to the board of directors
of the Company as of the Effective Time and (b) the board of directors of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall resign as of the
Effective Time.

 

Section 6.15 _Oil and Gas Lease Curative Matters_. Upon reasonable request by
Parent, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, curative action (including the preparation and execution of
correction assignments and the filing and recording thereof) in order to help
ensure that, at the Effective Time, the title to the Oil and Gas Leases set
forth on _Section 4.14(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (other than those
Oil and Gas Leases or the interests in such Oil and Gas Leases of (i) a
Purchased Entity that is not contemplated to be transferred, directly or
indirectly, to the Company or a Post-Restructuring Company Subsidiary in
connection with the Restructuring Transactions or (ii) the Company or a Post-
Restructuring Company Subsidiary that is contemplated to be transferred,
directly or indirectly, to a Pipeline Subsidiary in connection with the
Restructuring Transactions) is distinctly discernable between the Company or a
Post-Restructuring Company Subsidiary and the interests of the Drilling
Partnerships. Any other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, the
Parties agree that the failure of such title to be so discernable at of the
Effective Time, notwithstanding the use of such efforts by the Company, shall
not cause or be deemed to cause any condition to Parents obligation to
consummate the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby not to be
satisfied.

 

Section 6.16 _Pennsylvania Operating Entity_. The Company shall ensure that at
least one Post-Restructuring Company Subsidiary holds all permits issued by
the Pennsylvania Bureau of Oil and Gas Management and any other applicable
Governmental Entity and all material performance, surety and road bonds that,
in each case, are necessary for the Company and the Post-Restructuring
Company Subsidiaries to continue their business in Pennsylvania after the
Closing in substantially the same manner as such business is currently
conducted.

 

Section 6.17 _Assignment of Patent Rights_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Atlas Energy
Resources, LLC and/or other of its Affiliates, as applicable, to assign to the
Company the entire right, title, and interest in United States Provisional
Patent application 61/368,425 entitled "PROCESS FOR REUSING FLOW BACK AND
PRODUCED WATER IN MARCELLUS SHALE DRILLING" and filed on July 28, 2010, and
all inventions and improvements described and disclosed therein (the " _425
Patent Application")_ , including by using commercially reasonable efforts to
cause all inventors of such inventions and

 



81 improvements, including all named inventors on the 425 Patent Application, to
execute written assignments, in a form effective for recording and perfecting
such assignment in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, of their
entire right title and interest in and to the 425 Patent Application to Atlas
Energy Resources, LLC or one of such other applicable Affiliates thereof. Any
other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, the Parties agree that the
failure to assign any or all right, title ,and interest of the 425 Patent
Application to the Company prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding the
use of such efforts by the Company, shall not cause or be deemed to cause any
condition to Parents obligation to consummate the Merger or the transactions
contemplated hereby not to be satisfied.

_Section 6.18 Pay-off of Revolving Credit Agreement_. Prior to the Closing,
the Company shall obtain from the administrative agent under the Revolving
Credit Agreement, as amended, dated as of June 29, 2007, among Atlas Energy
Operating Company, LLC, its Subsidiaries, J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.,
as Administrative Agent and the other lenders signatory thereto (the "
_Revolving Credit Agreement_ ") a pay-off letter in the Administrative Agents
customary form or otherwise in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent,
evidencing the amount (the " _Pay-off Amount_ ") necessary to pay-off, at the
Closing, all existing Indebtedness and other obligations under the Revolving
Credit Agreement. Immediately prior to the Closing, Parent shall, or shall
cause one of its Subsidiaries to, (i) pay, on behalf of Atlas Energy
Operating Company, LLC, the Pay-off Amount to an account or accounts
designated by the agent bank under the Revolving Credit Agreement, and (ii)
provide, on behalf of Atlas Energy Operating Company, LLC, such other funds
or backstop letters of credit as may be necessary to satisfy the conditions
precedent to termination of the Revolving Credit Agreement under the pay-off
letter, such payments and provisions to be loans to, or otherwise for the
account of, Atlas Energy Operating Company, LLC on terms reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and the Company.

the Company set forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct as of the

clause (iii), the failure of the representations and warranties to be true and
correct, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect (it

materiality and Company Material Adverse Effect qualifications contained in
such representations and warranties shall be disregarded).

Adverse Effect contained in such representations and warranties shall be
disregarded).

(i) if (A) the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before September
30, 2011 (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ that if by the Outside Date, the

the failure of AHD to obtain financing, the Outside Date may be extended for
one period of up to 90 days by either the Company or Parent, in its discretion
(in which case any references to the Outside Date herein shall mean the
Outside Date as extended) and (B) the Party seeking to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ shall not have breached its
obligations in any material respect under this Agreement or the Restructuring
Agreements in any manner that shall have proximately caused or resulted in the
failure of the Merger or the Restructuring Transactions to have been
consummated by such date;

 

(ii) if an Order shall have been entered permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger and such Order shall
have become final and non-appealable, _provided_ that the Party seeking to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ shall have
complied with its obligations pursuant to  _Section 6.8_ with respect to
such Order; or

(iii) if at the Company Stockholder Meeting (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof), the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been
obtained.



     | (c) | by Parent: 
---|---|--- 

(i) if (A) (x) any of the representations or warranties of the Company herein
shall be untrue or inaccurate on the date of this Agreement or shall
thereafter become untrue or inaccurate, or (y) the Company shall have breached
or failed to perform any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement or the Restructuring Agreements, in each case such that any

satisfied; and (B) such untruth, inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform is
not curable by the Outside Date or, if curable and the untruth, inaccuracy,
breach or failure of perform is a breach or failure by the Company to perform
any covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement or the Restructuring
Agreements, the Company shall not have, in good faith, within ten (10)
calendar days after written notice of the breach or failure to perform from
Parent, begun to diligently pursue such cure; or 

(ii) if, after the date hereof, the board of directors of the Company or any
committee thereof has effected a Change in Recommendation.



     | (d) | by the Company: 
---|---|--- 
 

(i) if (A) (x) any of the representations or warranties of Parent or Merger
Sub herein shall be untrue or inaccurate on

 



85  the date of this Agreement or shall thereafter become untrue or inaccurate,
or (y) Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform any of
their respective covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, in each
case such that any condition set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section
7.3(b)_ would not be satisfied, and (B) such untruth, inaccuracy, breach or
failure to perform is not curable by the Outside Date or, if curable and the
untruth, inaccuracy, breach or failure of perform is a breach or failure by
Parent or Merger Sub to perform any covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, Parent or Merger Sub shall not have, in good faith, within ten
(10) calendar days after written notice of the breach or failure to perform
from the Company, begun to diligently pursue such cure; or

 

(ii) if the board of directors of the Company determines to accept a Superior
Proposal, _provided_ that the Company has complied in all material respects
with _Section 6.3_ and concurrently with such termination pays the
Termination Fee to Parent in accordance with the procedures and within the
time periods set forth in _Section 8.3_. 

The Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1_
shall give notice of such termination and the provisions of this _Section
8.1_ being relied on to terminate this Agreement to the other Parties.

 

 _Section 8.2 Effect of Termination_. In the event of any termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section 8.1_, the obligations of the Parties
hereunder shall terminate (except for the Confidentiality Agreement and the
provisions of _Section 6.2(b)_, _Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3_ and _Article
IX_ , each of which shall remain in full force and effect) and there shall be
no liability on the part of any Party hereto except (i) liability arising from
fraud or a deliberate or willful breach of this Agreement, or as provided in
the Confidentiality Agreement, in which case the aggrieved Party shall be
entitled to all rights and remedies available at Law or in equity and (ii) as
provided in _Section 8.3_.

Section 8.3 _Termination Fee_.



     | (a) | In the event that: 
---|---|--- 

(i)(A) a Takeover Proposal or intention to make a Takeover Proposal (whether
or not conditional) is made to the Companys stockholders, otherwise publicly
disclosed (a " _Public Takeover Announcement_ ") or is or proposed or is
communicated to the board of directors of the Company or a committee thereof
(a " _Private Takeover Announcement_ ," and either a Private Takeover
Announcement or a Public Takeover Announcement, a " _Takeover Announcement_
"), and such Takeover Proposal shall not have been withdrawn (x) prior to the
termination of this Agreement (in the case of a termination pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)(i))_, (y) prior to the date of the Company Stockholder
Meeting (in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_) or
(z)

 



86  prior to the breach giving rise to Parents right to terminate under
_Section 8.1(c)(i)_, (in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(i)_), and (B) after the Takeover Announcement, this Agreement is
terminated (1) by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ and,
as of the Outside Date, the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_, 
_Section 7.1(c)_, _Section 7.3(a)_ and _Section 7.3(b)_ were satisfied, (2)
by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_, or (3) by Parent
pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(i)_, so long as such breach giving rise to
Parents right to terminate under _Section 8.1(c)(i)_ is a breach of the
Companys obligations to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a Company
Stockholder Meeting as required by  _Section 6.4_, then (I) if the Takeover
Announcement causing clause (A) of this paragraph to be satisfied was a Public
Takeover Announcement, and if, concurrently with or within twelve (12) months
after the date of any such termination of this Agreement, the Company enters
into a definitive agreement with respect to a Takeover Proposal or a Takeover
Proposal is consummated; or (II) if the Takeover Announcement causing clause
(A) of this paragraph to be satisfied was a Private Takeover Announcement,
and if, concurrently with or within twelve (12) months after the day of any
such termination of this Agreement, the Company enters into a definitive
agreement with or involving the Person that made the Takeover Proposal giving
rise to such Takeover Announcement, then, in either of cases (I) or (II), the
Company shall pay to Parent or its designee the Termination Fee concurrently
with the earlier of the entry into a definitive agreement with respect to, or
the consummation of, such Takeover Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that for
purposes of the definition of Takeover Proposal in this _Section 8.3(a)(i)_,
references to "15%" in such definition shall be replaced by "50%;"

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to  _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_, and the Company is not entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent or its
designee the Termination Fee within one (1) Business Day after such
termination; and

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to  _Section
8.1(d)(ii)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent or its designee the
Termination Fee concurrently with such termination;

 

it being understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 

(b) If applicable, payment of the Termination Fee shall be made to Parent or
its designee by wire transfer of same day funds to the account designated by
Parent or such designee.

(c) Each Party hereto agrees that the agreements contained in this  _Section
8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,

 



87  and that, without these agreements, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company would
not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to
pay any amounts due under this  _Section 8.3_ and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent or its designee commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the Company for all or a portion of the Termination Fee, the Company
shall pay to Parent or its designee interest on such amounts from the date
payment of such amounts was due to the date of actual payment at the prime
rate of the Bank of New York in effect on the date such payment was due plus
one percent (1%), together with the costs and expenses of Parent and Merger
Sub (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit. Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges that the Termination Fee is not
a penalty, but rather are liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may be, in the
circumstances in which such Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision.

(d) Subject to _Section 8.2_ and the right of Parent and Merger Sub to seek
specific performance as provided in _Section 9.13_, the Parties agree that,
if the Termination Fee shall become due and payable in accordance with this
_Section 8.3_, the payment of the Termination Fee (plus any amounts due under
_Section 8.3(c)_) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger
Sub under this Agreement, and upon payment of such amount, the Company shall
have no further liability to Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement other
than any liability arising from fraud or a deliberate or willful breach of
this Agreement, or as provided in the Confidentiality Agreement, in which
case Parent or Merger Sub shall be entitled to all rights and remedies
available at Law or in equity.

89 Section 9.3  _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Sections, Articles, or Exhibits, such reference shall be to a Section or
Article of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table
of contents and headings contained in this Agreement or in any Exhibit are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Any capitalized terms used in any Exhibit
but not otherwise defined therein shall have the meaning set forth in this
Agreement. All Exhibits annexed hereto or referred to herein are hereby
incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth herein.
Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation," unless otherwise specified. The words "hereby," "hereof," herein"
and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall

Agreement. The words "date hereof" shall refer to the date of this Agreement.
The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to

Reference to any agreement (including this Agreement), document or instrument

in accordance with the terms thereof and, if applicable, the terms hereof. The
Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this
Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties
and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any
Party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement.

Section 9.4 _Amendment_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any
provision of this Agreement may be amended or supplemented if such amendment
or supplement is in writing and signed by the Parties hereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no
amendment shall be made that pursuant to applicable Law requires further
approval or adoption by the stockholder of the Company without such further
approval or adoption. This Agreement may not be amended or supplemented in
any manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, except by an instrument
in writing specifically designated as an amendment hereto, signed on behalf of
each of the Parties in interest at the time of the amendment.

 

Section 9.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
Parties may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the Parties,
(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained

90 may be made that pursuant to applicable Law requires further approval or
adoption by the stockholders of the Company without such further approval or
adoption. Any agreement on the part of a Party hereto to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such Party. No failure or delay by the Company or Parent in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
of any other right hereunder. Except as otherwise provided herein, the rights
and remedies of the Parties hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of
any rights or remedies which they would otherwise have hereunder.

 

Section 9.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of
which shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement shall
become effective when each Party hereto shall have received counterparts
thereof signed and delivered (by confirmed facsimile transmission or
electronic mail or otherwise) by the other Parties hereto.

Section 9.7 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. 

(a) This Agreement (including the Exhibits and the Parties disclosure
schedules hereto), the Voting Agreement, the Non-compete Agreements, the
Specified Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof.

(b) Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns any right, benefit or remedy hereunder, other than with
respect to the provisions of _Section 6.7_, which shall inure to the benefit
of the Persons benefiting therefrom, who are hereby intended to be third-
party beneficiaries thereof.

Section 9.8 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any term or other provision
of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any
Law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the
greatest extent possible.

Section 9.9 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties
(whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of the other Parties, and any attempted assignment of this Agreement or any
of such rights, interests or obligations without such consent shall be void
and of no effect, except that Merger Sub may, without

 



91  the consent of the Company, assign any or all of its rights, interests and
obligations hereunder to Parent, one or more direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiaries of Parent, or a combination thereof, but no such assignment
shall relieve Merger Sub or Parent of any of its obligations hereunder.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

Section 9.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to any conflicts of Law rules (whether of the State of Delaware or of
any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

Section 9.11 _Exclusive Jurisdiction for Disputes_. The Parties hereto agree
that any Action seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (whether brought by any Party or any of its Affiliates or
against any Party or any of its Affiliates) shall only be brought in the
Delaware Chancery Court or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any
federal court located in the State of Delaware or other Delaware state court,
and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of
such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such
Action and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any
such Action in any such court or that any such Action brought in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such Action
may be served on any Party anywhere in the world, whether within or without
the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each
Party agrees that service of process on such Party as provided in _Section
9.2_ shall be deemed effective service of process on such Party.

 

Section 9.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

Section 9.13  _Specific Performance_. The Parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement or any Restructuring Agreement (after giving effect to any
amendments thereof or waivers with respect thereto made without contravention
of _Section 6.9(c)_) was not performed in accordance with its specific terms
or was otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that (a) the Parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to specific performance of the terms and provisions hereof, and
(b) Parent shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches by the Company of any Restructuring Agreement (after giving effect
to any amendments thereof or waivers with respect thereto made without
contravention of _Section 6.9(c)_) and to specific performance to cause the
Company to enforce its rights under any Restructuring Agreement (after giving
effect to any amendments thereof or waivers with respect thereto made without
contravention of _Section 6.9(c)_) with respect to a breach by the other
parties to the Restructuring Agreement, in each of cases (a) and(b), in any
court of 

 



92  competent jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at Law or in equity. The Restructuring Agreements provide
that Parent is entitled to specific performance to cause the applicable
Pipeline Subsidiary to perform the terms and provisions thereof as a third
party beneficiary of the Restructuring Agreement as set forth in such
Restructuring Agreement.

 

Section 9.14 _Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring or
required to incur such expenses.

 



93 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have caused this
Agreement to be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized
as of the date first written above.
