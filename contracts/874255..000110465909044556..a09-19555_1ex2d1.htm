AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of July 22, 2009 (this " _Agreement_
"), by and among Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, a Delaware corporation ("
_Parent_ "), Puma Acquisition Corporation, a New Jersey corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Sub_ "), and Medarex, Inc., a New
Jersey corporation (the " _Company_ ").

  



  

WHEREAS Parent is the beneficial owner of 2,879,223 shares of common stock,
par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ "),
including the associated Company Rights, representing approximately 2.2% of
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock;

  



  

WHEREAS Parent desires to acquire the remaining outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock, including the associated Company Rights, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS in furtherance of the acquisition of the remaining outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock by Parent on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, Parent proposes to cause Sub to make a tender
offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted under this
Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all the remaining outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock, including the associated Company Rights, for
consideration of a price per share of Company Common Stock (including the
associated Company Rights) of $16.00 (such amount, or any other amount per
share paid pursuant to the Offer and this Agreement, the " _Offer Price_ "),
net to the seller in cash, without interest, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS the Boards of Directors of each of the Company and Sub have approved
the merger of Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; and

  



  

WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Offer and the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Offer and the Merger.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

  



  

# **ARTICLE I**

  

# ** **

  

# ** _The Offer_**

  

# ** **

  

## ** _SECTION 1.01. _The Offer._ (a) Subject to the terms of
this Agreement, as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than
seven business days) after the date of this Agreement, Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Sub to, commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ "), the
Offer._**

        
   

  



  

## ** _The obligations of Sub to, and of Parent to cause Sub to, accept for
payment, and pay for, any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to
the Offer are subject to the conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ (the "
_Offer Conditions_ "). The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be
midnight, New York City time, on the 20th business day following
the commencement of the Offer (determined pursuant to Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under
the Exchange Act). Sub expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion,
to waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition or modify the terms of the
Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that, without the prior written consent of
the Company, Sub shall not (i) reduce the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) change, modify
or waive the Minimum Tender Condition, (iv) add to the conditions set forth
in Exhibit A or modify or change any Offer Condition in a manner adverse in
any material respect to any holders of Company Common Stock, (v) except as
otherwise provided in this Section 1.01(a), extend or otherwise change the
expiration date of the Offer, (vi) change the form of consideration payable
in the Offer or (vii) otherwise amend, modify or supplement any of the terms
of the Offer in a manner adverse in any material respect to any holders of
Company Common Stock. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Sub may, in its sole discretion, without consent of the Company,
(A) without limiting Parents or Subs obligations under the following
sentence, extend the Offer on one or more occasions, in
consecutive increments of up to five business days (or such longer period as
the parties hereto may agree) each, if on any then-scheduled expiration date
of the Offer any of the Offer Conditions shall have occurred and be
continuing, until such time as such condition or conditions shall no longer
exist, (B) extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
_SEC_ ") or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer and (C) if Parent
determines in good faith that a filing with the German Federal Cartel Office
(the " _GFCO_ ") is required in connection with the Offer or the Merger,
extend the Offer on one or more occasions, in increments of up to five
business days (or such longer period as the parties hereto may agree) each,
for an aggregate period of time of not more than 25 business days, until the
waiting period required by the GFCO (and any extension thereof) has been
terminated or has expired. Parent and Sub agree that, to the extent requested
in writing by the Company prior to any then-scheduled expiration date of the
Offer, Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Sub to) (A) if any of the Offer
Conditions set forth in clause (ii) of Exhibit A or in paragraph (a), (b) or
(d)(2) of clause (iii) of Exhibit A shall have occurred and be continuing on
such then-scheduled expiration date (and have not been waived by Sub), and
provided that it is reasonably expected that such condition or conditions
shall cease to exist prior to the Termination Date, extend the Offer on one
or more occasions, in consecutive increments of up to five business days each
(or such longer period as the parties hereto may agree), until such time as
such Offer Conditions no longer exist and (B) if any of the Minimum Tender
Condition or the Offer Conditions set forth in paragraph (d) (other than
paragraph (d)(2)) or (e) of clause (iii) of Exhibit A shall have occurred and
be continuing on such then-scheduled expiration date (and have not been
waived by Sub), but all the other Offer Conditions set forth in Exhibit A
shall not have occurred and be continuing on such then-scheduled expiration
date, extend the Offer on one or more occasions, in consecutive increments of
up to five business days (or such longer period as the parties hereto may
agree) each, for an aggregate period of time of not more than 20 business
days. On the _**

  



        
   

  



  

terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Sub
shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, accept and pay for (subject to
any withholding of tax pursuant to Section 1.01(d)) all shares of
Company Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer that Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer as
soon as practicable after the expiration date of the Offer (as it may be
extended and re-extended in accordance with this Section 1.01(a)). Acceptance
for payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to and subject to the
conditions of the Offer is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer
Closing_ ", and the date on which the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in
this Agreement as the " _Offer Closing Date_ ". Sub expressly reserves
the right, in its sole discretion, to extend the Offer for a "subsequent
offering period" in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act
following the Offer Closing, and the Offer Documents may, in Subs sole
discretion, provide for such a reservation of right.  The Offer may not be
terminated prior to its expiration date (as such expiration date may be
extended and re-extended in accordance with this Section 1.01(a)), unless
this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Article VIII. If the
Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Sub, or this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with Section 8.01, prior to the acceptance for payment of Company
Common Stock tendered in the Offer, Sub shall promptly return, and shall
cause any depository acting on behalf of Sub to return, all tendered Company
Common Stock to the registered holders thereof.  Nothing contained in this
Section 1.01(a) shall affect any termination rights in Article VIII.

  

## ** _ _**

  

(b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Sub shall file with
the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO filed under cover of Schedule
TO with respect to the Offer, which shall contain an offer to purchase and a
related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (such Schedule TO and
the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made,
together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_
").  The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Sub all
information concerning the Company required by the Exchange Act to be set
forth in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Sub and the Company shall
promptly correct any information supplied by it for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents if and to the extent
that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and each of Parent and Sub shall take all steps necessary to amend
or supplement the Offer Documents and to cause the Offer Documents as so
amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
holders of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required
by applicable Federal securities Laws. Parent and Sub shall promptly notify
the Company upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC, or any request
from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to the Offer Documents, and shall
provide the Company with copies of all correspondence between them and their
representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Prior to
the filing of the Offer Documents (including any amendment or supplement
thereto) with the SEC or dissemination thereof to the shareholders of the
Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Offer
Documents, Parent and Sub shall provide the Company a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on such Offer Documents or response (including the
proposed final version thereof), and Parent and Sub shall give reasonable
consideration to any such comments.

  



         
 

  



  

### (c)  Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Sub on a timely
basis the funds necessary to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock that
Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment, and pay for, pursuant to the
Offer.

  

### 

  

### (d)  Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer to any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock such amounts as Sub is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and paid over by Sub to the appropriate Governmental
Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Sub.

  

### 

  

## SECTION 1.02. _Company Actions._ (a) The Company hereby approves of
and consents to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  

## 

  

### (b)  On or as promptly as practicable after the date the Offer Documents
are filed with the SEC, the Company shall file with the SEC a
Solicitation/ Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the
Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, together with any supplements or amendments
thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") containing the recommendation described in
Section 4.01(d)(i) and shall mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the shareholders of
the Company. Parent and Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company all
information concerning Parent and Sub required by the Exchange Act to be set
forth in the Schedule 14D-9.  Each of the Company, Parent and Sub shall
promptly correct any information supplied by it for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that
such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and the Company shall take all steps necessary to amend or
supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so amended
or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the shareholders
of the Company, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
Federal securities Laws. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC, or any request from the SEC
for amendments or supplements, to the Schedule 14D-9, and shall provide
Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its
representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Prior to
the filing of the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendment or supplement
thereto) with the SEC or mailing thereof to the shareholders of the Company,
or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Schedule 14D-9,
the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such Schedule 14D-9 or response (including the proposed final
version thereof), and the Company shall give reasonable consideration to any
such comments. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer
Documents of the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company
contained in the Schedule 14D-9.

  

### 

  

### (c)  In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the Company shall cause
its transfer agent to furnish Parent and Sub promptly with mailing
labels containing the

  



        
   

  



  

### names and addresses of the record holders of Company Common Stock as of a
recent date and of those persons becoming record holders subsequent to such
date, together with copies of all lists of shareholders, security position
listings and computer files and all other information in the Companys
possession or control regarding the beneficial owners of Company Common
Stock, and shall furnish to Sub such information and assistance (including
updated lists of shareholders, security position listings and computer files)
as Parent may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to holders of
Company Common Stock. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and
except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and
any other documents necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, Parent and Sub shall hold in confidence the information
contained in any such labels, listings and files in accordance with the
requirements of the Confidentiality Agreement dated June 2, 2009 between
Parent and the Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), shall use such information only in connection
with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated,
shall, upon request, destroy all copies of such information then in their
possession or control.

  

### 

  

## SECTION 1.03. _Top-Up Option._ (a) The Company hereby grants to Sub
an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable only on the
terms and conditions set forth in this Section 1.03, to purchase at a price
per share equal to the Offer Price paid in the Offer up to that number of
newly issued shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Shares_ ") equal
to the lowest number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to
the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent and its
Subsidiaries at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, shall constitute
one share more than 90% of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Shares on a "fully diluted
basis" (which assumes conversion or exercise of all derivative securities
regardless of the conversion or exercise price, the vesting schedule or other
terms and conditions thereof); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Top-
Up Option shall not be exercisable for a number of shares of Company Common
Stock in excess of the shares of Company Common Stock authorized and unissued
or held in the treasury of the Company at the time of exercise of the Top-Up
Option (giving effect to the shares of Company Common Stock issuable pursuant
to all then-outstanding stock options, restricted stock units and any other
rights to acquire Company Common Stock as if such shares were outstanding),
(ii) the issuance of the Top-Up Shares shall not require approval of the
Companys shareholders under applicable Law (including the rules of The
NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (" _NASDAQ_ ")) and (iii) the exercise of the Top-Up
Option and the issuance and delivery of the Top-Up Shares shall not be
prohibited by any Law or Judgment. The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable at
any one time following the Offer Closing and prior to the earlier to occur of
(a) the Effective Time and (b) the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms. The obligation of the Company to issue and deliver
the Top-Up Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject only to
the condition that no Legal Restraint that has the effect of preventing the
exercise of the Top-Up Option or the issuance and delivery of the Top-
Up Shares in respect of such exercise shall be in effect.

  

## 

  

### (b)  The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance and delivery
of the Top-Up Shares comply with all applicable Laws, including compliance
with an

  



        
   

  



  

### applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Shares under the
Securities Act. In the event Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Sub
shall give the Company at least three business days prior written notice,
specifying (i) the number of shares of the Company Common Stock owned by
Parent and its Subsidiaries at the time of such notice and (ii) a place and a
time for the closing of such purchase. The Company shall, as soon as
practicable following receipt of such notice, deliver written notice to Sub
specifying, based on the information provided by Sub in its notice, the
number of Top-Up Shares. At the closing of the purchase of Top-Up Shares,
the purchase price owed by Sub to the Company therefor shall be paid to the
Company (i) in cash, by wire transfer or cashiers check or (ii) by issuance
by Sub to the Company of a promissory note on terms reasonably satisfactory
to the Company.

  

### 

  

### (c)  Parent and Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Shares that Sub may
acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the
Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an applicable exemption
from registration under the Securities Act. Each of Parent and Sub hereby
represents and warrants to the Company that Sub is, and will be, upon the
purchase of the Top-Up Shares, an "accredited investor," as defined in Rule
501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Sub agrees that the Top-Up
Option and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up
Option are being and will be acquired by Sub for the purpose of investment
and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution
thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(including the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "
_Securities Act_ ")).

extent applicable, the Company, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the NJBCA and shall be filed by Parent with the Department of Treasury of the

specified in the NJBCA, including as set forth in Section 14A:10-6 thereof.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 2.05. _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws._ (a) The
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as heretofore amended (the "

shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

# 

  

# _Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the Constituent
Corporations; Exchange 
 of Certificates_

  

## 

  

## SECTION 3.01. _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares
of Company Common Stock, or the holder of any shares of capital stock of
Parent or Sub:

  

## 

  

#### (a)   _Capital Stock of Sub._ Each share of common stock of Sub, par
value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully
paid and

  



        
   

  



  

#### nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

  

#### 

  

#### (b)   _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._ All
shares of Company Common Stock that are owned as treasury stock by the
Company or owned by Parent or Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

  

#### 

  

#### (c)   _Conversion of Company Common Stock._  Each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 3.01(b)) shall
be converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation, in
cash and without interest, an amount equal to the Offer Price paid in the
Offer (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time such shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate, or evidence of shares held
in book-entry form, that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
any such shares (a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

  

#### 

  

#### (d)   _Adjustment Events._ If, between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are
changed into, or exchanged for, a different number or class of shares by
reason of any stock dividend, split, combination, subdivision or
reclassification of shares, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar
transaction, then the Offer Price and the Merger Consideration (as
applicable) payable per share of Company Common Stock shall be adjusted
to the extent appropriate to fairly reflect the effects of such transaction.

  

#### 

  

## SECTION 3.02. _Exchange of Certificates._ (a) _Paying Agent._ Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement with such bank or trust
company as may be designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon
surrender of Certificates (the " _Paying Agent_ "). At the Effective
Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, deposit with
the Paying Agent funds in amounts and at the times necessary for the payment
of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.01(c) upon surrender
of Certificates, it being understood that any and all interest or other
amounts earned with respect to such funds shall be for the account of and
turned over to Parent in accordance with Section 3.02(g).

  

## 

  

### (b)   _Exchange Procedure._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a Certificate (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates held by such person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and

  



        
   

  



  

### have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the amount of Merger Consideration that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.01(c), and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
stock transfer books of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration in
exchange therefor may be made to a person other than the person in whose name
the Certificate so surrendered is registered if, upon presentation to the
Paying Agent, such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such taxes have been paid or
are not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash
payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

  

### 

  

### (c)   _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ All cash
paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the terms of this
Article III shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
by such Certificate. At the close of business on the day on which the
Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.  If, after the close of
business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or
any other reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Article III.

  

### 

  

### (d)   _No Liability._ None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any cash that would otherwise have been payable in respect of any Certificate
that is delivered to a public official in accordance with any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates shall not have
been surrendered prior to the date which is one year after the Effective Time

general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any
Merger Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates
held by such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any
interest thereon.

standing (in jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing) in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership,
leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing

qualified or licensed or to be in good standing, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent, prior to

Certificate and its By-laws (the " _Company By-laws_ "), and the comparable
organizational documents of each of its Subsidiaries, in each case as amended

##### (iii)  Since the close of business on July 21, 2009 until the date of

of capital stock or other voting securities or equity interests of the
Company, other than issuances of shares of Company Common Stock (including
the associated Company Rights) pursuant to the conversion of the Convertible
Notes, the exercise of Company Stock Options and purchase rights under the
Purchase Plan and the settlement of Company RSUs, in each case outstanding as
of the close of business on July 21, 2009, and only in accordance with
their terms as in effect on such date, and (B) there have been no issuances
by the Company of securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable

##### derivative securities or other rights that are linked to the value of
Company Common Stock or the value of the Company or any part thereof, other
than purchase rights under the Purchase Plan and Company Rights.

  

##### 

  

(iv)  There are no outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock subject to vesting or restrictions on transfer imposed by the
Company, and all outstanding Company Stock Options and Company RSUs have been
granted under the Company Stock Plans. All grants under the Company Stock
Plans of Company Stock Options and Company RSUs were accounted for in
accordance with GAAP in the financial statements (including the related
notes) of the Company and disclosed in the Company SEC Documents in
accordance with the Exchange Act and all other applicable Laws. Each grant of
a Company Stock Option was duly authorized no later than the date on which
the grant of such Company Stock Option was by its terms to be effective (the
" _Grant Date_ ") by all necessary corporate action, including, as
applicable, approval by the Board of Directors of the Company (or a duly
constituted and authorized committee thereof) and any required shareholder
approval by the necessary number of votes or written consents, each such
grant was made in accordance with the terms of the applicable compensation
plan or arrangement of the Company, the Exchange Act and all other applicable
Laws and regulatory rules or requirements, including the rules of the NASDAQ,
and the per share exercise price of each Company Stock Option was equal to
the fair market value (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, in the
case of each Company Stock Option intended to qualify as an "incentive stock
option", and within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, in the case of
each other Company Stock Option) of a share of Company Common Stock on the
applicable Grant Date. The Company has not knowingly granted, and there is no
and has been no Company policy or practice to knowingly grant, Company
Options prior to, or otherwise knowingly coordinate the grant of Company
Options with, the release or other public announcement of material
information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
financial results or prospects. Each Company Stock Option intended to
qualify as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code, if any,
so qualifies. Other than the Company Stock Plans, there is no plan,
contract, agreement or arrangement providing for the grant of options to
acquire shares of Company Common Stock by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. All Company Stock Options and Company RSUs that are outstanding
as of the date hereof are evidenced by stock option agreements, restricted
stock unit agreements or other award agreements, in each case substantially
in the forms made available to Parent prior to the date hereof, except that
the forms of such agreements differ with respect to the number of Company
Stock Options, Company RSUs or shares covered thereby, the exercise price (if
applicable), vesting schedule and expiration date applicable thereto and
other similar terms; _provided_  that no stock option agreement, restricted
stock unit agreement or other award agreement contains terms that are
inconsistent in any material respect with, or material terms in addition to,
such forms.

  



         
 

  



  

##### (v)  As of the close of business on July 21, 2009, there were
outstanding Company Stock Options to purchase 18,571,605 shares of Company
Common Stock with exercise prices on a per share basis lower than the Merger

Options was equal to $8.07 per share. As of the close of business on July
21, 2009, approximately 9,151 shares of Company Common Stock were subject to
outstanding purchase rights under the Purchase Plan based on payroll
information for the period ended July 10, 2009 (assuming the fair market
value per share of Company Common Stock determined in accordance with the
terms of the Purchase Plan on the last day of the offering period in effect
under the Purchase Plan on the date hereof will be equal to the
Merger Consideration and that payroll deductions continue at the current
rate). Each Company Stock Option and each Company RSU may, by its terms, be
treated at the Effective Time as set forth in Section 6.04(a)(i)
or 6.04(a)(ii), as applicable, and all rights to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock under the Purchase Plan may, by their terms, be treated in
accordance with Section 6.04(a)(iii). No holder of a Company Stock Option or
Company RSU or right to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under the
Purchase Plan that is outstanding at the Effective Time is entitled, at the
Effective Time, to any treatment of such Company Stock Option or Company RSU
or right to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under the Purchase Plan
other than as provided in Section 6.04(a), and after the Effective Time no
holder of a Company Stock Option or Company RSU or right to purchase shares
of Company Common Stock under the Purchase Plan (or former such holder) shall
have the right to acquire any capital stock of the Company or any other
equity interest therein.

Except as set forth above in Section 4.01(b) or this Section 4.01(c), as of
the date hereof, (A) there are not issued, reserved for issuance or
outstanding (1) any shares of capital stock or other voting securities or
equity interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (2) any

Stock or the value of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any part
thereof and (B) there are not any outstanding obligations of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such

sold, any such securities (except pursuant to the forfeiture of Company Stock
Options and Company RSUs or the acquisition by the Company of shares of
Company Common Stock in settlement of the exercise price of a Company Stock
Option or the tax withholding obligations of holders of Company Stock Options
and Company RSUs, in each case in accordance with their terms as in effect on
the date of this Agreement). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
is a party to any voting or other agreement with respect to the voting of any
such securities and, to the knowledge of the Company, as of the date hereof,
there are no irrevocable proxies and no voting agreements with respect to any
such securities.

## SECTION 5.02. _No Solicitation._ (a) The Company shall not, nor shall
it permit any of its controlled affiliates to, nor shall it authorize or
permit any of its or its controlled affiliates directors, officers,
employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or
representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage, or take any other action to
knowingly facilitate, any Takeover Proposal or any inquiries or the making of
any proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal
or (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any information with respect
to, or otherwise knowingly cooperate in any way with any person with respect
to, any Takeover Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
could reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal.  The Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and direct its Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions and
negotiations with any person conducted heretofore with respect to any
Takeover Proposal and shall

  



        
   

  

## 

  

## request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished in connection therewith. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if, at any time prior to the Offer Closing, the
Company, in response to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal that the Board
of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal, and which Takeover Proposal was not solicited after the date hereof
and was made after the date hereof and did not otherwise result from a breach
of this Section 5.02, may, and may permit and authorize its affiliates and
its and its affiliates Representatives to, in each case subject to
compliance with Section 5.02(c) and the other provisions of this Agreement,
(A) furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to
the person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant
to a confidentiality agreement which contains terms that are no less
favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement; _provided_ that all such information had been provided, or is
concurrently provided, to Parent, and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the person making such Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 5.02(a) by any controlled affiliate of
the Company or any of the Companys or its controlled affiliates
Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach by the Company of this Section
5.02(a).

  

## 

  

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any
proposal or offer (whether or not in writing) from any person (other than
Parent or Sub or any of their affiliates) with respect to any (i) merger,
consolidation, share exchange, other business combination or similar
transaction involving the Company, (ii) sale, lease, contribution or other
disposition, directly or indirectly (including by way of merger,
consolidation, share exchange, other business combination, partnership, joint
venture, sale of capital stock of or other equity interests in a Subsidiary
of the Company or otherwise), of any business or asset or assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries representing 15% or more of
the consolidated revenues or assets (determined by reference to book value or
fair market value) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
(iii) issuance, sale or other disposition, directly or indirectly, to any
person (or the shareholders of any person) or group of securities (or
options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for, such securities) representing 15% or more of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or of the voting power of the
Companys capital stock, (iv) transaction in which any person (or the
shareholders of any person) shall acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial
ownership, or the right to acquire beneficial ownership, or formation of any
group which beneficially owns or has the right to acquire beneficial
ownership of, 15% or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
or of the voting power of the Companys capital stock or (v) combination of
the foregoing.

  



  

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any
binding bona fide written offer, which was not solicited after the date
hereof, was made after the date hereof and did not result from a breach of
Section 5.02(a), made by any person (other than Parent or Sub or any of their
affiliates) that, if consummated, would

  



        
   

  



  

result in such person (or in the case of a direct merger between such person
and the Company, the shareholders of such person) acquiring, directly or
indirectly, more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
or of the voting power of the Companys capital stock or all or substantially
all the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and
which offer the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) (i) provides a higher value to the
shareholders of the Company than the consideration payable in the Offer and
the Merger (taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such
proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of the Offer
or this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such Superior Proposal or
otherwise)) and (ii) is reasonably capable of being completed in a timely
fashion, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other
aspects of such proposal.

  



  

### (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee
thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, or
propose publicly to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub,
the approval or recommendation by such Board of Directors or any such
committee of this Agreement, regarding the Offer or the Merger, or approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend any Takeover Proposal,
or resolve or agree to take any such action (any such action, resolution or
agreement to take such action being referred to herein as an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change"_ ), or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly
to approve, recommend or permit the Company or any of its affiliates to enter
into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement (each, an "
_Acquisition Agreement_ ") constituting or related to, or which is intended
to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other
than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 5.02(a)).
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior
to the Offer Closing, the Board of Directors of the Company may (x) effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change, _provided_  that the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
shareholders of the Company under applicable Law and (y) in response to a
Superior Proposal, cause the Company to terminate this Agreement, _provided_
, concurrently with such termination, the Company pays the fee required by
Section 6.06(b)(ii)(B); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (1) the Board of
Directors of the Company may not effect such an Adverse Recommendation Change
and (2) no termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.02(b) may
be made, in each case unless the Company has complied with all its
obligations pursuant to this Section 5.02 (other than, in the case of an
Adverse Recommendation Change, Section 5.02(a) if, since the date hereof, no
Takeover Proposal has been made or otherwise become publicly known and no
person has publicly announced an intention to make a Takeover Proposal (in
each case, whether or not conditional and whether or not withdrawn)). No
Adverse Recommendation Change or termination of this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 5.02(b) may be made unless (A) the Board of Directors shall have
first provided prior written notice to Parent that it is prepared to (I)
effect an Adverse Recommendation

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### Change (an " _Adverse Recommendation Change Notice_ ") or (II)
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.02(b) in response to
a Superior Proposal (a " _Superior Proposal Notice_ "), which notice shall,
if the basis for the proposed action by the Board of Directors of the Company
is not related to a Superior Proposal, contain a description of the events,
facts and circumstances giving rise to such proposed action or, if the basis
for the proposed action by the Board of Directors of the Company is a
Superior Proposal, contain a description of the material terms and conditions
of such Superior Proposal, and (B) Parent does not make, within three
business days after the receipt of such notice, a proposal that would, in the
reasonable good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation), cause such events, facts and
circumstances to no longer form the basis for the Board of Directors of the
Company to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or cause the offer
previously constituting a Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a
Superior Proposal, as the case may be. If Parent has in good faith
proposed to the Company revisions to the terms of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement during the three business day period prior to
the Company effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.02(b), the Company agrees that the
Company and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and
its Representatives (so long as Parent and its Representatives are
negotiating in good faith) regarding any such revisions to the terms of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent. Any material
changes with respect to such events, facts or circumstances mentioned above,
or material changes to the financial terms or any material change to other
material terms of such Superior Proposal, as the case may be, occurring prior
to the Companys effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.02(b) shall require the Company to
provide to Parent a new Adverse Recommendation Change Notice or Superior
Proposal Notice and a new three business day period and, in determining
whether to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or whether to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.02(b), the Board of Directors of
the Company shall take into account any such changes.

  

### 

  

### (c) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in
this Section 5.02, the Company shall, as promptly as possible and in any
event within 24 hours after the receipt thereof, advise Parent orally and in
writing of (i) any Takeover Proposal or any request for information or
inquiry that expressly contemplates or could reasonably be expected to lead
to a Takeover Proposal and (ii) the material terms and conditions of such
Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry (including any change to the financial
terms, conditions or other material terms thereof) and the identity of the
person making any such Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry. The Company
shall (i) make reasonable best efforts to confer with Parent at least once
each calendar day and keep Parent reasonably informed of the status
(including any change to the financial terms, conditions, or other material
terms) of any such Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry and (ii) provide to
Parent, as soon as practicable and in any event within 24 hours after receipt
or delivery thereof, copies of all draft agreements (and any other written
material to the extent such material contains any financial terms, conditions
or other material terms relating to any Takeover Proposal) sent by or
provided to the Company (or its Representatives) in connection with any such
Takeover Proposal.

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### (d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its
shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying with Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its
shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the
Company (after consultation with outside legal counsel), failure so to
disclose is reasonably likely to result in a breach of applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the taking of any such position or making of
any such disclosure contemplated by clauses (i) or (ii) above shall be
subject to and only taken in compliance with Section 5.02(b).

## SECTION 6.01. _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Shareholders Meeting._
(a) If the approval of this Agreement by the Companys shareholders is
required by applicable Law, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable
following the Offer Closing, prepare and file with the SEC the preliminary
Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys shareholders as
promptly as practicable after such filing. Each of the Company and Parent
shall furnish all information concerning such person to the other as may be
reasonably requested in connection with the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall promptly notify
Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the
SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide
Parent with copies of all correspondence between it and its Representatives,
on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement. Each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts
to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect
to the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or
mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company (i)
shall provide Parent an opportunity to review and comment on such document or
response (including the proposed final version of such document or response)
and (ii) shall include in such document or response all comments reasonably
proposed by Parent. If, at any time prior to the Shareholders Meeting, any
information relating to the Company, Parent or any of their respective
affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the Company or
Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, so that the Proxy Statement does not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party
that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, disseminated to the shareholders of the Company.

  

## 

  

### (b) If the approval of this Agreement by the Companys shareholders is
required by applicable Law, the Company shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### following the Offer Closing (or, with respect to calling, giving
notice of, convening and holding a meeting of its shareholders, as soon as
reasonably practicable following the expiration of the time period
contemplated by Rule 14a-6(a) under the Exchange Act or the resolution of any
comments from the SEC), establish a record date (which will be as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the Offer Closing) for, duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the "
_Shareholders Meeting_ "), for the purpose of obtaining the Shareholder
Approval. The notice of such Shareholders Meeting shall state that a
resolution to approve this Agreement will be considered at the Shareholders
Meeting. The Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend to
shareholders of the Company that they approve this Agreement, and shall
include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if, following the Offer and any subsequent offering period and the
exercise, if any, of the Top-Up Option, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall own
at least 90% of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock, the
parties hereto shall take all necessary and appropriate action, including
with respect to the transfer to Sub of any shares of Company Common Stock
held by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, to cause the Merger to become
effective as soon as practicable after the Offer Closing without the
Shareholders Meeting in accordance with Section 14A:10-5.1 of the NJBCA.

  

### 

  

### (c) At the Shareholders Meeting, if any, Parent agrees to cause all
shares of Company Common Stock acquired pursuant to the Offer and all other
shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent to
be voted in favor of the Shareholder Approval.

  

### 

  

## SECTION 6.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality._ The Company shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and to Parents
Representatives access upon reasonable advance notice and during normal
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time or the
termination of this Agreement to all their respective properties, assets,
books, records, Contracts, Permits, documents, information, directors,
officers and employees, but only to the extent that such access does not
unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (and, to the extent required by applicable Law, access to
personnel records will be provided only if authorized by the specific
employees), and during such period the Company shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, furnish to Parent any information concerning its
business as Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not be required to (or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to)
afford such access or furnish such information to the extent that doing so is
restricted under applicable Law or otherwise would result in the loss
of attorney-client privilege (provided that the Company shall use its
reasonable efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that
does not result in a loss of attorney-client privilege).  Following the date
of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, Parent may (but shall not
be required to), following reasonable notice to the Company, contact and
interview any Company Personnel and review the personnel records and such
other information concerning the Company Personnel as Parent may reasonably
request, provided such review is permitted by applicable Law. No
investigation by Parent or any of its Representatives and no other receipt of
information by Parent or any of its Representatives shall operate as a waiver
or otherwise affect any representation or

  



        
   

  

## 

  

## warranty of the Company or any covenant or other provision in
this Agreement. Except as required by any applicable Law or Judgment, Parent
will hold, and will direct its Representatives to hold, any and all
information received from the Company confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 6.03. _Reasonable Best Efforts; Consultation and Notice._ (a)
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using its reasonable
best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the satisfaction of the
conditions precedent set forth in Exhibit A and Article VII, (ii)
the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents,
approvals, orders and authorizations from, and the giving of any necessary
notices to, Governmental Entities and other persons and the making of all
necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including (A) the filing
of a premerger notification and report form by the Company, Parent and Sub
under the HSR Act not later than seven business days, or such longer period
as to which the parties may mutually agree in writing, after the date of this
Agreement and (B) the filing of other registrations, declarations and filings
with, or provision of notices to, Governmental Entities, if any), (iii) the
taking of all reasonable steps to provide any supplemental information
requested by a Governmental Entity, including participating in meetings with
officials of such entity in the course of its review of this Agreement, the
Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(iv) the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid any
suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding by any Governmental Entity
or other person and (v) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate and make effective the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In connection
with and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) each of the
Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement
or any of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (B) Parent shall be required to, subject to the next
sentence, sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct its business
in a specified manner, agree to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of
or conduct its business in a specified manner, or permit the conduct of its
business in a specified manner or the sale, holding separate or other
disposition of, any assets of Parent or its Subsidiaries or, after the
Closing, the Company or its Subsidiaries, in each case as may be required to
avoid the occurrence of any Offer Condition set forth in clauses (ii) or
(iii)(a) or (b) of Exhibit A or to cause any such Offer Condition then
existing to cease to exist. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (I) neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required pursuant to this Section
6.03(a) to complete any disposition of the assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing or enter into any agreement or

therefor policies of any reputable insurance company or (ii) satisfy its
obligation under this Section 6.05(c) by causing the Company to obtain, on

benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her

Takeover Proposal has been made directly to the shareholders of the Company
generally or shall have otherwise become publicly known or any person shall
have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional and whether

amounts due pursuant to Section 6.06(b) and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for
the amounts set forth in Section 6.06(b), the Company shall pay to Parent its
reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit and any appeal relating thereto, together with
interest on the amounts set forth in Section 6.06(b) at the prime rate of

transaction date) and (ii) provide full credit for any co-payments,
deductibles or similar payments made or incurred prior to the Effective Time
for the plan year in which the Effective Time (or such transition date)
occurs.

hereby acknowledges that the consummation of the Offer and the Merger
constitutes a change of control or change in control, as the case may be, for

extent any Company Benefit Plan, Company Benefit Agreement, Parent Benefit
Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement

,  _however_ , that to the extent that, and for so long as, a
Continuing Employee remains employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
during the 12 month period following the Closing, the compensation and
benefits payable to such employee during such period shall be subject to
Section 6.12(a). No covenant or other undertaking in this Agreement shall
constitute an amendment to any employee benefit plan, program, policy or
arrangement, and any covenant or undertaking that suggests that an employee
benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement will be amended shall be
effective only upon the adoption of a written amendment in accordance with
the amendment procedures of such plan, program, policy or arrangement.

# _Termination, Amendment and Waiver_

  

# 

  

## SECTION 8.01. _Termination._ This Agreement may be terminated, and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be abandoned, at any time
prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the Shareholder Approval
has been obtained, upon written notice (other than in the case of Section
8.01(a) below) from the terminating party to the non-terminating party
specifying the subsection of this Section 8.01 pursuant to which such
termination is effected:

  

## 

  

### (a) subject to Section 6.09(b), by mutual written consent of Parent, Sub
and the Company;

  

### 

  

### (b) by either Parent or the Company, if:

  

### 

  

##### (i) the Offer Closing shall not have occurred prior to October 30,
2009 (the " _Termination Date_ ") for any reason; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.01(b)(i)
shall not be available to any party whose action or failure to act has been a
principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the Offer Closing to occur
prior to such date and such action or failure to act constitutes a breach of
this Agreement;

  

##### 

  

##### (ii) any Legal Restraint that has the effect of preventing the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger shall be in effect and shall have
become final and nonappealable; or

  

##### 

  

##### (iii) any Legal Restraint that has the effect of delaying the
consummation of the Offer beyond the Termination Date shall be in effect and
shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.01(b)(iii) shall not
be available to any party which is then in breach of Section 6.03 of this
Agreement and such breach has been a principal cause of such Legal Restraint
being or remaining in effect;

  

##### 

  

### (c) prior to the Offer Closing, by Parent, in the event an Adverse
Recommendation Change has occurred;

  

### 

  

### (d) prior to the Offer Closing, by Parent, in the event the Board of
Directors of the Company fails to publicly reaffirm its recommendation of the
Offer within ten business days of a written request by Parent for
such reaffirmation (which reaffirmation request may be made by Parent only
once with respect to each Takeover Proposal and once with respect to each
amendment to the financial terms, conditions or any other material term of
such Takeover Proposal);

  

### 

  

### (e) prior to the Offer Closing, by Parent, if (i) the Company shall have
breached any of its representations or warranties or failed to perform any of
its obligations, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which
breach or

  



        
   

  



  

### failure to perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set
forth in paragraph (d) or (e) of clause (iii) of Exhibit A and (B)
is incapable of being cured by the Company by the Termination Date or, if
capable of being cured by the Company by the Termination Date, the Company
does not commence to cure such breach or failure within ten business days
after its receipt of written notice thereof from Parent and use its
reasonable best efforts to pursue such cure thereafter, or (ii) if any Legal
Restraint having any of the consequences referred to in clauses (2) through
(4) of paragraph (a) of clause (iii) of Exhibit A shall be in effect and
shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that this
Agreement may not be terminated pursuant to this Section 8.01(e)(ii)
if Parent or Sub is then in breach of Section 6.03 of this Agreement and
such breach has been a principal cause of such Legal Restraint being or
remaining in effect;

  

### 

  

### (f) prior to the Offer Closing, by the Company, if (i) Parent or Sub
shall have breached any of its representations or warranties contained in
this Agreement or (ii) Parent or Sub shall have failed to perform
all obligations, covenants or agreements required to be performed by them
under this Agreement at or prior to the Offer Closing, in each case, which
breach or failure to perform (A) is incapable of being cured by Parent or Sub
by the Termination Date or, if capable of being cured by Parent by the
Termination Date, Parent and Sub do not commence to cure such breach or
failure within ten business days after their receipt of written notice
thereof from the Company and use their reasonable best efforts to pursue such
cure thereafter and (B) in any way would reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially impede or materially delay the consummation by Parent or Sub of
the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

  

### 

  

### (g) prior to the Offer Closing, (i) by Parent if, on any then-scheduled
expiration date for the Offer, Sub is not required (and Parent is not
required to cause Sub) to extend the Offer pursuant to the sixth sentence of
Section 1.01(a) and any of the Offer Conditions shall have occurred and be
continuing on such then-scheduled expiration date and (ii) by the Company, if
the Offer has expired in accordance with its terms and has not been extended
by Sub, and Sub has not accepted for payment within three business days
following such expiration all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered
and not validly withdrawn; or

  

### 

  

### (h) by the Company in accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions of Section 5.02(b).

  

### 

  

## SECTION 8.02. _Effect of Termination._ In the event of termination of
this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section
8.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without
any liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Sub or the Company or
their respective Subsidiaries, officers or directors, except that (a)
the provisions of Section 4.01(u), the last sentence of Section 6.02, Section
6.06, this Section 8.02 and Article IX shall survive such termination and (b)
the termination of this Agreement shall not relieve or release any party
hereto from any liability arising out of its willful breach of this Agreement
or any fraud.

  



        
   

  



  

## SECTION 8.03. _Amendment._ Subject to Section 6.09(b), this Agreement may
be amended by the parties hereto at any time, whether before or after the
Offer Closing shall have occurred or the Shareholder Approval, if required by
applicable Law, has been obtained; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) after
the Offer Closing, there shall be no amendment that decreases the Merger
Consideration and (b) after the Shareholder Approval has been obtained, there
shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further approval by
shareholders of the Company without the further approval of such
shareholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 8.04. _Extension; Waiver._ At any time prior to the Effective
Time, the parties may, subject to Section 6.09(b), (a) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties,
(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that after the Shareholder Approval has been obtained,
there shall be made no waiver that by Law requires further approval by
shareholders of the Company without the further approval of such
shareholders. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party which specifically sets forth the terms of such
extension or waiver. The failure or delay by any party to this Agreement to
assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of such rights nor shall any single or partial exercise
by any party to this Agreement of any of its rights under this Agreement
preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or any other rights
under this Agreement.
