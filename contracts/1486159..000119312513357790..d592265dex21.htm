prepared by any third environmental consultant pursuant to Section 6.2 to
Seller. Seller shall not be deemed by its receipt of said documents or
otherwise as a result of Buyers environmental assessment process to have made
any representation or warranty, expressed, implied or statutory, as to the
condition of the Assets or Operators Assets or to the accuracy of said
documents or the information contained therein, it being understood that
Sellers only representations or warranties with respect to environmental
matters shall be those set forth in Section 3.21. Buyer agrees to, and to
cause its Affiliates and representatives to, keep the results of all
environmental assessments conducted by Buyer or its representatives on
the Assets and Operators Assets confidential, and not disclose such results
to any third Person, other than as required by applicable Law.

 

(iii) Upon completion of Buyers due diligence, Buyer shall at its sole cost
and expense and without any cost or expense to Seller, Operator, or their
Affiliates, (A) repair all damage done to the Assets or Operators Assets in
connection with Buyers due diligence in a manner that restores the Assets and
Operators Assets to the approximate same or better condition existing prior
to commencement of Buyers due diligence and (B) remove all equipment, tools
or other property brought onto the Assets or Operators Assets in connection
with Buyers due diligence. Any damage to the Assets or Operators Assets
resulting from Buyers due diligence will be promptly corrected by Buyer.

(iv) If Seller does not provide its consent to any Phase II Request delivered
in accordance with the terms hereof before the ten (10) Business Days prior to
the Title Claim Date (or within two (2) Business Days if such Phase II Request
is delivered before the ten (10) Business Days prior to the Title Claim
Date), Buyer may elect to exclude the affected Asset or Operators Asset to be
conveyed at Closing, and such Asset or the Operators Asset (or portion
thereof affected) and all Assets and Operators Assets related thereto shall
become Excluded Assets. At Closing, the Allocated Value of all assets excluded
pursuant to this Section 6.2b shall be accounted for as a downward adjustment
to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.2b.

c. All information described in Section 6.2a(iii) shall be open to inspection
and photocopying at Sellers and/or Operators offices (as applicable) from
the date hereof until the Closing Date (or earlier termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article 12); _provided_ that during such period Buyer
agrees to keep such information confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement.

d. All access, reviews, assessments or investigations described in Sections
6.2a and b shall be at Buyers sole risk and expense, and Buyer shall conduct
such access, reviews, assessments or investigations during Sellers and
Operators normal business hours and upon reasonable notice to Seller or
Operator, as applicable, and in a manner that minimizes interference with the
operation of the business of Seller and Operator.

 



27 e. Buyer shall, and shall cause all of its representatives to, abide by
Sellers, Operators and any third-party operators, as applicable, safety
rules, regulations and operating policies while conducting its due diligence
evaluation of the Assets or the Operators Assets, including any environmental
or other inspection or assessment of the Assets or the Operators Assets.
Buyer hereby releases, indemnifies, defends and holds harmless each of the
operators of the Assets and the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against
any and all liabilities arising out of, resulting from or relating to any
field visit, environmental property assessment or other due diligence activity
conducted by Buyer or any of Buyers representatives with respect to the
Assets or the Operators Assets, including entry by Buyer or any of Buyers
representatives into the offices of Seller, EVEN IF SUCH LIABILITIES ARISE OUT
OF OR RESULT FROM, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, THE SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT
OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF
LAW OF OR BY ANY THIRD-PARTY OPERATOR OR ANY SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTY,
EXCEPTING ONLY LIABILITIES ACTUALLY RESULTING FROM THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR
WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF SUCH THIRD PARTY OPERATOR OR SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTY.

6.3 _Release of Liens._

 

Subject to Section 7.3, concurrent with the Closing, except for Permitted
Encumbrances, Seller and Operator shall cause all liens, mortgages and
security interest (if any) encumbering any of the Assets and the Operators
Assets and securing any debt facilities maintained by or other obligations for
borrowed money of Seller, Operator or any of their respective Affiliates
to be terminated.

6.4 _Consents_.

a. Seller and Operator shall use commercially reasonable efforts to procure
the consents set forth on _Exhibit A-4_ and all other required third party
consents to the assignment of the Assets to Buyer (other than such consents as
are customarily obtained post-Closing), and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate
with Seller and Operator in seeking to obtain such consents, but, in each
case, without being obligated to pay any consideration or waive or release any
right or privilege to obtain such consent. If the Parties are not able to
effect the assignment of any of the Assets at Closing due to the lack of a
required material consent to transfer the same, then, except as otherwise
provided herein, such Assets shall not be deemed assigned at Closing. As to
any Transferred Agreement (subject to Sections 6.4b and 6.4c), until any such
consent is obtained, to the extent permissible under Law and under the terms
of such Transferred Agreement, Seller and Operator shall use
commercially reasonable efforts post-Closing (i) to continue to perform the
liabilities and obligations under or with regard to such Transferred
Agreement, (ii) hold such Transferred Agreement in trust for the benefit of
Buyer and shall promptly forward to Buyer any monies or other benefits
received that are attributable to such Transferred Agreement, and (iii)
endeavor to mutually agree with Buyer to institute alternative arrangements
intended to put the Parties in substantially the same economic position as if
such non-assigned Transferred Agreement had been assigned. If the foregoing
arrangements are not

 



28  permissible under Law or under the terms of the Transferred Agreement, then
the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take such other
actions or put into place such other arrangements as are permissible with
regard to the non-assigned Transferred Agreement so as to provide the Parties
with the same economic results as would otherwise have resulted.

 

b. If the assignment of a Lease or Transferred Agreement is subject to a
consent requirement and (i) the Lease or Transferred Agreement does not
contain language to the effect that the lessor or counterparty thereto (as
applicable) will have the right to terminate the Lease or Transferred
Agreement if an assignment is made without the consent requirement being
satisfied, and (ii) the failure to obtain such consent would not cause the
assignment to Buyer to be void or result in a material liability to Buyer,
then such Lease or Transferred Agreement, as applicable, shall be assigned to
Buyer at Closing and following the Closing, Seller, Operator and Buyer shall
continue the use of commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the required
consent and Buyer shall have no Claim against, and Seller and Operator shall
have no liability for, the failure to obtain any such consent.

c. If the assignment of a Lease or Transferred Agreement is subject to a
consent requirement and (i) the Lease or Transferred Agreement contains
language to the effect that the lessor or counterparty thereto (as applicable)
will have the right to terminate the Lease or Transferred Agreement if an
assignment is made without the consent requirement being satisfied (but
excluding any such of the foregoing that provide that consent may not be
unreasonably withheld unless the lessor or counterparty refused to grant
consent), (ii) the Lease or Transferred Agreement contains language to the
effect that failure to obtain such consent will result in a material
liability to Buyer, or (iii) the failure to obtain such consent would cause
the assignment to Buyer to be void, and the required consent is not obtained
by Closing (in such case in clauses (i) through (iii) above, a " _Required
Consent Lease_ "), then such Required Consent Lease shall be excluded from the
Assets or the Operators Assets (as the case may be) to be assigned and sold
to Buyer hereunder and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated
Value of the excluded Required Consent Lease. Following Closing, Seller and
Operator shall continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to procure such
consent within 180 days following Closing, with Buyer lending reasonable
assistance. If at the end of such 180-day period the required consent has not
been obtained, then the Parties shall discuss in good faith what further
mutually agreeable actions (if any) will be taken with respect to such
Required Consent Lease. If during such 180 day period the required consent is
obtained, then Seller shall notify Buyer and Buyer shall purchase, on or
before ten (10) Business Days following receipt of such notice, the
Required Consent Lease under the terms of this Agreement for a price equal to
the Allocated Value of such Required Consent Lease. To the extent such
Required Consent Lease has not been included in determining the adjustments to
be made pursuant to Section 2.2 (excluding Section 2.2b(viii), then the
adjustments that are specific to such Required Consent Lease shall be
calculated and contemporaneous with the payment of such Allocated Value, there
shall be applied as a deduction to such Allocated Value (if the sum of the
downward adjustments exceeds the sum of the upward adjustments) the net amount
resulting from such adjustments or there shall be applied as an addition to
such Allocated Value (if the sum of the upward adjustments exceeds the sum of
the downward adjustments) the net amount resulting from such adjustments.

 



29 d. Seller and Operator shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain or
otherwise cure any Chain of Title Consents identified by Buyer and Buyer
shall reasonably cooperate with Seller and Operator in seeking to obtain such
consents, but, in each case, without being obligated to pay any consideration
or waive or release any right or privilege to obtain such consent.

e. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the failure to (i) obtain any
consent for the assignment of a Required Consent Lease or (ii) obtain or
otherwise cure any Chain of Title Consents, shall not constitute a Title
Defect.

6.5  _Preferential Purchase Rights_.

a. With respect to each preferential purchase right or similar right set forth
on _Exhibit A-4_  or which otherwise affects any Asset or any Operators
Asset (" _Preferential Right_ "), Seller shall send, within seven (7) Business
Days following the date of this Agreement, to the holder of each such right a
written notice in material compliance with the contractual provisions
applicable to such right.

b. If, prior to Closing, any holder of such right notifies Seller that it
intends to consummate the purchase of any part of the Assets or the Operators
Assets to which its right applies (in such case, a " _Preferential Right
Property_ "), that Preferential Right Property shall be excluded from the
Transactions, and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value
of such excluded Preferential Right Property. Seller shall be entitled to all
proceeds from the holder of such right who exercises its right to purchase
a Preferential Right Property prior to Closing. If the holder of such
Preferential Right thereafter fails to consummate the purchase of the
Preferential Right Property covered by such Preferential Right on or before
one hundred and fifty (150) days following the Closing Date and such
Preferential Right is waived in writing or such Preferential Right has
otherwise expired, then Seller shall notify Buyer and Buyer shall purchase, on
or before ten (10) Business Days following receipt of such notice, the
Preferential Right Property under the terms of this Agreement for a price
equal to the Allocated Value of such Preferential Right Property.

 

c. If, by Closing, a Preferential Right burdening any Preferential Right
Property has not been exercised, the time for exercising such Preferential
Right has not expired and such Preferential Right has not been waived, then
that Preferential Right Property (the " _Transferred Preferential Right
Property_ ") shall be included in the Assets or the Operators Assets (as the
case may be) to be assigned and sold to Buyer, the Purchase Price shall not be
reduced in respect of such Transferred Preferential Right Property, such
Preferential Right shall be a Permitted Encumbrance hereunder, and the
following procedures shall be applicable. Seller shall promptly notify Buyer
if, after Closing, any holder of such Preferential Right notifies Seller that
it intends to consummate the purchase of any part of the Transferred
Preferential Right Property to which its Preferential Right applies before
the time for exercising such Preferential Right has expired. Buyer shall honor
all Preferential Rights validly exercised after Closing in respect of any
Transferred Preferential Right Property, shall indemnify and hold harmless
all Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any and all claims,
liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses (including court costs,
expert fees and reasonable attorneys fees) in connection therewith,
and shall be entitled to all proceeds from the holder of such Preferential
Right who exercises its right to purchase a Transferred Preferential Right
Property after Closing. All Preferential Right Properties for which applicable
Preferential Rights have been waived prior to Closing, or as to which the
period to exercise such Preferential Right has expired prior to Closing
without such Preferential Right being exercised, shall be sold to Buyer at
Closing pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement. 

 



30 d. To the extent any Preferential Right Property is purchased by Buyer
following Closing pursuant to Section 6.5a and such Preferential Right
Property has not been included in determining the adjustments to be made
pursuant to Section 2.2 (excluding Section 2.2b(viii)), then the adjustments
that are specific to such Preferential Right Property shall be calculated and
contemporaneous with the payment of the Allocated Value for such Preferential
Right Property there shall be applied as a deduction to such Allocated Value
(if the sum of the downward adjustments exceeds the sum of the upward
adjustments) the net amount resulting from such adjustments or there shall be
applied as an addition to such Allocated Value (if the sum of the upward
adjustments exceeds the sum of the downward adjustments) the net amount
resulting from such adjustments.

6.6 _Non-Compete._

 

a. Seller and Operator shall not, directly or indirectly, acquire, (and shall
ensure that, except as set forth herein, its Affiliates, and the respective
members, partners, employees, officers and directors (each, a " _Restricted
Person_ ") do not acquire, directly or indirectly) in any capacity for a
period of one (1) year following the Closing Date, any interest in
any Restricted Opportunity (whether alone or as a partner, joint venturer, or
equity interest holder of, or lender to, any Person or business acquiring such
interest) (such interest, a " _Restricted Interest_ "). As used herein, "
_Restricted Opportunity_ " means any opportunity for (including an opportunity
to finance) the leasing, acquisition, exploration, development, production,
gathering or any combination of the foregoing, of oil, gas or
other hydrocarbons in any part of the lands highlighted in yellow on _Exhibit
A-9_. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything in the foregoing
to the contrary, (i) Excluded Assets and (ii) the direct or indirect ownership
of publicly-traded securities shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to
constitute a Restricted Interest or Restricted Opportunity.

b. In the event a Restricted Person acquires or commits to acquire (whether
directly or indirectly) a Restricted Interest in breach of this Section 6.6,
within five (5) Business Days of such acquisition or commitment, Seller and
Operator shall cause such Restricted Person to deliver to Buyer all
documentation describing and summarizing the interest acquired, including a
copy of the instrument or agreement under which such interest was acquired.
Buyer shall have thirty (30) days following receipt of such notice to notify
Seller and Operator of Buyers desire to acquire all or any part of any such
Restricted Interest for the price equal to the amount actually paid for such
interest; _provided, however_ , that if the acquisition of a Restricted
Interest is made as part of a transaction that includes other assets and the
value allocated in good faith for such Restricted Interest is less than ten
percent (10%) of the total value of such transaction then Buyer shall pay to
such Restricted Person the value allocated to such Restricted Interest that
Buyer elects to acquire; _provided, further_ , that if there is a dispute as
to the value allocated such Restricted Interest the value shall be
determined in accordance with the dispute resolution provisions set forth in
Section 9.5. If Buyer elects to acquire such Restricted Interest or part
thereof, then Seller and Operator shall cause such Restricted Person to
execute and deliver to Buyer (or its designee) a valid recordable assignment
of all of such Restricted Persons

 



31  right, title and interest in and to the acquired interest in the applicable
Restricted Interest which Buyer elected to acquire, which assignment shall
contain a special warranty of title from and against claims arising by,
through or under such Restricted Person, but not otherwise and Buyer shall pay
such Restricted Person or Seller the value described above as consideration.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any assignment made by a Restricted Person
hereunder shall not limit any other remedies available to Buyer at law or in
equity as a result of the breach of this Section 6.6.

 

c. The Parties agree that the limitations contained in this Section 6.6 with
respect to time, geographical area and scope of activity are reasonable.
However, if any court shall determine that the time, geographical area or
scope of activity of any restriction contained in this Section 6.6 is
unenforceable, it is the intention of the Parties that such restrictive
covenant set forth herein shall not thereby be terminated but shall be deemed
amended to the extent required to render it valid and enforceable.

 

ARTICLE 7

COVENANTS OF BUYER

 

7.1 _Interim Covenants of Buyer._

Buyer covenants and agrees with Seller and Operator that from the date hereof
to the Closing Date, except (i) as provided herein, or (ii) as otherwise
consented to in writing by Seller, Buyer shall:

 

a. Take or cause to be taken all such actions as may be necessary or advisable
to make effective the purchase of the Assets and the Operators Assets, to
consummate the Transactions and to use reasonable efforts to assure that as of
the Closing Date it will not be under any material organizational, legal or
contractual restriction that would prohibit or materially delay the timely
consummation of the Transactions.

b. Use reasonable best efforts (i) to keep the Credit Agreement in place
and (ii) amend the Credit Agreement, at or prior to the Closing, to increase
the lenders aggregate commitment thereunder to such amounts as would be
necessary to enable Buyer to finance the Purchase Price and consummate the
Transactions on a timely basis in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

c. (i) Promptly notify Seller and Operator upon becoming aware of (A) any
termination or threatened termination of the Credit Agreement or (B) any
refusal or threatened refusal by the lenders party to the Credit Agreement to
increase the lenders commitment thereunder in accordance with Section
7.1b(ii), or any other event or circumstance that could adversely impact the
ability of Buyer to obtain such increase or keep the Credit Agreement in
place; (ii) upon becoming aware of any of the foregoing, use reasonable
best efforts to arrange, as promptly as practicable, but in no event later
than one day prior to the Closing Date, such financing from alternative
financing sources as would enable Buyer to finance the Purchase Price and
consummate the Transactions on a timely basis in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement; and (iii) keep Seller and Operator informed on a current basis
of the status of its efforts to increase the lenders aggregate commitment
under the Credit Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1b(ii) or, if
applicable, arrange such alternative financing.

 



32 7.2 _Records._

 

Buyer shall preserve and keep, or cause to be preserved and kept, all Records
in respect of the Assets and the Operators Assets that relate to periods
prior to Closing, or to matters for which Seller or Operator may be required
to provide indemnification hereunder, for a period of five (5) years from
Closing (or any longer period required by applicable Law, to account for the
statute of limitations under North Dakota Law, or until the final resolution
of any matters for which Seller or Operator may be required to provide
indemnification hereunder) and shall give Seller or Operator, at Sellers or
Operators sole cost and expense, reasonable access to such Records, and any
relevant properties or personnel, during normal business hours. Buyer shall
require any purchaser of the Assets and the Operators Assets from Buyer to
preserve all such Records until five (5) years from the date of Closing under
this Agreement, to make such Records available to Seller or Operator as
required hereunder, and during such five (5) year period, to include a
comparable provision as this Section 7.2 in any sale of any of the Assets and
the Operators Assets to a purchaser from Buyer and require that such
purchaser further include such comparable provision in any sale of any of the
Assets and the Operators Assets to any subsequent purchaser.

7.3 _Mescalero._

 

As reflected on _Exhibit D-1_ , Mescalero owns, or will own, a working
interest upon payout (the " _Excluded After Payout Interests_ ") as that term
is defined in that certain Stipulation and Assignment of After Payout Interest
dated April 24, 2013 and filed of record under file number 452206 of the
records of the County Recorder of McKenzie County, North Dakota and filed of
record under file number 765930 of the records of Williams County, North
Dakota (the " _Stipulations_ "), less and except those Wells identified in
_Exhibit A-8_. Buyer agrees to timely provide to Mescalero information
regarding payout as set forth in the Stipulations, as amended by a stipulation
stating that the Revised Exhibit B to Stipulation and Assignment of After
Payout Working Interest attached hereto as Exhibit K amends and restates in
its entirety the Exhibit B to Stipulation and Assignment of After Payout
Working Interest dated April 24, 2013 attached to such Stipulation and
Assignment of After Payout Working Interest (the " _Amendment_ ").

 

7.4 _Credit Support._

a. The Parties understand that none of the bonds, letters of credit,
guarantees and insurance, if any, posted or owned by Seller or Operator with
any Governmental Entity or third party and relating to the Assets or the
Properties (" _Seller Credit Obligations_ ") are to be transferred to Buyer.

b. On or before the Closing Date, Buyer shall obtain, or cause to be obtained
in the name of Buyer, replacements for such Seller Credit Obligations.

c. In the case of Section 7.4b, Buyer may also provide evidence that such
replacements are not necessary as a result of existing bonds, letters of
credit, guarantees and insurance that Buyer has previously posted as long as
such existing bonds, letters of credit, guarantees and insurance are adequate
to secure the release of those posted, supported or owned by Seller.

 



33 7.5 _Salt Water Disposal Well._

 

a. Operator shall retain the water extraction system, any water collection
tanks at the Jackson #1-29H well site currently used in connection therewith,
the extraction water line to Jackson #1-29 well site, any truck loading
facilities for the loading of the extraction water and the connection between
the extraction water line and salt water disposal system (collectively, the "
_Wolf Assets_ "). At Closing, Operator agrees to execute a reasonable
customary access agreement to grant Operator access to the Wolf Assets.

 

b. Operator shall retain the responsibility and liability for extraction,
monitoring and disposal of any extracted water from the water extraction
system.

c. Operator may offer water extracted by Operator from the water extraction
system (" _Extracted Water_ ") to Buyer or a third party, and Buyer at its
option may (i) for Extracted Water Buyer chooses to take, reimburse the
Operator for transportation of the Extracted Water (as provided in 7.5f) to
the trucking facilities at the Jackson #1-29H well site or, for any Extracted
Water for which Buyer does not elect to reimburse such transportation costs,
allow Operator to offer the Extracted Water to a third party who will
reimburse Operator for transportation of the Extracted Water to the trucking
facilities at the Jackson #1-29H well site; or (ii) for Extracted Water not
taken by Buyer or a third party under clause (i), allow Operator to dispose of
the Extracted Water in the Wolf Salt Water Disposal Well or other salt water
disposal wells as provided in Section 7.5g. It is understood that any
Extracted Water provided by Operator to Buyer shall meet Buyers standards for
use in its production operations. Operator shall use reasonable efforts
to provide the Extracted Water suitable for disposal in the Wolf Salt Water
Disposal Well or other salt water disposal wells referenced in Section 7.5g.

 

d. At Closing, Buyer shall acquire the Wolf Salt Water Disposal Well and
associated gathering SWD system as an Asset. The maximum volume of Extracted
Water of which Buyer will be required to allow disposal will be 1000 BPD (and
of the quality as provided in Section 7.5c) and Buyers obligation to allow
disposal of such water shall terminate when North Dakota
Industrial Commission (" _NDIC_ ") and the North Dakota Department of Health
(" _NDDH_ ") release Operator from its current extraction obligation under the
Consent Agreement and the NDIC Stipulation. Buyer is only obligated to
allow disposal of water that constitutes Extracted Water.

e. At Closing, Buyer shall acquire the pipeline from the Jackson water
collection tanks to the Wolf Salt Water Disposal Well and all other
facilities at the Jackson site (other than the Wolf Assets).

f. If Buyer reimburses Operator for transportation of the Extracted Water,
the transportation cost thereof will be $0.75/bbl, without any CPI or marked
to market increases in transportation cost. If Operator disposes of any water
into the Wolf Salt Water Disposal Well or other salt water disposal wells
referenced in Section 7.5g, there shall be no charge for use of the pipeline
system existing on the date of this Agreement for transportation or disposal
charge in 

 



34  such wells. Buyers obligation to allow Operator to dispose of Extracted
Water in such wells under this Section 7.5 shall continue so long as those
wells or the SWD lines existing as of the date hereof and servicing those
wells have capacity. Operator agrees that its right to dispose of Extracted
Water in such wells is not exclusive and that other water will be disposed of
in such wells.

 

g. If the Wolf Salt Water Disposal Well is plugged or if there is no longer
any capacity, Buyer shall first provide access for Operator to dispose of the
Extracted Water via existing SWD gathering system, in order of preference, to
(1st) the Bagwell #1 SWD well to the extent there is any capacity, and if not,
shall provide access to (2nd) the Powell #1 SWD well (if established) or
(3rd) to the Safely #1 SWD well to the extent there is any capacity; provided,
that Operator shall be responsible for the transportation (including costs
thereof) of any Extracted Water if the SWD lines do not serve these wells. 

h. In the event the Buyer would decide to plug and abandon the Jackson #1-29
well, Operator will have first right of refusal, prior to plugging of same,
to obtain the well bore and surface equipment for the possible use of same as
a salt water disposal well (SWD). If approval is given to use same as a SWD,
it would be used for the sole purpose of disposal of the Extracted Water.
If the conversion of the Jackson #1-29 well to a SWD is successful, Operator
would disconnect the Wolf SWD line at the Jackson #1-29 well site thereby
allowing the SWD to be a standalone system for the remainder of Operators
extraction obligation under the Consent Agreement and the NDIC Stipulation
thus releasing Buyer from any continued obligation concerning the extraction
process.

 

i. Operator will fulfill its obligations under the Consent Agreement, NDIC
Stipulation, Monson Settlement Agreement and Wolf Settlement Agreement;
_provided_ , that nothing in this Section 7.5i shall diminish Sellers
obligations to Buyer with respect to the Seller Retained Liabilities.

 

j. As used in this Section 7.5, the following terms shall have the meanings
set forth below.

 

(i) " _Consent Agreement_ " means the Administrative and Consent Agreement to
which Operator is a party, entered on September 20, 2006 by the NDDH in Case
No. 07-001WPC.

(ii) " _Monson Settlement Agreement_ " means the Settlement Agreement and
Release among Operator, SK and S Oilfield Services, Inc., Linda Monson, Jesse

Release by and among Operator, Rodney Wolf and Verna Wolf.

cause their respective Affiliates to, (i) make or cause to be made the
filings required of such Party or any of its Affiliates under the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ "), as
promptly as is reasonably practicable (but no later than September 13, 2013),
(ii) cooperate with the other Parties and furnish all information in such
Partys possession that is necessary in connection with such other Parties
filings under the HSR Act, (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the expiration of the notice or waiting periods under the HSR Act as promptly
as is reasonably practicable, (iv) promptly inform the other Parties of any
communication from or to, and any proposed understanding or agreement with,
any Governmental Entity in respect of such filings, and permit the other
Parties to review in advance any proposed communication by such Party to any
Governmental Entity, (v) consult and cooperate with the other Parties

(viii) use commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any
proceeding instituted (or threatened in writing to be instituted) by any
Governmental Entities challenging the Transactions as being in violation of
any Law.

b. In connection with filings to be made and actions taken under the HSR Act,
if any, the Party required to bear a filing fee shall be responsible for such
filing fee; _provided, however_ , that each Party shall bear its own fees and
expenses incurred as a result of any investigation or proceeding initiated by
the Department of Justice Antitrust Division or the Federal Trade Commission.

c. No Party shall agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any filing under the HSR Act, proceeding or other inquiry
in connection therewith, unless it consults with the other Parties in advance
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other
Parties the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting.

 



37 d. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.2, neither a
Party nor its Affiliate shall be required to divest itself from any business
operations, assets or properties in order to obtain any clearance, approval or
waiver under the HSR Act.

 

8.3 _Employees._

After Closing and during the term of the Transition Services Agreement (as
defined in Section 10.2f), Operator will make available to Buyer Operators
North Dakota employees (the " _Employees_ ") for purposes of determining
whether Buyer desires to offer employment to the Employees following the
termination of the term of the Transition Services Agreement. The Employees
will remain Operators "at will" employees during the term of the Transition
Services Agreement. If an Employee remains in Operators employment until
termination of the term of the Transition Services Agreement, absent cause or
good reason, Buyer shall offer at-will employment to such Employee(s) on terms
and conditions comparable to those provided by Operator to the Employees
(excluding any bonus awards contemplated to be paid or paid to such Employees
by Operator). Prior to the Closing, Buyer agrees that neither Buyer nor any of
its Affiliates will induce, solicit or attempt to induce or solicit any
Employee, or hire or attempt to hire any Employee, other than through general
advertising not targeted against Operator or such Employees. To the extent
that Buyer offers employment to any Employee post-termination of
the Transition Services Agreement, Seller and Operator agree that neither it
nor any of their respective Affiliates will induce, solicit or attempt to
induce or solicit any such Employee, or hire or attempt to hire any such
Employee, within the period of two (2) years post-termination of the
Transition Services Agreement.

8.4 _Exclusivity._

 

Between the date hereof until Closing, Seller and Operator shall negotiate
exclusively with Buyer with respect to the Transactions or any
other transaction involving the Assets, and shall not (and shall assure that
their respective officers, directors, employees, attorneys, financial
advisors, agents and affiliates do not on their behalf) take any action to
solicit, initiate, seek, knowingly encourage or support any inquiry, proposal
or offer from, furnish any information to, or participate in any negotiations
with, any corporation, partnership, person or other entity or group (other
than discussions with Buyer) regarding any acquisition of Seller or Operator,
any merger or consolidation with or involving Seller or Operator, or any
acquisition of the Assets. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8.4
shall not restrict any sale or disposition of any of the Excluded Assets.

8.5 _Like-Kind Exchange._

 

The Parties agree that, at any Partys election, this transaction shall be
structured as an exchange of like-kind properties (the " _1031 Exchange_ ")
under Section 1031 of the Code. Any Party desiring to make such election must
do so no later than three (3) business days prior to the Closing Date. If such
an election is made, (i) the electing Party shall in all events be
responsible for all costs and expenses related to the 1031 Exchange and shall
fully indemnify, defend and hold the other Parties harmless from and against
any and all liability, claims, damages, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) proceedings and causes of action of any kind or
nature whatsoever arising out of, connected with or in any manner related to
such 1031 Exchange that

 



38  would not have been incurred by the non-electing Parties but for the 1031
Exchange, (ii) the electing Party acknowledges and agrees that a whole or
partial assignment of this Agreement to a qualified intermediary or exchange
accommodation facilitator shall not release any Party from any of its
respective liabilities and obligations (for the avoidance of doubt including,
in the case of Buyer (and associated obligations of Parent pursuant to
Section 15.20), its obligations hereunder to fund the Transactions) or expand
any liabilities or obligations under this Agreement, and (iii) the electing
Party acknowledges and agrees that no representations are or have been made
that any particular tax treatment will be given to any Party as a result of a
1031 Exchange. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall
survive Closing and the transfer of the Property to Buyer. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this paragraph: (i) any 1031 Exchange
(whether a "forward" or "reverse" exchange) shall be consummated through the
use of a qualified intermediary or exchange accommodation facilitator so that
the non-electing Party shall in no event be requested or required to acquire
title to any property except as otherwise provided in this Agreement; and,
(ii) the electing Party shall have the right to assign all of its rights and
interests (but not its obligations) under this Agreement to its qualified
intermediary or exchange accommodation facilitator, and the non-electing party
agrees to acknowledge such assignment in writing.

 

ARTICLE 9

TITLE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

9.1 _Title._

Seller represents and warrants to Buyer that Sellers title to the Wells,
Leases and each DSU is Defensible Title, and the Assignment, Bill of Sale and
Conveyance in the form of _Exhibit D-1_ to be executed and delivered by Seller
and Buyer at Closing shall contain a special warranty of title to the Assets
by, through, and under Seller, but not otherwise, subject to the Permitted
Encumbrances.

 

9.2 _Title Defects._

a. To assert a claim arising out of a breach of Section 9.1, Buyer must
deliver a claim notice to Seller (a " _Title Defect Notice_ ") on or before
four (4) Business Days prior to Closing (the " _Title Claim Date_ "). Such
Title Defect Notice shall be in writing and shall include (i) a specific
description of the alleged Title Defect(s), (ii) the Wells, Lease or DSU
affected by the Title Defect (the " _Title Defect Property_ "), (iii)
documents upon which Buyer relies for its assertion of a Title Defect,
including, at a minimum, supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller
(as well as any title attorney or examiner hired by Seller) to verify the
existence of the alleged Title Defect, and (iv) the dollar amount by which
Buyer reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property is
reduced by the alleged Title Defect and the computations and information upon
which Buyers belief is based. Buyer shall be deemed to have waived any Title
Defects for which Seller has not been given notice on or before the Title
Claim Date; _provided_ , that an alleged failure to comply with subsections
(i) through (iv) above shall not cause any such notice to be invalid or any
Title Defect to be waived if the defect notice is reasonably sufficient to
provide notice to Seller of the existence and general nature of the alleged
Title Defect. Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to notify Seller at least on
a weekly basis of any Title Defects discovered by Buyer during the period from
the date hereof until Closing.

 



39 b. Subject and without prejudice to Sellers rights to dispute the existence
of a Title Defect and/or the Title Defect Amount asserted by Buyer with
respect thereto, in the event that Seller fails to cure or remove the Title
Defect timely asserted by Buyer in accordance with Section 9.2a affecting any
Title Defect Property to Buyers reasonable satisfaction on or before the
second (2nd) Business Day prior to Closing, and such Title Defect is not
waived in writing by Buyer, then, subject to the provisions of Section 9.4,
Seller shall, at its sole option, elect to:

(i) account for the Title Defect Amount(s) for each such Title Defect
Property, subject to the Individual Defect Threshold and Aggregate Defect
Deductible, as a downward adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section
2.2b;

 

(ii) exercise its right to attempt to cure (in whole or in part) the Title
Defect pursuant to Section 9.2c, in which case no adjustment to Purchase
Price at Closing will be made; or

(iii) retain the entirety of any Title Defect Property (and the related
Assets) that is adversely affected by such Title Defect if the Title Defect
Amount asserted by Buyer with respect thereto is greater than fifty percent
(50%) of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property (and the related
Assets), in which event, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by an
amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property, such Title
Defect Property shall not be assigned by Seller to Buyer at Closing and such
Title Defect Property shall no longer be included within the definition of
Assets for any purpose under this Agreement.

c. Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its
sole cost, to address, cure, or remove, on or before ninety (90) days after
the Closing Date (the " _Cure Period_ "), any Title Defects for which Seller
has received a Title Defect Notice from Buyer by the Title Claim Date. If
Seller has provided notice to Buyer, on or before two (2) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, of Sellers intent to attempt to address, cure or remove
such alleged Title Defects within the Cure Period, there shall be no
reduction to the Purchase Price with respect to such alleged Title Defects for
the purposes of Closing. If any Title Defect with respect to which Buyer
provided a Title Defect Notice to Seller is not addressed, cured, or removed
by Seller by the expiration of the Cure Period, the Title Defect Amounts
associated with each such Title Defect shall be accounted for in the final
determination of the Final Payment Amount pursuant to Section 11.1b. If, at
the expiration of the Cure Period, Seller and Buyer cannot agree on (i) the
proper and adequate response to any such Title Defect, (ii) the Title Defect
Amount or (iii) whether the alleged Title Defect constitutes a Title Defect,
such dispute(s) shall be finally and exclusively resolved in accordance with
the provisions of Section 9.5. An election by Seller to attempt to address,
cure, or remove a Title Defect shall be without prejudice to its rights under
Section 9.5 and shall not constitute an admission against interest or a
waiver of Sellers right to dispute the existence, nature or value of, or cost
to cure, the alleged Title Defect. If Seller so elects to cure or remove any
alleged Title Defect, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with Sellers efforts to cure or remove such alleged Title Defect at
Sellers sole cost and expense.

 



40 d. The amount resulting from a Title Defect (the " _Title Defect Amount_ ")
shall be determined as follows:

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, that amount shall be
the Title Defect Amount;

(ii) if the Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge that is
undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be
the amount necessary to be paid to unconditionally remove the Title Defect
from Sellers (and Buyers, as successor in interest to Seller) interest in
the affected Title Defect Property;

 

(iii) if the Title Defect is an Environmental Defect, the Title Defect Amount
shall be the net present value of the cost of the Lowest Cost Response to
correct or remediate the Environmental Defect as required by Environmental
Laws;

(iv) if the Title Defect is a discrepancy between (A) the net revenue
interest for a Well, Lease or DSU and (B) the net revenue interest stated in
_Exhibit A-1_ and _Exhibit A-2_ for such Well, Lease or DSU, the Title Defect
Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Well,
Lease or DSU multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the net
revenue interest decrease for such Title Defect Property and the denominator
of which is the net revenue interest of such Title Defect Property stated in
_Exhibit A-1_ and _Exhibit A-2_ ;

(v) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or
charge upon, or other defect in, title to the Title Defect Property of a type
not described in subsections (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above, the Title Defect
Amount shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the
Title Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect Property adversely
affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the
potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Title
Defect Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller
and such other factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation;

 

(vi) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in any other
Title Defect Amount hereunder, or for which Buyer otherwise receives credit in
the calculation of the Purchase Price;

 

(vii) if a Title Defect relates to a Well, Lease or DSU and affects multiple
Wells, Leases or DSUs, the Title Defect Amount for such Title Defect shall be
determined based on the aggregate effect of such Title Defect on all such
Wells, Leases and DSUs; and

 

(viii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 9, except with
respect to Environmental Defects and Title Defect Amounts determined pursuant
to Section 9.2d(ii), the aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the
effect of all Title Defects upon any Title Defect Property shall not exceed
the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property.

 

e. It is understood and agreed that Environmental Defects shall constitute
Title Defects for purposes of this Agreement and, as such, will be handled in
accordance with, and in all instances will be subject to, the provisions of
this Section 9.2 and the other applicable provisions of this Article 9
(including the thresholds and deductibles set forth below).

 



41 9.3 _Title Benefits._

 

a. Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to deliver to Buyer,
with respect to each Title Benefit, a written notice asserting such Title
Benefit on or before the Title Claim Date. Should Buyer discover any Title
Benefit on or before the Title Claim Date, Buyer shall have an obligation,
within three (3) days of such discovery, but in any case by the Title Claim
Date, to deliver to Seller a notice including (i) a description of the Title
Benefit, (ii) the Lease, Well or DSU affected by the Title Benefit (each a "
_Title Benefit Property_ "), (iii) the dollar amount by which
Buyer reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each Title Benefit Property
is increased by the Title Benefit and the computations and information upon
which Buyers belief is based. Subject to the Individual Benefit Threshold and
Aggregate Benefit Threshold, the Title Benefit Amount shall be used solely to
offset against the Title Defect Amount for the purpose of determining any
downward adjustment to the Purchase Price.

 

b. The amount resulting from a Title Benefit (the " _Title Benefit Amount_ ")
shall be determined as follows:

 

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Benefit Amount, that amount shall
be the Title Benefit Amount;

 

(ii) if the Title Benefit reflects a difference between (A) the net revenue
interest for the affected Lease, Well or DSU and (B) the net revenue interest
stated in _Exhibit A-1_ and _Exhibit A-2_ for such Property, the Title Benefit
Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Benefit
Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the net revenue
interest increase for such Title Benefit Property and the denominator of which
is the net revenue interest of such Title Benefit Property stated in _Exhibit
A-1_ and _Exhibit A-2_ ; and

 

(iii) if the Title Benefit represents a benefit in the ownership or title to
the Title Benefit Property of a type not described in clauses (i) or (ii)
above, the Title Benefit Amount shall be determined by taking into account the
Allocated Value of the Title Benefit Property, the portion of the Title
Benefit Property benefitted by the Title Benefit, the legal effect of the
Title Benefit, the potential economic effect of the Title Benefit over the
life of the Title Benefit Property, the values placed upon the Title Benefit
by Buyer and Seller and such other factors as are necessary to make a
proper evaluation.

9.4 _Limitations on Applicability._

 

a. Except for any rights or remedies of Buyer arising out of the special
warranty of title contained in the Assignment, Bill of Sale and Conveyance
delivered in connection herewith, and the indemnities provided in Article 14
with respect to breaches of the representations and warranties in Sections
3.16, 3.17 and 3.21, (i) this Article 9 shall, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Laws, be the exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with respect
to Title Defects (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Environmental
Defects) and (ii) the right of Buyer or Seller to assert a Title Defect or
Title Benefit, respectively, under this Article 9 shall terminate

 



42  on the Title Claim Date; _provided, however_ , that until the alleged Title
Defect or Title Benefit or Title Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount, as
applicable, is resolved in accordance with this Agreement, there shall be no
termination of Buyers or Sellers rights under this Article 9 with respect to
any alleged Title Defect or Title Benefit or Title Defect Amount or Title
Benefit Amount properly reported on or before the Title Claim Date.

b. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) in no event
shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price for individual Title
Defects (including Title Defects constituting Environmental Defects) that do
not exceed one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars ($125,000) (" _Individual
Defect Threshold_ "); and (ii) in no event shall there be any adjustments to
the Purchase Price for Title Defects (including Title Defects constituting
Environmental Defects) unless the amount of all such Title Defects (assuming
that each such Title Defect exceeds the Individual Defect Threshold), in the
aggregate (excluding any Title Defects cured by Seller) exceeds two percent
(2%) of the Purchase Price (the " _Aggregate Defect Deductible_ "), after
which point, subject to the Individual Defect Threshold, Buyer shall be
entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price only with respect to Title
Defects in excess of such Aggregate Defect Deductible.

 

c. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) in no event
shall there be any offset to Title Defects by individual Title Benefits that
do not exceed one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars ($125,000) ("
_Individual Benefit Threshold_ "); and (ii) in no event shall there be any
offset to Title Defects by any Title Benefits unless the amount of all Title
Benefits (assuming that each such Title Benefit exceeds the Individual Benefit
Threshold), in the aggregate, exceeds two percent (2%) of the Purchase Price
(the " _Aggregate Benefit Threshold_ ").

 

d. Without prejudice to any of the other dates by which performance or the
exercise of rights is due hereunder, or the Parties rights or obligations in
respect thereof, the Parties hereby acknowledge that time is of the essence in
performing their obligations and exercising their rights under this Article 9,
and, as such, that each and every date and time by which such performance
or exercise is due shall be the firm and final date and time.

9.5 _Title Disputes_

 

Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree on all Title Defects and Title
Benefits and Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts, respectively, by
one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing Date. If Seller and Buyer are unable
to agree on Title Defects and Title Benefits and Title Defect Amounts and
Title Benefit Amounts, respectively, by the Closing Date, Buyers good faith
estimate of such amounts shall be used to determine the Closing Payment (with
such amounts constituting downward adjustments in the initial calculation of
the Final Payment Amount pursuant to Section 11.1), except that if
Seller exercises its right to cure any alleged Title Defect(s) and provides
Buyer with notice thereof as set forth in Section 9.2c, no Closing Payment
adjustments shall be made with respect to such Title Defects or Title Defect
Amounts. If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree on an alleged Title
Defect/Title Benefit or Title Defect Amount/Title Benefit Amount prior to
expiration of the Cure Period (the " _Disputed Title Matters_ "), such
dispute(s), and only such dispute(s), shall be exclusively and finally
resolved in accordance with the following provisions of this Section 9.5.
Buyer shall provide to Seller, by not later than the tenth (10th) Business Day
following the Cure Period, a written description of 

 



43  the Disputed Title Matters. By not later than ten (10) Business Days after
Sellers receipt of Buyers written description meeting the requirements of
Section 9.2a or 9.3a, as applicable, together with all supporting
documentation, of the Disputed Title Matters, Seller shall provide to Buyer a
written response setting forth Sellers position with respect to the Disputed
Title Matters together with all supporting documentation.

a. By not later than ten (10) Business Days after Buyers receipt of Sellers
written response to Buyers written description of the Disputed Title
Matters, Buyer or Seller may initiate a non-administered arbitration of any
such dispute(s) conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules
of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent that such rules do not
conflict with the terms of this Section 9.5, by written notice to the other
Party of any Disputed Title Matters (" _Final Disputed Title Matters_ ") not
otherwise resolved or waived that are to be resolved by arbitration (the "
_Title Arbitration Notice_ ").

b. The arbitration shall be held before one arbitrator (the " _Title
Arbitrator_ "), determined as follows: The Title Arbitrator shall be a
disinterested and impartial attorney who has not represented Buyer or Seller
within the five (5) year period preceding the arbitration with at least ten
(10) years experience (A) in the case of Title Defects other than
Environmental Defects, examining oil and gas titles in the State of North
Dakota and (B) in the case of Environmental Defects, as an environmental
attorney practicing in the State of North Dakota. Within five (5) Business
Days following the delivery and receipt of the Title Arbitration Notice,
Seller and Buyer shall each exchange lists of three (3) acceptable, qualified
arbitrators. Within two (2) Business Days following the exchange of lists of
acceptable arbitrators, Seller and Buyer shall select by mutual agreement the
Title Arbitrator from their original lists of three (3) acceptable
arbitrators. If no such agreement is reached within seven (7) Business Days
following the delivery of Title Arbitration Notice, the Denver, Colorado
office of the American Arbitration Association shall select an arbitrator from
the original lists provided by Seller and Buyer to serve as the Title
Arbitrator.

c. Within three (3) Business Days following the selection of the Title
Arbitrator, Buyer and Seller shall submit one copy to the Title Arbitrator of
(i) this Agreement, with specific reference to this Section 9.5 and the other
applicable provisions of this Article 9, (ii) Buyers written description of
the Final Disputed Title Matters, together with the supporting documents that
were provided to Seller, (iii) Sellers written response to Buyers written
description of the Final Disputed Title Matters, together with the supporting
documents that were provided to Buyer and (iv) the Title Arbitration Notice.
Within five (5) Business Days following such submissions, each of Buyer and
Seller may submit one written response to the other Partys submission. The
Title Arbitrator shall resolve the Final Disputed Title Matters based only on
the foregoing submissions. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall have the right to
submit additional documentation to the Title Arbitrator nor to demand
discovery on the other Party.

 

d. The Title Arbitrator shall make its determination by written decision
within thirty (30) days following Sellers or Buyers receipt of the Title
Arbitration Notice (the " _Arbitration Decision_ "). The Arbitration Decision
shall be final and binding upon the Parties, without right of appeal or
challenge except upon the grounds specified in 9 U.S.C. Sections 10(a)(1),
(2) or (4) or 9 U.S.C. Section 11\. In making its determination, the Title
Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in this Article 9. The Title
Arbitrator may consult with and engage disinterested 

 



44  and impartial third parties to advise the Title Arbitrator, but shall
disclose to Buyer and Seller the identities of such consultants. Any such
consultant shall not have worked as an employee or consultant for the Parties
or their Affiliates during the five (5) year period preceding the arbitration
nor have any financial interest in the dispute.

 

e. The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the specific disputed Title Defects and Title Defect Amounts or
Title Benefits and Title Benefit Amounts and shall not be empowered to award
damages, interest or penalties to any Party with respect to any matter.

 

f. Buyer and Seller shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of
preparing and presenting its case to the Title Arbitrator. Seller shall bear
one-half and Buyer shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title
Arbitrator, including any costs incurred by the Title Arbitrator that are
attributable to the consultation of any third party.

 

g. Any disputed Title Benefits and Title Benefit Amounts or Title Defects and
Title Defect Amounts determined to be owed by any Party to the other Party
pursuant to the Arbitration Decision shall be accounted for in the final
determination of the Final Payment Amount, in accordance with and subject to
Article 9, pursuant to Section 11.1. The Arbitration Decision as to the
Final Disputed Title Matters shall be final and binding on the Parties.

h. Except with respect to disputed Title Defects and Title Benefits, which
shall be decided by the Title Arbitrator with reference to the Laws of the
State North Dakota and/or Montana, as applicable, any dispute over the
interpretation or application of this Section 9.5 shall be decided by the
Title Arbitrator with reference to the Laws of the State of Texas without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of
the State of Texas or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Texas.

9.6 _Casualty or Condemnation Loss._

 

If, after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, any
portion of the Assets or the Operators Assets is destroyed by fire or other
casualty or is taken in condemnation or under right of eminent domain (each, a
" _Casualty Loss_ "), Buyer shall nevertheless be required to close and Seller
shall elect by written notice to Buyer prior to Closing to either (a) repair
or restore, or cause Operator, as applicable, to repair or restore, such
assets affected by any Casualty Loss to at least their condition prior to such
Casualty Loss, at Sellers or Operators, as applicable, sole cost, as
promptly as reasonably practicable (which work may extend after the Closing
Date) or (b) remove such portion of the Assets or the Operators Assets, as
applicable, from this Agreement and reduce the Purchase Price by the
Allocated Value of such Asset or such Operators Asset. In each case, Seller
or Operator shall retain all rights to insurance, condemnation proceeds and
other claims against third parties with respect to any Casualty Loss except to
the extent the applicable Parties otherwise agree in writing; _provided,
however_ , that, to the extent that any Casualty Loss is covered by any
insurance or condemnation proceeds, Seller or Operator, as applicable, may
elect, in lieu of repairing the Asset or the Operator Asset affected by
Casualty Loss in accordance with the foregoing clause (a), to assign such
insurance or condemnation proceeds to Buyer at Closing, with any related
deductible to be paid by Seller or Operator to Buyer at Closing, in which
case no reduction in the Purchase Price shall occur.

 



45 9.7 _Definitions Applicable to Title and Environmental Matters._

 

a. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Defensible Title_ " shall mean, as
to each of the Leases, Wells and DSUs, that the title acquired by Buyer:

(i) Entitles Seller (and will entitle Buyer, as successor in interest to
Seller) to receive (after satisfaction of all royalties, overriding
royalties, nonparticipating royalties, net profits interests or other similar
burdens on or measured by production of Hydrocarbons) not less than the net
revenue interests set forth in _Exhibit A-1_ and  _Exhibit A-2_ and a like
share of all Hydrocarbons produced, saved and marketed from the Leases, Wells
and DSUs (including the proceeds thereof) throughout the productive life
thereof, except for any reduction to such net revenue interest caused by
Permitted Encumbrances;

(ii) Obligates Seller (and will obligate Buyer, as successor in interest to
Seller) to bear not more than that percentage of the costs and expenses
related to the maintenance and development of and operations of the working
interests as set forth on _Exhibit A-1_ and _Exhibit A-2_ and a like share
attributable thereto throughout the productive life thereof, except for any
increase caused by Permitted Encumbrances and any increase accompanied by a

(iii) Is free and clear of all liens, security interests, encumbrances,
burdens and claims of any kind, except for Permitted Encumbrances.

b. As used herein, the term " _Permitted Encumbrances_ " shall mean:

similar burdens, whether recorded or unrecorded, that do not operate to
reduce the net revenue interests set forth in _Exhibit A-1_ and _Exhibit A-2_
;

(ii) Division orders and sales contracts terminable without penalty upon no
more than thirty (30) days notice to the purchaser;

 

(iii) Leases, unit agreements, pooling agreements, operating agreements and

aggregate, reduce Sellers net revenue interest in any Property below that
shown in _Exhibit A-1_ and _Exhibit A-2_ or increase Sellers working
interest in any Property above that shown in _Exhibit A-1_ and _Exhibit A-2_
without a proportionate increase in the net revenue interest, or do not
materially affect or impair the ownership, use, value or operation of such
Property; _provided, that_ Specified Material Agreements shall only be
Permitted Encumbrances to the extent that they do not adversely affect or
impair the ownership, use or operation of such Property as currently conducted
by Sellers. 

(iv) Preferential rights to purchase and required third-party consents and
similar agreements with respect to which waivers or consents are obtained
under this Agreement prior to Closing from the appropriate parties or the

a. Not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall prepare and deliver to Buyer (along with appropriate supporting
documentation), using and based upon the best information available to Seller,
a preliminary settlement statement estimating in good faith the Closing
Payment, which statement shall include Sellers estimates of each adjustment
set forth in Section 2.2. Buyer and Seller shall attempt in good faith to
agree with respect to any proposed revisions to the amounts set forth by
Seller in such preliminary settlement statement, and any revisions to such
amounts shall be approved in writing by Seller and Buyer; _provided, however_
, that if Buyer and Seller are unable to reach an agreement prior to the
Closing Date as to any such amount, Sellers statement of such amount shall
control the calculation of the Closing Payment so long as such statement was
delivered to Buyer in accordance with this Agreement. Sellers preliminary
settlement statement, as may be adjusted by the written agreement of Seller
and Buyer pursuant to this Section 11.1 shall be referred to herein as the "
_Preliminary Settlement Statement_ ".

b. On or before one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing Date, Seller
with the assistance of Buyers staff and with access to such records as
necessary, shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a final settlement statement
(the " _Final Settlement Statement_ ") setting forth (i) each adjustment to

calculation of the Closing Payment pursuant to Section 2.1a, that was not
finally determined as of the Closing, and showing the calculation of each
such amount and the resulting Purchase Price as finally adjusted (the " _Final
Payment Amount_ "). As soon as practicable after receipt of Sellers proposed
Final Settlement Statement, but in no event more than thirty (30) days after
receipt of Sellers proposed Final Settlement Statement, Buyer shall deliver
to Seller a written report containing any changes that Buyer proposes to make
to the Final Settlement Statement. Buyers failure to deliver to Seller a
written report detailing changes to the proposed Final Settlement Statement by
that date shall be deemed an acceptance by Buyer of the Final Settlement
Statement as submitted by Seller. The Parties shall attempt in good faith to
agree with respect to the changes proposed by Buyer, if any, no later than
fifteen (15) days after receipt by Seller of Buyers comments on the proposed
Final Settlement Statement. The date upon which such agreement is reached or
upon which the Final Payment Amount is established shall be called the "
_Final Settlement Date_ ". If the Final Payment Amount is more than the
Closing Payment, Buyer shall pay Seller the amount of such difference
pursuant to Section 2.1. If the Final Payment Amount is less than the Closing
Payment, Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of such difference. Any such
payment by Buyer or Seller shall be by wire transfer in immediately
available funds within five (5) Business Days after the Final Settlement
Date.

 



54 11.2 _Dispute Resolution._

 

If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve any dispute concerning the Final
Settlement Statement or Final Payment Amount on or before ninety (90) days
after the Final Settlement Statement is received by Buyer, such dispute shall
be finally determined by binding arbitration by a single arbitrator (the "
_Arbitrator_ "), pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association, and the Arbitrators determination shall be final and
binding upon Seller and Buyer by written notice to the other Party ("
_Arbitration Notice_ "). Within three (3) Business Days following a Partys
receipt of either of the other Parties Arbitration Notice, Seller and Buyer
shall each exchange lists of three (3) acceptable, qualified arbitrators.
Within three (3) Business Days following the exchange of lists of acceptable
arbitrators, Seller and Buyer shall select by mutual agreement the Arbitrator
from their original lists of three (3) acceptable arbitrators. If no such
agreement is reached within seven (7) Business Days following the delivery of
an Arbitration Notice, the Dallas, Texas office of the American Arbitration
Association shall select an arbitrator from the original lists provided by
Seller and Buyer to serve as the Arbitrator. The arbitration proceedings shall
be held in Dallas, Texas. The Arbitrator shall be directed to make its
determination within thirty (30) days after submission of the matters in
dispute to the Arbitrator, and such determination shall be final and binding
upon the Parties, without right of appeal. The fees charged by the Arbitrator
for making a determination under this Section 11.2 shall be paid one-half by
Buyer and one-half by Seller.

 

11.3 _Proceeds and Invoices For Property Expenses Received After the Final
Settlement Date._

three (3) Business Days to Buyer by Seller, or if already paid by Seller,
invoiced by Seller to Buyer.

The provisions of this Section 11.3 with respect to Sellers obligation to

contractual restrictions on disclosure or transfer, Seller agrees to use
reasonable efforts to obtain the waiver of such contractual restrictions prior

any money in connection with obtaining such waivers. Should Buyer need access
to any Records not transferred hereunder, due to contractual restrictions
mentioned above, for filing with regulatory bodies, Buyer shall, except to the

by Operator holding monies payable to royalty owners, mineral owners and other

unable to pay because of title defects, or because such Persons cannot be
located or their identity is unknown or other causes. Buyer will assume full
and complete responsibility and liability for proper handling and payment of
such suspended amounts to the extent of the amount credited by Seller to Buyer
in the Closing Payment and all accounts and for all monies payable to royalty
owners, mineral owners and other Persons with an interest in production of
Hydrocarbons and of maintaining any necessary suspense accounts relating to

Buyer and Seller shall reasonably cooperate with each other in seeking to
obtain such required authorization.

 

11.11 _Letters in Lieu._

e. All of the information provided by Seller and Operator pursuant to this

and forever discharges each member of the Seller Indemnified Parties from any
and all legal or administrative proceedings, Losses, interest, or causes of
action whatsoever, in Law or in equity, known or unknown, which any member of

12.1 _Termination._

This Agreement and the Transactions may be terminated in the following
instances:

a. By the mutual prior written consent of RoDa, Zeneco, Operator and Buyer:

b. By Buyer, if Seller or Operator shall have failed to perform or observe in
any material respect, or is in material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which
failure to perform, observe or breach (i) would give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in Sections 10.3a, 10.3b or 10.3c and (ii)(A) is not
capable of being satisfied or cured by the Drop-Dead Date or (B) if capable of
being satisfied or cured, is not satisfied or cured by seven (7) Business Days
following receipt by Seller of written notice stating Buyers intention to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 12.1b and the basis for such
termination;

c. By RoDa or Zeneco, if Buyer shall have failed to perform or observe in any
material respect, or is in material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which
failure to perform, observe or breach (i) would give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in Sections 10.4a or 10.4b and (ii)(A) is not capable of
being satisfied or cured by the Drop-Dead Date or (B) if capable of being
satisfied or cured, is not satisfied or cured by seven (7) Business Days
following receipt by Buyer of written notice stating the intention of RoDa and
Zeneco to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 12.1c and the
basis for such termination;

 



58 d. By RoDa or Zeneco on the one hand, or Buyer on the other hand, if Closing
has not occurred on or before 5:00 pm local time in Houston, Texas on October
25, 2013; _provided that_ , such date shall be extended, at the written
request of RoDa, Zeneco or Buyer, for a period of up to an additional ten (10)
days in the event that approval under the HSR Act has not yet been obtained
(as extended, the " _Drop-Dead Date_ "); _provided, further,_ that, the Party
seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 12.1d shall not
have breached its obligations hereunder in any manner that shall have
proximately caused the failure to consummate the Closing on or before the
Drop-Dead Date;

 

e. By RoDa or Zeneco on the one hand, or Buyer on the other hand, if the sum
of the Purchase Price adjustments under Sections 2.2b(vi), 2.2b(vii),
2.2b(viii) and 2.2b(ix), without duplication, exceeds nine percent (9%) of the
Purchase Price; or

f. By RoDa or Zeneco on the one hand, or Buyer on the other hand, if any
Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, judgment or decree or taken
any other action permanently restraining, enjoining, prohibiting or
invalidating the consummation of the Transactions, and such order, judgment,
decree or action shall become final and non-appealable; _provided that_ the
Party seeking to terminate this Agreement under this Section 12.1f shall have
used commercially reasonable efforts to remove such order, judgment, decree
or action; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 12.1f shall not be available to a Party if the
issuance of such final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or action was
proximately caused by the failure of such Party to perform any of its
obligations under this Agreement.

12.2 _Return or Forfeiture of Deposit._

If this Agreement is terminated (a) in accordance with Section 12.1d or 12.1f
above, and Buyer was not entitled to exercise such termination right
hereunder at the time of such termination (unless, in the case of Section
12.1d, at the time of such termination Buyer had the bona fide right to
exercise the termination right under Section 12.1e), or (b) in accordance
with Section 12.1c and Buyer was not entitled to exercise its termination
right under Section 12.1b at the time of such termination (unless at such time
(i) Buyer had the bona fide right to exercise the termination right in
Section 12.1e or (ii) the termination right in Section 12.1f was exercisable
by Buyer and not by Seller) then, in either case (a) or (b), Buyer shall
forfeit and immediately authorize the Deposit Escrow Agent to deliver the
Deposit to Seller as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty (it being agreed
by the parties that damages from Buyers actions may at that time be difficult
to ascertain) such forfeiture being Sellers sole and exclusive remedy, and
whereupon this Agreement will terminate and be of no further force and effect
except for Section 12.3 below. If this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with Section 12.1a above, the mutual written consent of the Parties shall
provide for the release of the Deposit upon such termination. If this
Agreement is terminated for any reason in accordance with Section 12.1 (other
than the reasons set forth in the immediately preceding two sentences), Seller
shall immediately authorize the Deposit Escrow Agent to refund to Buyer the
Deposit, whereupon this Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force
and effect except for Section 12.3 below. If Buyer is (i) ready, willing and
able to proceed to Closing and (ii) not in a material breach of any terms of
this Agreement, and Seller has failed to perform or observe in any material
respect its covenants and agreements or is in breach of its representations
and warranties hereunder, then Buyer, in lieu of termination of this
Agreement, shall be entitled to seek specific performance of this Agreement,
it being specifically agreed that monetary damages may not be sufficient to
compensate Buyer; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not constitute an
election of remedies and shall not limit Buyers right to exercise any other
remedies available to it at law or in equity.

 



59 12.3 _Return of Information; Confidentiality._

 

If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing:

 

a. Buyer shall destroy all information and material and all copies thereof
delivered to Buyer by Seller and/or its representatives in regard to the
Assets or otherwise pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; and

b. The Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with
its terms, but for a period ending on the date twelve (12) months after the
Closing Date specified in Section 10.1.

12.4  _Liabilities Prior to Closing or Termination._

Until Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement, if this Agreement
is breached, unless otherwise provided herein, nothing contained herein shall
be construed to limit Sellers or Buyers legal or equitable remedies, and
each Party shall be entitled to all of such remedies, including damages for
the breach or failure of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein and the right to enforce specific performance (without the
necessity of posting bonds or other security) of this Agreement, the
assignments and certificates to be executed pursuant thereto, and the
transactions contemplated hereunder and thereunder (including, any liability
for Losses incurred as a result of a breach by a Party of such
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other
obligations occurring prior to such termination); _provided_ , _that_ in no
event shall any Party be liable to the other Parties for any exemplary,
punitive, special, indirect, consequential, loss of profits, remote or
speculative damages. This Section 12.4 shall survive termination of this
Agreement.

ARTICLE 13

 

TAXES

13.1 _Apportionment of Taxes: General Allocation._

All taxes, including, excise taxes, state severance taxes, ad valorem taxes,
property taxes, production taxes, net profits taxes, and any other local,
state and/or federal taxes or assessments, based upon or measured by the
ownership of the Assets or the Operators Assets or the production of
Hydrocarbons therefrom or the receipt of proceeds therefrom, but, for the
avoidance of doubt, excluding any and all income taxes (" _Taxes_ "), for all
taxable periods during Sellers or Operators period of ownership prior to the
Effective Time shall remain Sellers or Operators responsibility, as
applicable, and all deductions, credits, and refunds pertaining to such Taxes
attributable to taxable periods prior to the Effective Time, no matter when
received, shall belong to Seller or Operator, as applicable. All Taxes
for all taxable periods from and after the Effective Time shall be the
responsibility of Buyer. If ad valorem, property or similar Taxes are assessed
for any period that includes the Effective Time, they shall be apportioned to
Seller based on the number of days in the applicable period falling before
the Effective Time and to Buyer based on the number of days falling on or
after the Effective Time. Production Taxes and

 



60  similar Taxes measured by units of production, and severance Taxes, shall be
apportioned to Seller based on the amount of Hydrocarbons actually produced,
purchased or sold, as applicable, before the Effective Time and to Buyer
based on the amount of Hydrocarbons actually produced, purchased or sold, as
applicable, on or after the Effective Time. The amount of Taxes, if any,
apportioned to either Party shall be accounted for to the extent known in the
adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.2 at Closing and shall
be finally reconciled in the Final Settlement Statement pursuant to Section
11.1 based on then-current information. To the extent not otherwise taken
into account as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, Buyer or Seller, as
appropriate, shall pay to the other Party, within 15 days of notice, the
amount of any Taxes for which it is responsible pursuant to this Section
13.1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 13.1 shall not apply to
income, franchise, corporate, business and occupation, business license and
similar Taxes, and Tax returns therefor, which shall be borne, paid and filed
by the Party responsible for such Taxes under applicable Law.

13.2 _Transfer Taxes._

 

The Purchase Price excludes, and Buyer shall be liable for, any Transfer Taxes
required to be paid in connection with the sale of the Assets and Operators
Assets pursuant to this Agreement. " _Transfer Taxes_ " means any sales, use,
excise, stock, stamp, documentary, filing, recording, registration,
authorization and similar taxes, fees and charges.

 

13.3 _Tax Reports and Returns._

For Tax periods in which the Effective Time occurs, Seller agrees to forward
to Buyer, within 15 days of receipt, copies of any tax reports and returns
received by Seller after Closing and to provide Buyer with any information
Seller has that is reasonably necessary for Buyer to file any required Tax
reports and returns related to the Assets. Buyer agrees to file all tax
returns and reports applicable to the Assets that Buyer is required to file
after the Closing and, subject to the provisions of Section 13.1, to pay all
Taxes payable with respect to the Assets and Operators Assets.

13.4 _Tax Form 8594._

 

For federal income tax purposes, the Parties agree that the Purchase Price
shall be allocated among the Assets and Operators Assets transferred to
Buyer in accordance with the principles of Code Section 1060 and to each Asset
on a property by property (e.g., lease by lease, well by well, etc.) basis
(the " _Tax Allocations_ "). Buyer agrees to provide Seller and Operator with
a copy of such proposed Code Section 1060 allocation within 60 days after
Closing; _provided, however_ , that Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide a proposed allocation of value on a leasehold and acreage
basis for purposes of the property by property allocation within 5 days before
Closing. Buyer, Seller and Operator shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
any disagreement regarding the Tax Allocations within 180 days after Closing,
and, after the resolution of any such disputes and after taking into account
any adjustments agreed by the Parties acting in good faith to account for
subsequent adjustments to the Purchase Price, agree that (i) the Tax
Allocations, if agreed, shall be used by Seller, Operator and Buyer as the
basis for reporting asset values and other items for purposes of all federal,
state and local Tax returns, including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 and
(ii) neither Buyer, Seller or Operator, 

 



61  nor their Affiliates, will take positions inconsistent with such Tax
Allocations in notices to Governmental Entities, in audit or other proceedings
with respect to Taxes, in notices to preferential purchase right holders, or
in other documents or notices relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except as required by applicable Law.

 

13.5 _Indemnification Payments._

Buyer and Seller agree to treat any payments made pursuant to the
indemnification provisions of this Agreement as adjustments to the Purchase
Price for Tax purposes.

14.4 _Indemnification._

After the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall indemnify each other as follows:

a. _Seller s Indemnification of Buyer_. Subject to the limitations set forth
herein, each Seller shall defend, indemnify, save and hold harmless Buyer, its

attributable to production prior to the Effective Time (except to the extent

(and not jointly) obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties for
the Losses relating to or resulting from its own Party-Specific Breaches
(subject to the other terms and limitations herein).

b.  _Buyer s Indemnification of Seller_. Subject to the limitations set

OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE INDEMNIFIED
PERSONS SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER
FAULT, EXCEPT FOR GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.

 

d. _Survival_. The obligations set forth in this Section 14.4 shall survive
the Closing in accordance with Section 15.14.

 

14.5 _Procedure._

The indemnification obligations contained in Section 14.4 shall be
implemented as follows:

a. _Claim Notice_. The Party seeking indemnification under the terms of this
Agreement (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall submit a written " _Claim
Notice_ " to the other Party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") which shall state:
(i) the amount of each payment claimed by an Indemnified Party to be owing,
(ii) the basis for such claim, with supporting documentation, and (iii) a list
identifying to the extent reasonably possible each separate item of Loss for
which payment is so claimed. The amount claimed shall be paid by the
Indemnifying Party to the extent required herein within ten (10) days after
receipt of the Claim Notice, or after the amount of such payment has been
finally established, whichever last occurs.

 



65 b. _Information_. Within twenty (20) days after the Indemnified Party receives
notice of a claim or legal action brought by any third party that may result
in a Loss for which indemnification may be sought under this Article 14 ("
_Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall give written notice of
such Third Party Claim to the Indemnifying Party, together with copies of all
pleadings and other information with respect to such Third Party Claim;
provided that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice of a Third
Party Claim as provided in this Section 14.5b shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations to provide indemnity except to the
extent such failure results in insufficient time being available to permit the
Indemnifying Party to effectively defend against the Third Party Claim or
otherwise materially prejudices the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend
against the Third Party Claim. At the election of the Indemnifying Party made
within sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice, the Indemnified
Party shall permit the Indemnifying Party to assume control of such Third
Party Claim (to the extent only that such Third Party Claim, legal action or
other matter relates to a Loss for which the Indemnifying Party is liable),
including the determination of all appropriate actions, the negotiation of
settlements on behalf of the Indemnified Party, and the conduct of litigation
through attorneys of the Indemnifying Partys choice; _provided, however_ ,
that (i) no compromise or settlement thereof or consent to any admission or
the entry of any judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim may be
effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified Partys written
consent unless the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in
full by the Indemnifying Party (and no injunctive or other equitable relief is
imposed upon the Indemnified Party) and there is an unconditional provision
whereby each plaintiff or claimant in such Third Party Claim releases the
Indemnified Party from all liability with respect thereto and (ii) the
Indemnified Party shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or
settlement thereof effected without its written consent. If the Indemnifying
Party elects to assume control of a Third Party Claim or legal action, (A)
any expense incurred by the Indemnified Party thereafter for investigation or
defense of the matter shall be borne by the Indemnified Party, and (B) the
Indemnified Party shall give all reasonable information and assistance, other
than pecuniary, that the Indemnifying Party shall deem necessary to the proper
defense of such Third Party Claim, legal action, or other matter. In the
absence of such an election, the Indemnified Party will use its reasonable
efforts to defend, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, any Third Party Claim,
legal action or other matter to which such other Partys indemnification under
this Section 14.5 applies until the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense,
and, if the Indemnifying Party fails to assume such defense within the time
period provided above, settle the same in the Indemnified Partys reasonable
discretion at the Indemnifying Partys expense, but only if such Indemnifying
Party is determined to have had an obligation to indemnify such Indemnified
Party pursuant to Article 14; _provided, however_ , that (1) no compromise or
settlement thereof or consent to any admission or the entry of any judgment
with respect to such Third Party Claim may be effected by the Indemnified
Party without the Indemnifying Partys written consent unless the sole relief
provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnified Party
(and no injunctive or other equitable relief is imposed upon the Indemnifying
Party) and there is an unconditional provision whereby each plaintiff or
claimant in such Third Party Claim releases the Indemnifying Party from
all liability with respect thereto and (2) the Indemnifying Party shall have
no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement thereof effected
without its written consent. If such a Third Party Claim requires immediate
action, both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party will cooperate
in good faith to take appropriate action so as not to jeopardize defense of
such Third Party Claim or either partys position with respect to such Third
Party Claim.

 



66 14.6 _Limitation on Claims._

 

a. Neither Party shall be required to indemnify any Indemnified Parties for
any individual Claim of less than two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000)
(the " _Individual Deductible_ ").

b. Seller shall not be required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified
Parties with respect to any Claim unless, and then only to the extent that,
the aggregate amount of such Losses exceeds one and three-fourths percent
(1.75%) of the Purchase Price (the " _Claims Threshold_ ").

 

c. Seller shall not be required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties to
the extent that the aggregate amount of all Claims for which Seller is
required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties exceeds five percent (5%)
of the Purchase Price (the " _Indemnity Cap_ ") (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall include any cash paid from the Indemnity Escrow Account with
respect to such Claims);

_provided, however_ , that the following Claims (collectively, the " _Core
Claims_ ") shall not be subject to the Individual Deductible, the Claims
Threshold or the Indemnity Cap: (i) Claims with respect to Taxes; (ii) Claims
with respect to breach by Seller of the representations and warranties in the
Fundamental Representations; (iii) Claims in respect of the Seller Retained
Liabilities; and (iv) Claims with respect to breach by Seller of the special
warranty of title contained in the Assignment, Bill of Sale and Conveyance;
_provided, further_ , that, with respect to Claims under Section 14.4a(vi)
and (vii), the amount of any Loss is subject to the Indemnity Cap to the
extent that such amount is not recoverable under the applicable insurance
policies of Seller and Operator. Claims with respect to breach by Buyer of
the representations and warranties in Sections 5.1 through 5.5 and Section
5.10 and Claims against Buyer for Assumed Liabilities shall not be subject to
the Individual Deductible. Notwithstanding the foregoing exceptions to the
Indemnity Cap, in no event shall Seller have liability, in the aggregate,
under this Agreement in excess of the Purchase Price.

d. Any Claim for indemnification by any Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller
Indemnified Party under Article 14 shall be made in writing as provided herein
on or before the expiration of the applicable Survival Period as provided in
Section 15.14;  _provided, however_ , there shall be no termination of any
bona fide claim for which a Claim Notice is given under this Agreement prior
to the expiration of the applicable Survival Period.

 

e. Any liability for indemnification under this Agreement shall be determined
without duplication of (i) recovery by reason of the state of facts (A)
giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or (B) taken into account in
determining any adjustment to the Purchase Price under Section 2.2; and (ii)
any insurance proceeds realized by and paid to such Indemnified Parties in
respect of such claim.

f. Subject to Sections 15.11 and 15.12, any disputes or liabilities arising
under any joint operating agreement relating to the Assets in effect prior to
the Closing Date, the joint operating agreement delivered at Closing by Buyer
and Operator, the Amendment, and the 

 



67  Stipulations as amended by the Amendment, shall be governed by and subject
to the terms of such agreements (as applicable) and applicable Laws, and shall
in no event be subject to any Claim of indemnification under the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

g. For the purpose of determining the amount of any Losses that are
the subject matter of a Claim (and not for determining whether any breach has
occurred), the representations, warranties and covenants in this Agreement
shall be read without regard and without giving effect to any materiality
or Material Adverse Effect standard or qualification contained in such
representation, warranty or covenant; _provided, however,_ that for purposes
of determining whether any breach has occurred with respect to any breach of
the representations in Sections 3.11, 3.12, 3.17, 3.21 and 3.27, materiality
qualifications as to matters qualified by "knowledge" shall be interpreted to
mean matters involving at least five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000).

 

14.7 _Escrow Claims._

a. The Indemnity Escrow Fund shall be the Buyer Indemnified Parties sole
recourse and exclusive source of funds for satisfaction of all Claims pursuant
to Section 14.4a (except for any Core Claims) in connection with, arising out
of or resulting from the subject matter of this Agreement and the
Transactions. With respect to the Core Claims, Buyer may, at its option,
subject to the provisions and limitations of this Agreement, proceed directly
against RoDa or Zeneco, as the case may be, or proceed against the Indemnity
Escrow Fund, which shall not considered to be an election of remedies.

b. Except to the extent of the amounts provided in the Indemnity Escrow Fund
and for any breach based on fraud or intentional misrepresentation, Seller
shall not under any circumstance have any liability or obligation for the
satisfaction of any Claims in connection with, arising out of or resulting
from the subject matter of this Agreement and the Transactions, except solely
for Core Claims. Seller shall not under any circumstance have any liability or
obligation for the satisfaction of any Core Claims except to the extent
the amount of such Core Claims exceeds the then-remaining Indemnity Escrow
Fund remaining after satisfaction of all Claims other than Core Claims timely
asserted, and which are paid from such remaining Indemnity Escrow Fund. A
Sellers share of the Indemnity Escrow Fund shall be reduced, dollar for
dollar, in respect of disbursements made to Buyer Indemnified Parties to
satisfy such Sellers Party-Specific Breaches. A Seller shall have a right of
contribution against the other Seller to the extent that its share of the
Indemnity Escrow Fund is used to satisfy (i) any Claim in respect of such
other Sellers Party-Specific Breaches and/or (ii) any portion of such other
Sellers pro rata share of any other Claim. 

c. In the event Seller does not dispute any claim for indemnification made by
any Buyer Indemnified Party, Seller and Buyer shall provide written
instructions to the Indemnity Escrow Agent in accordance with the Indemnity
Escrow Agreement to disburse to the applicable member(s) of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties the amount of the undisputed claim, to the extent of
available Indemnity Escrow Funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account. In the
event Seller does dispute any claim for indemnification made by any member of
the Buyer Indemnified Parties, then upon final determination of liability (or
a settlement between the applicable parties) with respect to such claim, the
Parties shall provide written instructions to the Indemnity Escrow

 



68  Agent to disburse to the applicable member(s) of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties the amount determined by such final determination or settlement to be
due, to the extent of available Indemnity Escrow Funds in the Indemnity
Escrow Account.

d. On the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date, the Parties shall
instruct the Indemnity Escrow Agent to release to Seller the difference
between the then existing amount of the Indemnity Escrow Fund and the
aggregate amount of all unsatisfied claims for indemnification that any member
of the Buyer Indemnified Parties has made on or before the date of such first
(1st) anniversary pursuant to this Article 14. Any amount remaining in the
Indemnity Escrow Fund for such unsatisfied claims shall remain in escrow until
a final determination of liability (or a settlement between the parties) with
respect to such claims is made pursuant to this Agreement.

14.8 _No Insurance; Subrogation._

 

To the extent of the indemnification obligations in this Agreement, Buyer and
Seller hereby waive for themselves, their successors and assigns, including
any insurers, any rights to subrogation for Losses for which each of them is
respectively liable or against which each respectively indemnifies the other,
and, if required by applicable policies, Buyer and Seller shall obtain waiver
of such subrogation from their respective insurers.

14.9 _Reservation as to Non-Parties._

 

Nothing in this Agreement is intended to limit or otherwise waive any recourse
Buyer or Seller may have against any Person not a party to this Agreement for
any obligations or liabilities that may be incurred with respect to the
Assets.

14.10 _Exclusive Remedy._

 

The sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer and Seller with respect to the Assets
shall be pursuant to the express provisions of this Agreement and the
assignments executed pursuant thereto. Without limitation of the foregoing, if
the Closing occurs, the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer and Seller, for any
and all: (a) claims relating to any representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements that are contained in this Agreement, (b) other claims
pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement, and (c) other claims
relating to the Assets and the purchase and sale thereof, shall be any right
to indemnification from such claims that is expressly provided in this
Agreement, and if no such right of indemnification is expressly provided, then
such claims are hereby waived to the fullest extent permitted by law (except
for any breach based on fraud or intentional misrepresentation and except for
the representations and warranties made by Operator in Article 4). If the
Closing occurs, Buyer and Seller shall also be deemed to have waived, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, any right to contribution against the other
(including any contribution claim arising under any applicable Environmental
Law) and any and all other rights, claims and causes of action it may have
against the other arising under or based on any federal, state or
local statutes, law, ordinance, rule or regulation or common law or
otherwise.

 



69 14.11 _Waiver of Right to Rescission._

 

Buyer and Seller acknowledge that the payment of money, as limited by the
terms of this Agreement, shall be adequate compensation for breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein or for any
other claim arising in connection with or with respect to the Transactions.
Buyer and Seller waive any right to rescind this Agreement, the sale of the
Assets to Buyer, or any of the Transactions.

14.12 _Anti-Indemnity Statute Limitation._

 

Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, to the extent, if at
all, that North Dakota or Montana statutes are applicable, no provision of
this Agreement shall be construed or applied to require any Indemnifying Party
to indemnify any Indemnified Party against loss or liability for damages for
(i) death or bodily injury to persons, (ii) injury to property or (iii) any
other loss, damage or expense arising under (i) or (ii) from the sole or
concurrent negligence of such Indemnified Party or its agents or employees,
the sole or concurrent negligence of an independent contractor who
is directly responsible to such Indemnified Party, or any accident that
occurs in operations carried on at the direction or under the supervision of
such Indemnified Party or an employee or representative of such Indemnified
Party or in accordance with methods and means specified by such Indemnified
Party of employees or representatives of such Indemnified Party.
