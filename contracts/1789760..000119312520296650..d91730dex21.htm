_Section_ __ _ 3.03_ _(c)_ with respect to the SPAC Class A Common Stock
issued pursuant to the Merger for any shares of SPAC Class A Common Stock with
a record and payment date after the Merger Effective Time and prior to the

23

    

 payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.03(h)_ (all such Holdco Ordinary
Shares and cash, together with the amount any dividends or distributions
contemplated pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.03(c)_, being hereinafter
referred to, collectively, as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Holdco shall cause the
Exchange Agent pursuant to irrevocable instructions, to deliver the Merger
Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement.
Except as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 3.03_ hereof, the Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Agent shall invest the
cash portion of the Exchange Fund as directed by Holdco; _provided_ that such
investments shall be in obligations, funds or accounts typical for (including
having liquidity typical for) transactions of this nature. To the extent that
there are losses or any diminution of value with respect to such investments,
or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any other reason below the level required
to make prompt cash payment of any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.03(c)_ and any cash in lieu of any fractional
shares payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.03(h)_, Holdco shall promptly
replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund lost through
such investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at
all times maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash payments. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part
of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under
this _Section_ __ _ 3.03(a)_ shall be promptly returned to Holdco.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the Merger
Effective Time, Holdco shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of SPAC Common Stock
(including shares of SPAC Class A Common Stock resulting from the SPAC Class B
Conversion) entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.02_ a letter of transmittal, which shall be in a form
reasonably acceptable to SPAC and the Company (the " _Letter of Transmitta_
l") and shall specify (i) that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the certificates evidencing such SPAC Common Stock (collectively,
the " _Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent; and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates pursuant to the Letter of Transmittal. Within
five (5) Business Days after the surrender to the Exchange Agent of all
Certificates held by such holder for cancellation, together with a Letter of
Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, and Holdco shall cause the Exchange Agent to
deliver (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) an amount in immediately
available funds (or, if no wire transfer instructions are provided, a check)
equal to (A) any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.03(h)_ _plus_ (B) any unpaid non-stock dividends and any other dividends or
other distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 3.03(c)_ in accordance with the provisions of this _Section_
__ _ 3.03_, and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender
of the Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _
3.03_, each Certificate entitled to receive a portion of the Merger
Consideration in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 3.02_ shall be deemed at
all times after the Merger Effective Time, as the case may be, to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration that
such holder is entitled to receive in accordance with the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 3.02_.

 



24

    

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of SPAC Common Stock_.
No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Merger
Effective Time with respect to the SPAC Common Stock with a record date after
the Merger Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of SPAC Class A Common Stock
(including shares of SPAC Class A Common Stock resulting from the SPAC Class B
Conversion) represented thereby until the holder of such Certificate shall
surrender such Certificate in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 3.03_.
Subject to the effect of escheat, tax or other applicable Laws, following
surrender of any such Certificate, SPAC shall pay or cause to be paid to the
holder of the certificates representing shares of SPAC Common Stock
(including shares of SPAC Class A Common Stock resulting from the SPAC Class B
Conversion) issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly, but
in any event within five (5) Business Days of such surrender, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Merger Effective
Time and theretofore paid with respect to such shares of SPAC Common Stock,
and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions, with a record date after the Merger Effective Time but prior to
surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender, payable with respect
to such shares of SPAC Common Stock.

 

(d) The Merger Consideration payable upon conversion of the SPAC Class A
Common Stock (including shares of SPAC Class A Common Stock resulting from
the SPAC Class B Conversion) in accordance with the terms hereof, shall be
deemed to have been paid and issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of SPAC Common Stock (including shares of SPAC
Class A Common Stock resulting from the conversion of the SPAC Class B Common
Stock).

(e)  _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to SPAC
Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Merger
Effective Time.

 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of SPAC Common Stock with respect to the
Merger Consideration for one (1) year after the Merger Effective Time shall be
delivered to Holdco, and any holders of SPAC Common Stock (including shares of
SPAC Class A Common Stock resulting from the SPAC Class B Conversion) who
have not theretofore complied with this _Section_ __ _ 3.03_ shall thereafter
look only to Holdco for the Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund with respect to the Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by holders
of SPAC Common Stock (including shares of SPAC Class A Common Stock resulting
from the conversion of the SPAC Class B Conversion), as may be applicable, as
of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any government entity shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Holdco free and
clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

(g) _No Liability_. None of the Exchange Agent, SPAC, Holdco, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective affiliates shall be liable to any
holder of SPAC Common Stock for any such SPAC Common Stock (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto) or cash delivered to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law in accordance with
this _Section_ __ _ 3.03_.

 



25

    

(h) _Fractional Shares_. __ Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no fractional shares of Holdco Ordinary Shares will be issued, and
any holder of SPAC Common Stock entitled to receive a fractional share of
Holdco Ordinary Shares but for this _Section_ __ _ 3.03(h)_ shall
be entitled to receive a cash payment in lieu thereof, which payment shall be
calculated by the Exchange Agent and shall represent such holders
proportionate interest in a share of Holdco Ordinary Shares based on the
Average SPAC Share Price. 

(i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
Merger Consideration, as the case may be, that such holder is otherwise
entitled to receive pursuant to, and in accordance with, the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 3.02_.

 

SECTION 3.04 _Treatment of Company Options and Restricted Shares_. Pursuant to
the terms of the applicable Company Equity Plan or other terms and conditions
governing each Company Equity Awards and as specified on the Rollover
Spreadsheet:

(a)  _Company Options_. Each Company Option, whether vested or unvested, that
is issued immediately prior to the Second Exchange Effective Time shall, as of
the Second Exchange Effective Time, automatically and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by Holdco (as assumed, a "
_Converted Option Award_ ") in such a manner by which such Converted Option
Award shall represent an option award (i) exercisable for the aggregate number
of Holdco Ordinary Shares as set forth opposite the name of each holder
thereof on the Rollover Spreadsheet, equal to the product (rounded down to the
nearest whole number) of (x) the number of Company Ordinary Shares underlying
the Company Options immediately prior to the Second Exchange Effective Time
and (y) the Exchange Ratio; and (ii) with a price per share exercise price set
forth on _Section_ __ _ 3.04(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Each
Converted Option Award shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and
conditions (including any vesting requirements) set forth under the applicable
award agreement in effect immediately prior to the Second Exchange Effective
Time.

 

(b) _Company Restricted Shares_. Each Company Restricted Share that is issued
immediately prior to the Second Exchange Effective Time shall, as of the

part of the holder thereof, be exchanged against the aggregate number of
Holdco Restricted Shares in the manner as provided in  _Section_ __ _
3.01(a)_ of this Agreement as set forth opposite the name of each holder
thereof on the Payment Spreadsheet.

 

SECTION 3.05 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Merger Effective Time, following
the recordation of the Transactions in the share records of Holdco, the stock
transfer books of SPAC shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of SPAC Common Stock thereafter on the records of
SPAC. From and after the Merger Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates representing SPAC Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Merger Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
SPAC Common Stock, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by
applicable Law. On or after the Merger Effective Time, any Certificates
presented to the Exchange Agent or Holdco for any reason shall be converted
into the Merger Consideration in accordance with the provisions of _Section_
__ _ 3.02_.

 



26

    

SECTION 3.06 _SPAC Warrants_. At the Merger Effective Time, each SPAC
Warrant that is outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time
shall, pursuant to the SPAC Warrant Agreement, cease to represent a right to
acquire the number of shares of SPAC Class A Common Stock set forth in such
SPAC Warrant and shall be converted in accordance with the terms of such SPAC
Warrant Agreement, at the Merger Effective Time, into a right to acquire one
(1) Holdco Ordinary Share (a " _Holdco Warrant_ " and collectively, the "
_Holdco Warrants_ ") on substantially the same terms as were in effect
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time under the terms of the SPAC
Warrant Agreement. The parties hereof shall take all lawful action to effect
the aforesaid provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 3.06_, including causing the
SPAC Warrant Agreement to be amended or amended and restated to the extent
necessary to give effect to this _Section_ __ _ 3.06_, including adding

such other applicable form as the Company and SPAC may agree (as amended or
supplemented from time to time, the " _Registration Statement_ "), in which
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included, in connection with the
registration under the Securities Act of the Holdco Ordinary Shares and Holdco
Warrants to be issued in the Merger. Each Party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
to comply with the applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC,
including providing any necessary opinions of counsel, to have the
Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly
as practicable after such filing, and to keep the Registration Statement
effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Transactions. Each of
Holdco, the Company and SPAC shall furnish all information as may be
reasonably requested by the others in connection with any such action and the
preparation, filing and distribution of the Registration Statement and the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party shall use
any such information for any purposes other than those contemplated by this
Agreement unless such party obtains the prior written consent of the other.
SPAC also agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary
state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out
the Transactions, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action; _provided_ that, without the prior written
consent of the Company, SPAC shall not use any such information for any
purposes other than to obtain necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky"
permits and approvals.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement shall have
become effective, SPAC shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the SPAC Stockholders as of the
record date for the SPAC Stockholders Meeting. No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
will be made (in each case including documents incorporated by reference
therein) by SPAC, the Company or Holdco without providing the other with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon and each Party shall
give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by any other
party and their counsel. Each of SPAC, the Company and Holdco will be given a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the response to any SEC comments and
to provide comments on that response (to which reasonable and good faith
consideration shall be given), including by participating with SPAC, the
Company or Holdco or their counsel in any discussions or meetings with the
SEC. SPAC shall comply with all applicable rules and regulations promulgated
by the SEC, any applicable rules and regulations of Nasdaq, SPAC
Organizational Documents, and this Agreement in the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, any solicitation of proxies
thereunder, the calling and holding of the SPAC Stockholders Meeting and the
Redemption.

 

(c) If at any time prior to the Merger Effective Time, any information
relating to SPAC, the Company or Holdco or any of their respective
affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by SPAC, the Company
or Holdco which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either
the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that 

 



69

    

 either such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the
party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law,
disseminated to the SPAC Stockholders.

(d) Each of SPAC, the Company and Holdco will advise the other parties hereto
promptly after it receives any oral or written request by the SEC for
amendment of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement, as
applicable, or comments thereon and responses thereto, any oral or written
comments or requests in relation to the SPAC Stockholders Meeting or the
Redemption, or requests by the SEC for additional information and each party
will promptly provide the other with copies of any written communication
between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, any
state securities commission or their respective staffs, on the other hand,
with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Registration Statement,
the Exchanges, the Merger, the SPAC Stockholders Meeting or the Redemption.
SPAC, the Company and Holdco shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts, after consultation with each other, to resolve all such requests or
comments with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Registration
Statement, the SPAC Stockholders Meeting or the Redemption, as applicable, as
promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt thereof.

 

(e) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of SPAC, the
Company and Holdco shall cooperate with each other in the preparation of each
of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement, and each of
the Company and SPAC shall furnish Holdco with all information concerning it
and its affiliates as the providing party (after consulting with counsel) may
deem reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the preparation of
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement, as applicable.

 

(f) SPAC, the Company and Holdco shall notify each other promptly of the time
when the Registration Statement has become effective, of the issuance of any
stop order or suspension of the qualification of the Holdco Ordinary Shares or
Holdco Warrants issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff
of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Registration Statement or for additional information.

 

SECTION 8.02 _SPAC Stockholders_ __ _Meetings_. SPAC shall call the SPAC
Stockholders Meeting in accordance with the SPAC Organizational Documents
and applicable Law for the purposes of voting upon the SPAC Proposals as
promptly as practicable after the date on which the SEC has declared the
Registration Statement effective for the purpose of voting solely upon the
SPAC Proposals. SPAC shall consult with the Company in fixing the record date
for the SPAC Stockholders Meeting and the date of the SPAC Stockholders
Meeting, give notice to the Company of the SPAC Stockholders Meeting and
allow the Companys representatives and legal counsel to attend the SPAC
Stockholders Meeting. Without the prior written consent of the Company (not
to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), the SPAC Proposals
shall be the only matters (other than procedural matters) which SPAC shall
propose to be acted on by the SPAC Stockholders at the SPAC Stockholders
Meeting. SPAC shall include in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus the
recommendation of the SPAC Board that the SPAC Stockholders vote in favor of
the SPAC Proposals and shall otherwise use its reasonable

 



70

    

 best efforts to obtain the approval of the SPAC Proposals at the SPAC
Stockholders Meeting, including by soliciting from its stockholders proxies
as promptly as possible in favor of the SPAC Proposals, and shall take all
other action necessary or advisable to secure the required vote or consent of
its stockholders therefor. SPAC shall provide the Company with (a) updates
with respect to the tabulated vote counts received by SPAC, (b) the right to
demand postponement or adjournment of the SPAC Stockholders Meeting if, based
on the tabulated vote count, SPAC will not receive the required approval of
its stockholders of the SPAC Proposals; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that SPAC
shall not be permitted to postpone the SPAC Stockholders Meeting more than
the earlier of (i) five (5) Business Days prior to the Outside Date and (ii)
ten (10) days from the date of the first SPAC Stockholders Meeting without
the prior written consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), and (c) the right to review and comment on all
communication sent to SPAC Stockholders, holders of SPAC Warrants and/or
proxy solicitation firms.

SECTION 8.03 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Merger Effective Time, the
Company and SPAC shall (and shall cause their respective subsidiaries to):
(i) provide to the other party (and the other partys officers, directors,
employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, agents and other
representatives, collectively, " _Representatives_ ") reasonable access at
reasonable times upon prior notice to the officers, employees, agents,
properties, offices and other facilities of such party and its subsidiaries
and to the books and records thereof; _provided_ , that such access shall
not unreasonably interfere with the business and operations of SPAC and the
Company; and (ii) furnish promptly to the other party such information
concerning the business, properties, contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel
and other aspects of such party and its subsidiaries as the other party or
its Representatives may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Company nor SPAC shall be required to provide access to or
disclose information where the access or disclosure would jeopardize the
protection of attorney-client privilege or contravene applicable Law (it being
agreed that the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause such
information to be provided in a manner that would not result in such jeopardy
or contravention).

(b) All information obtained by the parties pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
8.03_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with the confidentiality
agreement, dated August 21, 2020 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "),
between SPAC and the Company.

that are provided relating to such treatment or structure, in each case in

SECTION 8.04 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) Holdco shall, or shall cause the Company, the Surviving Corporation and
each of their respective subsidiaries, as applicable, to provide the
employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries who remain employed

credit for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting under any
employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established or maintained by

 



71

    

 Holdco, the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
subsidiaries, other than any qualified or nonqualified defined benefit plan,
for service accrued or deemed accrued prior to the Closing with the Company
or any Company Subsidiary; _provided_ , _however_ , that such crediting of
service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such
benefit. In addition, Holdco shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) cause
to be waived any eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of insurability
requirements and the application of any pre-existing condition limitations
under each of the employee benefit plans established or maintained by Holdco,
the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries
that cover the Continuing Employees or their dependents following the Closing
and (ii) cause any eligible expenses incurred by any Continuing Employee and
his or her covered dependents, during the portion of the plan year in which
the Closing occurs, under those health and welfare Plans in which such
Continuing Employee participates immediately prior to the Closing to be taken
into account under those health and welfare benefit plans of Holdco, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries in
which such Continuing Employee participates following the Closing for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance, and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year. Following the Closing, Holdco shall,

respective subsidiaries, as applicable, to honor all accrued but unused
vacation and other paid time off of the Continuing Employees that existed
immediately prior to the Closing.

(b) The parties shall cooperate to establish an equity incentive plan for
service providers of Holdco and its subsidiaries to be effective as of the

percent (10%) of the Holdco Ordinary Shares and Holdco Warrants issued
immediately following Closing.

 

(c) The aggregate amount of all bonuses and similar payments identified in
clause (b) of the definition of Transaction Expenses payable to the employees
identified in _Section_ __ _ 1.01_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall
not exceed the Transaction Bonus Cap.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 8.04_ to the contrary,
nothing contained herein, whether express or implied, is or will be deemed to
be an establishment, amendment or other modification of any Plan or any
employee benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement of Holdco,
the Company, the Surviving Corporation and each of their respective
subsidiaries or affiliates, or shall prohibit or limit the right of Holdco,
the Company, the Surviving Corporation and each of their respective
subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Plan or
other employee benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement. The
parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this _Section_
__ _ 8.04_ are included for their sole benefit, and that nothing in this 
_Section_ __ _ 8.04_, whether express or implied, shall (i) create any third
party beneficiary or other rights in any other person, including any
Continuing Employee, any participant in any Plan or employee benefit
plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement of Holdco, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation and each of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates,
or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (ii) any rights in such person to
continued employment with Holdco, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and
each of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates or to any particular term
or condition of employment.

 



72

    

SECTION 8.05 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _ Indemnification_.

(a) To the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the Holdco
Organizational Documents shall contain provisions no less favorable with
respect to indemnification, advancement or expense reimbursement than are set
forth in the Company Organizational Documents and the SPAC Organizational
Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date in any manner
that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or
prior to the Merger Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees,
fiduciaries or agents of the Company (each such individual, a " _D andO
Indemnified Party_" and collectively, the " _D andO Indemnified Parties_") or
SPAC, unless such modification shall be required by applicable Law. Holdco
and the Company agree that with respect to the provisions of the articles,
bylaws, limited liability company agreements or other equivalent
organizational documents of the Company Subsidiaries relating to
indemnification, advancement or expense reimbursement, such provisions shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years
from the Merger Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the
rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Closing Date, were
directors, managers, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of such
Company Subsidiary, unless such modification shall be required by applicable
Law.

 

(b) The Company shall obtain, fully pay the premium for, and maintain prior to
the Closing a fully-paid "tail" insurance policy for a term of six (6) years
from the Closing Date (the " _D andO Tail Policy_", and the period for the DandO
Tail Policy, the " _Tail Period_ ") with terms and scope of coverage at least
as favorable as the Companys directors and officers insurance policy;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 8.05(b)_ shall
relieve Holdco or the Company of its other obligations under this  _Section_
__ _ 8.05_, or allow Holdco or the Company to delay its performance of its
obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 8.05_ and otherwise to provide
indemnification for or make any expense advances with respect to the expenses
of any claim for indemnification by a DandO Indemnified Party. Holdco shall
cause the Company to maintain the DandO Tail Policy in full force and effect,
for the full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the
Company. Such DandO Tail Policy shall be non-cancellable and placed with the
incumbent insurers using the policies that were in place as of the date of
this Agreement (unless the incumbent insurers will not offer such policies in
which case coverage for the Tail Period shall be placed with a substantially
comparable insurer with the same or better terms, conditions, exclusions,
retentions and limits of the expiring policies). The Company will instruct
the insurers and their brokers that they may communicate directly with the DandO
Indemnified Party(ies) regarding such claim, and Holdco and the Company will
provide the DandO Indemnified Party(ies) a copy of all insurance policies and
coverage correspondence relating to any proceeding involving any DandO
Indemnified Party upon request. The DandO Indemnified Parties are express and
intended third-party beneficiaries of the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _
8.05(b)_ and shall be entitled to independently enforce the terms hereof as if
they were each a party to this Agreement.

 

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, Holdco shall purchase and maintain, for such
periods as the Holdco Board shall in good faith determine, at its expense,
insurance reasonable for Holdco, given its size and activities in an amount of
coverage which is mutually agreed to by SPAC and the Company or, on an
aggregate basis, a premium not to exceed an amount mutually agreed to by SPAC
and the Company on behalf of any person who after the Closing is or was a
director or officer of Holdco, or is or was serving at the request of Holdco
as a

 



73

    

 director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including any direct or indirect
subsidiary of Holdco, against any expense, liability or loss asserted against
such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out
of such persons status as such, subject to customary exclusions.

 

(d) In the event Holdco, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then and in any such case
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Holdco,
the Company, the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.05_.

SECTION 8.06 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give
prompt notice to SPAC, and SPAC shall give prompt notice to the Company, of
any event which a party becomes aware of between the date of this Agreement
and the Closing (or the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance
with _Article X_ ), the occurrence, or non-occurrence of which causes or
would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions set forth in
_Article IX_ to fail. The failure by the Company or SPAC to give notice under
this  _Section_ __ _ 8.06_ shall not be deemed to be a breach under this
_Section_ __ _ 8.06_, unless such breach is knowing and in any event shall
not give rise to any additional damages above and beyond the breach of the
underlying representation, warranty, covenant, condition or agreement, as the
case may be.

SECTION 8.07 _Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts_

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, such things as
are necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the Transactions as soon as practicable,
including, without limitation, using its reasonable best efforts to obtain all
permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders of
Governmental Authorities and parties to contracts with the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.05_ necessary for the
consummation of the Transactions and to fulfill the conditions to the Merger.
In case, at any time after the Merger Effective Time, any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper
officers and directors of each party shall use their reasonable best efforts
to take all such action.

 

(b) Each of the parties shall keep each other apprised of the status of
matters relating to the Transactions, including promptly notifying the other
parties of any communication it or any of its affiliates receives from any
Governmental Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this

extent practicable consult about, any proposed communication by such party to
any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions. No party to
this Agreement shall agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it
consults with the other parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Authority, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend
and participate at such meeting. Subject to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, the parties will use reasonable best efforts to coordinate and

 



74

    

 cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing
such assistance as the other parties may reasonably request in connection with
the foregoing. Subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, the
parties will provide each other with copies of all material correspondence,
filings or communications, including any documents, information and data
contained therewith, between them or any of their Representatives, on the one
hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other
hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions. No party shall take
or cause to be taken any action before any Governmental Authority that is
inconsistent with or intended to delay its action on requests for a consent or
the consummation of the Transactions.

 

SECTION 8.08 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release relating to
this Agreement shall be a joint press release the text of which has been
agreed to by each of SPAC and the Company. Thereafter, between the date of
this Agreement and the Closing Date (or the earlier termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Article IX_ ) unless otherwise prohibited
by applicable Law or the requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, each of
SPAC and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to consult
with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statements (including through social media platforms) with respect to
this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Transactions, and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the
prior written consent of the other party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Furthermore, nothing contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.08_ shall prevent SPAC or the Company and/or its respective
affiliates from furnishing customary or other reasonable information
concerning the Transactions to their investors and prospective investors.

SECTION 8.09 _Tax Matters_.

(a) No Party has taken (or failed to take) any action or caused any action to
be taken (or to fail to be taken) and will not take (or fail to take) any
action or will cause any action to be taken (or to fail to be taken) (in each
case other than any action provided for or prohibited by this Agreement), or
has any knowledge of any fact or circumstance that could reasonably be
expected to prevent the Exchanges and subsequent Merger from qualifying for
the Intended Tax Treatment.

 

(b) Each Party agrees to act in good faith, consistent with the Intended Tax
Treatment and will not take any position on any U.S. Tax Return or otherwise
take any U.S. Tax reporting position inconsistent with the Intended Tax
Treatment, unless otherwise required by a "determination" within the meaning
of Section 1313 of the Code that the Intended Tax Treatment is not correct.
For the avoidance of doubt, the preceding sentence shall not be interpreted to
prevent a person from reporting transactions hereunder pursuant to other
applicable non-recognition provisions of the Code, including under Section
368 of the Code, to the extent any such position is not, in and of itself,
conflicting with the qualification of the transactions contemplated hereby for
the Intended Tax Treatment.

(i) The Parties agree that this Agreement is a "plan of reorganization" within
the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a).

determined under Section 367 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder, may enter into (and cause to be filed with the IRS) a
gain recognition agreement in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section
1.367(a)-8. Upon the written request of any such SPAC Stockholder made
following the Closing Date, Holdco shall (i) use reasonable best efforts to
furnish to such SPAC Stockholder such information as such SPAC Stockholder
reasonably requests in connection with such SPAC Stockholders preparation of
a gain recognition agreement, and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to provide
such SPAC Stockholder with the information reasonably requested by such SPAC

permitted in this Agreement. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a) any
defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be
adequate and (b) any requirement under any Law to post security or a bond as a
prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

ARTICLE II

REGISTRATIONS 

2.1 _ Shelf Registration_.

 

2.1.1 The Company shall, as soon as practicable, but in any event within
thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, file a Registration Statement under
the Securities Act to permit the public resale of all the Registrable
Securities held by the Holders from time to time as permitted by Rule 415
under the Securities Act (or any successor or similar provision adopted by the
Commission then in effect) on the terms and conditions specified in this _
subsection 2.1.1_ and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such
Registration Statement to be declared effective as soon as practicable after
the filing thereof, but in no event later than ninety (90) days following the
filing deadline (the " _Effectiveness Deadline_ "); _ provided_, that the
Effectiveness Deadline shall be extended to one hundred and twenty (120)
days after the filing deadline if the Registration Statement is reviewed by,
and receives comments from, the Commission. The Registration Statement filed
with the Commission pursuant to this _ subsection 2.1.1_ shall be on a
shelf registration statement on Form F-1 (a " _Form_ __ _ F-1_ __ _
Shelf_") or such other form of registration statement as is then available to
effect a registration for resale of such Registrable Securities, covering such
Registrable Securities, and shall contain a Prospectus in such form as to
permit any Holder to sell such Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule 415
under the Securities Act (or any successor or similar provision adopted by the
Commission then in effect) at any time beginning on the effective date for
such Registration Statement. A Registration Statement filed pursuant to this
_ subsection 2.1.1_ shall provide for the resale pursuant to any method or
combination of methods legally available to, and requested by, the Holders.
The Company shall use its best efforts to cause a Registration Statement
filed pursuant to this _ subsection 2.1.1_ to remain effective, and to be
supplemented and amended to the extent necessary to ensure that such
Registration Statement is available (including to use its best efforts to add
Registrable Securities held by Permitted Transferees) or, if not available,
that another Registration Statement is available, for the resale of all the
Registrable Securities held by the Holders until all such Registrable
Securities have ceased to be Registrable Securities. As soon as practicable
following the effective date of a Registration Statement filed pursuant to
this _ subsection 2.1.1_, but in any event within one (1) business day of
such date, the Company shall notify the Holders of the effectiveness of such
Registration Statement. When effective, a Registration Statement filed
pursuant to this _ subsection 2.1.1_ (including the documents incorporated
therein by reference) will comply as to form in all material respects with
all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and
will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading (in the case of any Prospectus contained in
such Registration Statement, in the light of the circumstances under which
such statement is made).

 

2.1.2 The Company shall use its best efforts to convert the Form F-1 Shelf
filed pursuant to  _subsection 2.1.1_ to a shelf registration statement on
Form F-3 (a " _Form F-3 Shelf_") as promptly as practicable after the Company
is eligible to use a Form F-3 Shelf and have the Form F-3 Shelf declared
effective as promptly as practicable and to cause such Form F-3 Shelf to
remain effective, and to be supplemented and amended to the extent necessary
to ensure that such Registration Statement is available or, if not available,
that another Registration Statement is available, for the resale of all the
Registrable Securities held by the Holders until all such Registrable
Securities have ceased to be Registrable Securities.

 

2.1.3 At any time and from time to time following the effectiveness of the
shelf registration statement required by _ subsection 2.1.1_ or _subsection
2.1.2_ , any Holder may request to sell all or a portion of their Registrable
Securities in an underwritten offering that is registered pursuant to such
shelf registration statement, including a Block Trade (a " _Shelf
Underwritten Offering_ ") provided that such Holder(s) (a) reasonably expects
to sell Registrable Securities yielding aggregate gross proceeds in excess of
$15,000,000 from such Shelf Underwritten Offering or (b) reasonably expects
to sell all of the Registrable Securities held by such Holder in such Shelf
Underwritten Offering (the amount of Registrable Securities pursuant to the
foregoing clause (a) or (b), as applicable, the " _Minimum Amount_ "). All
requests for a Shelf Underwritten Offering shall be made by giving written
notice to the Company (the " _Shelf Take Down Notice_ "). Each Shelf Takedown
Notice shall specify the approximate number of Registrable Securities
proposed to be sold in the Shelf Underwritten Offering and the expected price
range (net of underwriting discounts and commissions) of such Shelf
Underwritten Offering. Within three (3) days after receipt of any Shelf Take

   

 Down Notice, the Company shall give written notice of such requested Shelf
Underwritten Offering to all other Holders of Registrable Securities (the "
_Company Shelf Takedown Notice_ ") and, subject to the provisions of _
subsection 2.2.4_, shall include in such Shelf Underwritten Offering all
Registrable Securities with respect to which the Company has received written
requests for inclusion therein, within five (5) days after sending the
Company Shelf Takedown Notice, or, in the case of a Block Trade, as provided
in _ Section_ __ _ 2.5_. The Company shall enter into an underwriting
agreement in a form as is customary in Underwritten Offerings of securities
by the Company with the managing Underwriter or Underwriters selected by the
Holders after consultation with the Company and shall take all such other
reasonable actions as are requested by the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such
Registrable Securities. In connection with any Shelf Underwritten Offering
contemplated by this _ subsection 2.1.3_, subject to _ Section_ __ _ 3.3_
and _ _ Article IV__, the underwriting agreement into which each Holder and
the Company shall enter shall contain such representations, covenants,
indemnities and other rights and obligations as are customary in underwritten
offerings of securities by the Company. Any Shelf Underwritten Offering
effected pursuant to this _subsection 2.1.3_ shall be counted as a
Registration for purposes of the limit on the number of Registrations that
can be effected under _ Section_ __ _ 2.2_ hereof.

2.2 _ Demand Registration_.

 

2.2.1 _ Request for Registration_. Subject to the provisions of _ subsection
2.2.5_ and _ Sections 2.4_ and _ 3.4_ hereof, at any time and from time to
time on or after the Closing Date, each of (a) the Founder (the " _Founder
Demanding Holder_ "), and (b) at least a majority in interest of the then-
outstanding number of Registrable Securities held by the New Holders (the "
_New Demanding Holders_ ," together with the Founder Demanding Holders, the "
_Demanding Holders_ ") may make a written demand for Registration of all or
part of their Registrable Securities on (i) Form F-1, or such other form of
registration statement as is then available to effect a registration for
resale of such Registrable Securities, covering such Registrable Securities
or (ii) if available, Form F-3, which in the case of either clause (i) or
(ii), may be a shelf registration statement filed pursuant to Rule 415 under
the Securities Act, which written demand shall describe the amount and type of
securities to be included in such Registration and the intended method(s) of
distribution thereof (such written demand a " _Demand Registration_ "). The
Company shall, promptly following the Companys receipt of a Demand
Registration, notify, in writing all other Holders of Registrable Securities
of such demand, and each Holder of Registrable Securities who thereafter
wishes to include all or a portion of such Holders Registrable Securities in
a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration (each such Holder that
includes all or a portion of such Holders Registrable Securities in
such Registration, a " _Requesting Holder_ ") shall so notify the Company, in
writing, within five (5) days after the receipt by the Holder of the notice
from the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent a
Requesting Holder also separately possesses Demand Registration rights
pursuant to this _ Section_ __ _ 2.2_, but is not the Holder who exercises
such Demand Registration rights, the exercise by such Requesting Holder of its
rights pursuant to the foregoing sentence shall not count as the exercise by
it of one of its Demand Registration rights. Upon receipt by the Company of
any such written notification from a Requesting Holder(s) to the Company,
subject to _ subsection 2.2.4_ below, such Requesting Holder(s) shall be
entitled to have their Registrable Securities included in a Registration
pursuant to a Demand Registration and the Company shall effect, as soon
thereafter as practicable, but not more than forty five (45) days immediately
after the Companys receipt of the Demand Registration, the Registration of
all Registrable Securities requested by the Demanding Holders and Requesting
Holders pursuant to such Demand Registration. The Company shall not be
obligated to effect more than (1) an aggregate of three (3) Registrations
pursuant to a Demand Registration or a Shelf Underwritten Offering initiated
by the Founder and (2) an aggregate of three (3) Registrations pursuant to a
Demand Registration or a Shelf Underwritten offering initiated by the New
Holders, in each case under _subsection 2.1.3_ or this _ subsection 2.2.1_
with respect to any or all Registrable Securities; _ provided_, _ however_,
that a Registration shall not be counted for such purposes unless a
Registration Statement that may be available at such time has become effective
and all of the Registrable Securities requested by the Demanding Holders and
the Requesting Holders to be registered on behalf of the Demanding Holders and
the Requesting Holders in such Registration have been sold, in accordance with
_ Section_ __ _ 3.1_ of this Agreement.

2.2.2 _ Effective Registration_. Notwithstanding the provisions of _
subsection 2.2.1_ above or any other part of this Agreement, a Registration
pursuant to a Demand Registration shall not count as a Registration unless and
until (a) the Registration Statement filed with the Commission with respect to
a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration has been declared effective
by the Commission and (b) the Company has complied with all of its obligations
under this Agreement with respect thereto; _ provided_, _ further_, that if,
after such Registration Statement has been declared effective, an offering of
Registrable Securities in a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration is
subsequently interfered with by any stop order or injunction of the
Commission, federal or state court or any other 

   

 governmental agency, the Registration Statement with respect to such
Registration shall be deemed not to have been declared effective, unless and
until, (i) such stop order or injunction is removed, rescinded or otherwise
terminated, and (ii) a majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders
initiating such Demand Registration thereafter affirmatively elect to
continue with such Registration and accordingly notify the Company in writing,
but in no event later than five (5) days after the removal, rescission or
other termination of such stop order or injunction, of such election; _
provided_, _ further_, that the Company shall not be obligated or required to
file another Registration Statement until the Registration Statement that has
been previously filed with respect to a Registration pursuant to a Demand
Registration by the same Demand Holder becomes effective or is subsequently
terminated.

2.2.3 _ Underwritten Offering_. Subject to the provisions of _ subsection
2.2.4_ and _ Sections 2.4_ and _ 3.4_ hereof, if a majority-in-interest of
the Demanding Holders so advise the Company as part of their Demand
Registration that the offering of the Registrable Securities pursuant to such
Demand Registration shall be in the form of an Underwritten Offering, then the
right of such Demanding Holder or Requesting Holder (if any) to include its
Registrable Securities in such Registration shall be conditioned upon
such Holders participation in such Underwritten Offering and the inclusion
of such Holders Registrable Securities in such Underwritten Offering to the
extent provided herein. All such Holders proposing to distribute their
Registrable Securities through an Underwritten Offering under this _
subsection 2.2.3_, subject to _ Section_ __ _ 3.3_ and _ _ Article IV__,
shall enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the Company
and the Underwriter(s) selected for such Underwritten Offering by the
majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders initiating the Demand
Registration. 

2.2.4 _ Reduction of Underwritten Offering_. If a Demand Registration is to
be an Underwritten Offering and the managing Underwriter or Underwriters, in
good faith, advises the Company, the Demanding Holders and the Requesting
Holders (if any) in writing that, in its opinion, the dollar amount or number
of Registrable Securities that the Demanding Holders and the Requesting
Holders (if any) desire to sell, taken together with all other Ordinary Shares
or other equity securities that the Company desires to sell for its own
account and the Ordinary Shares, if any, as to which a Registration has been
requested pursuant to separate written contractual piggy-back registration
rights held by any other stockholders of the Company who desire to sell,
exceeds the maximum dollar amount or maximum number of equity securities that
can be sold in such Underwritten Offering without adversely affecting the
proposed offering price, the timing, the distribution method, or the
probability of success of such offering (such maximum dollar amount or maximum
number of such securities, as applicable, the " _Maximum Number of
Securities_ "), then the Company shall include in such Underwritten Offering,
as follows: (a) first, the Registrable Securities of the Demanding Holders and
the Requesting Holders (if any) (pro rata based on the respective number of
Registrable Securities that each Demanding Holder and Requesting Holder (if
any) has requested be included in such Underwritten Registration and the
aggregate number of Registrable Securities that the Demanding Holders and
Requesting Holders have requested be included in such Underwritten
Registration (such proportion is referred to herein as " _Pro Rata_ ")) that
can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (b) second,
to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under
the foregoing clause (a), the Ordinary Shares or other equity securities that
the Company desires to sell for its own account, which can be sold
without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and (c) third, to the
extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the
foregoing clauses (a) and (b), the Ordinary Shares or other equity securities
of other persons or entities that the Company is obligated to register in a
Registration pursuant to separate written contractual arrangements with such
persons and that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Securities and (d) fourth, to the extent that the Maximum Number of
Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (a), (b) and (c),
Ordinary Shares or other equity securities of other persons or entities that
the Company is obligated to register in a Registration pursuant to Section
2.3 and that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities.

2.2.5 _ Demand Registration Withdrawal_. A Demanding Holder or a Requesting
Holder shall have the right to withdraw all or a portion of its Registrable
Securities included in a Demand Registration pursuant to _ subsection 2.2.1_
or a Shelf Underwritten Offering pursuant to _ subsection 2.1.3_ for any or
no reason whatsoever upon written notification to the Company and the
Underwriter or Underwriters (if any) of its intention to so withdraw at any
time prior to (a) in the case of a Demand Registration not involving an
Underwritten Offering or a Shelf Underwritten Offering, the effectiveness of
the applicable Registration Statement or (b) in the case of any Demand
Registration involving an Underwritten Offering or any Shelf Underwritten
Offering, prior to the pricing of such Underwritten Offering or Shelf
Underwritten Offering; _ provided_, _ however_, that upon withdrawal by a
majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders initiating a Demand Registration
(or in the case of a Shelf Underwritten Offering, withdrawal of an amount
of Registrable Securities included by the Holders in such Shelf Underwritten
Offering, in their capacity as Demanding Holders, being less than the Minimum
Amount), the Company shall cease all efforts to secure effectiveness of the
applicable 

   

 Registration Statement or complete the Underwritten Offering, as applicable.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall
be responsible for the Registration Expenses incurred in connection with a
Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration or a Shelf Underwritten
Offering prior to and including its withdrawal under this _ subsection
2.2.5_.

 

2.3 _ Piggyback Registration_.

 

2.3.1 _ Piggyback Rights_. If the Company proposes to file a Registration
Statement under the Securities Act with respect to an offering of equity
securities, or securities or other obligations exercisable or exchangeable
for, or convertible into equity securities, for its own account or for the
account of stockholders of the Company (or by the Company and by
the shareholders of the Company including, without limitation, pursuant to _
Section_ __ _ 2.2_ hereof), other than a Registration Statement (a) filed in
connection with any employee share option or other benefit plan, (b) for an
exchange offer or offering of securities solely to the Companys existing
shareholders, (c) for an offering of debt that is convertible into equity
securities of the Company, (d) for a dividend reinvestment plan, or (e) filed
pursuant to _ subsection 2.1.1_, then the Company shall give written notice
of such proposed filing to all of the Holders of Registrable Securities as
soon as practicable but not less than twenty (20) days (or, in the case of a
Block Trade, three (3) business days) before the anticipated filing date of
such Registration Statement, which notice shall (A) describe the amount and
type of securities to be included in such offering, the intended method(s)
of distribution (including whether such registration will be pursuant to a
shelf registration statement), and the proposed price and name of the proposed
managing Underwriter or Underwriters, if any, in such offering, (B) such
Holders rights under this _ Section_ __ _ 2.3_ and (C) offer to all of the
Holders of Registrable Securities the opportunity to register the sale of such
number of Registrable Securities as such Holders may request in writing
within ten (10) days after receipt of such written notice (or in the case of
a Block Trade, within two (2) business days) (such Registration a " _Piggyback
Registration_ "). The Company shall, in good faith, cause such Registrable
Securities identified in a Holders response noticed described in the
foregoing sentence to be included in such Piggyback Registration and shall use
its best efforts to cause the managing Underwriter or Underwriters of a
proposed Underwritten Offering, if any, to permit the Registrable Securities
requested by the Holders pursuant to this _ subsection 2.3.1_ to be included
in a Piggyback Registration on the same terms and conditions as any similar
securities of the Company or Company shareholder(s) for whose account the
Registration Statement is to be filed included in such Registration and to
permit the sale or other disposition of such Registrable Securities in
accordance with the intended method(s) of distribution thereof. All such
Holders proposing to distribute their Registrable Securities through an
Underwritten Offering under this _ subsection 2.3.1_, subject to _ Section_
__ _ 3.3_ and _ _ Article IV__, shall enter into an underwriting agreement
in customary form with the Underwriter(s) selected for such Underwritten
Offering by the Company or Company shareholder(s) for whose account the
Registration Statement is to be filed. For purposes of this _ Section_ __ _
2.3_, the filing by the Company of an automatic shelf registration statement
for offerings pursuant to Rule 415(a) that omits information with respect to
any specific offering pursuant to Rule 430B shall not trigger any
notification or participation rights hereunder until such time as the Company
amends or supplements such Registration Statement to include information with
respect to a specific offering of Securities (and such amendment or
supplement shall trigger the notice and participation rights provided for in
this _ Section_ __ _ 2.3_).

 

2.3.2 _ Reduction of Piggyback Registration_. If a Piggyback Registration is
to be an Underwritten Offering and the managing Underwriter or Underwriters,
in good faith, advises the Company and the Holders of Registrable Securities
participating in the Piggyback Registration in writing that, in its opinion,
the dollar amount or number of the Ordinary Shares that the Company desires
to sell, taken together with (a) the Ordinary Shares, if any, as to which
Registration has been demanded pursuant to separate written contractual
arrangements with persons or entities other than the Holders of
Registrable Securities hereunder, (b) the Registrable Securities as to which
registration has been requested pursuant _ Section_ __ _ 2.3_ hereof, and
(c) the Ordinary Shares, if any, as to which Registration has been requested
pursuant to separate written contractual piggy-back registration rights of
other shareholders of the Company, exceeds the Maximum Number of Securities,
then:

 

2.3.2.1 if the Registration is undertaken for the Companys account, the
Company shall include in any such Registration (a) first, the Ordinary Shares
or other equity securities that the Company desires to sell for its own
account, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities;
(b) second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been
reached under the foregoing clause (a), the Registrable Securities of Holders
exercising their rights to register their Registrable Securities pursuant to _
subsection 2.3.1_ hereof, Pro Rata, which can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Securities; and (c) third, to the extent that the Maximum
Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (a) and
(b), the Ordinary Shares, if any, as to which Registration has been
requested pursuant to written contractual piggy-back registration rights of
other shareholders of the Company, which can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Securities; and

   

2.3.2.2 if the Registration is pursuant to a request by persons or entities
other than the Holders of Registrable Securities, then the Company shall
include in any such Registration (a) first, the Ordinary Shares or other
equity securities, if any, of such requesting persons or entities, other than
the Holders of Registrable Securities, which can be sold without exceeding
the Maximum Number of Securities; (b) second, to the extent that the Maximum
Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clause (a), the
Registrable Securities of Holders exercising their rights to register their
Registrable Securities pursuant to _ subsection 2.3.1_ hereof, Pro Rata,
which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (c)
third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been
reached under the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), the Ordinary Shares or other
equity securities that the Company desires to sell for its own account, which
can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and (d)
fourth, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been
reached under the foregoing clauses (a), (b) and (c), the Ordinary Shares or
other equity securities for the account of other persons or entities that the
Company is obligated to register pursuant to separate written contractual
arrangements with such persons or entities, which can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities.

 

2.3.3 _ Piggyback Registration Withdrawal_. Any Holder of Registrable
Securities shall have the right to withdraw all or any portion of its
Registrable Securities in a Piggyback Registration for any or no reason
whatsoever upon written notification to the Company and the Underwriter or
Underwriters (if any) of his, her or its intention to withdraw such
Registrable Securities from such Piggyback Registration prior to (a) in the
case of a Piggyback Registration not involving an Unwritten Offering or Shelf
Underwritten Offering, the effectiveness of the applicable Registration
Statement or (b), in the case of any Piggyback Registration involving an
Underwritten Offering or any Shelf Underwritten Offering, prior to the pricing
of such Underwritten Offering or Shelf Underwritten Offering. The Company
(whether on its own good faith determination or as the result of a request
for withdrawal by persons pursuant to separate written contractual
obligations) may withdraw a Registration Statement filed with the Commission
in connection with a Piggyback Registration at any time prior to the
effectiveness of such Registration Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall be responsible for the
Registration Expenses incurred in connection with the Piggyback Registration
prior to and including its withdrawal under this _ subsection 2.3.3_.

2.3.4 _ Unlimited Piggyback Registration Rights_. For purposes of clarity,
any Registration effected pursuant to _ Section_ __ _ 2.3_ hereof shall not
be counted as a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration effected under
_ Section_ __ _ 2.2_ hereof or a Shelf Underwritten Offering effected under
_ subsection 2.1.3_.

2.4 _ Restrictions on Registration Rights_. If (a) during the
period starting with the date sixty (60) days prior to the Companys good
faith estimate of the date of the filing of, and ending on a date one hundred
and twenty (120) days after the effective date of, a Company initiated
Registration and provided that the Company has delivered written notice to
the Holders prior to receipt of a Demand Registration pursuant to _
subsection 2.2.1_ and it continues to actively employ, in good faith, all
reasonable efforts to cause the applicable Registration Statement to become
effective; (b) the Holders have requested an Underwritten Registration and the
Company and the Holders are unable to obtain the commitment of underwriters to
firmly underwrite the offer; or (c) in the good faith judgment of the Board
such Registration would be seriously detrimental to the Company and the Board
concludes as a result that it is essential to defer the filing of such
Registration Statement at such time, then in each case the Company shall
furnish to such Holders a certificate signed by the Chairman of the Board
stating that in the good faith judgment of the Board it would be seriously
detrimental to the Company for such Registration Statement to be filed in
the near future and that it is therefore essential to defer the filing of
such Registration Statement. In such event, the Company shall have the right
to defer such filing for a period of not more than thirty (30) days; _
provided_, _ however_, that the Company shall not defer its obligation in
this manner more than once in any twelve (12)-month period (the " _Aggregate
Blocking Period_ ").

 

2.5 _ Block Trades_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this _ _ Article
II__, but subject to _ Sections 2.4_ and _ 3.4_, if the Holders desire to
effect a Block Trade, then notwithstanding any other time periods in this _ _
Article II__, the Holders shall provide written notice to the Company at least
three (3) business days prior to the date such Block Trade will commence. As
expeditiously as possible, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to facilitate such Block Trade. The Holders shall use reasonable best efforts
to work with the Company and the Underwriters (including by disclosing the
maximum number of Registrable Securities proposed to be the subject of such
Block Trade) in order to facilitate preparation of the Registration Statement,
Prospectus and other offering documentation related to the Block Trade and
any related due diligence and comfort procedures. In the event of a Block
Trade, and after consultation with

   

 the Company, the Demanding Holders and the Requesting Holders (if any) shall
determine the Maximum Number of Securities, the underwriter or underwriters
and share price of such offering. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, in the event of a Block Trade in connection with the sale of
Registrable Securities by a pledgee upon foreclosure of the Registrable
Securities that were pledged as collateral for a loan, the Company shall not
include any other Holders Registrable Securities on the Registration
Statement or Prospectus with respect to such Block Trade.

 

2.6 _ Rule 415; Removal_. If at any time the Commission takes the position
that the offering of some or all of the Registrable Securities in a
Registration Statement on Form F-3 filed pursuant to this _ Section_ __ _ 2_
is not eligible to be made on a delayed or continuous basis under
the provisions of Rule 415 under the Securities Act (provided, however, the
Company shall be obligated to use diligent efforts to advocate with the
Commission for the registration of all of the Registrable Securities in
accordance with the Commission Guidance, including without limitation,
Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 612.09) or requires a Holder to be
named as an "underwriter," the Company shall (i) promptly notify each holder
of Registrable Securities thereof and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to
persuade the SEC that the offering contemplated by such Registration Statement
is a valid secondary offering and not an offering "by or on behalf of the
issuer" as defined in Rule 415 and that none of the Holders is an
"underwriter." The Holders shall have the right to select one legal counsel
designated by the holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities subject
to such Registration Statement to review and oversee any registration or
matters pursuant to this _ Section_ __ _ 2.6_, including participation in
any meetings or discussions with the Commission regarding the Commissions
position and to comment on any written submission made to the Commission with
respect thereto. No such written submission with respect to this matter shall
be made to the Commission to which the applicable Holders counsel reasonably
objects. In the event that, despite the Companys reasonable best efforts and
compliance with the terms of this _ Section_ __ _ 2.6_, the Commission
refuses to alter its position, the Company shall (i) remove from such
Registration Statement such portion of the Registrable Securities (the "
_Removed Shares_ ") and/or (ii) agree to such restrictions and limitations on
the registration and resale of the Registrable Securities as the Commission
may require to assure the Companys compliance with the requirements of Rule
415; _ provided_, _ however_, that the Company shall not agree to name any
Holder as an "underwriter" in such Registration Statement without the prior
written consent of such Holder. In the event of a share removal pursuant to
this _ Section_ __ _ 2.6_, the Company shall give the applicable Holders at
least five (5) days prior written notice along with the calculations as to
such Holders allotment. Any removal of shares of the Holders pursuant to
this _ Section_ __ _ 2.6_ shall first be applied to holders other than the
Holders with securities registered for resale under the applicable
Registration Statement and thereafter allocated between the Holders on a pro
rata basis based on the aggregate amount of Registrable Securities held by the
Holders. In the event of a share removal of the Holders pursuant to this _
Section_ __ _ 2.6_, the Company shall promptly register the resale of any
Removed Shares pursuant to _ subsection 2.1.2_ hereof and in no event shall
the filing of such Registration Statement on Form F-1 or subsequent
Registration Statement on Form F-3 filed pursuant to the terms of _
subsection 2.1.2_ be counted as a Demand Registration hereunder. Until such
time as the Company has registered all of the Removed Shares for resale
pursuant to Rule 415 on an effective Registration Statement, the Company shall
not be able to defer the filing of a Registration Statement pursuant to _
Section_ __ _ 2.4_ hereof.

In the case of a Form F-1 Shelf filed to register the resale of Removed
Shares, upon such date as the Company becomes eligible to register all of the
Removed Shares for resale on a Form F-3 Shelf pursuant to the Commission
Guidance and, if applicable, without a requirement that any of the Holders be
named as an "underwriter" therein, the Company shall use its best efforts to
file a Form F-3 Shelf as promptly as practicable to replace the applicable
Form F-1 Shelf and have the Form F-3 Shelf declared effective as promptly as
practicable and to cause such Form F-3 Shelf to remain effective, and to be
supplemented and amended to the extent necessary to ensure that such
Registration Statement is available or, if not available, that another
Registration Statement is available, for the resale of all the Registrable
Securities thereunder held by the applicable Holders until all such
Registrable Securities have ceased to be Registrable Securities.

2.7. Waiver. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
unless the Company is notified in writing to the contrary by the Class B
Holder, (A) each Class B Holder hereby waives any and all rights (i) to
receive notice of a Demand Registration relating to any Underwritten Offering
as provided for in this Section 2 or (ii) to participate in any such
Underwritten Offering, and (B) the Company hereby agrees not to notify any
Class B Holder of any Underwritten Offering or provide any Class B Holder
with any information relating thereto.

"lock-up agreements," in connection with such Registration.

3.2 _ Registration Expenses_. The Registration Expenses of all Registrations
shall be borne by the Company. It is acknowledged by the Holders that the
Holders shall bear all incremental selling expenses relating to the sale of
Registrable Securities, such as Underwriters commissions and discounts,
brokerage fees, and, other than as set forth in the definition of
"Registration Expenses," all reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel
representing the Holders.

 

3.3 _ Participation in Underwritten Offerings_.

 

3.3.1 No person may participate in any Underwritten Offering for equity
securities of the Company pursuant to a Registration initiated by the Company
hereunder unless such person (a) agrees to sell such persons securities on
the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Company
and (b) completes and executes all customary questionnaires, indemnities,
lock-up agreements, underwriting agreements and other customary documents as
may be reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.

 

3.3.2 The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that
no Underwriter shall require any Holder to make any representations or
warranties to or agreements with the Company or the Underwriters other than
representations, warranties or agreements regarding such Holder and such
Holders intended method of distribution and any other
representation required by law, and if, despite the Companys commercially
reasonable efforts, an Underwriter requires any Holder to make additional
representation or warranties to or agreements with such Underwriter, such
Holder may elect not to participate in such Underwritten Offering (but shall
not have any claims against the Company as a result of such election). Any
liability of such Holder to any Underwriter or other person under such
underwriting agreement shall be limited to an amount equal to the proceeds
(net of expenses and underwriting discounts and commissions) that it derives
from such registration.

3.4 _ Suspension of Sales; Adverse Disclosure_. Upon receipt of written
notice from the Company that a Registration Statement or Prospectus contains a
Misstatement, or in the opinion of counsel for the Company it is necessary to
supplement or amend such Prospectus to comply with law, each of the Holders
shall forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities until it has
received copies of a supplemented or amended Prospectus correcting the
Misstatement or including the information counsel for the Company believes to
be necessary to comply with law (it being understood that the Company hereby
covenants to prepare and file such supplement or amendment as soon as
practicable after the time of such notice such that the Registration
Statement or Prospectus, as so amended or supplemented, as applicable, will
not include a Misstatement and complies with law), or until it is advised in
writing by the Company that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed. If
the filing, initial effectiveness or continued use of a Registration
Statement in respect of any Registration at any time would require the Company
to make an Adverse Disclosure or would require the inclusion in such
Registration Statement of financial statements that are unavailable to the
Company for reasons beyond the Companys control, the Company may, upon giving
prompt written notice of such action to the Holders, delay the filing or
initial effectiveness of, or suspend use of, such Registration Statement for
the shortest period of time, but in no event more than thirty (30) days,
determined in good faith by the Board to be necessary for such purpose; _
provided_, that each day of any such suspension pursuant to this _ Section_
__ _ 3.4_ shall correspondingly decrease the Aggregate Blocking Period
available to the Company during any twelve (12)-month period pursuant to _
Section_ __ _ 2.4_ hereof. In the event the Company exercises its rights
under the preceding sentence, the Holders agree to suspend, immediately upon
their receipt of the notice referred to above, their use of the Prospectus
relating to any Registration in connection with any sale or offer to sell
Registrable Securities. The Company shall immediately notify the Holders of
the expiration of any period during which it exercised its rights under this _
Section_ __ _ 3.4_.

 

3.5 _ Covenants of the Company_. As long as any Holder shall own Registrable
Securities, the Company hereby covenants and agrees:

 

3.5.1 the Company will not file any Registration Statement or Prospectus
included therein with the Commission which refers to any Holder
of Registrable Securities by name or otherwise without the prior written
approval of such Holder, which may not be unreasonably withheld;

   

3.5.2 at all times while it shall be a reporting company under the Exchange
Act, to file timely (or obtain extensions in respect thereof and file within
the applicable grace period) all reports required to be filed by the Company
after the date hereof pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act
and to promptly furnish the Holders with true and complete copies of all such
filings. The Company further covenants that it shall take such further action
as any Holder may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to
time to enable such Holder to sell Ordinary Shares held by such Holder
without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the
exemptions provided by Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act (or any
successor rule promulgated thereafter by the Commission), including providing
any legal opinions. Upon the request of any Holder, the Company shall deliver
to such Holder a written certification of a duly authorized officer as to
whether it has complied with such requirements; and

 

3.5.3 promptly following the effectiveness of the shelf registration statement
required by _ subsection 2.1.1_ (and in any event within three (3) business
days from such effectiveness), the Company shall cause the transfer agent to
remove any restrictive legends (including any electronic transfer
restrictions) from any Ordinary Shares held by such Holder and provide
or cause any customary opinions of counsel to be delivered to the transfer
agent in connection with such removal.

ARTICLE IV

 

INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION

 

4.1 _ Indemnification_.

 

4.1.1 The Company agrees to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, each
Holder of Registrable Securities, its officers, directors, partners,
shareholders or members, employees, agents, investment advisors and each
person who controls such Holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act and
Exchange Act) from and against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses (including attorneys fees), joint or several (or actions or
proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof)
(collectively, " _Claims_ "), to which any such Holder or other persons may
become subject, insofar as such Claims arise out of or are based on any
untrue or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any
Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus or any amendment
thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, and the Company will reimburse such Holder
or other person for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred by
them in connection with investigating or defending any such Claim; except
insofar as the Claim or expense arises out of or is based upon an untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in
such filing in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in
writing to the Company by such Holder expressly for use therein. The Company
shall indemnify the Underwriters, their officers and directors and each person
who controls such Underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act and
Exchange Act) to the same extent as provided in the foregoing with respect to
the indemnification of the Holder.

 

4.1.2 In connection with any Registration Statement in which a Holder of
Registrable Securities is participating, the Company may require that, as a
condition to including any Registrable Securities in any Registration
Statement, the Company shall have received an undertaking reasonably
satisfactory to it from such Holder, to indemnify the Company, its directors
and officers and agents and each person who controls the Company (within the
meaning of the Securities Act and Exchange Act) from and against any Claims,
to which any the Company or such other persons may become subject, insofar as
such Claims arise out of or are based on any untrue statement of any material
fact contained in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary
Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission of a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue
statement or omission is contained in any information furnished in writing by
such Holder expressly for use therein; _ provided_, _ however_, that
the obligation to indemnify shall be several, not joint and several, among
such Holders of Registrable Securities, and the liability of each such Holder
of Registrable Securities shall be in proportion to and limited to the net
proceeds received by such Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities
pursuant to such Registration Statement. The Holders of Registrable Securities
shall indemnify the Underwriters, their officers, directors and each person
who controls such Underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act and
Exchange Act) to the same extent as provided in the foregoing with respect to
indemnification of the Company and the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that no Underwriter shall require any Holder of
Registrable Securities to provide any indemnification other than that provided
hereinabove in this _ subsection 4.1.2_, and, if, despite the Companys
commercially reasonable efforts, an Underwriter requires any Holder
of Registrable Securities to provide additional indemnification, such Holder
may elect not to participate in such Underwritten Offering (but shall not have
any claim against the Company as a result of such election).

   

4.1.3 Any person entitled to indemnification herein shall (a) give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying party of any Claim with respect to which
it seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give prompt notice
shall not impair any persons right to indemnification hereunder to the extent
such failure has not materially prejudiced the indemnifying party) and (b)
unless in such indemnified partys reasonable judgment a conflict of interest
between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to
such Claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such
Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If such
defense is assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any
liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its
consent (but such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). An indemnifying
party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim
shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one (1)
counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to
such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a
conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of
such indemnified parties with respect to such claim. No indemnifying party
shall, without the consent of the indemnified party, consent to the entry of
any judgment or enter into any settlement which cannot be settled in all
respects by the payment of money (and such money is so paid by the
indemnifying party pursuant to the terms of such settlement) and which
settlement includes a statement or admission of fault or culpability on the
part of such indemnified party or does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a
release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation.

 

4.1.4 The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of
the indemnified party or any officer, director, partners, shareholders or
members, employees, agents, investment advisors or controlling person of such
indemnified party and shall survive the Transfer of Registrable Securities.

 

4.1.5 If the indemnification provided under _ Section_ __ _ 4.1_ hereof from
the indemnifying party is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party in respect of any Claims, then the indemnifying party, in
lieu of indemnifying the indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount
paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of such Claims (a) in
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by
the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party or
parties on the other hand from the offering of the Registrable Securities or
(b) if the allocation provided by clause (a) above is not permitted by
applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the
relative benefits referred to in clause (a) above but also to reflect the
relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the other hand in
connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Claims, as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations; _ provided_, _
however_, that the liability of any Holder or any director, officer,
employee, agent, investment advisor or controlling person thereof under this _
subsection 4.1.5_ shall be limited to the amount of the net proceeds received
by such Holder in such offering giving rise to such liability. The amount
paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses or other liabilities
referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set
forth in _ subsections 4.1.1_, _ 4.1.2_ and _ 4.1.3_ above, any legal or
other fees, charges or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in
connection with any investigation or proceeding. The parties hereto agree that
it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this _
subsection 4.1.5_ were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other
method of allocation, which does not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to in this _ subsection 4.1.5_. No person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution pursuant to this _
subsection 4.1.5_ from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

4.1.6 The indemnification required by this _ Section_ __ _ 4.1_ shall be
made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the
investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or expense, loss,
damage or liability is incurred.

 

ARTICLE V

LOCK-UP

5.1 _Transfer Restrictions_.

 

5.1.1 Except as permitted by Section 5.2, (i) the New Holders shall not
Transfer any Ordinary Shares beneficially owned or owned of record by the
such Holder until the earlier of (A) the date that is 180 days from the date
hereof, which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be a date prior to the
consummation of CIIGs initial business combination, (B) the last
consecutive trading day where the sale price of the Ordinary Shares equals or
exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends,
reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days
within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the date
hereof and (C) such date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger,
stock exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of the
Companys stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of Ordinary
Shares for cash, securities or other property (the " _New Holders Lock-up
Period_") and (ii) except as provided in Section 5.1.1(i)(C), until December
31, 2022, Kinetik S.a.r.l. shall maintain beneficial ownership of at least 50%
of the outstanding voting securities of the Company (the " _Kinetik Lock-Up
Period_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, the New Holders Lock-up Period and
Kinetik Lock-Up Period shall not apply to (i) any Ordinary Shares that were
previously shares of Class A common stock of CIIG, (ii) any Ordinary shares
underlying the warrants of CIIG or Holdco, or (iii) any Ordinary Shares
acquired in the open market.



   

5.1.2 Except as permitted by Section 5.2, the Founder and the Class B Holder

is one (1) year from the date hereof, (ii) the last consecutive trading day
where the sale price of the Ordinary Shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share

recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading
day period commencing at least 150 days after the date hereof, or (iii) such
date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or
other similar transaction that results in all of the Companys stockholders
having the right to exchange their shares of Ordinary Shares for cash,
securities or other property (the " _Founder  Lock-up Period_"). For the
avoidance of doubt, the Founder Lock-Up Period only applies to such Ordinary
Shares which were previously the 6,468,750 shares of Class B common stock of
CIIG, and does not apply to (i) any Ordinary Shares underlying any of the
7,175,000 private placement warrants issued to the Founder and Class B
Holders, (ii) any Ordinary Shares that were previously shares of Class A
common stock of CIIG, (iii) any Ordinary shares underlying the public warrants

comply with any additional restrictions on the pledging of Ordinary Shares
imposed on such Holder by the Companys policies.

sale, recapitalization, consolidation or other transaction involving a Change

completed, the Ordinary Shares subject to this Agreement shall remain subject
to this Agreement;

under the Exchange Act, provided that such plan does not provide for the
transfer of Ordinary Shares or any securities convertible into or exercisable
or exchangeable for Ordinary Shares during the Founder Lock-up Period, New
Holders Lock-up Period and Kinetik Lock-Up Period, as applicable; and

 

 _provided_ , that in the case of any Transfer or distribution pursuant to
_subsections 5.2.2 through 5.2.8_ , each donee, distributee or
other transferee shall agree in writing, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Company, to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement.

political, economic or social developments occur or are imminent that would
interfere with the normal activities of the Company at its registered office
or with the ease of communications with this office or between this office and
persons abroad, the Company may temporarily transfer the registered office
abroad, until the complete cessation of these abnormal circumstances. These
temporary measures will have no effect on the nationality of the Company,

remain a company governed by the Laws. These temporary measures will be taken

record any premium paid on any Share in addition to its nominal value. The
premium account shall constitute a distributable reserve and may notably be
used for the payment of the price for any Shares which the Company may
repurchase from its shareholder(s), to offset any net realised losses, to make
distributions to the shareholder(s) or to allocate funds to the legal
reserve.

Distributable reserve accounts may be established to record contributions to
the Company made by existing shareholders without issuance of Shares. Any
such reserve shall constitute a distributable reserve and may notably be used
to provide for the payment of the price of any Shares which the Company may
repurchase from its shareholder(s), to offset any net realised losses, to
make distributions to the shareholder(s) or to allocate funds to the legal
reserve.

_Article 6. Authorised Capital  Free Shares _

The authorised capital of the Company (including the issued share capital) is
set at two hundred seventy million euro (EUR 270,000,000) divided into two
billion seven hundred million (2,700,000,000) Shares with a nominal value of
ten euro cents (EUR 0.10) each.

 

The Board of Directors is authorised, up to the maximum amount of the
authorised capital, to (i) increase the issued share capital in one or
several tranches with or without share premium, against payment in cash or in
kind, by conversion of claims on the Company or in any other manner for any
reason whatsoever including (ii) issue subscription and/or conversion rights
in relation to new shares or instruments within the limits of the authorised
capital under the terms and conditions of warrants (which may be separate or
linked to Shares, bonds, notes or similar instruments issued by the Company),
convertible bonds, notes or similar instruments; (iii) determine the place
and date of the issue or successive issues, the issue price, the terms and
conditions of the subscription of and paying up on the new shares and
instruments and (iv) remove or limit the statutory preferential subscription
right of the shareholders in case of issue against payment in cash or shares,
warrants (which may be separate or attached to shares, bonds, notes or similar
instruments), convertible bonds, notes or similar instruments. 

The Board of Directors may authorise any person to accept on behalf of the
Company subscriptions and receive payment for Shares or instruments
issued under the authorised capital.

The Board of Directors is further authorised to make an allotment of existing
or newly issued shares without consideration to the following persons:



   (a) |

employees of the Company or certain categories amongst those; 

---|--- 
 



   (b) |

employees of companies or economic interest grouping in which the Company
holds directly or indirectly at least fifty per cent (50%) of the share
capital or voting rights; 

---|--- 



   (c) |

employees of companies or economic interest grouping in which at least fifty
per cent (50%) of the share capital or voting rights is held directly or
indirectly by a company which holds directly or indirectly at least fifty per
cent (50%) of the share capital of the Company; 

---|--- 
 



   (d) |

members of the corporate bodies of the Company or of the companies or economic
interest grouping listed in point (b) to (c) above or certain categories
amongst those.

   |  | 2 |  | 
    

The above authorisations are valid for a period ending five (5) years after
the date of the deed of incorporation of the Company. The above
authorisations may be renewed, increased or reduced by a resolution of the
General Meeting voting with the quorum and majority rules set for the
amendment of the Articles of Association. The shares to be issued upon
exercise or conversion of any warrants (which may be separate or linked to
Shares, bonds, notes or similar instruments issued by the Company),
convertible bonds, notes or similar instruments may be issued beyond the
initial authorized capital period of five (5) years as long as such
instruments were issued within the relevant initial authorized capital period
of five (5) years.

 

Following each increase of the issued share capital in accordance with this
article 6, article 5 will be amended so as to reflect the capital increase.
Any such amendment will be recorded in a notarial deed upon the instructions
of the Board of Directors or of any person duly authorised by the Board of
Directors for this purpose.

 

 _Article 7. Increase and Reduction of Capital  Acquisition of own Shares _

 

The share capital and/or authorised capital of the Company may be increased or
reduced by a resolution of the General Meeting adopted in compliance with
the quorum and majority rules set for the amendment of the Articles of
Association.

The new shares to be subscribed for by contribution in cash will be offered
by preference to the existing shareholders in proportion to the part of the
capital which those shareholders are holding. The Board of Directors shall
determine the period within which the statutory preferential subscription
rights ("PSRs") shall be exercised (the "Subscription Period") and the PSRs
shall be freely negotiable during the Subscription Period. If, at the end of
the Subscription Period, not all PSRs have been exercised, the PSRs shall
immediately lapse and the Board of Directors may decide that any person
(including third parties) may participate in the capital increase by
subscribing to the shares which have not been subscribed through the exercise
of PSRs during the Subscription Period.

Notwithstanding the above, the Board of Directors, within the limit of the
authorisation under article 6 or, the General Meeting, voting in compliance
with the quorum and majority rules set for any amendment of the Articles of
Association may limit or withdraw the PSRs.

The Company may acquire or repurchase Shares.

_Article 8. Shares _



   8.1 |

Each Share entitles to one (1) vote. 

---|--- 
 



   8.2 |

A shareholder may individually undertake not to exercise, permanently or
temporarily, all or part of its voting rights. Such a waiver binds the
relevant shareholder and the Company as from its notification to the Company. 

---|--- 



   8.3 |

The rights and obligations attached to all Shares shall be identical except to
the extent otherwise provided by the Articles of Association or by the Laws. 

---|--- 



   8.4 |

The co-owners of Shares must be represented towards the Company by one (1)
joint representative, whether appointed amongst them or not. 

---|--- 



   8.5 |

The Shares will be in the form of registered shares only. 

---|--- 
 



   8.6 |

A register of shares shall be kept by the Company at its registered office,
where it shall be available for inspection by any shareholder. This register
shall contain the precise designation of each shareholder and the indication
of the number of Shares held, the indication of the payments made on the
Shares as well as the transfers of Shares and the dates thereof. Ownership of
shares will be established by inscription in the said register or in the event
separate registrars have been appointed pursuant to Article 8.8, in such
separate register(s). 

---|---

---|---|---|---|--- 
  A42915260 |  |  |  | 
   |  | 3 |  | 
       8.7 |

The Company may appoint registrars in different jurisdictions who may each
maintain a separate register for the Shares entered therein. Shareholders may
elect to be entered into one of these registers and to transfer their Shares
to another register so maintained. The Board of Directors may however impose
transfer restrictions for Shares in compliance with the requirements of the
jurisdiction applicable to the shares at that time. A transfer to the register
kept at the Companys registered office may always be requested. 

---|--- 
 



   8.8 |

Subject to the provisions of Articles 8.10 and 8.11, the Company may consider
the person in whose name the Shares are registered in the register of
shareholders as the full owner of such Shares. In the event that a holder of
Shares does not provide an address in writing to which all notices or
announcements from the Company may be sent, the Company may permit a notice
to this effect to be entered into the register of shareholders and such
holders address will be deemed to be at the registered office of the Company
or such other address as may be so entered by the Company from time to
time, until a different address shall be provided to the Company by such
holder in writing. The holder may, at any time, change his address as entered
in the register of shareholders by means of written notification to the
Company. 

---|--- 
 



   8.9 |

The Shares may be held by a holder through a securities settlement system or a
Depositary (as this term is defined below). The holder of Shares held in such
fungible securities accounts has the same rights and obligations as if such
holder held the Shares directly. The Shares held through a securities
settlement system or a Depositary shall be recorded in an account opened in
the name of the holder and may be transferred from one account to another in
accordance with customary procedures for the transfer of securities in book-
entry form. However, the Company will make dividend payments, if any, and any
other payments in cash, shares or other securities, if any, only to the
securities settlement system or Depositary recorded in the register of
shareholders or in accordance with the instructions of such securities
settlement system or Depositary. Such payment will grant full discharge of
the Companys obligations in this respect. 

---|--- 



   8.10 |

All communications and notices to be given to a registered shareholder shall
be deemed validly made if made to the latest address communicated by the
shareholder to the Company in accordance with this Article 8.9 or, if no
address has been communicated by the shareholder, the registered office of the
Company or such other address as may be so entered by the Company in the
register from time to time according to this Article 8.10. 

---|--- 



   8.11 |

Where Shares are recorded in the register of shareholders in the name of or on
behalf of a securities settlement system or the operator of such system and
recorded as book-entry interests in the accounts of a professional depositary
or any sub-depositary (any depositary and any sub-depositary being referred
to hereinafter as a "Depositary"), the Company  subject to having received
from the Depositary a certificate (or such other document as accepted by
the Company) in proper form  will permit the Depositary of such book-entry
interests to exercise the rights attaching to the Shares corresponding to the
book-entry interests of the relevant Holder, including receiving notices of
general meetings, admission to and voting at general meetings, and shall
consider the Depositary to be the holder of the Shares corresponding to the
book-entry interests for purposes of this Article 8 of the present articles of
association. The Board of Directors may determine the formal requirements
with which such certificates (or such other document as accepted by the
Company) must comply and the exercise of the rights in respect of such shares
may in addition be subject to the internal rules and procedures of the
securities settlement system.

       8.12 |

Any person who is required to report ownership of Shares on Schedule 13D or
13G pursuant to Rule 13d-1 or changes in such ownership pursuant to Rule
13d-2, each as promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, must notify the
Companys Board of Directors promptly following any reportable acquisition or
disposition, and in no event later than the filing date of such Schedule 13D
or 13G, of the proportion of Shares held by the relevant person as a result
of the acquisition or disposal. 

---|--- 

_Article 9. Transfer of Shares_

 

The Shares are freely transferable in accordance with the provisions of the
Law, subject to any contractual restrictions or restrictions on transfer
under applicable securities laws of any jurisdiction to which the Shares are
subject.

Without prejudice to the conditions for transfer by book entries provided for
in Article 8.10 of these Articles of Association, any transfer of Shares will
be registered in the register of shares by a declaration of transfer entered
into the register of shares, dated and signed by the transferor and the
transferee or by their representative(s) as well as in accordance with the
rules on the transfer of claims laid down in article 1690 of the Luxembourg
Civil Code. Furthermore, the Company may accept and enter into the register of
shares any transfer referred to in any correspondence or other document
recording the consent of the transferor and the transferee.

Ownership of a Share carries implicit acceptance of the Articles of
Association and of the resolutions validly adopted by the General Meeting.

A transfer of Shares in breach of provisions of the Articles of Association
shall be null and void.

_Article 10. Incapacity, Death, Suspension of Civil Rights, Bankruptcy or
Insolvency of a shareholder _

The incapacity, death, suspension of civil rights, bankruptcy, insolvency,
liquidation, or any other similar event affecting one or more shareholder(s)
does not put the Company into liquidation.

_CHAPTER III. BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AUDITORS_

 

 _Article 11. Board of Directors_

The Company shall be managed by a board of directors (the "Board of
Directors").

The Board of Directors shall be composed of not less than six (6)
members (the "Directors"), who may but do not need to be shareholders of the
Company themselves.

If and as long as the Company has only one (1) shareholder, the Board of
Directors may comprise one (1) Director only.

Each Director will be appointed by the General Meeting. The General Meeting
shall determine the number of Directors. The resolutions of the General
Meeting approving the appointment of a Director shall require a separate vote
for each individual candidate Director.

 

The Board of Directors shall qualify the Directors as a class A Director (the
"Class A Director"), a class B Director (the "Class B Director") or a class C
Director (the "Class C Director"), with the number of Directors in each class
to be divided as nearly equal as reasonably possible.

 

The mandate of the first appointed Class A Directors will terminate at the
annual general meeting of shareholders of the Company approving the
annual accounts for the financial year ended in 2021.

 



       |  |   |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  A42838903 |  |  |  | 
   |  | 5 |  | 
    

The mandate of the first appointed Class B Directors will terminate at the
annual general meeting of shareholders of the Company approving the annual
accounts for the financial year ended in 2022.

The mandate of the first appointed Class C Directors will terminate at the
annual general meeting of shareholders of the Company approving the annual
accounts for the financial year ended in 2023.

The duration of the mandate of any Directors subsequently appointed shall be
determined (i) so as not to exceed the date of the annual general meeting of
shareholders of the Company approving the annual accounts of the 3rd financial
year following their appointment and (ii) so as to ensure that the mandate of
all the Directors of the same class end on the same date and that a different
full class of Directors be fully renewed at each annual general meeting of
shareholders of the Company.

Each Director is eligible for re-appointment for successive terms and may be
removed at any time, with or without cause by a resolution of the General
Meeting.

 

In the event of a vacancy on the Board of Directors, the remaining Directors
may elect by co-optation a new Director to fill such vacancy until the next
General Meeting, which shall ratify such co-optation or elect a new Director
instead.

 

 _Article 12. Powers of the Board of Directors_

The Board of Directors is vested with the broadest powers to perform all acts
necessary or useful to accomplish the Companys purpose.

All powers not expressly reserved by the Articles of Association or by the
Laws to the General Meeting or to the Auditor(s) (as defined below) shall be
within the competence of the Board of Directors.

 

 _Article 13. Delegation of Powers - Representation of the Company _

 

The Board of Directors may delegate the daily management of the Company and
the representation of the Company for that daily management to one or more
persons or committees of its choice.

The Board of Directors may create one or several committees. The composition
and the powers of such committee(s), the terms of the appointment, removal,
remuneration and duration of the mandate of its/their members, as well as
its/their rules of procedure are determined by the Board of Directors. The
Board of Directors shall be in charge of the supervision of the activities of
the committee(s).

The Board of Directors may also grant other special powers of attorney or
entrust permanent or temporary tasks to one or more persons of its choice.
Such persons shall exercise the tasks entrusted to them under the supervision
of the Board of Directors.

The remuneration and other benefits granted to the person(s) to whom the
daily management has been delegated must be reported annually by the Board of
Directors to the General Meeting.

 

The Company will be bound towards third parties by the individual signature of
the sole Director or by the joint signatures of any three (3) Directors.

 

The Company will further be bound towards third parties by the joint
signatures or single signature of any person(s) to whom the daily management
of the Company has been delegated, for that daily management, or by the joint
signatures or sole signature of any person(s) to whom any special power of
attorney has been granted, but only within the limits of that special power of
attorney.

 

 _Article 14. Meetings of the Board of Directors _

 

The Board of Directors may appoint from among its members a chairperson (the
"Chairperson").

 



       |  |   |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  A42838903 |  |  |  | 
   |  | 6 |  | 
    

The Board of Directors will meet upon call by the Chairperson or by any
Director in accordance with the provisions of this article 14.

The Chairperson will preside over all meetings of the Board of Directors,
except that in the absence of the Chairperson, the Board of Directors may
appoint another Director as chairperson for the relevant meeting by a majority
of the votes of the Directors present or represented at such meeting.

 

Except in case of urgency or with the prior consent of all those entitled to
attend, which consent shall be recorded in the minutes of the meeting at
least forty-eight (48) hours written notice of meetings of the Board of
Directors shall be given in writing and transmitted by any means of
communication allowing for the transmission of a written text. Any such notice
shall specify the time and the place of the meeting, as well as the agenda
and the nature of the business to be resolved upon. The notice may be waived
by properly documented consent of each Director which consent shall be
recorded in the minutes of the meeting. No separate notice is required for
meetings held at times and places specified in a time schedule previously
adopted by resolution of the Board of Directors.

 

The meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held in Luxembourg or at such
other place as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine.

 

Any Director may be represented at any meeting of the Board of Directors by
appointing in writing, transmitted by any means of communication allowing for
the transmission of a written text, another Director as his proxy. Any
Director may represent one or more Directors.

The quorum for a valid meeting of the Board of Directors shall be the
presence or the representation of at least half (1/2) of the Directors.

When the rules of a foreign stock exchange require that, at least once a
year, only independent directors of the Company may hold a meeting of the
Board of Directors, the quorum required for a meeting of the Board of
Directors can be disregarded and the independent directors must all
be present or represented at such meeting. The independent directors may
appoint a chairman _pro tempore_ at such meetings.

Resolutions of the Board of Directors in a meeting will be taken by a
majority of the votes of the Directors present or represented at such meeting.
The Chairperson shall have no casting vote in case of a tie.

 

Directors may participate in a meeting by conference call, videoconference or
any other similar means of communication enabling thus several
persons participating therein to simultaneously communicate with each other
on a continuous basis. A meeting held using such means of communication is
deemed to have taken place at the Companys registered office.

 

A written resolution, signed by all the Directors and transmitted by any means
of communication allowing for the transmission of a written text, is proper
and valid as though it had been adopted at a meeting of the Board of
Directors which was duly convened and held. Such a resolution may be
documented in a single document or in several separate documents having the
same content and each of them signed by one or several Directors. A written
resolution passed in this way is deemed to have been taken at the Companys
registered office.

_Article 15. Resolutions of the Board of Directors_

The resolutions of the Board of Directors shall be recorded in writing.

 

The minutes of any meeting of the Board of Directors will be signed by the
Chairperson or the chairperson of the meeting or by any three (3) Directors. 

 



       |  |   |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  A42838903 |  |  |  | 
   |  | 7 |  | 
    

Copies or extracts of written resolutions or minutes, to be produced in
judicial proceedings or otherwise, may be signed by the sole Director or by
any three (3) Directors acting jointly.

In case of a sole Director, resolutions shall be documented in writing and
signed by the sole Director.

_Article 16. Management Fees and Expenses_

 

Subject to approval by the General Meeting, Directors may receive a management
fee for their management of the Company and may, in addition, be reimbursed
for all other expenses whatsoever incurred by the relevant Director in
relation to the management of the Company.

_Article 17. Conflicts of Interest _

If any Director has or may have a direct or indirect financial interest in any
transaction which requires the approval of the Board of Director(s), that
Director shall disclose that interest to the Board of Directors and shall not
take part of any deliberation or vote on any such transaction.

 

Such transaction and such Directors interest shall be disclosed in a special
report to the next General Meeting before any resolution is passed.

 

In case of a sole Director, record is kept in writing of the transactions
where the sole Director has such direct or indirect financial interest.

 

Where, due to a conflict of interests, the number of Directors required to be
present or represented for a valid quorum is not reached, the Board of
Directors may defer the decision to the General Meeting.

The foregoing paragraphs do not apply if the relevant transaction falls within
the ordinary course of business of the Company and is entered into at arms
length under market conditions.

No transaction between the Company and any other party shall be affected or
invalidated by the mere fact that a Director (or any one of its directors,
managers, officers or employees) is a director, manager, associate, member,
shareholder, officer or employee of that other party. Any person related as
described above to any company or firm with which the Company shall contract
or otherwise engage in business shall not, by reason of such affiliation, be
automatically prevented from considering, voting or acting upon any matters
with respect to such contract or other business.

The provisions of this article apply _mutatis mutandis_ to the persons to whom
the Board of Directors has delegated the daily management of the Company,
except that in case the Board of Directors has delegated the daily management
of the Company to a single person, the decision shall be deferred to the Board
of Directors.

 

 _Article 18. Directors  Liability; Indemnification _

 

Directors are not held personally liable for the indebtedness or other
obligations of the Company. As agents of the Company, they are responsible for
the performance of their duties. Subject to the exceptions and limitations
listed in below and mandatory provisions of law, every person who is, or has
been, a Director or officer of the Company (and his or her heirs, executors
and administrators) shall be indemnified by the Company to the fullest extent
permitted by law against liability and against all expenses reasonably
incurred or paid by such person in connection with any claim, action, suit or
proceeding which he becomes involved as a party or otherwise by virtue of his
or her being or having been a director or officer of the Company, or, at the
request of the Company, of any other company of which the Company is a
shareholder or creditor and by which he is not entitled to be indemnified,
and against amounts paid or incurred by him or her in the settlement thereof.
The words "claim", "action", "suit" or "proceeding" shall apply to all claims,
actions, suits or proceedings (civil, criminal or otherwise including
appeals) actual or threatened and the words "liability" and "expenses" shall
include without limitation attorneys fees, costs, judgments, amounts paid in
settlement and other liabilities. 

 



       |  |   |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  A42838903 |  |  |  | 
   |  | 8 |  | 
    

No indemnification shall be provided to any Director, officer or shareholder
(i) against any liability by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross
negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his
or her office (ii) with respect to any matter as to which he or she shall have
been finally adjudicated to have acted in bad faith and not in the interest
of the Company or (iii) in the event of a settlement, unless the settlement
has been approved by a court of competent jurisdiction or by the Board of
Directors.

 

The right of indemnification herein provided shall be severable, shall not
affect any other rights to which any director or officer may now or hereafter
be entitled, shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be such director
or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of such a person. Nothing contained herein shall affect or
limit any rights to indemnification to which corporate personnel, including
directors and officers, may be entitled by contract or otherwise under law.
The Company shall specifically be entitled to provide contractual
indemnification to and may purchase and maintain insurance for any corporate
personnel, including directors and officers of the Company, as the Company may
decide upon from time to time.

_Article 19. Confidentiality _

Even after cessation of their mandate or function, any Director, as well as
any person who is invited to attend a meeting of the Board of Directors,
shall not disclose information on the Company, the disclosure of which may
have adverse consequences for the Company, unless such divulgation is required
(i) by a legal or regulatory provision applicable to  _soci etes anonymes _or
(ii) for the public benefit.

_Article 20. Auditors_

 

The auditing of the Company may be entrusted to one or several auditors (
_commissaires_ ) __ (the "Auditors").

 

When so required by the Laws, the auditing of the Company must be entrusted to
one or several approved statutory auditors ( _r eviseurs dentreprises_ _agr
ees_) ("Reviseurs"). When a Reviseur is appointed, no Auditor needs to be
appointed.

 

The Auditors or Reviseurs, if any, will be appointed by the General Meeting,
which will determine the number of Auditors or Reviseurs and the duration of
their mandate. Each of them is eligible for re-appointment. Unless otherwise
provided by the Laws, they may be removed at any time, with or without cause,
by a resolution of the General Meeting. 

_CHAPTER IV. GENERAL MEETING_

_Article 21. Powers of the General Meeting_

The general meeting of shareholders (the "General Meeting") shall have such
powers as are vested in it pursuant to the Articles of Association and the
Laws.

_Article 22. Annual General Meeting_

 

An annual General Meeting shall be held in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg
within six (6) months of the end of the preceding financial year, except for
the first annual General Meeting which may be held within eighteen (18)

_Article 23. Other General Meetings_

 

The Board of Directors or the Auditor(s) (if any) may convene General Meetings
(in addition to the annual General Meeting). Such meetings must be convened
if shareholders representing at least ten per cent (10%) of the Companys
share capital so require.

General Meetings, including the annual General Meeting, will be held at the
registered office of the Company or at such other place in the Grand Duchy of
Luxembourg, and may be held abroad if, in the judgement of the Board of
Directors, circumstances of _force majeure_ so require.

 

 _Article 24. Notice of General Meetings_

The shareholders shall meet in a General Meeting upon issuance of a convening
notice in accordance with the Laws which shall specify the time and the place
of the General Meeting as well as the agenda and the nature of the business to
be resolved upon at the relevant General Meeting. The agenda for a General
Meeting shall also describe any proposed changes to the Articles of
Association and, if applicable, set out the text of those changes affecting
the purpose or form of the Company. If the Shares are listed on a foreign
stock exchange, the requirements of such foreign stock exchange applicable to
the Company shall additionally be complied with.

 

If the Shares are listed on a foreign stock exchange, all shareholders of the
Company (for the avoidance of doubt, including any registered shareholder,
any Depositary and, without prejudice to any requirements as set out in any
other provision of these Articles of Association, any Holder) are entitled to
be admitted to any General Meeting, provided, however, that the Board of
Directors may determine a date and time preceding the General Meeting as the
record date for admission to such meeting, which may not be less than five (5)
calendar days before the date of such meeting (the "Record Date").

 

Shareholders holding individually or collectively at least ten (10) per cent
of the issued share capital of the Company, may request the addition of
one or several new items on the agenda of the General Meeting. This right
shall be exercised upon request of the shareholders in writing submitted to
the Company by registered letter at the address of the registered office of
the Company. The requests shall include the details requested in the
convening notice. The requests from the shareholders shall be received by the
Company no later than five (5) calendar days before the General Meeting.

 

 _Article 25. Attendance - Representation _

 

Each shareholder is entitled to attend and speak at any General Meeting.

 

A shareholder may be represented at any General Meeting by another person (who
does not need to be a shareholder) appointed in writing (transmitted by
any means of communication allowing for the transmission of a written text)
as a proxyholder by the shareholder. A proxyholder may represent more than one
(1) shareholder.

 

Shareholders taking part in a meeting by conference call, through video
conference or by any other means of communication allowing for their
identification, allowing all persons taking part in the meeting to hear one
another on a continuous basis and allowing for an effective participation of
all such persons in the meeting, are deemed to be present for the computation
of the quorums and votes, subject to such means of communication being made
available at the place of the meeting. A General Meeting held in this way is
deemed to have taken place at the Companys registered office.

 

 _Article 26. Proceedings_

Any General Meeting shall be presided over by the Chairperson or, in the
absence of the Chairperson, by a person designated by the Board of Directors
or, in the absence of such designation, by a resolution of the General
Meeting.

The chairperson of the General Meeting shall appoint a secretary.

 

By resolution of the General Meeting one (1) scrutineer shall be appointed

In connection with each General Meeting, the Board of Directors is authorized
to provide such rules of deliberations and such conditions for
allowing shareholders to take part in the meeting as the Board of Directors
deems appropriate.

Except to the extent inconsistent with the rules and conditions as adopted by
the Board of Directors, the person presiding over the General Meeting shall
have the power and authority to prescribe such additional rules and conditions
and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such person, are appropriate
for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules and conditions, whether
adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the person presiding over
the meeting, may include, in each case to the extent permitted by applicable
law:

 



   (a) |

determining the order of business for the meeting; 

---|--- 
 



   (b) |

rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of
those present;  

---|--- 



   (c) |

limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to shareholders
of record, their duly authorized and constituted attorneys or such other
persons as the person presiding over the meeting shall determine; 

---|--- 



   (d) |

restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement
thereof; and  

---|--- 



   (e) |

limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants.

 _Article 27. Adjournment_

Without limiting the generality of article 26 and irrespective of the agenda,
the Board of Directors may adjourn any General Meeting in accordance with the
formalities and time limits stipulated for by the Law.

 

Such adjournment automatically cancels any resolution already adopted prior
thereto.

 

The adjourned General Meeting has the same agenda as the first one. Shares and
proxies regularly deposited in view of the first meeting remain
validly deposited for the second one.

_Article 28. Voting at General Meetings_

 

An attendance list indicating the name of each shareholder and the number of
Shares for which he votes is signed by or on behalf of each shareholder
present or represented by proxy, prior to the start of the General Meeting.

The Board of Directors may in its sole discretion authorize each shareholder
to vote at a General Meeting through a signed voting form sent by post,
electronic mail, facsimile or any other means of communication to the
Companys registered office or to the address specified in the convening
notice. Subject to such authorization by the Board of Directors, the
shareholders may only use voting forms provided by the Company which contain
at least the date, place and time of the meeting, the agenda of the meeting
and the text of the proposed resolutions. For each resolution, the form must
contain three boxes allowing for a vote for or against that resolution or an
abstention. the place, date and time of the meeting, the agenda of the
meeting, the proposals submitted to the shareholders, as well as for each
proposal three boxes allowing the shareholder to vote in favor thereof,
against, or abstain from voting by ticking the appropriate box. For the
avoidance of doubt, shareholders may not vote by voting forms where the Board
of Directors has not authorized such voting method for a given General
Meeting.

 



       |  |   |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  A42915260 |  |  |  | 
   |  | 11 |  | 
    

Voting forms which, for a proposed resolution, do not show (i) a vote in favor
of the proposed resolution, (ii) a vote against the proposed resolution or
(iii) an abstention from voting on the proposed resolution, are void with
respect to such resolution. If a shareholder votes by means of a voting form,
the voting form shall be deposited at the registered office of the Company or
with an agent of the Company duly authorized to receive such voting forms. The
Company shall only take into account voting forms received no later than three
(3) business days prior to the date of the General Meeting to which they
relate. The Board of Directors may set a shorter period for the submission of
the voting forms.

If a shareholder votes by means of proxy, the proxy shall be deposited at the
registered office of the Company or with an agent of the Company duly
authorized to receive such proxies. The Company shall only take into account
proxies received no later than three (3) business days prior to the date of
the General Meeting to which they relate. The Board of Directors may set a
shorter period for the submission of the proxies.

 

A holder of Shares held through the operator of a securities settlement system
or with a Depositary wishing to attend a General Meeting must provide
the Company with a certificate issued by such operator or Depositary
certifying the number of Shares recorded in the relevant account on the Record
Date. Such certificate must be provided to the Company no later than three (3)
business days prior to the date of such general meeting. If such holder of
shares votes by means of a proxy, article 28 of these Articles of Association
shall apply.

 

Resolutions the adoption of which is not subject to the quorum and the
majority requirements for an amendment of the Articles of Association, shall
be adopted, irrespective of the number of Shares represented, by a simple
majority of votes cast.

For resolutions the adoption of which is subject to the quorum and majority
requirements for an amendment of the Articles of Association, the quorum shall
be at least one half (1/2) of all the Shares issued and outstanding and the
resolutions shall be adopted by a two thirds (2/3rds) majority of the votes
cast. If the said quorum is not reached at a first meeting, a second meeting
may be convened and resolutions shall be adopted, irrespective of the number
of Shares represented, by a two thirds (2/3rds) majority of the votes cast.

 

 _Article 29. Minutes_

The minutes of a General Meeting shall be signed by the members of the board
of that General Meeting and may be signed by or on behalf of any shareholders,
who so request.

 

 _CHAPTER V. FINANCIAL YEAR, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, DISTRIBUTION OF PROFITS_

 

 _Article 30. Financial Year_

The Companys financial year begins on the first day of January and ends on
the last day of December of each calendar year.

_Article 31. Adoption of Financial Statements_

  A42915260 |  |  |  | 
   |  | 12 |  | 
    

Each shareholder or his representative may also peruse the financial
statements of the Company at the registered office of the Company.

_Article 32. Distribution of Profits_

 

From the annual net profits of the Company, at least five per cent (5%) shall
each year be allocated to the reserve required by Laws (the "Legal Reserve").
That allocation to the Legal Reserve will cease to be required as soon and as
long as the Legal Reserve amounts to ten per cent (10%) of the amount of the
share capital of the Company.

 

The General Meeting shall resolve how the remainder of the annual net profits,
after allocation to the Legal Reserve in accordance with the
previous paragraph, will be disposed of by allocating the whole or part of
the remainder to a reserve or to a provision, by carrying it forward to the
next following financial year or by distributing it, together with carried
forward profits, distributable reserves or share premium to the
shareholder(s), each Share entitling to the same proportion in such
distributions.

Subject to the provisions of the Laws and in compliance with the provisions
in the previous two paragraphs, the Board of Directors may resolve that the
Company pays out an interim dividend to the shareholders. The Board of
Directors shall set the amount and the date of payment of the interim
dividend.

Any share premium, assimilated premium or other distributable reserve may be
freely distributed to the shareholders subject to the provisions of the Law
and the Articles of Association.

_CHAPTER VI. DISSOLUTION, LIQUIDATION_

 

 _Article 33. Dissolution, Liquidation_

The Company may be dissolved by a resolution of the General Meeting adopted
in compliance with the quorum and majority rules set for any amendment of the
Articles of Association.

 

Should the Company be dissolved, the liquidation will be carried out by the
Board of Directors or such other person(s) (who may be physical persons or
legal entities) appointed by the General Meeting. The General Meeting shall
also determine the powers and the compensation (if any) of those other
person(s).

 

After settlement of all the debts and liabilities of the Company, including
the expenses of liquidation, the net liquidation proceeds shall be distributed
to the shareholder(s) in compliance with the same preference as set out for
dividend distributions.

In case the Company has only one (1) shareholder, it may also be dissolved
without liquidation in accordance with article 1865bis of the Luxembourg Civil
Code.

_CHAPTER VII. APPLICABLE LAW _

_Article 34. Applicable Law_

All matters not governed by the Articles of Association shall be determined
in accordance with the Laws."

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and of the mutual consents

ARTICLE II

 

NOMINATION AGREEMENTS PRIOR TO NOMINATION TERMINATION TIME

 

Section 2.1 _Board Nomination Rights_.

 

(a) _Board Composition_. The size of the Board shall be such number as
approved by the shareholders of the Company at a General Meeting. 

(b) _Shareholder Nominees_. In connection with any General Meeting at which
Directors are to be elected, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, the
Shareholder shall have the right to propose for appointment a number of
Directors that equals a majority of the Board (each such Director proposed for
appointment by the Shareholder, a " _Shareholder Director_ "). At least one-
half of the Shareholder Directors must qualify as Independent Directors,
subject to any independence requirements established by the listing rules of
the stock exchange on which the Ordinary Shares are listed that would require
a greater number of Shareholder Directors to qualify as Independent Directors,
provided that the Shareholder shall not be required to nominate any additional
Independent Directors unless and until all of the Directors, other than the
Shareholder Directors, qualify as Independent Directors.

   

(i) For so long as the Directors on the Board are divided into three classes,
the Board will use reasonable efforts to apportion the Shareholder Directors
among such classes so as to maintain the number of Shareholder Directors in
each class as nearly equal as possible.

 

(ii) For so long as the Company maintains an Audit Committee, Compensation
Committee or Nominating Committee, such committees shall each include at
least one Shareholder Director (but only to the extent such Director (A)
qualifies as an Independent Director and (B) with respect to membership on the
Audit Committee or Compensation Committee, meets the heightened
independence requirements applicable to audit committees and compensation
committees, as applicable, under the Securities Exchange Commission and within
the context of the criteria established by the listing rules of the stock
exchange on which the Ordinary Shares are listed).

(c) _Death; Retirement; Resignation; Removal; Vacancies_. __ If a vacancy on
the Board is caused by the death, retirement, resignation or removal of any
Shareholder Director pursuant to this _ Section_ __ _ 2.1_, then the
Shareholder shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, have the
right to propose an individual to be appointed to fill such vacancy for the
remainder of the deceased, retired, resigned or removed, as applicable,
Directors term, and the Company shall take all action to cause such
Shareholder Director to be appointed to the Board.

 

(d) _Additional Nomination Procedures_.

 

(i) In connection with any General Meeting at which Directors are to be
elected, the Company shall treat any Shareholder Director previously proposed
for appointment in accordance with _ Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_ and who is then
in office as a Shareholder Director unless and until the Company receives
contrary notice from the Shareholder. With respect to any person that will be
proposed for appointment as a Shareholder Director for the first time at any
General Meeting by the Shareholder, Shareholder shall propose such Shareholder
Director for appointment by delivering to the Company a written statement at
least 90 days prior to the one-year anniversary of the preceding annual
General Meeting that (A) informs the Company of such Shareholder Directors
nomination and (B) sets forth such Shareholder Directors name, business
address, telephone number, and e-mail address. The Company may require any
Shareholder Director to (i) provide the Company with a completed and executed
copy of the Companys standard director questionnaire applicable to all other
Directors; (ii) provide the Company with the Shareholder Directors written
consent to a customary background check, which consent shall be provided
promptly after the Shareholder Director is nominated to the Board; (iii)
complete a reasonably satisfactory interview with the Nominating Committee (or
similarly designated committee) and Board, which shall be completed as
promptly as practicable following receipt of a completed director
questionnaire; and (iv) provide such other information as the Company may
reasonably request, including information that the Company is required to
disclose with respect to such Shareholder Director pursuant to applicable Law
or the rules of any securities exchange on which the Ordinary Shares are
listed.

   

(ii) The Nominating Committee shall evaluate each Shareholder Director and
determine whether such candidate satisfies the qualifications contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(d)_ (with such determination to be made in good faith and
not to be unreasonably made, withheld or delayed). If the Nominating Committee
so determines that such candidate satisfies such qualifications, then, unless
otherwise required by its fiduciary duties (as determined in good faith by the
Nominating Committee after consultation with legal counsel), the Nominating
Committee shall recommend such Shareholder Director to the Board for
inclusion in the slate of directors that is included in any proxy statement
(or similar document) of the Company in respect of any General Meeting at
which Directors are to be elected.

 

(iii) In the event the Board or the Nominating Committee declines, in good
faith, to approve any Shareholder Director, the Shareholder may propose a new
nominee in accordance with the approval process described in this _Section_ __
_ 2.1(d)_ until a nominee is approved in accordance with this Section. If the
Company identifies any reason under applicable Law why a person proposed for
appointment as a Director pursuant to _ Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_ cannot be
seated as a Director, then (x) the Company shall promptly notify the
Shareholder of that fact and (y) the Company and the Shareholder shall
cooperate in good faith to eliminate such impediment or the Shareholder shall
identify another nominee in accordance with this _ Section_ __ _ 2.1_.

 

Section 2.2 At any time the Shareholder or its Affiliates, in the aggregate,
beneficially own at least 50% of the outstanding Ordinary Shares, the
Shareholder agrees that it shall (and shall cause its respective Affiliates
to) not take any action to attempt to remove any Director, other than a
Shareholder Director, without cause.

 

Section 2.3 _Assurances_.

 

(a) The Shareholder agrees that it shall (and shall cause its respective
Affiliates to) cooperate in facilitating any action or right described in or
required by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Shareholder further agrees that it shall to the maximum extent permitted
by law:

 

(i) cause to be counted as present for purposes of establishing quorum and to
vote (or cause to be voted) all shares of the Company that the Shareholder or
its Affiliates (x) beneficially own and have the power to vote or cause the
voting of or (y) over which the Shareholder holds proxies or powers of
attorney, as the case may be, and take all other actions necessary to: (1)
give effect to the provisions of this Agreement; (2) ensure that the Articles
facilitate and do not at any time contravene, conflict with, or result in any
violation or breach of, or otherwise frustrate any provision of this
Agreement; and (3) ensure that the initial Board is comprised of the
individuals set forth on Exhibit C of the Business Combination Agreement;

 

(ii) cause to be counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum and
to vote (or cause to be voted) all shares of the Company that the Shareholder
or its Affiliates (x) beneficially own and have the power to vote or cause the
voting of or (y) over which the Shareholder holds proxies or powers of
attorney, as the case may be, and take all actions to oppose (1) any action
or proposal that is reasonably likely to impair, delay, frustrate or otherwise
serve to interfere with any provision of this Agreement (including removing or
supporting the removal of any Director) and (2) any shareholder proposal to
amend, modify or supplement Article 11 of the Articles, or to amend, modify or
supplement the Articles that would otherwise act as an amendment, modification
or supplement to Article 11 of the Articles that is not supported by the
Board; and

   

(iii) not (1) solicit proxies or become a participant in any solicitation of
proxies, or (2) cooperate in any way with, assist or participate in,
knowingly encourage or otherwise facilitate or encourage any effort or
attempt, in each case, that is reasonably likely to impair, delay, frustrate
or otherwise serve to interfere with any provision of this Agreement.

(b) The Company agrees that it shall (and shall cause its controlled
Affiliates to) cooperate in facilitating any action or right described in or
required by this Agreement. __ Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company further agrees that it shall to the maximum extent
permitted by law:

 

(i) take all actions necessary to: (1) give effect to the provisions of this
Agreement (including (x) nominating each Shareholder Director as part of the
slate that is included in any proxy statement (or similar document) of the
Company in respect of any General Meeting at which Directors are to be
elected, (y) supporting the election of such Shareholder Director in a manner
substantially similar to the support it provides to any other individual
standing for election as a Director as part of the Companys slate of
directors) and (2) submit proposals to the General Meeting of any other
amendment, modification or supplement of the Articles to ensure that the
Articles do not at any time contravene, conflict with, or result in any
violation or breach of, or otherwise frustrate any provision of this
Agreement;

 

(ii) take all actions to oppose: (1) any action or proposal that is reasonably
likely to impair, delay, frustrate or otherwise serve to interfere with any
provision of this Agreement (including (x) removing or supporting the removal
of any Shareholder Director (except at the direction of the Shareholder) or
(y) nominating a number of Director nominees for any election of Directors
that exceeds the number of Directors to be elected at any General Meeting or
otherwise impairing, delaying, frustrating or otherwise interfering with the
rights of the Shareholder set forth in this _ Article II_), and (2)
any amendment, modification or supplement of the Articles that would
contravene, conflict with, result in any violation or breach of any provision
or otherwise frustrate any provision of this Agreement; and

 

(iii) not (1) solicit proxies or participate in a solicitation, (2) assist any
Person in taking or planning any action, or (3) cooperate in any way with,
assist or participate in, knowingly encourage or otherwise facilitate or
encourage any effort or attempt, in each case, that is reasonably likely to
impair, delay, frustrate or otherwise serve to interfere with any provision
of this Agreement (including the rights of the Shareholder set forth in this _
Article II_).

ARTICLE III 

TERMINATION

 

Section 3.1 _Termination_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, unless earlier terminated by the mutual agreement of the Company
and the Shareholder, this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon the
date on which the Shareholder or its Affiliates cease to beneficially own, in
the aggregate, 30% of the outstanding Ordinary Shares. Upon such termination,
the Shareholder shall not have or owe any of the rights or obligations set
forth therein (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the rights set forth in
_Article II_ ). No termination under this Agreement shall relieve any Person
of liability for breach prior to termination.

limitation of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the
Warrant Agent, the Company and the holders (the words " _holders_ " or "

but without payment of any service charge, for another Warrant Certificate
or Warrant Certificates of like tenor evidencing in the aggregate a like
number of Warrants.

Certificate at the office of the Warrant Agent a new Warrant Certificate or
Warrant Certificates of like tenor and evidencing in the aggregate a like

Warrant Certificate, subject to the limitations provided in the Warrant
Agreement, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge
imposed in connection therewith.

hereof as the absolute owner(s) of this Warrant Certificate (notwithstanding
any notation of ownership or other writing hereon made by anyone), for the
purpose of any exercise hereof, of any distribution to the holder(s) hereof,
and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Warrant Agent
shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. Neither the Warrants nor
this Warrant Certificate entitles any holder hereof to any rights of a
stockholder of the Company.
