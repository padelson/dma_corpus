ARTICLE 2

PURCHASE AND SALE OF MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS; CONSIDERATION AND PAYMENT

| 
---|--- 

2.1

|

Purchase and Sale of the Membership Interests 

Upon and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, at
the Closing, Seller shall sell, transfer and deliver to Buyer, free and clear
of all Liens (other than restrictions on the transfer of securities arising
under applicable federal and state securities Laws), and Buyer shall purchase
from Seller, all right, title and interest in and to the Membership Interests.

| 
---|--- 

2.2

|

Consideration 

The consideration (the "Purchase Price") for the sale of the Membership
Interests to Buyer shall be Three Hundred Thirty Million, Four Hundred Eighty
Thousand Dollars and No/100 ($330,480,000.00). The "Adjusted Purchase Price"
shall be the Purchase Price as adjusted under Section 2.5.

| 
---|--- 

2.3

|

Escrow 

Contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, (a) Buyer, Seller and
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the "Escrow Agent") entered into the
Deposit Escrow Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the
"Deposit Escrow Agreement"), and (b) Buyer deposited an amount equal to seven
and one-half percent (7.5%) of the Purchase Price with the Escrow Agent into
an account (the "Escrow Account") as a deposit hereunder (such amount,
together with all interest earned thereon, the "Cash Deposit"). The Cash
Deposit shall be held and distributed by the Escrow Agent in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and the Deposit Escrow Agreement.

| 
---|--- 

2.4

|

Payment of Closing Consideration 

At the Closing, (a) Buyer shall wire transfer the Adjusted Purchase Price
minus the Cash Deposit and any amounts to be deposited with the Escrow Agent
pursuant to Section 5.5(a) and Section 6.8(a) (such amount, the "Closing
Amount") in immediately available funds to one or more accounts specified by
Seller, and (b) Buyer and Seller shall provide written instructions to the
Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to disburse the Cash Deposit and any
interest earned thereon pursuant to the Deposit Escrow Agreement to Seller.

| 
---|--- 

2.5

|

Purchase Price Adjustment 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

The Purchase Price shall be adjusted according to this Section 2.5. Seller
shall deliver to Buyer not less than three (3) Business Days immediately
preceding the Closing Date a statement (the "Preliminary Settlement
Statement") setting forth Seller\'s preliminary good faith determination of
the Adjusted Purchase Price, together with reasonably supporting documentation
of the same. The Preliminary Settlement Statement shall set forth the Adjusted
Purchase Price as provided in this Section 2.5 using the best information
available at the date Seller delivers the Preliminary Settlement Statement. In
calculating the various adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to this
Section 2.5, no single item shall be given duplicative effect. After delivery
of the Preliminary Settlement Statement by Seller, Buyer will have an
opportunity to review such Preliminary Settlement Statement, and Buyer and
Seller shall work together in good faith to address any reasonable requests
for adjustments to the Preliminary Settlement Statement made by Buyer on or
before the Closing Date; provided that if Buyer and Seller are unable to
resolve any disagreement regarding the Preliminary 3



Settlement Statement prior to Closing, the Preliminary Settlement Statement
delivered by Seller shall be used for purposes of calculating the Closing
Amount.

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

For purposes of determining the amounts of the adjustments to the Purchase
Price provided for in Section 2.5, the principles set forth in this Section
2.5(b) shall apply. Buyer shall be entitled to all production of hydrocarbons
from or attributable to the Subject Assets at and after the Effective Time
(and all products and proceeds attributable thereto), and to all other income,
proceeds, receipts and credits earned with respect to the Subject Assets at or
after the Effective Time, and shall be responsible for (and entitled to any
refunds with respect to) all Property Expenses (as defined in Section 2.5(c))
incurred at and after the Effective Time. Seller shall be entitled to all
hydrocarbon production from or attributable to Subject Assets prior to the
Effective Time (and all products and proceeds attributable thereto), and to
all other income, proceeds, receipts and credits earned with respect to the
Subject Assets prior to the Effective Time, and shall be responsible for (and
entitled to any refunds with respect to) all Property Expenses incurred prior
to the Effective Time. "Earned" and "incurred", as used in the Agreement shall
be interpreted in accordance with GAAP and Council of Petroleum Accountants
Society standards, except as otherwise specified herein. For purposes of
allocating production (and proceeds and accounts receivable with respect
thereto), under this Section 2.5, (i) liquid hydrocarbons shall be deemed to
be "from or attributable to" the Subject Assets when they pass through the
pipeline connecting into the storage facilities into which they are run and
(ii) gaseous hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or attributable to" the
Subject Assets when they pass through the royalty measurement meters, delivery
point sales meters or custody transfer meters on the gathering lines or
pipelines through which they are transported (whichever meter is closest to
the well). Seller shall utilize reasonable interpolative procedures,
consistent with industry practice, to arrive at an allocation of production
when exact meter readings or gauging and strapping data are not available. As
part of the Preliminary Settlement Statement, Seller shall provide to Buyer
such data as is reasonably necessary to support any estimated allocation, for
purposes of establishing the Adjusted Purchase Price. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

The term "Property Expenses" means all (i) direct costs and expenses
(including capital expenditures and lease operating expenses) of ownership,
exploration, maintenance, development, production and operation of the Subject
Assets or acquiring new oil and gas leases after the Effective Time but on or
before the Execution Date, which are within the Bakken Drillsite Spacing Units
and listed on Schedule 2.5(c) (including, for this purpose, prepayments of any
such costs or expenses), which costs and expenses shall include (x) Asset
Taxes, but exclude any other Taxes and also exclude any costs and expenses of
operating the office of Seller in Denver, Colorado, or the costs to the
Company or its Affiliates of employees in that office; and (y) with respect to
the Subject Assets operated by the Company or its Affiliates, all direct costs
and expenses (including capital expenditures, lease operating expenses,
facilities and plant expenses, and joint interest billings) chargeable to the
joint account under the applicable Contract or in accordance with any Law of
any Governmental Authority in connection with the exploration, maintenance,
development, production and operation of such Subject Assets, and (ii) all
overhead charges paid by the Seller, the Company or any of their Affiliates
before the Closing Time to any third-party operator of any of the Subject
Assets and incurred with respect to the time period (the "Adjustment Period")
beginning at the Effective Time and ending at 7:00 A.M. (local time) on the
Closing Date (such time being the "Closing Time"). 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Upward Adjustments. To calculate the Adjusted Purchase Price, the Purchase
Price shall be adjusted upward by the following: 4


| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

Proceeds received by Buyer (less any royalties and other non-Tax burdens and
Asset Taxes measured by or payable out of such production to the extent not
included in Property Expenses), from the sale of any hydrocarbons or otherwise
that were produced from or attributable to the Subject Assets prior to the
Effective Time. 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

An amount equal to all Property Expenses attributable to the Subject Assets
during the Adjustment Period that were paid by the Company, Seller or any of
their Affiliates. 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

An amount equal to all amounts paid by Seller or any of its Affiliates as a
performance bond or security deposit outstanding at the Closing Date and
attributable to the Subject Assets. 

| 
---|--- 

(iv)

|

An amount equal to, with respect to the Subject Assets operated by the Seller,
(i) if there is an existing operating agreement in place for such Subject
Assets, the overhead chargeable to the joint account pursuant to each of the
existing operating agreements for such Subject Assets and incurred with
respect to the Adjustment Period, and (ii) if, during the Adjustment Period,
there is no existing operating agreement in place for such Subject Assets, an
overhead amount equal to the Seller's Working Interest portion of $12,000 per
Well per month undergoing drilling or completion operations and $1,200 per
producing Well per month, and for which, in the case of clause (i) or (ii),
neither the Company, the Seller nor any of their Affiliates have received
reimbursement before the Closing from the other parties in the case of clause
(i) bound by any such operating agreement or in the case of clause (ii) in the
unit for such Well. 

| 
---|--- 

(v)

|

Any other amount provided for in this Agreement as payable by Buyer to Seller
or as may otherwise be agreed to by Buyer and Seller. 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

Downward Adjustments. To calculate the Adjusted Purchase Price, the Purchase
Price shall be adjusted downward by the following: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

An amount equal to the Title Defect Adjustment, if any. 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

An amount equal to the Environmental Defect Adjustment, if any. 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

An amount equal to the Excluded Environmental Adjustment, if any. 

| 
---|--- 

(iv)

|

Gross proceeds (less any royalties and other non-Tax burdens and Asset Taxes
measured by or payable out of such production to the extent not included in
Property Expenses) received by the Seller, the Company or their Affiliates (A)
from the sale or disposition of hydrocarbons produced from the Subject Assets
during the Adjustment Period, (B) from the rental, sale, salvage, or other
disposition of any other Subject Assets on or after the Effective Time or (C)
otherwise attributable to the ownership of the Subject Assets during the
Adjustment Period (excluding, however, all Property Expenses for which the
Company or any of its Affiliates receives reimbursement before the Closing
Time from the other parties bound by any such operating agreement). 

| 
---|--- 

(v)

|

If applicable, the amount provided in Schedule 2.5(e)(v). 

| 
---|--- 

(vi)

|

Any other amount provided for in this Agreement as payable by Seller to Buyer
or as may otherwise be agreed to by Buyer and Seller. 5


| 
---|--- 

2.6

|

Post Closing Review 

After the Closing, Seller shall review the Preliminary Settlement Statement
and determine the actual Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.5. On
or prior to the ninetieth (90th) day after the Closing Date, Seller shall
present Buyer with a statement of the actual Purchase Price adjustments and
such supporting documentation as is reasonably necessary to support the
Adjusted Purchase Price shown therein (the "Final Settlement Statement").
Buyer will give representatives of Seller or its Affiliates reasonable access
to its premises and to the books and records of Buyer and the Company for
purposes of preparing the Final Settlement Statement and will cause
appropriate personnel of Buyer and, if applicable, the Company to assist
Seller, its Affiliates, and its and their representatives, at no cost to
Seller, in the preparation of the Final Settlement Statement. Seller will, and
will cause its Affiliates to, give representatives of Buyer and, if
applicable, the Company, reasonable access to its and their premises and to
its and their books and records for purposes of reviewing the calculation of
the Adjusted Purchase Price set forth in the Final Settlement Statement and
will cause appropriate personnel of Seller and its Affiliates to assist Buyer
and its representatives, at no cost to Buyer or the Company, in verification
of such calculation. The Final Settlement Statement shall become final and
binding on Seller and Buyer sixty (60) days following the date the Final
Settlement Statement is received by Buyer, except to the extent that prior to
the expiration of such sixty (60) day period, Buyer shall deliver to Seller
notice, as hereinafter required, of its disagreement with the contents of the
Final Settlement Statement. Such notice shall be in writing and set forth all
of Buyer\'s disagreements with respect to any portion of the Final Settlement
Statement, together with Buyer\'s proposed changes thereto, and shall include
an explanation in reasonable detail of, and such supporting documentation as
is reasonably necessary to support, such changes. If Buyer has timely
delivered such a notice of disagreement to Seller, then, upon written
agreement between Buyer and Seller resolving all disagreements of Buyer set
forth in such notice, the Final Settlement Statement will become final and
binding upon Buyer and Seller. If the Final Settlement Statement has not
become final and binding by the ninetieth (90th) day following its receipt by
Buyer, then Buyer or Seller may submit any unresolved disagreements of Buyer
set forth in such notice to the Houston, Texas office of KPMG LLP (the
"Independent Accounting Firm") who shall be designated to act as an arbitrator
and to decide all points of disagreement with respect to the Final Settlement
Statement, such decision to be binding upon Buyer and Seller. Buyer and Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such arbitrator to render
its decision within fifteen (15) Business Days after such points of
disagreement are submitted to such arbitrator. The costs and expenses of such
arbitrator shall be borne equally by Seller and Buyer. Upon resolution of such
unresolved disagreements, the Final Settlement Statement shall be final and
binding upon the Parties. The date upon which such agreement is reached or
upon which the final Adjusted Purchase Price is established shall be herein
called the "Final Settlement Date." If the Adjusted Purchase Price shown in
the Final Settlement Statement is more than the Adjusted Purchase Price shown
in the Preliminary Settlement Statement, Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount
of such difference by wire transfer in immediately available funds no later
than five (5) Business Days after the Final Settlement Date. If the Adjusted
Purchase Price shown in the Final Settlement Statement is less than the
Adjusted Purchase Price shown in the Preliminary Settlement Statement, Seller
shall pay the amount of such difference, to Buyer by wire transfer in
immediately available funds no later than five (5) Business Days after the
Final Settlement Date.

to this ARTICLE 5. For all purposes of this Agreement, Buyer shall be deemed
to have waived any Title Defect which Buyer fails to assert as a Title Defect
by written notice given to Seller on or before 5:00 P.M., Mountain Time, on
the Defect Notice Date. To be effective, Buyer\'s written notice of a Title
Defect must by asserted in good faith and include (i) a description of the
alleged Title Defect Property, (ii) the Allocated Value of the alleged Title
Defect Property, (iii) a brief description of the matter constituting the
asserted Title Defect and the basis for such Title Defect, (iv) the Title
Defect Amount attributable thereto claimed in good faith by Buyer, (v) the
computations for such Title Defect Amount, (vi) to the extent then known by
Buyer, the necessary curative for each Title Defect, and 16



(vii) supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller (as well as any
title attorney or examiner hired by Seller) to verify the existence of such
asserted Title Defect; provided, however, that to the extent that Seller and
Buyer are in disagreement as to whether or not Buyer\'s written notice of
Title Defect is effective as provided above, Seller and Buyer shall resolve
such dispute pursuant to Section 5.5 of this Agreement. To give Seller an
opportunity to commence reviewing and curing Title Defects, on a weekly basis,
Buyer shall give Seller written notice of any Title Defect that Buyer
determines exists, which notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented
prior to 5:00 P.M., Mountain Time, on the Defect Notice Date; provided,
however, any failure of Buyer to deliver such notice shall not constitute a
breach of this Agreement.

| 
---|--- 

(g)

|

Allocation of Consideration. Solely for the purposes of ARTICLE 5 and ARTICLE
6, the allocated value of each Property Subdivision shall be the value
specified for such Property Subdivision in Part II of Exhibit A (the
"Allocated Value"). 

| 
---|--- 

(h)

|

Seller\'s Opportunity to Cure. 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

Seller shall have until one (1) day before the Closing Date, at its sole cost
and expense, if it so elects but without obligation, to cure all or a portion
of such asserted Title Defects. Subject to Seller\'s continuing right to
dispute the existence of a Title Defect and/or the Title Defect Amount
asserted with respect thereto, if Seller within such time fails to cure any
Title Defect of which Buyer has given a timely and effective written notice as
required above and Buyer has not and does not waive same on or before the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Property Subdivision affected by
such uncured and unwaived Title Defect shall be a "Title Defect Property". 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

To the extent that a Title Defect is based on Seller\'s failure to have
Defensible Title to a Bakken Drillsite Spacing Unit, Seller may cure such
defect by securing, at its sole cost and expense, in the Seller\'s name new or
renewal leases with reasonable primary terms and royalty rates covering a
sufficient number of net mineral acres within the Bakken Drillsite Spacing
Unit to elevate Seller\'s Net Revenue in such unit to an amount not less than
set forth on Part II(A) of Exhibit A for such unit. 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

In addition, Seller may attempt to cure any Title Defect at any time after
Closing but prior to the deadline for submitting a Final Settlement Statement
under Section 2.6. Upon curing of any such Title Defect, Seller may include in
the Final Settlement Statement an amount due Seller arising from such title
curative. 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

Buyer\'s Title Adjustments. Subject to (w) Section 5.5, (x) the special
warranty of Defensible Title contained in Section 3.1(m), (y) Buyer\'s
termination right as provided in Section 13.1(a), and (z) Seller\'s
termination right as provided in Section 13.2(b), as Buyer\'s sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to Title Defects, Buyer shall be entitled to
reduce the Purchase Price by an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which
the aggregate amount of Title Defect Amounts with respect to all Title Defect
Properties exceeds the Title Defect Deductible (such amount in excess of the
Title Defect Deductible, the "Title Defect Adjustment"). "Title Defect Amount"
shall mean, with respect to a Title Defect Property, the amount by which the
value of such Title Defect Property is impaired as a result of the existence
of one or more uncured and unwaived Title Defects, which amount shall be
determined as follows: 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

If Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, then that amount shall
be the Title Defect Amount. 17


| 
---|--- 

(iv)

|

If the Title Defect results from the Seller owning a lesser Net Revenue
Interest in such Title Defect Property than the Net Revenue Interest specified
therefor in Part II(A) of Exhibit A, and the Working Interest attributable to
such Property Subdivision has been reduced proportionately, the Title Defect
Amount shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying the Allocated
Value specified on Part II(A) of Exhibit A for such Title Defect Property by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the difference, if any, between (A) the
Net Revenue Interest for such Title Defect Property in Part II(A) of Exhibit
A, minus (B) the actual Net Revenue Interest for such Title Defect Property,
and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest specified for such
Title Defect Property in Part II(A) of Exhibit A. 

| 
---|--- 

(v)

|

If the Title Defect results from the existence of a Lien, the Title Defect
Amount shall be an amount sufficient to fully discharge such Lien. 

| 
---|--- 

(vi)

|

If the Title Defect results from any matter not described in paragraphs (i),
(ii), or (iii) above, the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by the
Parties in good faith, taking into account all relevant factors, including the
following: (A) the Allocated Value of the affected Title Defect Property; (B)
the portion of the Title Defect Property affected by the Title Defect; (C) the
legal effect of the Title Defect; (D) the potential economic effect of the
Title Defect over the life of the Title Defect Property; (E) the values placed
upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller; and (F) such other reasonable
factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation. 

| 
---|--- 

(vii)

|

If a Title Defect does not affect a Title Defect Property throughout the
entire productive life of such Title Defect Property, such fact shall be taken
into account in determining the Title Defect Amount. 

| 
---|--- 

(viii)

|

The Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder. For example, but without limitation, if a Lien
affects more than one Title Defect Property or the curative work with respect
to one Title Defect results (or is reasonably expected to result) in the
curing of any other Title Defect affecting the same or another Title Defect
Property, the amount necessary to discharge such Lien or the cost and expense
of such curative work shall only be included in the Title Defect Amount for
one Title Defect Property and only once in such Title Defect Amount. 

| 
---|--- 

(ix)

|

The Title Defect Amount attributable to a Title Defect Property shall not
exceed the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property. For example, but
without limitation, if the Seller does not own fifty percent (50%) of the Net
Revenue Interest specified in Part II(A) of Exhibit A for a Title Defect
Property and such unowned fifty percent (50%) interest is also burdened by a
Lien, the Title Defect Amount for such Title Defect Property shall not exceed
the Allocated Value allocable to such fifty percent (50%) interest
notwithstanding that it may be affected by multiple Title Defects. 

| 
---|--- 

(x)

|

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Title Defect Amount determined pursuant
to the foregoing with respect to a Title Defect is [***] or less for any
Property Subdivision, then the Title Defect Amount with respect to such Title
Defect shall be deemed to be zero. 

| 
---|--- 

5.3

|

Determination of Title Defects 18



A portion of a Property Subdivision shall be deemed to have a "Title Defect"
if the Seller fails to have Defensible Title thereto as of the Defect Notice
Date. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
the following matters shall not be asserted as, and shall not constitute Title
Defects: (a) defects in the early chain of title consisting of the mere
failure to recite marital status in a document or omissions of successions of
heirship proceedings, unless Buyer provides affirmative evidence that such
failure or omission results in another Person\'s superior claim of title to
the relevant Property Subdivision or portion thereof or that another Person is
claiming the same; (b) defects arising out of lack of survey unless a survey
is expressly required by Laws; (c) defects arising out of lack of corporate
authorization, unless Buyer provides affirmative evidence that such corporate
action was not authorized and results in another Person\'s superior claim of
title to the relevant Property Subdivision or portion thereof or that another
Person is claiming the same; (d) defects that have been cured by possession
under the applicable statutes of limitations; (e) defects based solely on the
existence of prior oil and gas leases relating to the Subject Interests that
are expired and no longer in force and legal effect but not surrendered of
record; (f) defects arising from a mortgage encumbering the oil, gas or
mineral estate of any lessor if such mortgage would customarily be accepted in
taking oil and gas leases and for which the lessee would not customarily seek
a subordination of such mortgage to the Subject Interests affected thereby
prior to conducting drilling activities on the Subject Interests (unless a
complaint of foreclosure has been filed or any similar action taken by the
mortgagee thereunder and in such case such mortgage has not been subordinated
to the Subject Interests affected thereby or unless the mortgage requires
notice to or consent from the mortgagee prior to entering into any oil and gas
lease and such notice or consent was not delivered or obtained); (g) defects
based solely on lack of information in files of Seller or the Company or
references to documents if such documents are not in files of Seller or the
Company; (h) Permitted Encumbrances; (i) defects based on a failure to record
name changes or mergers set forth on Schedule 5.3(i) in the applicable
records; (j) defects to Wells and Bakken Drillsite Spacing Units that result
from an adjustment in the acreage contained within such Bakken Drillsite
Spacing Unit as set forth on Part II(A) of Exhibit A resulting from the
presence of irregular lots in the governmental survey of such Bakken Drillsite
Spacing Unit; and (k) defects asserting that the Seller's ownership in a Well
is based on a right under a Contract or under a Law of any Governmental
Authority entitling the Seller to a non-consenting owner\'s share in such
Well.

| 
---|--- 

5.4

|

Seller Title Credit 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Seller Title Credit. A "Seller Title Credit" shall mean, (x) with respect to
each Property Subdivision described in Part II(A) of Exhibit A, the amount by
which the value of such Property Subdivision is enhanced by virtue of the
Seller owning a greater Net Revenue Interest in such Property Subdivision than
the Net Revenue Interest specified therefor in Part II(A) of Exhibit A, or (y)
with respect to each Property Subdivision described in Part II(A) of Exhibit
A, the amount by which the value of such Property Subdivision is enhanced by
virtue of the Seller owning a lesser Working Interest in such Property
Subdivision than the Working Interest specified therefor in Part II(A) of
Exhibit A, in each case, as of the Closing Date, which amount shall be
determined as follows (such amount, the "Seller Title Credit Amount"): 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

If Buyer and Seller agree on the amount of the Seller Title Credit, then that
amount shall be the amount of the Seller Title Credit. 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

If the Seller Title Credit results from Seller owning a greater Net Revenue
Interest in such Property Subdivision than the Net Revenue Interest specified
therefor in Part II(A) of Exhibit A, and the Working Interest attributable to
such Property Subdivision has been increased proportionately, the Seller Title
Credit shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying the Allocated
Value specified on Part II(A) of Exhibit A for such Property 19



Subdivision by a fraction, the numerator of which is the difference, if any,
between (A) the actual Net Revenue Interest for such Title Defect Property,
minus (B) the Net Revenue Interest for such Title Defect Property in Part
II(A) of Exhibit A and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest
specified for such Property Subdivision in Part II(A) of Exhibit A.

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

If the Seller Title Credit results from any matter not described in paragraphs
(i) or (ii) above, the Seller Title Credit shall be determined by the Parties
in good faith, taking into account all relevant factors. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Notice of Seller Title Credit. On or before September 19, 2014, Seller shall
have the right, but not the obligation, to deliver to Buyer a Seller Title
Credit Notice. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Contents of Seller Title Credit Notice. The Seller Title Credit Notice must be
in writing and by asserted in good faith and include (1) a description of the
Seller Title Credit, (2) the Property Subdivisions affected by the Seller
Title Credit, (3) the Allocated Values of the Property Subdivisions subject to
such Seller Title Credit, and (4) the amount by which Seller reasonably
believes the Allocated Value of those Property Subdivisions is increased by
the Seller Title Credit, and the computations and information upon which
Seller\'s belief is based. Seller shall be deemed to have waived all Seller
Title Credits of which it has not given notice on or before the Defect Notice
Date. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Seller Title Credit Amount. Any Seller Title Credit Amounts shall be offset
against the aggregate of all Title Defect Amounts, if any, but shall not
result in any upward adjustment to the Purchase Price under Section 2.5. 

| 
---|--- 

5.5

|

Deferred Claims and Disputes 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Deferred Adjustment Claim. In the event that Buyer and Seller have not agreed
upon one or more adjustments, credits or offsets claimed by Buyer or Seller
pursuant to and in accordance with the requirements of this ARTICLE 5, any
such claim (a "Deferred Adjustment Claim") shall be settled pursuant to this
Section 5.5 and, except as provided in Section 8.1(e) and Section 8.2(e),
shall not prevent or delay Closing; provided, however, if either Party claims
that its closing conditions have not been satisfied under Section 8.1(e) or
Section 8.2(e), as applicable, and such Party's claim under such Section
relies upon alleged Title Defects and/or Title Defect Amounts that are
Deferred Adjustment Claims in order to reach the threshold set forth therein,
then the Parties will resolve all such Deferred Adjustment Claims under this
Section 5.5 prior to Closing, and until all such Deferred Adjustment Claims
are resolved, neither Party will be entitled to rely on the failure of the
condition in Section 8.1(e) or Section 8.2(e), as applicable, to terminate
this Agreement. With respect to each potential Deferred Adjustment Claim,
Buyer and Seller shall deliver to the other a written notice describing each
such potential Deferred Adjustment Claim, the amount in dispute and a
statement setting forth the facts and circumstances that support such Party\'s
position with respect to such Deferred Adjustment Claim. At Closing, the
Purchase Price shall not be adjusted on account of, and, except as provided in
Section 8.1(e) and Section 8.2(e), no effect shall be given to, the Deferred
Adjustment Claim, except, Buyer shall pay that portion of the Purchase Price
related to the Deferred Adjustment Claim into the Escrow Account. On or prior
to the thirtieth (30th) consecutive calendar day after the Closing Date (the
"Deferred Matters Date"), Seller and Buyer shall attempt in good faith to
reach agreement on the Deferred Adjustment Claims and, ultimately, to resolve
by written agreement all disputes regarding the Deferred Adjustment Claims.
Following any written agreement between Seller and Buyer regarding the
Deferred Adjustment Claims, Seller and Buyer shall 20



promptly jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release to the entitled party
the amount of any reduction or increase in the Purchase Price to which Buyer
or Seller, as applicable, is entitled.

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Disputed Deferred Adjustment Claims. If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve
all Deferred Adjustment Claims or any disputes regarding any post closing cure
of any Title Defects by Seller by the Deferred Matters Date, then such claims
shall be resolved by a single arbitrator, who shall be an attorney with at
least fifteen (15) years' experience in oil and gas title and transactional
matters, as selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller, and if the
Parties are not able to mutually agree, then as selected by the Denver office
of the Judicial Arbiter Group, Inc. (the "Title Arbitrator"). The arbitration
proceeding shall be held in Denver, Colorado, and shall be conducted in
accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this
Section 5.5. Buyer and Seller shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Title Arbitrator to render his or her determination within
fifteen (15) Business Days after a disputed matter is submitted to the Title
Arbitrator and such determination shall be final and binding upon the Parties,
without right of appeal. In making his or her determination, the Title
Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in this ARTICLE 5 and may
consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Title Arbitrator are
necessary or helpful to make a proper determination. The Title Arbitrator
shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific
disputed Deferred Adjustment Claims submitted by Buyer or Seller and may not
award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any
matter. Seller and Buyer shall each bear (i) its own legal fees and other
costs of presenting its case and (ii) one-half of the fees, costs and expenses
of the Title Arbitrator. Following the receipt of any final and binding
written decision of the Title Arbitrator, Seller and Buyer shall promptly (x)
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release to the entitled party the amount
of any reduction or increase in the Purchase Price to which Buyer or Seller,
as applicable, is entitled and (y) pay any amounts due to the other party as a
result of the Title Arbitrator's decision. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Certain Seller Rights. Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the
contrary, including Section 5.2(c), at any time prior to the point in time
when a final and binding written decision of the Title Arbitrator is made with
respect to any Title Defect which constitutes a Deferred Adjustment Claim in
accordance with this Section 5.5, Seller shall be entitled (i) to cure any
such Title Defect and (ii) to resolve all disputes relating to the Deferred
Adjustment Claims by payment, by joint instruction to the Escrow Agent
instructing the release of such funds to Buyer, of the amount by which the
Purchase Price would have been reduced at Closing on account of the Title
Defects which constitute Deferred Adjustment Claims if same did not constitute
Deferred Adjustment Claims. 

| 
---|--- 

5.6

|

No Duplication 

Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the contrary, if a Title Defect
results from any matter which could also result in the breach of any
representation or warranty of Seller set forth in Section 3.1 (other than
Section 3.1(m)), then Buyer shall only be entitled to assert such matter as a
Title Defect pursuant to this ARTICLE 5 and shall be precluded from also
asserting such matter as the basis of the breach of any such representation or 21


| 
---|--- 

5.7

|

Title Defect Deductible 

Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the contrary, there will be no
reduction of the Purchase Price on account of a Title Defect and no amount
owing by Seller unless and until the aggregate amount of all undisputed Title
Defect Amounts with respect to the Title Defect Properties exceeds [***] (the
"Title Defect Deductible"), and in such event, the reduction of the Purchase
Price will be limited to the amount in excess of the Title Defect Deductible.

ARTICLE 6

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

| 
---|--- 

6.1

|

Environmental Defects; Environmental Defect Amount 

"Environmental Defect" means any condition or circumstance (other than any
condition or circumstance set forth on Schedule 6.1) that, with notice to the
Governmental Authority with jurisdiction, would require Remediation under
Environmental Laws in, on or under a particular Well and related facilities
(including air, land, soil, surface and subsurface strata, surface water,
groundwater or sediments) or would cause a particular Well and related
facilities to be in violation of any applicable requirements of Environmental
Laws or Environmental Permits, in either case that is reasonably expected to
require more than [***] to Remediate as to a particular Well and related
facilities. "Environmental Defect Amount" means the cost to Remediate the
Environmental Defect. "Environmental Defect Properties" means the Wells to
which an Environmental Defect relates. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, if the Environmental Defect Amount with respect to an Environmental
Defect Property is [***] or less, then the Environmental Defect Amount with
respect to such Environmental Defect shall be deemed to be zero.

| 
---|--- 

6.2

|

Environmental Defect Notice 

Prior to 5:00 P.M., Mountain Time, on the Defect Notice Date, Buyer shall have
the right, but not the obligation to notify Seller in writing of any matters
that, in Buyer\'s reasonable opinion, constitute an Environmental Defect (an
"Environmental Defect Notice"). Each Environmental Defect Notice shall be in
writing and shall contain the following: (i) a description of the asserted
Environmental Defect, (ii) the identity of the specific Subject Assets to
which such Environmental Defect relates, (iii) the reason Buyer believes such
Subject Assets to have an Environmental Defect, (iv) the Environmental Defect
Amount attributable thereto claimed in good faith by Buyer, and (v)
documentation supporting Buyer\'s asserted Environmental Defect. To be valid,
any Environmental Defect Notice must be received by Seller prior to 5:00 P.M.,
Mountain Time, on the Defect Notice Date.

| 
---|--- 

6.3

|

Effect of Environmental Defect Notice 

Buyer waives for all purposes all objections associated with the environmental
condition of the Subject Assets (including Environmental Defects), unless
raised in an Environmental Defect Notice prior to 5:00 P.M., Mountain Time, on
the Defect Notice Date. If the aggregate amount of all Environmental Defects
Amounts with respect to Environmental Defects, as applicable, timely asserted
by Buyer is equal to or less than the Environmental Defect Deductible based on
the estimates in the Environmental Defect Notice, Buyer shall be deemed to
have (i) accepted the environmental condition(s) in, on and under the affected
Subject Assets, (ii) waived its right to claim an Environmental Defect with
respect to that particular condition in, on or under the affected Subject
Assets, and (iii) included the particular environmental condition(s) as part
of the Assumed Liabilities. 22


| 
---|--- 

6.4

|

Seller\'s Right to Cure 

Seller shall have until the Closing Date, at its cost and expense, if it so
elects but without obligation, to cure all or a portion of asserted
Environmental Defects prior to such date with no adjustment to the Purchase
Price in respect of such cured Environmental Defect.

| 
---|--- 

6.5

|

Environmental Defect Adjustments 

If Seller and Buyer agree that an Environmental Defect exists and agree on the
Environmental Defect Amount, and Seller has been unable, or elects not, to
cure such Environmental Defect to the satisfaction of the Parties pursuant to
Section 6.4, then Buyer shall be entitled, at its sole and exclusive option,
to:

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

waive the Environmental Defect that remains uncured and reduce the Purchase
Price by the amount, if any, by which the aggregate amount of all undisputed
Environmental Defect Amounts exceeds the Environmental Defect Deductible (such
amount in excess of the Environmental Defect Deductible, the "Environmental
Defect Adjustment"), or 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

exclude the Environmental Defect Properties affected by such Environmental
Defect from the Subject Assets. 

| 
---|--- 

6.6

|

Environmental Defect Deductible 

Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the contrary, there will be no
reduction of the Purchase Price on account of an Environmental Defect and no
amount owing by Seller unless and until the aggregate amount of all undisputed
Environmental Defect Amounts with respect to the Environmental Defect
Properties (not counting any Environmental Defect Properties that are excluded
by Seller pursuant to Section 6.7) exceeds [***] (the "Environmental Defect
Deductible"), and in such event, the reduction of the Purchase Price will be
limited to the amount in excess of the Environmental Defect Deductible.

| 
---|--- 

6.7

|

Subject Assets Exclusion 

Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the contrary, with respect to any
Environmental Defect Properties, Seller may elect prior to Closing to exclude
such Environmental Defect Properties from the Subject Assets conveyed to the
Company immediately prior to the Closing. If an Environmental Defect Property
is excluded under Section 6.5(b) or this Section 6.7, as the case may be, then
(a) all Subject Assets comprising such Environmental Defect Property together
with a pro rata share of all incidental rights, oil, gas and other
hydrocarbons and other assets attributable or appurtenant thereto, shall be
retained by the Seller and shall not be considered part of the Subject Assets
and (b) the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value
attributable to such Subject Asset (the "Excluded Environmental Adjustment").

| 
---|--- 

6.8

|

Deferred Environmental Claims and Disputes 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Deferred Environmental Adjustment Claim. In the event that Buyer and Seller
have not agreed on or prior to the Closing Date as to whether an Environmental
Defect exists or, if Buyer and Seller agree that an Environmental Defect
exists but disagree as to whether it has been cured or on the amount of the
Environmental Defect Amount attributable to such Environmental Defect, any
such claim (a "Deferred Environmental Adjustment Claim") shall be settled
pursuant to this Section 6.8 and, except as provided in Section 8.1(e) and
Section 8.2(e), shall not prevent or delay Closing; provided, however, if
either Party claims that its closing conditions have not been satisfied under
Section 8.1(e) or Section 8.2(e), as applicable, and such Party's claim under
such Section relies 23



upon alleged Environmental Defects and/or Environmental Amounts that are
Deferred Environmental Adjustment Claims in order to reach the threshold set
forth therein, then the Parties will resolve all such Deferred Environmental
Adjustment Claims under this Section 6.8 prior to Closing, and until all such
Deferred Environmental Adjustment Claims are resolved, neither Party will be
entitled to rely on the failure of the condition in Section 8.1(e) or Section
8.2(e), as applicable, to terminate this Agreement. With respect to each
potential Deferred Environmental Adjustment Claim, Buyer and Seller shall
deliver to the other a written notice describing each such potential Deferred
Environmental Adjustment Claim, the amount in dispute and a statement setting
forth the facts and circumstances that support such Party\'s position with
respect to such Deferred Environmental Adjustment Claim, except Buyer shall
pay that portion of the Purchase Price related to the Deferred Environmental
Adjustment Claim into the Escrow Account. At Closing, the Purchase Price shall
not be adjusted on account of, and, except as provided in Section 8.1(e) and
Section 8.2(e), no effect shall be given to, the Deferred Environmental
Adjustment Claim. On or prior to Deferred Matters Date, Seller and Buyer shall
attempt in good faith to reach agreement on the Deferred Environmental
Adjustment Claims and, ultimately, to resolve by written agreement all
disputes regarding the Deferred Environmental Adjustment Claims. Following any
written agreement regarding the Deferred Environmental Adjustment Claims,
Seller and Buyer shall promptly jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release
to the entitled party the amount of escrow funds to which Buyer or Seller, as
applicable, is entitled.

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Disputed Deferred Environmental Adjustment Claims. If Buyer and Seller are
unable to resolve all Deferred Environmental Adjustment Claims by the Deferred
Matters Date, then such matters shall be resolved by a single arbitrator, who
shall be an attorney with at least fifteen (15) years experience in oil and
gas environmental matters, as selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and
Seller, and if the Parties are unable to mutually agree, then as selected by
the Denver office of the Judicial Arbiter Group, Inc. (the "Environmental
Arbitrator"). The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Denver, Colorado,
and shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of
the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict
with the terms of this Section 6.8(b). Buyer and Seller shall exercise
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Environmental Arbitrator to
render his or her determination within fifteen (15) Business Days after a
disputed matter is submitted to the Environmental Arbitrator and such
determination shall be final and binding upon the Parties, without right of
appeal. In making his or her determination, the Environmental Arbitrator shall
be bound by the rules set forth in this ARTICLE 6 and may consider such other
matters as in the opinion of the Environmental Arbitrator are necessary or
helpful to make a proper determination. The Environmental Arbitrator shall act
as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed
Deferred Environmental Adjustment Claims submitted by either Buyer or Seller
and may not award damages, interest or penalties to a Party with respect to
any matter. Seller and Buyer shall each bear (i) its own legal fees and other
costs of presenting its case and (ii) one-half of the fees, costs and expenses
of the Environmental Arbitrator. Following the receipt of any final and
binding written decision of the Environmental Arbitrator, Seller and Buyer
shall promptly jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release to the entitled
party the amount of escrow funds to which Buyer or Seller, as applicable, is
entitled. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Certain Seller Rights. Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the
contrary, at any time prior to the point in time when a final and binding
written decision of the Environmental Arbitrator is made with respect to any
Environmental Defect which constitutes a Deferred Environmental Adjustment
Claim in accordance with this Section 6.8, Seller shall be entitled, (i) prior
to the Closing Date, to cure any such Environmental Defect or (ii) to resolve
all disputes relating to a Deferred Environmental Adjustment Claim by payment,
by joint instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing 24



the release of such funds to Buyer, of the amount by which the Purchase Price
would have been reduced at Closing on account of the Environmental Defects
which constitute Deferred Environmental Adjustment Claims if same did not
constitute Deferred Environmental Adjustment Claims.

6.9

|

Sole Remedies 

Subject to (i) Buyer\'s termination right as provided in Section 13.1(a), (ii)
Section 6.5, and (iii) any remedy for breach of any representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.1, the procedures set forth in this ARTICLE
6 shall be Buyer\'s sole remedy for the existence of any objections associated
with the environmental condition of the Subject Assets (including
Environmental Defects).

| 
---|--- 

6.10

|

NORM 

Buyer acknowledges that the Subject Assets have been used for exploration,
development and production of oil and gas and that there may be petroleum,
produced water, wastes, or other substances or materials located in, on or
under the Subject Assets or associated with the Subject Assets. Equipment and
sites included in the Subject Assets may contain asbestos, NORM or other
Hazardous Materials. NORM may affix or attach itself to the inside of wells,
materials, and equipment as scale, or in other forms. The wells, materials and
equipment located on the Subject Assets or included in the Subject Assets may
contain NORM and other wastes or Hazardous Materials. NORM containing material
and/or other wastes or Hazardous Materials may have come in contact with
various environmental media, including water, soils or sediment. Special
procedures may be required for the assessment, remediation, removal,
transportation, or disposal of environmental media, wastes, asbestos, NORM and

in addition to other remedies available at law or in equity.

| 
---|--- 

7.9

|

Certain Tax Matters 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Intended Tax Treatment. The Parties agree that because the Company is a
single-member limited liability company that is wholly-owned by Seller, based
on Seller's representations in Section 3.1(i), the acquisition by Buyer of the
Membership Interests is treated as an acquisition by Buyer of the assets of
the Company for United States federal Income Tax purposes (collectively, the
"Intended Tax Treatment"). Neither Buyer nor Seller shall take any actions
which are inconsistent with the Intended Tax Treatment unless required by
applicable Law. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall take any position on any Tax
Return or other similar document, or take any other Tax reporting position,
for United States federal, state and local Income Tax purposes, that is
inconsistent with the Intended Tax Treatment. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Apportionment of Property Taxes. 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

Property Taxes shall be deemed attributable to the period during which
ownership of the applicable Subject Assets gives rise to liability for such
Property Taxes, and liability therefor allocated to Seller for all periods
ending prior to the Effective Time and to Buyer for all periods beginning on
or after the Effective Time. The amount of Property Taxes allocable to the
Seller shall be equal to the amount of such Property Taxes for a taxable
period beginning before and ending after the Effective Time allocated to the
Seller shall be equal to the amount of such Property Taxes for the entire
taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number
of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of days in such taxable period. To the extent the
actual amount of Property Tax that is attributable to a period ending prior to
the Effective Time (but not due and payable prior to the Closing) is not
determinable at the time an adjustment to the Purchase Price is to be made
with respect to such Property Tax pursuant to Section 2.5 and/or Section 2.6,
as applicable, the Parties shall utilize the most recent information available
in estimating the amount of such Property Tax for purposes of such adjustment,
and the amount of such Property Tax used for purposes of Section 2.6 shall be
considered full and final settlement of such Property Tax without regard to
the actual Tax rates or assessments (the "Settled Property Taxes"). 28


| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

Buyer shall be entitled to all rights to any refunds of (1) Property Taxes
allocable to Buyer pursuant to this Section 7.9(b) regardless of when
received, and (2) Settled Property Taxes. Seller shall be entitled to all
rights to any refunds of Property Taxes allocated to Seller pursuant to this
Section 7.9(b) other than refunds of Settled Property Taxes. After Closing,
Buyer shall timely file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for Property
Taxes required to be filed after the Closing and shall timely pay or cause to
be paid to the taxing authorities all Property Taxes that become due and
payable after the Closing. Any penalty, addition to Tax, or interest levied or
assessed with respect to any Property Tax shall be allocated to, and shall be
payable by, the Party to which the Tax to which such penalty, addition to Tax
or interest relates is allocated, regardless of when such penalty, addition to
Tax, or interest is levied or assessed; provided, however, that the liability
for any penalty, addition to Tax, or interest levied or assessed with respect
to any failure of Buyer to comply with the previous sentence shall be
allocated to, and shall be payable by, Buyer. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Apportionment of Severance Taxes. Severance Taxes shall be deemed attributable
to the period during which the production of the hydrocarbons with respect to
such Severance Taxes occurred, and liability therefor shall be allocated to
Seller for pre-Effective Time Severance Taxes and to Buyer for post-Effective
Time Severance Taxes. For the purpose of calculating the Initial Adjustment
Amount under Section 2.5(a) and for purposes of the Final Settlement Statement
under Section 2.6, Severance Taxes for which the actual liability amount is
not known as of such time shall be estimated based on the applicable current
Severance Tax rates, with the resulting Adjusted Purchase Price under Section
2.6 to be considered full and final settlement of all such Taxes without
regard to the actual Tax rates or assessments; provided that, if the actual
amounts of the applicable Severance Tax rates are not known at the time of the
Closing, the amounts shall be re-estimated based on the best information
available at the time of the Final Settlement Statement, and such estimated
amounts shall thereupon become full and final settlement of such Severance
Taxes (the "Settled Severance Taxes," and together with the Settled Property
Taxes, the "Settled Asset Taxes") for purposes of this Agreement. Buyer shall
be entitled to all rights to any refunds of (a) Severance Taxes allocable to
Buyer pursuant to this Section 7.9(c) regardless of when received, and (b)
Settled Severance Taxes. Seller shall be entitled to all rights to any refunds
of Severance Taxes allocated to Seller pursuant to this Section 7.9(c) other
than refunds of Settled Severance Taxes. After Closing, Buyer shall timely
file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for Severance Taxes required to be
filed after the Closing and shall timely pay or cause to be paid to the taxing
authorities all Severance Taxes that become due and payable after the Closing.
Any penalty, addition to Tax, or interest levied or assessed with respect to
any Severance Tax shall be allocated to, and shall be payable by, the Party to
which the Tax to which such penalty, addition to Tax or interest relates is
allocated, regardless of when such penalty, addition to Tax, or interest is
levied or assessed; provided, however, that the liability for any penalty,
addition to Tax, or interest levied or assessed with respect to any failure of
Buyer to comply with the previous sentence shall be allocated to, and shall be
payable by, Buyer. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Income Taxes. Each Party shall be responsible for its own Income Taxes. 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

Transfer Taxes. All Transfer Taxes (including any related interest, penalties
or legal costs, but excluding any recordation fees incurred in connection with
the transfer of the Subject Assets) that may be imposed on any transfer of the
membership interests in the Company (or the Subject Assets) pursuant to this
Agreement shall be borne and paid 50% by Buyer and 50% by Seller. The Parties
shall cooperate with one another in the preparation of any Tax Returns and
other related documentation with respect to such Transfer Taxes (including any
exemption certificates and forms as each may request to establish an exemption
from (or otherwise reduce) or make a report with 29



respect to Transfer Taxes). Any expenses, fees or costs incurred by Seller in
connection with preparing or filing such Tax Returns shall be paid by Buyer.

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

Allocations for Federal Income Tax Purposes. Buyer and Seller acknowledge
that, under Section 1060 of the Code, Buyer and Seller must report information
regarding the allocation of the Purchase Price and any other amounts treated
as consideration for federal Income Tax purposes (collectively, the
"Allocation Amount") to the United States Secretary of Treasury by attaching
Department of Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Form 8594 to their federal
Income Tax returns for the tax period which includes the Closing Date. Buyer
and Seller agree that the Allocation Amount shall be allocated among the
Subject Assets for Tax purposes in accordance with an allocation schedule
substantially consistent with Schedule 7.9(f) (the "Allocation Schedule").
Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to revise the Allocation
Schedule in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder to take into account any adjustments to the
Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement, including any indemnification
payments pursuant to ARTICLE 12. Buyer and Seller shall each prepare their
respective Forms 8594 in a manner consistent with the Allocation Schedule. The
Parties shall not take any Tax position (whether in audits, on Tax Returns, or
otherwise) that is inconsistent with such allocation unless required to do so
by applicable Law; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall
prevent Buyer or Seller from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by
any Taxing Authority based upon or arising out of such Allocation Schedule,
and neither Buyer nor Seller shall be required to litigate before any court
any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Taxing Authority challenging such
allocation. 

| 
---|--- 

(g)

|

Post-Closing Tax Matters. After the Closing, each of Buyer and Seller shall: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

reasonably cooperate and assist the other (1) in preparing any Tax Returns
relating to any Tax imposed with respect to the Subject Assets or the Company,
or the Transaction, and (2) in qualifying for any exemption or reduction in
Tax that may be available; 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

reasonably cooperate in preparing for any audits, examinations or other tax
proceedings by, or disputes with, taxing authorities regarding any Tax

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

make available to the other, and to any Taxing Authority as reasonably
requested, any information, records, and documents relating to a Tax incurred
or imposed in connection with the Subject Assets or the Transaction; 

| 
---|--- 

(iv)

|

provide timely notice to the other in writing of any pending or threatened Tax
audit, examination, or assessment that could reasonably be expected to affect
the other\'s Tax liability under applicable Law or this Agreement (a "Tax
Controversy"), and to promptly furnish the other with copies of all
correspondence with respect to any Tax Controversy; and 

| 
---|--- 

(v)

|

allow the other to participate, at its own expense, in any Tax Controversy,
and not settle any Tax Controversy without the prior written consent of the
other, which may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. 

| 
---|--- 

(h)

pursuant to this Agreement as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes unless otherwise required by Law. 30

Assumed Liabilities. 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

Employees"). Buyer may, on or after the date hereof, interview any Business
Employee and conduct any such standard employee screening and eligibility
procedures with regard to such Business Employees as Buyer conducts with
respect to candidates for employment in Buyer's ordinary course of business.
Subject to applicable Law and, with the prior written consent of each Business
Employee, as applicable, Buyer shall be entitled to review copies of the
personnel records maintained by Seller with respect to such Business Employee,
and discuss such records and such Business Employee with Seller's
representatives. Buyer's interviews of the Business Employees as set forth in
this Section 7.12 shall be conducted so as not to unreasonably interfere with
the Business of Seller prior to the Closing, and Seller shall exercise
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer and to facilitate
Buyer's completion of its interview and screening procedures hereunder. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

After the date hereof, Buyer shall be authorized to communicate with any
Business Employee regarding such Business Employee's potential employment with
Buyer and Buyer shall be authorized to communicate any offer of employment to
any Business Employees. Buyer shall, not later than 5 days prior to the
Closing, deliver to Seller a final written list containing the name of each
Business Employee Buyer desires to hire. Each Business Employee that is
offered employment with Buyer and that accepts such offer (each a "Continuing
Employee" and, collectively, the "Continuing Employees") shall, as of the
Closing be terminated by Seller and become an employee of Buyer. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Seller shall be responsible for all compensation and benefits owing to
Business Employees up to and including the Closing Date, and Buyer shall be
responsible for all compensation and benefits owing to Continuing Employees
after the Closing Date under Buyer's compensation and benefits programs (on
and subject to the terms of employment agreed upon between Buyer and such
Continuing Employee). Buyer shall have no obligations with respect to any
Business Employee that is not hired by Buyer at the Closing. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

With respect to each Continuing Employee: 

| 
---|--- 

(vi)

|

In the event that, prior to the 6-month anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer
terminates the employment of any Continuing Employee, other than for cause (as
determined pursuant to Buyer's applicable employment policies), Buyer shall
pay to such Continuing Employee, within five (5) days following termination of
such Continuing Employee, the Severance Amount. 

| 
---|--- 

(vii)

|

In accordance with and solely to the extent permitted by and in accordance
with Buyer's current policies and programs (i) Buyer shall grant such
Continuing Employee credit for their service with Seller for purposes of
eligibility to participate in and vesting credits in Buyer's service award
plans, vacation programs and policies and retirement plans; (ii) for the
calendar year during which such coverage begins, Buyer shall credit under any
medical, dental or vision benefit plans maintained by Buyer, all Continuing
Employees with any deductibles and co-payments already incurred during such
year under Seller's benefit plans, and waive any pre-existing conditions,
exclusions or limitations as to coverage, any 32



evidence-of-insurability provisions and any waiting-period requirements under
such plans; and (iii) Buyer shall apply towards any deductible requirements
and out-of-pocket maximum limits under such welfare benefit plans that are
applicable to 2014, any similar deductible requirements and out-of-pocket
maximum limits satisfied by any Continuing Employee under Seller's welfare
benefit plans. Prior to Closing, Seller shall prepare and deliver, or cause to
be prepared and delivered, to each Continuing Employee, and request such
Continuing Employee to deliver to Buyer, a schedule setting forth the amount
of the deductible and out-of-pocket maximum limits satisfied by each
Continuing Employee under Seller welfare benefit plans with the information
available as of the date the schedule is prepared, which schedule shall be
updated through the Closing Date as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Closing.

| 
---|--- 

(viii)

|

To the extent permitted by Buyer's current 401(k) plan, Buyer shall cause the
trustee or administrator of Buyer's 401(k) plan to accept direct rollovers
from Seller's 401(k) plan trust for each Continuing Employee electing the same
with respect to a distribution of his or her vested account thereunder. If any
Continuing Employee does not rollover his or her account to Buyer's 401(k)
plan, such Continuing Employee may continue to participate in Seller's 401(k)
plan as a terminated participant in accordance with the terms thereof, and
Seller shall retain all responsibility for the management and administration
of such Continuing Employee's account balances under Seller's 401(k) plan. 

| 
---|--- 

(ix)

|

Each Continuing Employee shall, on the Closing Date, begin accruing vacation
time at the level to which they would be entitled under Buyer's vacation
policies for 2014. Seller will pay to each Business Employee an amount equal
to any accrued and unused vacation days at the Closing in accordance with its
policies. 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

For the 6 month period following the Closing Date, if Buyer or any of its
Affiliates directly or indirectly retains the services of any Business
Employee to whom Seller paid the Severance Amount because the employment of
such Business Employee was terminated, Buyer shall immediately reimburse
Seller for the Severance Amount, except to the extent (a) that such Business
Employee applies for employment with Buyer in response to a general
solicitation or posting by Buyer of an open position, or (b) such Business
Employee was not solicited by Buyer. 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) nothing in
this Agreement shall create any obligation on the part of Buyer to continue
the employment of any employee for any definite period following the Closing
Date, and (ii) nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Buyer from altering,
amending, or terminating any of its welfare benefit plans, or the
participation of any of its employees in such welfare benefit plans, at any
time. 

| 
---|--- 

(g)

|

No provision in this Agreement shall create any third party beneficiary or
other right in any Person (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) for
any reason in respect of continued employment or new employment with Seller,
the Company or Buyer or in respect of any benefits that may be provided,
directly or indirectly, under any plan or arrangement maintained by Seller,
the Company or Buyer. 33

SURVIVAL

| 
---|--- 

10.1

|

Survival 

No representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made herein shall survive
the Closing except as provided in this Section 10.1. Each representation,
warranty, covenant and agreement made herein shall terminate and cease to be
of further force and effect as of the Closing or such later date after Closing
as is expressly stipulated in this Section 10.1 for the survival thereof.
Following the Closing or such later date stipulated in this Section 10.1 for
the survival thereof, such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
shall not form the basis for or give rise to any claim, demand, cause of
action, counterclaim, defense, damage, indemnity, obligation or liability
which is asserted, claimed, made or filed following the Closing or such later
date stipulated in this Section 10.1 for survival. It is expressly agreed that
the terms and provisions of (a) ARTICLE 3 shall survive for twelve (12) months
following the Closing, except that (i) Section 3.1(i) shall survive the
Closing until sixty (60) days following the expiration of the applicable
statutes of limitations (including extensions) for the subject Taxes and (ii)
Seller\'s representations and warranties set forth set forth in Section
3.1(a), Section 3.1(b), Section 3.1(m), Section 3.1(w), Section 3.1(x),
Section 3.2(a), Section 3.2(b), Section 3.2(c) and Section 3.2(i) (the
"Fundamental Representations") and Buyer representations and warranties set
forth in Section 3.3 shall, in each case, survive the Closing indefinitely,
(b) Section 2.5, Section 2.6, Section 4.2, ARTICLE 5, ARTICLE 6, ARTICLE 10,
ARTICLE 11, ARTICLE 12, ARTICLE 14, and Buyer\'s indemnity and hold harmless
of the Seller Indemnified Parties under Section 4.1, shall survive the Closing
indefinitely or for such shorter period of time as may be stipulated in such
provisions and (c) the covenants contained herein shall survive in accordance
with their terms. In addition, the definitions set forth in Appendix A to this
Agreement which are used in the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements which survive the Closing pursuant to this Section 10.1 shall
survive the Closing to the extent necessary to give operative effect to such
surviving representations, warranties, covenants and agreements.

| 
---|--- 

10.2

|

Acknowledgement of Limitation of Recovery 

Both Parties acknowledge that the limitations on survival in Section 10.1 are
a contractual statute of limitations that limits such Party\'s ability to make
a claim against the other Party or, with respect to Buyer, the Company, which
such Party may otherwise have available under Law. 37

SPECIFICALLY STIPULATED IN SECTION 13.2, THE RECOVERY BY ANY PARTY OF ANY
DAMAGES SUFFERED OR INCURRED BY IT AS A RESULT OF ANY BREACH BY ANOTHER PARTY

SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE ACTUAL DAMAGES SUFFERED OR INCURRED BY THE NON-

12.3

|

Indemnification and Defense Procedures 

A Person that desires to make a claim for indemnification under this ARTICLE
12 is herein referred to as an "Indemnified Person" and the Party from which
indemnification is sought under this ARTICLE 12 is herein referred to as the
"Indemnifying Party." All claims for indemnification under this ARTICLE 12
shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

If a third party claim is asserted against an Indemnified Person for which the
Indemnified Person desires to seek indemnification from an Indemnifying Party
(an "Indemnified Claim"), then the Indemnified Person shall promptly transmit
to the Indemnifying Party a written notice ("Claim Notice") (i) notifying such
Indemnifying Party of such Indemnified Claim and requesting indemnity, 39



(ii) setting forth the full name, address for all notices and the authorized
representatives of such Indemnified Person with respect to such Indemnified
Claim, and (iii) describing in reasonable detail the nature of the Indemnified
Claim, including a copy of all papers served with respect to such Indemnified
Claim (if any) and the basis of such request for indemnification hereunder.
Failure to provide such Claim Notice promptly shall not affect the right of
the Indemnified Person to indemnification hereunder except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby; provided that the Indemnifying Party
shall not be obligated to defend, indemnify or otherwise hold harmless an
Indemnified Person with respect to a third party claim until a Claim Notice
meeting the foregoing requirements is furnished to the Indemnifying Party by
the Indemnified Person. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of any Claim
Notice (the "Election Period") from a Party, the Indemnifying Party shall
notify the Indemnified Person (A) whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its
obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Person with respect to such third
party claim and (B) whether the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the
Indemnified Person against such third party claim; provided that, if the
Indemnifying Party fails to so notify the Indemnified Person during the
Election Period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have elected to
dispute such liability and not to defend against such third party claim.

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Person within the Election
Period that the Indemnifying Party (i) does not dispute its liability to
indemnify the Indemnified Person and (ii) elects to assume the defense of such
Indemnified Person with respect to such third party claim, then the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend, at its sole cost and
expense, such third party claim by all appropriate proceedings, which
proceedings shall be prosecuted diligently by the Indemnifying Party to a
final conclusion or settled at the discretion of the Indemnifying Party in
accordance with this Section 12.3(b). The Indemnifying Party shall have full
control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or
settlement thereof; provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into
any settlement agreement (or settle or compromise any such third party claim
in a manner) which provides for or results in any payment by or liability of
the Indemnified Person of or for any damages or other amount, any Lien on any
property of the Indemnified Person, any finding of responsibility or liability
on the part of the Indemnified Person or any sanction or restriction upon the
conduct of any business by the Indemnified Person without the Indemnified
Person\'s express written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. The Indemnified Person is hereby authorized, at the sole cost and
expense of the Indemnifying Party (but only if the Indemnified Person is
actually entitled to indemnification hereunder), to file, during the Election
Period, any motion, answer or other pleadings which the Indemnified Person
shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the
Indemnifying Party and not reasonably expected to be prejudicial to the
Indemnifying Party. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Person agrees, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any such
third party claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest, including
the making of any related counterclaim or cross-complaint against any Person
(other than a Buyer Indemnified Party, if the Indemnified Person is a Buyer
Indemnified Party, or a Seller Indemnified Party, if the Indemnified Person is
a Seller Indemnified Party). The Indemnified Person may participate in, but
not control, any defense or settlement of any third party claim controlled by
the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 12.3(b), and the Indemnified
Person shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such
participation. The prosecution of the defense of a third party claim with
reasonable diligence shall include the taking of such action (including the
posting of a bond, deposit or other security) as may be necessary to prevent
any action to foreclose a Lien against or attachment of the property of the
Indemnified Person for payment of such third party claim. 40


| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

If the Indemnifying Party (i) fails to notify the Indemnified Person within
the Election Period that the Indemnifying Party elects to defend the
Indemnified Person pursuant to Section 12.3(b) or (ii) elects to defend the
Indemnified Person pursuant to Section 12.3(b) but fails to prosecute the
defense of (or to settle) the third party claim with reasonable diligence,
then the Indemnified Person shall have the right to defend, at the sole cost
and expense of the Indemnifying Party (but only if the Indemnified Person is
actually entitled to indemnification hereunder), the third party claim by all
appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be promptly and vigorously
prosecuted by the Indemnified Person to a final conclusion or settled. The
Indemnified Person shall have full control of such defense and proceedings;
provided, however, that the Indemnified Person may not enter into any
compromise or settlement of such third party claim, without the Indemnifying
Party\'s express written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. The Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any
defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified Person pursuant to this
Section 12.3(c), and the Indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and
expenses with respect to such participation. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

If an Indemnified Person desires to seek indemnification from an Indemnifying
Party for a claim or other matter which does not involve a third party claim,
then the Indemnified Person shall promptly transmit to the Indemnifying Party
a written notice describing in reasonable detail the nature of such claim or
other matter, the Indemnified Person\'s reasonable estimate of the amount of
damages attributable to such claim or other matter and the basis for the
Indemnified Person\'s entitlement to indemnification. Unless the Indemnifying
Party notifies the Party who sent such notice within thirty (30) days from its
receipt of such notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes such claim for
indemnity, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed
to such claims. 

| 
---|--- 

12.4

|

Seller\'s General Liability Limitation 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

Notwithstanding anything contained to the contrary in this Agreement: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

Seller shall not be required to indemnify any Person under Section 12.2(b)(ii)
with respect to a breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in
this Agreement (other than the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 3.1(i) and the Fundamental Representations) unless the amount which
would otherwise be payable by Seller thereunder with respect to the breach or
series of related breaches of any such representation and warranty exceeds a
fifty thousand dollar ($50,000) threshold per event or circumstance. 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

In no event shall Seller\'s aggregate liability arising out of or relating to
Section 12.2(b)(ii) with respect to a breach by Seller of any representation
or warranty made by Seller in this Agreement (other than the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 3.1(i) and the Fundamental
Representations) exceed an amount equal to [***]. 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

Seller shall not be required to indemnify any Person under Section 12.2(b)(ii)
with respect to a breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in
this Agreement (other than the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 3.1(i) and the Fundamental Representations) unless the aggregate
amount which would otherwise be payable by Seller thereunder with respect to
all breaches of any such representations and warranties exceeds an amount
equal to [***] (the "Deductible Amount"), and in such event, Seller shall be
responsible for only the amount in excess of the Deductible Amount. 

| 
---|--- 

(j)

|

The amount to which a Buyer Indemnified Party may become entitled under
Section 12.2 shall be net of any actual recovery (whether by way of payment,
discount, credit, off‑set or otherwise) 41



received from a third party (including any insurer) less any cost associated
with receiving such recovery in respect of a claim.

| 
---|--- 

12.5

|

Exclusive Remedy 

Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree that from and after the Closing, the
indemnification provisions of this ARTICLE 12 and those obligations contained
in the Parent Guaranty are the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller and Buyer
for the breach of any representation or warranty or nonfulfillment of any
covenant or agreement on the part of Seller or Buyer under this Agreement or
confirmed in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto, and Seller does hereby
release, acquit and forever discharge all Buyer Indemnified Parties and Buyer
does hereby release, acquit, and forever discharge all Seller Indemnified
Parties from any such other remedies; provided, however, that either Party
shall be entitled to pursue all remedies available at Law or in equity
(including specific performance and injunctive relief without the necessity of
posting bond) for any breach by the other Party of the provisions of Section
4.2(b) or Section 4.2(c), as the case may be.

| 
---|--- 

12.6

|

Determination of Damages Related to Breach 

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, for purposes of
determining the amount of liabilities associated with a breach of any
representation or warranty by any Party hereunder (but not for purposes of
determining whether a breach has occurred), the representations and warranties
of such Party shall, for purposes of this ARTICLE 12, be read without giving
effect to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or qualification with a
similar meaning in such representation or warranty.

| 
---|--- 

12.7

|

Recovery 

In the event Covered Liabilities suffered by an Indemnified Party are
recoverable under more than one provision of this Agreement, such Indemnified
Party will only be permitted to recover with respect to any particular Covered
Liabilities suffered by it one time as it is the Parties\' intent that once
any particular Covered Liabilities have been recovered by a particular
Indemnified Party under one provision, such Covered Liability no longer exists
with respect to such Indemnified Party and, therefore, recovery by such
particular Indemnified Party for such same Covered Liabilities under another
provision would constitute unintended and prohibited "double" recovery. No
Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to any claim for Covered Liabilities
under Section 12.2 arising from claims based on the determination of the Final
Settlement Statement, as it is the intent that the procedures set forth in
Article 2 be the exclusive remedy for such claims.

ARTICLE 13

TERMINATION; REMEDIES

| 
---|--- 

13.1

|

Termination 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Termination of Agreement. This Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing:

| 
---|--- 

(iv)

|

If the Closing has not occurred by 5:00 P.M., Mountain Time, on October 31,
2014 (the "Termination Effective Time"), then (A) by Seller if any condition
specified in Section 8.1 has not (1) been satisfied on or before the
Termination Effective Time or (2) been 42



waived by Seller, or (B) by Buyer if any condition specified in Section 8.2
has not (1) been satisfied on or before the Termination Effective Time or (2)
been waived by Buyer; provided, in each case, that the failure to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby on or before such time did not result
from the failure by the Party seeking termination of this Agreement to fulfill
any undertaking or commitment provided for herein on the part of such Party
that is required to be fulfilled on or prior to the Closing.

| 
---|--- 

(v)

|

By Seller, if on the Scheduled Closing Date (A) Seller is not then in material
breach of any provision of this Agreement and (B) Buyer shall have breached
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, which breach results in the failure of a condition set forth in
Section 8.1(a), Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(c), and (1) such breach cannot
by its nature be cured prior to the Termination Effective Time, or (2) Buyer
fails to initiate action to cure such breach within 7 days following receipt
of written notice from Seller; or
