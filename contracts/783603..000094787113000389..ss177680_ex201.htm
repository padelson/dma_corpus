RECITALS

  

  

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and
the merger agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Merger
Agreement") and in accordance with the Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda, as
amended (the "Companies Act"), Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have agreed
to enter into a business combination transaction pursuant to which Merger Sub
will merge with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the
Surviving Company (the "Merger");

  

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board") has (i)
determined that the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, the
Company and its shareholders, and (ii) approved and adopted this Agreement,
the Merger Agreement, and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
including the Merger;

shareholder(s), and (ii) approved and adopted this Agreement, the Merger
Agreement and the Transactions;

  

  

WHEREAS, Merger Sub has received shareholder approval of this Agreement, the
Merger Agreement and the Transactions;

  

  

WHEREAS, upon consummation of the Merger, each issued and outstanding common
share, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (each a "Share" and together
the "Shares") will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive $29.25
per share in cash, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of and any
exceptions in this Agreement; and

  

  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, as part of the
consideration for Parent's willingness to enter into this Agreement, Parent is

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and
agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE I 
 

  

  

THE MERGER

  

  

SECTION 1.01 The Merger; Effective Time. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in Article VII, and in accordance with the Companies Act,
prior to the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause (a) the
Merger Agreement to be executed and delivered and (b) an application for
registration of the Surviving Company (the "Merger Application") to be
prepared, executed and delivered to the Registrar of Companies in Bermuda (the
"Registrar") as provided under Section 108 of the Companies Act and (c) the
Merger to become effective under the Companies Act. The Merger shall become
effective upon the issuance of a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of
Merger") by the Registrar or such other time as the Certificate of Merger may
provide. The parties to this Agreement agree that they will request the
Registrar to provide in the Certificate of Merger that the Effective Time will
be the time when the Merger Application is filed with the Registrar or another
time mutually agreed in writing by the parties to this Agreement (the
"Effective Time"). The name of the Surviving Company shall be "American Safety
Insurance Holdings, Ltd."

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

SECTION 1.02 Closing. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with Section 8.01, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will
take place at 10:00 a.m., New York time, on the second business day after the
later to be satisfied of the condition set forth in Section 7.01(a) or Section
7.01(c) (subject to the satisfaction or waiver (where permissible) of the
other conditions to Closing set forth in Article VII, other than those that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing), at the offices of Shearman and
Sterling LLP, 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10022, unless another
time, date or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company.

  

  

SECTION 1.03 Effects of the Merger. As of the Effective Time, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving such
Merger (the "Surviving Company"). The parties to this Agreement acknowledge
and agree that (a) the Merger shall be effected so as to constitute a "merger"
as such term is understood under the Laws of Bermuda and (b) the Surviving
Company shall be deemed to be a "surviving company" in accordance with Section
104H of the Companies Act. Pursuant to Section 109(2) of the Companies Act,
from and after the Effective Time: (i) the Merger of the Company and Merger
Sub and the vesting of their undertaking, property and liabilities in the
Surviving Company shall become effective; (ii) the Surviving Company shall
continue to be liable for the obligations and liabilities of each of the
Company and Merger Sub; (iii) any existing cause of action, claim or liability
to prosecution shall be unaffected; (iv) any civil, criminal or administrative
action or proceeding pending by or against the Company or Merger Sub may
continue to be prosecuted by or against the Surviving Company; (v) a
conviction against or Order in favor of or against, the Company or Merger Sub
may be enforced by or against the Surviving Company; however, the date of
incorporation of the Surviving Company is the original date of incorporation
of the Company and its merger with another company, including Merger Sub, does
not alter its original date of incorporation; (vi) the Certificate of Merger
shall be deemed to be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Company; (vii) the Registrar shall strike off the register Merger Sub; and
(viii) the cessation of Merger Sub shall not be a winding up within Part XIII
of the Companies Act.

  

  

SECTION 1.04 Surviving Company Memorandum of Association and Bye-Laws. (a) At
the Effective Time, the memorandum of association of the Company shall be as
set forth in Exhibit B attached hereto and shall be the memorandum of
association of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended as provided by
Law (the "Memorandum of Association").

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) At the Effective Time, the bye-laws of the Company shall be as set forth
in Exhibit C attached hereto and shall be the bye-laws of the Surviving
Company until thereafter amended as provided by Law (the "Bye-Laws").

  

  

SECTION 1.05 Directors and Officers. The directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Company, each to hold office in accordance with the Bye-Laws of the Surviving
Company, and the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Company, in each case
until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified
or until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal.

  

  

ARTICLE II 
 

  

  

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

  

  

SECTION 2.01 Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any of the following securities:

  

  

(a) Conversion of Shares. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (except as set forth in Section 2.01(b) and Section 2.04
and any Dissenting Shares) shall be canceled and shall be converted
automatically into the right to receive $29.25 in cash, without interest (the
"Merger Consideration"). The Merger Consideration is payable in accordance
with Section 2.02(b).

  

  

(b) Cancellation of Treasury Shares and Parent-Owned Shares. Each Share held
in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by Merger Sub, Parent or
any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled without any conversion
thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

  

  

(c) Shares of Merger Sub. Each share of par value $1.00, of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Company.

  

  

SECTION 2.02 Exchange of Certificates. (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall (i) appoint a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the "Paying Agent"), and (ii) enter into a paying
agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company,
with such Paying Agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Article II. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or cause the Surviving Company to deposit, with the Paying Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.01(a) (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Fund shall not
be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the
Paying Agent as directed by Parent; provided, however, that such investments
shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or
any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit
of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or
P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's
Corporation, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which
are then publicly available), or a combination of the foregoing. Any net
profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments
shall be payable to Parent or as directed by Parent.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
to be mailed to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record
of Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.01(a): (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Shares to the Paying
Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
certificates evidencing such Shares (each a "Certificate" and together the
"Certificates") or the non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry
("Book-Entry Shares") in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon (A)
surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent for cancellation, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, or (B) receipt by the Paying Agent of an
"agent's message" in the case of Book-Entry Shares, and, in each case, such
other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder
of such Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
2.01(a), and the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the
Merger Consideration may be made to a person other than the person in whose
name the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered are registered if the
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares representing such Shares shall be presented
to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and the
person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required
solely by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares or
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid
or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02,
each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at all times after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration to which the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share is entitled pursuant to this Article II. No interest shall be paid or
will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

  

  

(c) No Further Rights. From and after the Effective Time, holders of Shares
shall cease to have any rights as shareholders of the Company, except as
provided herein or by Law.

  

  

(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Shares one year after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent or as directed by Parent, upon demand, and
any holders of Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article II
shall thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Company for, and Parent
and the Surviving Company shall remain liable for payment of their claim for
the Merger Consideration without any interest thereon. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a date which is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims
or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) No Liability. None of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Company shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any cash
(including any dividends or distributions with respect to such Shares)
delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

  

  

(f) Withholding Rights. Each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Company and
Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares or
Company Share Options such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to such payment under all applicable federal, foreign, state or
local Tax laws and pay such withholding amount over to the appropriate taxing
authority, provided that at least ten (10) business days prior to deducting or
withholding any amount pursuant to this Section 2.02(f) (other than any
employment taxes and where providing advance notice is not possible due to a
change in Law), the Paying Agent, the Surviving Company or Parent (as
applicable) shall notify the Company in writing of its intention to withhold
or deduct such amounts and the parties shall use reasonable efforts to cause
the Paying Agent to provide the Shareholders with customary tax withholding
exemption forms, such as IRS Form W-9. To the extent that amounts are so
properly withheld by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Company or Parent, as the
case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or Company Share
Options in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Paying Agent, the Surviving Company or Parent, as the case may be.

  

  

(g) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, then upon (i) the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and (ii) if
required by the Surviving Company, an indemnity bond in form and substance and
with surety reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Company, the Paying Agent
shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Section
2.01(a).

  

  

SECTION 2.03 Share Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the share transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by
Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
presented to the Paying Agent or Parent for any reason shall be canceled
against delivery of the Merger Consideration to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to Section 2.01(a).

  

  

SECTION 2.04 Company Share Options and Restricted Shares. (a) At the Effective
Time, (i) each outstanding option (each, a "Company Share Option") to purchase
Shares granted under the Company's 1998 Incentive Stock Option Plan, the 2007
Incentive Stock Plan or the 1998 Director Stock Award Plan (the "Company Share
Plans") that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether or not vested or exercisable, shall become fully
vested and exercisable as of the Effective Time, (ii) the Company shall cancel
each Company Share Option that is outstanding and unexercised, as of the
Effective Time (in each case, without the creation of additional liability to
the Company or any Subsidiaries), subject, if applicable, to the payment

to a restricted Share award granted under the Company Share Plans ("Restricted
Shares") and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
become fully vested as of the Effective Time and transferable and all
restrictions on such restricted Shares shall lapse as of the Effective Time.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Each holder of a Company Share Option that is outstanding and unexercised
as of the Effective Time and has an exercise price per Share that is less than
the Merger Consideration shall (subject to the provisions of this Section
2.04) be paid by the Surviving Company immediately after the Effective Time,
in exchange for the cancellation of such Company Share Option, an amount in
cash equal to the product of (i) the difference between the Merger
Consideration and the applicable exercise price of such Company Share Option,
and (ii) the aggregate number of Shares issuable upon exercise of such Company
Share Option. All such payments shall be subject to all applicable federal,
state and local Tax withholding requirements and shall be made as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time.

  

  

(c) The Company shall ensure that no offering period under the Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") shall be commenced on or after the date of this
Agreement. If the Closing shall occur prior to the end of the offering period
in existence under the ESPP on the date of this Agreement, the Company shall
cause a new exercise date to be set under the ESPP, which date shall be no
less than five days prior to the Effective Time, use the accumulated funds to
purchase Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ESPP, and
ensure that the Shares so purchased are treated in accordance with Article II.
The Company shall terminate the ESPP immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all steps reasonably
necessary to cause the transactions contemplated hereby and any other
dispositions of Shares or other equity securities of the Company (including
derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each person who is
a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act, as amended.

  

  

(e) Corporate Actions. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
board of directors of the Company and the compensation committee of the board
of directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and
take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this
Section 2.04. The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that from
and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Company will be
required to deliver Shares or other capital stock of the Company to any person
pursuant to or in settlement of Company Share Options.

  

  

SECTION 2.05 Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. In the event that the Company
changes the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a
result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or
exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall
be equitably adjusted.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 2.06 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, any Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive the fair value thereof under Section 106(2) of the Companies
Act. The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt notice of (i) any demands for
appraisal of Dissenting Shares or attempted withdrawal or withdrawals of such
demands received by the Company and any other instruments served under the
Companies Act and received by the Company relating to any Dissenting
Shareholder's right to be paid the fair value of such Dissenting Shareholder's
Dissenting Shares and (ii) to the Company's knowledge, any applications to the
Supreme Court of Bermuda for appraisal of the fair value of the Dissenting
Shares and (b) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the opportunity to
participate with the Company in any and all negotiations and proceedings with

party, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer to
settle, any such demands or applications, or waive any failure to timely
deliver a written demand for appraisal or timely take any other action to
perfect appraisal rights in accordance with the Companies Act.

to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to be so
validly existing and in good standing would not have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed as a foreign legal entity to do business, and is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties or assets
owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such

the Company's other Subsidiaries that provide services to the Company
Insurance Subsidiaries is licensed or authorized, to the extent required by
Law, in each jurisdiction where it engages in business and for each line of

(b) To the Company's knowledge, as of the date of this Agreement, all of the
Company's Reinsurance Agreements are in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms, except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Insurance

which, with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both, would result
in such violation or default), or has given notice of any intention to cancel,
terminate or change the scope of rights and obligations under, or not to
renew, any Reinsurance Agreement, except, in each case, as has not had a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as has not had a Company Material
Adverse Effect, (i) since January 1, 2013 neither the Company nor the Company
Insurance Subsidiaries have received any written notice from any party to a
Reinsurance Agreement that any amount of reinsurance ceded by the Company or
such Company Insurance Subsidiary to such counterparty will be uncollectible
or otherwise defaulted upon, (ii) to the Company's knowledge, no party to a
Reinsurance Agreement under which the Company or any Company Insurance
Subsidiary is the cedent is insolvent or the subject of a rehabilitation,
liquidation, conservatorship, receivership, bankruptcy or similar proceeding,
(iii) to the Company's knowledge, the financial condition of any party to a
Reinsurance Agreement under which the Company or any Company Insurance
Subsidiary is the cedent is not impaired to the extent that a default
thereunder is reasonably anticipated, (iv) to the Company's knowledge, there
are no, and since January 1, 2013, there have been no, disputes under any
Reinsurance Agreement other than disputes in the ordinary course for which
adequate loss reserves have been established and (v) the relevant Company
Insurance Subsidiary is entitled under applicable Law and applicable Insurance
Law to take full credit in the Company SAP Statements for all amounts
recoverable by the Company under any Reinsurance Agreement and all such
amounts recoverable have been properly recorded in its books and records of
account (if so accounted therefor) and are properly reflected in the relevant
Company SAP Statements, except as has not had a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

(c) To the knowledge of the Company, each of the Company Insurance
Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed all reports or other filings required
to be filed with any insurance regulatory authority in the manner prescribed
therefor under applicable Insurance Laws and Permits, and no Governmental
Authority has asserted any deficiency or violation with respect thereto,
except as has been cured or resolved to the satisfaction of the Governmental
Authority or except, as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Without limiting the foregoing, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries'
submissions, reports or other filings under applicable insurance holding
company statutes or other applicable Insurance Laws with respect to Contracts
and transactions between or among Company Insurance Subsidiaries and their
affiliates, and all Contracts and transactions in effect between any Company
Insurance Subsidiary and any affiliate are in compliance with the requirements
of all applicable insurance holding company statutes or other applicable
Insurance Laws and all required approvals or deemed approvals of insurance
regulatory authorities with respect thereto have been received or obtained,
except as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(d) The policy reserves of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries recorded in
their Company SAP Statements have been computed: (i) in all material respects
in accordance with commonly accepted actuarial standards consistently applied
as in effect at such time, except as otherwise noted in the financial
statements and notes thereto included in such Company SAP Statements; (ii) on
the basis of methodologies consistent with those used in computing the
corresponding reserves in the prior fiscal years, except as otherwise noted in
the financial statements and notes thereto included in such Company SAP
Statements; and (iii) in accordance in all material respects with applicable
Insurance Law; provided, however, that the Company is not making any
representation or warranty (express or implied) as to the adequacy or
sufficiency of reserves for losses or loss expenses as of any date, provided,
further that the Company believed in good faith that such reserves were
adequate reserves for such losses or loss expenses at the time such reserves
were booked. The Company has provided or made available to Parent, to the
extent permitted by applicable Laws, true and complete copies of all Company
SAP Statements for each Company Insurance Subsidiary for the periods beginning
January 1, 2011 through the date hereof.

writing, sale, production, underwriting or administration of business for the
Company or its Subsidiaries, except for such failures or such violations which
have been cured, that have been resolved or settled through agreements with
applicable Governmental Entities or that are barred by an applicable statute
of limitations. Except as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect,
each Agent was appointed and compensated by the Company or its Subsidiaries in
compliance in all respects with applicable Law and all processes and
procedures used in making inquiries with respect of such Agent were undertaken
in compliance with applicable Law. No Agent has binding authority on behalf of
the Company or its Subsidiaries. As of the date of this Agreement, no Agent
accounting individually for 2% or more of the total gross premiums of all of
the Company Insurance Subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2012, has
indicated to the Company or its Subsidiaries in writing or, to the Company's
knowledge, orally that such Agent will be unable or unwilling to continue its

signer, indemnitor or otherwise other than insurance policies and reinsurance
Contracts issued in the ordinary course of business.

  

  

(f) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.10(f), no downgrade by a third party
rating agency of the financial strength, claims paying ability, insurance or
other ratings of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will, directly or
indirectly, contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or
default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise
to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation, to
a right to challenge the Transactions, to an obligation to post any collateral
under, to increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or
entitlements of any person under, or result in the creation of lien upon any
of the properties or assets of the Company under, any provision of, (a)
applicable Law with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries, (b) the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or its Subsidiaries or
(c) except as would not constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect, to the
Company's Knowledge, any Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of its assets or properties is bound.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

  

  

SECTION 6.01 Proxy Statement; Company Shareholders' Meeting. (a) As promptly
as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, and, in any
event, within 15 days after the date hereof, the Company shall prepare and
file with the SEC the preliminary Proxy Statement. Each of the Company and
Parent shall furnish all information concerning itself and its affiliates that
is required to be included in the Proxy Statement or that is customarily
included in proxy statements prepared in connection with transactions of the
type contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

27  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC with
respect to the Proxy Statement, and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company's
shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date on which the
SEC staff advises that it has no further comments thereon or that the Company
may commence mailing the Proxy Statement pursuant to Rule 14(a)-6 under the
Exchange Act. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff
for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall give
Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Proxy Statement including all amendments and supplements thereto, prior to
filing such documents with the SEC or disseminating to holders of Shares and
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all responses to requests for
additional information. The Company covenants that none of the information
included or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date
it is filed with the SEC or first mailed to the Company's shareholders or at
the time of the Company Shareholders' Meeting or at the time of any amendment
or supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading, except that no representation is made by the Company
with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the
preparation of the Proxy Statement for inclusion or incorporation by reference
therein. Parent covenants that none of the information supplied by Parent or
Merger Sub for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is filed
with the SEC or first mailed to the Company's shareholders or at the time of
the Company Shareholders' Meeting or at the time of any amendment or
supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading. If, at any time prior to the Company Shareholders'
Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent or any of their
respective affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the
Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party
which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties, and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated
to the shareholders of the Company.

Company shall as promptly as practicable after the date hereof duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the "Company
Shareholders' Meeting"), for the purpose of obtaining the Shareholder Approval
and shall not postpone, recess or adjourn such meeting except as required by
Law or with the consent of Parent. Subject to Section 6.03(b), the Company
Board shall (i) recommend to holders of the Shares that they adopt this
Agreement, (ii) include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (iii)
use its reasonable best efforts to solicit and obtain the Shareholder
Approval.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

28  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 6.02 Access to Information; Confidentiality. (a) Except as otherwise
prohibited by applicable Law or the terms of any Contract entered into prior
to the date hereof or as would be reasonably expected to violate any attorney-
client privilege (in which case the Company will use reasonable efforts to
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which such restrictions apply, including adopting additional specific
procedures to protect the confidentiality of sensitive material), from the
date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company shall (and shall
cause the Subsidiaries and the officers, employees, auditors and agents of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to): (i) provide to Parent and to the
officers, directors, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel,
financing sources, agents and other representatives (collectively,
"Representatives") of Parent reasonable access, during normal business hours
and upon reasonable prior notice to the Company by Parent, to the officers,
employees, agents, properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and
the Subsidiaries and to the books and records thereof, and (ii) furnish as
promptly as practicable to Parent such financial, operating and other data and
information concerning the business, properties, Contracts, assets,
liabilities, personnel and other aspects of the Company and the Subsidiaries
as Parent or its Representatives may reasonably request.

  

  

(b) All information obtained by Parent, Merger Sub or its or their
Representatives pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall be kept confidential in
accordance with the confidentiality agreement, dated December 26, 2012 (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), between Parent and the Company. In connection
therewith, Parent and Merger Sub may provide such information to Tower Group
International, Ltd. as a Representative of Parent and Merger Sub, in
accordance with and subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

(c) No investigation pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall affect any
representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any
condition to the obligations of the parties hereto.

  

  

SECTION 6.03 No Solicitation of Transactions. (a) Except as permitted by this
Section 6.03, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or, if
earlier, the termination of the Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, the
Company agrees that neither it nor any Subsidiary, nor any of the officers or
directors of it or any Subsidiary, shall, and that it shall use its reasonable
best efforts to instruct and cause its and its Subsidiaries' Representatives
not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, encourage or initiate any
inquiries or the implementation or submission of any proposal that constitutes
or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, or (ii)
engage in, continue or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public information in connection
with, any Acquisition Proposal except to notify such person of the existence
of this Section 6.03(a) or (iii) otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or
attempt to make an Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that, prior to,
but not after, the receipt of the Shareholder Approval, nothing contained in
this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from furnishing
information to (in response to a request therefor by), or engaging in
negotiations or discussions with, any person in connection with a written,
unsolicited, bona fide Acquisition Proposal providing for the acquisition of
at least 50% of the consolidated assets or the voting power of the Company and
its Subsidiaries by such person (an "Unsolicited Written Acquisition
Proposal"),

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

29  

  

 

 

 

  

  

if prior to taking such action (A) the Company Board (1) determines in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisors) that such Acquisition
Proposal is, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior
Proposal, and (2) determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that its failure to take such actions would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (B) the
Company receives from such person an executed confidentiality agreement with
terms no less favorable to the Company with regard to confidentiality than the
Confidentiality Agreement. Copies of any confidential information disclosed to
any third party pursuant to this Section 6.03(a) and not previously provided
to Parent shall promptly be provided to Parent.

  

  

(b) (1) Except as set forth in this Section 6.03(b), the Company, its
Subsidiaries and Representatives shall not, and shall not publicly propose to:
(i) withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub,
the Company Board Recommendation; (ii) approve or recommend or otherwise
declare advisable any Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) except as expressly
permitted by Section 8.01(f), cause or permit the Company to enter into any
letter of intent or memorandum of understanding, or approve, recommend or
otherwise declare advisable any letter of intent, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or other agreement relating or with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement entered into in
accordance with Section 6.03(a)) (an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement").
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to but not
after the receipt of the Shareholder Approval, (x) if in response to the
receipt of an Unsolicited Written Acquisition Proposal, if the Company Board
(A) determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors)
that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal and (B) determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that its
failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, then the Company Board may approve, recommend or
otherwise declare advisable such Superior Proposal and, in connection with the
approval or recommendation of such Superior Proposal, withhold, withdraw or
modify the Company Board Recommendation or (y) other than in connection with
an Acquisition Proposal, if a material development or change in circumstances
occurs or arises after the date of this Agreement that was not known by the
Company Board as of the date of this Agreement (an "Intervening Event") and
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that its failure to take such actions would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company
Board may withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation (either event
described in the foregoing clauses (x) and (y) a "Change in Board
Recommendation").

  

  

(2) No (x) Change in Board Recommendation may be made by the Company Board and
(y) no Alternative Acquisition Agreement shall be entered into by the Company
until after the second business day following Parent's receipt of notice from
the Company advising that the Company Board intends to take such action and
specifying the reasons and basis therefor, and including all necessary
information under Section 6.03(f), during which time the Company shall
negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) to agree upon such changes to the terms of this Agreement as would
result in, as applicable, (i) the Superior Proposal that is the subject of the
Change in Board Recommendation or the Alternative Acquisition Agreement to no
longer constitute a Superior Proposal or (ii) the Board's failure to effect a
Change in Board Recommendation as a result of an Intervening Event to no
longer be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

30  

  

 

 

 

  

  

In determining whether to make a Change in Board Recommendation in response to
a Superior Proposal or otherwise, or whether to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement, the Company Board shall take into account, after
consultation with its financial advisors, any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent and any other information provided by Parent in
response to such notice. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal or
Alternative Acquisition Agreement will be deemed to be a new Acquisition
Proposal or Alternative Acquisition Agreement for purposes of this Section
6.03, including with respect to the notice period referred to in this Section
6.03(b). Under no circumstance shall the Company enter into any Alternative
Acquisition Agreement without complying with Section 8.01(f) and 8.03(b)(iv).

  

  

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from taking
and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to
the Company's shareholders if the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that it is required to do
so under applicable Law.

  

  

(d) Except as set forth in Section 8.03(d) with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal, for purposes of this Agreement:

  

  

(i) "Acquisition Proposal" means any proposal or offer (including any proposal
from or to the Company's shareholders) from any person other than Parent or
Merger Sub relating to (1) any direct or indirect acquisition of (A) more than
15% of the assets of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or (B) more than 15% of any class of equity securities of the Company;
(2) any tender offer or exchange offer, as defined pursuant to the Exchange
Act, that if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 15% or
more of any class of equity securities of the Company; or (3) any merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or other similar transaction involving the Company.

  

  

(ii) "Superior Proposal" means any written Acquisition Proposal that (1)
relates to more than 50% of the outstanding Shares or all or substantially all
of the assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (2) is on
terms that the Company Board determines in good faith (after receiving the
advice of its financial advisor and after taking into account all the terms
and conditions, and all legal, financial and regulatory aspects, of the
Acquisition Proposal) are more favorable to the Company's shareholders from a
financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(after taking into account any revisions to the terms of the transaction
contemplated by Section 6.03(b)(2) of this Agreement pursuant to Section
6.03(b)(2) and the time likely to be required to consummate such Acquisition
Proposal) and (3) the Company Board determines is reasonably capable of being
consummated.

  

  

(e) Existing Discussions. The Company agrees that it will immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it will take the necessary steps
to promptly inform the individuals or entities referred to in the first
sentence hereof of the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.03. The
Company also agrees that it will promptly request each person that has
heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its
consideration of acquiring it or any of its Subsidiaries to return or destroy
all confidential information heretofore furnished to such person by or on
behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company agrees that it will fully
enforce any such confidentiality agreements, including standstill provisions
contained in any such confidentiality agreements, except that with respect to
the enforcement of standstill provisions, the Company Board may elect not to
enforce or waive such standstill provisions if it determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that its failure to take
such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

31  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) Notice. The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event,
within 24 hours) notify Parent if any bona fide inquiries, proposals or offers
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any non-public
information with respect to an Acquisition Proposal is requested from, or any
discussions or negotiations with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are sought
to be initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives
indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such person and the
material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if
applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including
proposed agreements) and thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a
reasonably current basis, of any material changes to the terms of any such
proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto).

  

  

SECTION 6.04 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance. (a) The
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company to, honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries under any and all indemnification agreements
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective
present or former directors and officers (collectively, the "Indemnified
Parties"). In addition, the bye-laws of the Surviving Company shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation and indemnification
than are set forth in Section 40 of the bye-laws of the Company, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely
the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time,
were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of the Company or
any of the Subsidiaries.

  

  

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless each
Indemnified Party against all costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts
paid in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
(whether arising before or after the Effective Time), whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to any action or
omission in their capacity as an officer, director, employee, fiduciary or
agent, whether occurring on or before the Effective Time. The Surviving
Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, pay all
expenses of each Indemnified Party in advance of the final disposition of any
such Action to the fullest extent permitted by Law to advance such expenses
upon receipt of an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined in accordance with applicable Law that such Indemnified Party is
not entitled to indemnification. In the event of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, (i) the Surviving Company shall pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties,
which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Company,
promptly after statements therefor are received,

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

32  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) the Surviving Company shall not settle, compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened Action to which an
Indemnified Party is a party (and in respect of which indemnification could be
sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement,
compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Party from all liability arising out of such Action or such Indemnified Party
otherwise consents, and (iii) the Surviving Company shall cooperate in the
defense of any such matter; provided, however, that the Surviving Company
shall not be liable for any settlement effected without the Surviving
Company's written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed); and provided, further, that, in the event that any claim for
indemnification is asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to
indemnification in respect of such claim shall continue until the disposition
of such claim. The rights of each Indemnified Party under this Section 6.04(b)
shall be in addition to any rights such person may have under the memorandum
of association or the bye-laws or similar organizational documents of the
Company and the Surviving Company or any of their Subsidiaries, or under any
Law or under any agreement of any Indemnified Party with the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
this Section 6.04, upon learning of any such Action shall notify the Surviving
Company (but the failure so to notify the Surviving Company shall not relieve
the Surviving Company from any liability which it may have under this Section
6.04 except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the Surviving
Company), and shall deliver to the Surviving Company an undertaking of the
kind described above. The Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one
law firm (in addition to local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction if
reasonably required) to represent them with respect to each such matter unless
there is, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on
any significant issue between the positions of any two or more Indemnified
Parties.

  

  

(c) Either the Company shall purchase prior to the Effective Time, or the
Surviving Company shall purchase, promptly following the Effective Time, a six
year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions (in both amount and scope)
providing substantially equivalent benefits, and from a carrier or carriers
with comparable credit ratings, as the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time
and covering the Transactions; provided, however, that in no event shall the
Company pay, or the Surviving Company be required to pay, more than 250% of
the current annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance (the
"Maximum Amount"); provided, further, that if the Surviving Company is unable
to obtain the insurance required by this Section 6.04(c) for an amount less
than or equal to the Maximum Amount, it shall obtain as much comparable
insurance as possible for the Maximum Amount.

  

  

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates or amalgamates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving company or entity of
such consolidation, amalgamation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall succeed
to the obligations set forth in this Section 6.04.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

33  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to perform all of the obligations
of the Surviving Company under this Section 6.04.

  

  

SECTION 6.05 Employee Benefits Matters. (a) Parent hereby agrees that for a
period of one year immediately following the Effective Time, it shall, or it
shall cause, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to, (i) provide each
employee of the Company and of each of the Company's Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time (each, an "Employee") with at least the same level of base
salary and total compensation opportunity that was provided to each such
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) provide the
Employees with employee benefits that are either substantially similar in the
aggregate to those provided to such Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time or, if no less favorable, that are substantially similar in the
aggregate to those provided to similarly-situated employees of the Parent or
an affiliate of the Parent. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to honor in accordance with
their terms, all Contracts, policies, plans and commitments of the Company and
the Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time that are
applicable to any current or former employees or directors of the Company or
any Subsidiary, including all severance agreements listed on Section 3.12(a)
of the Company Disclosure Letter.

  

  

(b) Each Employee shall receive credit for all purposes (including, for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, benefit accrual and
eligibility to receive benefits, but excluding benefit accruals under any
defined benefit pension plans) under any employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement established or maintained by Parent, the Surviving Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries under which each Employee may be eligible to
participate on or after the Effective Time to the same extent recognized by
the Company or any of the Subsidiaries under comparable Plans immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except to the extent such credit would result in
the duplication of benefits for the same period of service. Such plan, program
or arrangement shall credit each such Employee for service accrued on or prior
to the Effective Time with the Company, any Subsidiary and all affiliates
where service with the affiliate was credited under a comparable Plan of the
Company prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(c) With respect to each "employee welfare benefit plan" within the meaning of
Section 3(1) of ERISA maintained, sponsored or contributed to by Parent or the
Surviving Company ("Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plans") in which an Employee may
be eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (a) waive, or
cause the insurance carrier to waive, all limitations as to preexisting and
at-work conditions, if any, with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to each Employee under any Purchaser Welfare Benefit
Plan to the same extent such conditions would not have been applicable under
the terms of a comparable Plan, and (b) provide credit to each Employee for
any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such Employee
under the Plans during the relevant plan year, up to and including the
Effective Time.

  

  

(d) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that consummation
of the Transactions will constitute a change in control of the Company under
the terms of the Company's employee plans, programs and Contracts containing
provisions triggering payment, vesting or other rights upon a change in
control or similar transaction (collectively, the "Change in Control Plans").

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

34  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Notwithstanding Section 6.05(a), and only with respect to the individuals
listed on Section 6.05(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter, each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that (i) the employment
of such employee shall be terminated as of the Closing and (ii) that, pursuant
to each such employee's Change in Control Plan, the Company shall pay all
amounts and benefits payable under the Change in Control Plans at the time of
a change in control of the Company, in accordance with the respective terms of
the Change in Control Plans as illustrated by Section 6.05(d) of the Company
Disclosure Letter (including, without limitation, severance pay, acceleration
of vesting of Restricted Shares and Company Share Options and payment of all
tax equalization payments with respect to all of the foregoing, in each case,
unless the relevant employee consents otherwise, subject to withholding of
taxes at no more than the minimum rate required by applicable Law). Each of
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledges and agrees that each of
the individuals listed on Section 6.05(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
is an intended third party beneficiary of this Section 6.05(d).

  

  

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this Section 6.05 shall
(i) require the Surviving Company or Parent to provide severance or other
benefits at levels higher than those provided by the Company as of the date
hereof, (ii) be treated as an amendment of any particular Plan, (iii) give any
third party any right to enforce the provisions of Section 6.05(a)-(c), (iv)
obligate Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their affiliates to maintain
any particular benefit plan or (v) restrict Parent, the Surviving Company or
any of their affiliates from terminating the employment of any particular
Employee for any reason at any time.

  

  

SECTION 6.06 Further Action. (a) Each of the parties hereto shall use
reasonable best efforts to (i) promptly obtain all authorizations, consents,
Orders and approvals of all Governmental Authorities and officials that may be
or become necessary for its execution and delivery of, and the performance of
its obligations pursuant to, this Agreement, (ii) cooperate fully with the
other party in promptly seeking to obtain all such authorizations, consents,
Orders, approvals, licenses, permits and waivers, (iii) provide such other
information to any Governmental Authority as such Governmental Authority may
reasonably request in connection herewith and (iv) obtain all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties. As promptly as practicable,
but in any event no later than ten (10) business days, following the date of
this Agreement, (x) each party shall make its respective filing, if necessary,
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions and shall use
reasonable best efforts to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable to the
appropriate Governmental Authorities any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act, and (y)
Parent shall, with the full cooperation of the Company, prepare and file
requests for approval of the Transactions with the applicable Governmental
Authorities and shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all approvals
required to be made under applicable Insurance Laws with respect to the
Transactions, including an application with the Commissioner of the Oklahoma
Insurance Department for approval of the change in control of the parent of
American Safety Indemnity Company and American Safety Casualty Company in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the Oklahoma
Insurance Law (the "Form A Approval") and all other required pre-acquisition
notification statements (including Form Es and equivalent forms) under
applicable Insurance Laws set forth in Section 6.06(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter. Each party hereto agrees to make, as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement its respective filings and
notifications, if any, under any other applicable antitrust, competition or
trade regulation Law, and to supply as promptly as practicable to the
appropriate Governmental Authorities any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the applicable
antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

35  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and the Company
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best
efforts to eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust,
competition or trade regulation Law or Insurance Law that may be asserted by
any Governmental Authority or any other party so as to enable the parties
hereto to consummate the Transactions as promptly as practicable, and in any
event prior to the Termination Date, including, with respect to antitrust and
competition Laws proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture,
license or other disposition of such of its assets, properties or businesses
or of the assets, properties or businesses to be acquired by it pursuant
hereto, and the entrance into such other arrangements, as are necessary or
advisable in order to avoid the entry of, and the commencement of litigation
seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order or other Order in any suit or proceeding, which
would otherwise have the effect of materially delaying or preventing the
consummation of the Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
Merger Sub nor Parent nor any of their affiliates will be required by this
Section 6.06 to take any action, including entering into any consent decree,
hold separate orders or other arrangements, that (A)(1) requires the sale,
divestiture, license or other disposition of any assets, properties or
businesses of any of Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
subsidiaries or affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) or
(2) limits Parent's freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to
retain, any of Parent's or its affiliates' assets or businesses (other than
the Company and its Subsidiaries) or (B)(1) requires the sale, divestiture,
license or other disposition of any assets, properties or businesses of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (2) limits Parent's freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
or any portion thereof or (3) prohibits or limits in any material respect
Parent's ability to vote, transfer, receive dividends or otherwise exercise
full ownership rights with respect to the stock of the Surviving Company if,
in the case of each of clauses (B)(1), (2) and (3), such action has, or is
reasonably likely to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect or material
adverse effect on Parent's freedom of action or rights with respect to the
Company (any such limitation referred to in clauses (A) or (B), a "Burdensome
Condition"). Each of Parent and the Company agrees to defend through
litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any party in order to
avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any Order (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the Closing prior to
the Termination Date.

  

  

(c) Each party shall keep the other parties apprised of the content and status
of any communications with, and communications from, any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Transactions, including without limitation,
promptly notifying the other parties hereto of any material communication it
or any of its affiliates receives from any Governmental Authority relating to
any review or investigation of the Transactions under the HSR Act and shall
permit the other party to review in advance (and to consider any comments made
by the other party in relation to) any proposed material communication by such
party to any Governmental Authority relating to such matters.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

36  

  

 

 

 

  

  

None of the parties to this Agreement shall agree to participate in any
substantive meeting, telephone call or discussion with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any submissions, filings, investigation (including any
settlement of the investigation), litigation or other inquiry relating to the
matters that are the subject of this Agreement unless it consults with the
other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate at
such meeting, telephone call or discussion. The parties to this Agreement
shall (i) coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such
information and providing such assistance as the other party may reasonably
request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of
any applicable waiting periods, including under the HSR Act and (ii) provide
each other with copies of all correspondence, filings or communications
between them or any of their representatives, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other hand, with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, that materials may be redacted (i) to remove references
concerning the valuation of the Company, (ii) as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable
attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns.

shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise
making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, except to the extent public disclosure is required by applicable
Law or the requirements of the NYSE, in which case the issuing party shall use
its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party before issuing any
press release or making any such public statements, and except with respect to
the matters described in Sections 6.03, 8.01 and 8.03.

  

  

SECTION 6.09 Transfer Taxes. The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications
or other documents regarding any sales, transfer, stamp, stock transfer, value
added, use, real property transfer or gains and any similar Taxes which become
payable in connection with the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, each of Parent and the Surviving Company agrees to assume
liability for and pay any sales, transfer, stamp, stock transfer, value added,
use, real property transfer or gains and any similar Taxes, as well as any
transfer, recording, registration and other fees that may be imposed upon,
payable or incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions.

SECTION 6.11 Takeover Statutes. If any takeover statute is or may become
applicable to the Merger, the Company and the Company Board shall grant such
approvals and take such reasonable actions as are within their power so as to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statue or regulation on the
Transactions.

  

  

SECTION 6.12 Resignations. The Company shall procure letters of resignation,
effective as of the Effective Time, from each of the members of the Company
Board and each Board of Directors or similar governing body of each
Subsidiary.

(a) The Company shall sell on an orderly basis all Non-Cash Investments held
by or on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries, other than the Non-Cash
Investments set forth in Section 6.13 of the Company Disclosure Letter (the
"Liquidation") and the proceeds of such sales shall solely be either held in
cash or Treasury Bills (and the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, acquire any Non-Cash Investments). The Liquidation shall
commence promptly after the date of this Agreement and shall be completed no
later than the close of business on the fourteenth (14th) day after the date
of this Agreement. The Company shall consult regularly with Parent with
respect to the Liquidation and how to achieve best pricing and will provide
daily status reports on which securities have been sold and the sale price
received. Parent shall be provided direct access to the Company's third party

(b) Notwithstanding Section 6.13(a), the Company shall not sell any Non-Cash
Investment at a price less than the book value of such Non-Cash Investment as
of March 31, 2013 (the "Specified Value") without Parent's prior written
consent. If the Company is in good faith unable to sell a Non-Cash Investment
at a price at least equal to the Specified Value within seven days after the
date of this Agreement, it shall notify Parent of such fact in writing,
identifying the Non-Cash Investment in reasonable detail and requesting to
sell such Non-Cash Investment at a lower price, stating in good faith its
estimate of the best reasonably available price for such Non-Cash Investment.
If, following such written request, Parent does not give such consent within
two business days, then (i) the Company shall not be required to liquidate
such Non-Cash Investment and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub will be deemed to have
waived the requirement to sell such Non-Cash Investment with respect Section
6.13(a); provided that, in any event, the Company shall continue to use
reasonable efforts to sell such Non-Cash Investment at a price greater than
the Specified Value.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding Section 6.13(b), the Company may sell any Non-Cash
Investment at a price less than the Specified Value without Parent's prior
written consent only if (i) the Specified Value minus the sale price for such
Non-Cash Investment (the "Liquidation Loss") would not exceed $100,000 as a
result of such sale and (ii) the aggregate Liquidation Losses for all sales of
Non-Cash Investments pursuant to this Section 6.13(c) would not exceed
$1,000,000.

with the consummation of the Merger or shortly thereafter. The Company agrees
to use commercially reasonable efforts, at Parent's expense, to take such
actions as are reasonably requested by Parent to facilitate such transaction,
including by providing such information as may be required to make filings
with and obtain approvals from Governmental Authorities in connection with
such sale (including HSR, if required, approvals under Insurance Laws and
approvals of the Bermuda Monetary Authority with respect to the payment of a
dividend or other transactions) and taking such steps as may be reasonably
required to restructure the assets, contracts and employees relating to ASRE
and its Subsidiaries; provided that the Company and ASRE shall not be required
to take any action which is not contingent upon the consummation of the Merger
unless such action can be reversed in the event the Merger is not consummated
without material delay, expense or disruption to the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries. Parent acknowledges that the consummation of the sale of
ASRE is not a condition to the consummation of the Merger.

Date; provided, that the Company shall have given Parent written notice,

SECTION 8.02 Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination.

  

  

(a) A terminating party shall provide written notice of termination to the
other party specifying with particularity the reason for such termination, and

(b) In the event of any valid termination of this Agreement by any party as

SECTION 8.03 Fees and Expenses. (a) All Expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement, the Transactions, the solicitation of shareholder approvals
and all other matters related to the closing of the Merger shall be paid by
the party incurring such Expenses, whether or not the Merger or any other

42  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) one-half of the filing fees and the cost of
printing and mailing the Proxy Statement shall be paid by each of the Company
and Parent, and (ii) one-half of the filing fees incurred in connection with
the filings made pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions
shall be paid by each of the Company and Parent. "Expenses", as used in this
Agreement, shall include all reasonable out of pocket expenses (including all
fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers, financing
sources, hedging counterparties, experts and consultants to a party hereto and
its affiliates) incurred by a party or on its behalf in connection with or
related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and
performance of this Agreement.

  

  

(b) If this Agreement shall be terminated:

  

  

(i) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(b) (End Date) or Section
8.01(d) (No Shareholder Approval), if (A) at or prior to the Termination Date
an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced and not publicly withdrawn
and (B) within twelve (12) months of the Termination Date the Company enters
into, or the Board recommends or submits to the shareholders of the Company
for adoption an Alternate Acquisition Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal is
consummated, then the Company shall pay Parent the amount of $9,186,000 (the
"Company Termination Fee") provided that for purposes of this Agreement, an
Acquisition Proposal shall not be deemed to have been "publicly withdrawn" by
any person if, within 12 months of the Termination Date, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall have entered into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to, or shall have consummated or shall have approved or
recommended to the Company's shareholders, an Acquisition Proposal made by or
on behalf of such person or any of its Affiliates;

  

  

(ii) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(g) (as a result of a material breach
of a covenant) or Section 8.01(i), then the Company shall promptly, but in no
event later than two days after being notified of such by Parent, pay all of
the documented out-of-pocket Expenses, including those of the Paying Agent,
incurred by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement up to a maximum amount of
$1,500,000, in each case payable by wire transfer of same day funds (the
"Expense Reimbursement"); provided that if within twelve (12) months of the
Termination Date the Company enters into, or the Board recommends or submits
to the shareholders of the Company for adoption or otherwise does not oppose,
an Alternate Acquisition Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal is consummated,
then the Company shall pay Parent the Company Termination Fee, less the amount
of Expense Reimbursement previously paid;

  

  

(iii) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(e) and, on or prior to the date of
the Company Shareholders Meeting, any event giving rise to Parent's right to
terminate under Section 8.01(e) shall have occurred, then the Company shall
pay Parent the Company Termination Fee; or

  

  

(iv) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(f), then the Company shall pay to
Parent the Company Termination Fee.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) The Company Termination Fee payable by the Company under this Section 8.03
shall be paid to Parent or its designee by the Company in immediately
available funds (i) concurrently with and as a condition to the effectiveness
of a termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(f)
and (ii) within two (2) business days after the date of the event giving rise
to the obligation to make such payment in all other circumstances. If the
Company Termination Fee becomes payable and is in fact paid by the Company
then the payment to Parent or its designees of the Company Termination Fee
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent for any loss suffered by
Parent or Merger Sub as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be
consummated and upon such payment in accordance with this Section 8.03, the
Company shall not have any further liability or obligation for any losses with
respect thereto (except in the case of fraud).

  

  

(d) For purposes of this Section 8.03, Acquisition Proposal shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in Section 6.03(d)(i), except that references to
15% in clauses (1) and (2) of the definition thereof shall be deemed to be
references to 50% and clause (3) of the definition thereof shall be deemed
amended and replaced in its entirety by the following language "(3) any
merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization or other similar
transaction involving the Company or any of its consolidated Subsidiaries
pursuant to which shareholders of the Company immediately prior to the
consummation of such transaction would cease to own directly or indirectly at
least 50% of the voting power of the outstanding securities of the Company (or
of another person that directly or indirectly would own all or substantially
all of the assets of the Company) immediately following such transaction in
the same proportion as they owned prior to the consummation of such
transaction."

  

  

(e) The parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this
Section 8.03 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the
amount due pursuant to this Section 8.03, and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the Company for the Company Termination Fee or the Expense
Reimbursement or any portion thereof, the Company shall pay to Parent or
Merger Sub its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of such
payments at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such
payments were required to be made through the date of payment. Each of the
parties further acknowledges that the payment of the Company Termination Fee
by the Company specified in this Section 8.03 is not a penalty, but in each
case are liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate
Parent, as the case may be, in the circumstances in which such fees are
payable for the efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In no event
shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee in connection
with the termination of this Agreement more than once.

(c) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, Schedules or
Exhibits, such reference shall be to a Section, Schedule or Exhibit of this
Agreement, respectively, unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be
deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". The words "hereof,"
"herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this
Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not any particular
provision of this Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. The definitions
contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the
plural forms of such terms. References to a person are also to its permitted
successors and assigns. Whenever the context may require, any pronoun shall
include the corresponding masculine, feminine and neuter forms. Unless
otherwise specified in this Agreement, all reference to currency, monetary
values and dollars set forth herein shall mean United States (U.S.) dollars
and all payments hereunder shall be made in United States dollars.

  

  

SECTION 9.04 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

  

  

SECTION 9.05 Disclaimer of Other Representations and Warranties. Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company each acknowledges and agrees that, except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement (a) no
party makes, and has not made, any representations or warranties relating to
itself or its businesses or otherwise in connection with the Transactions, (b)
no person has been authorized by any party to make any representation or
warranty relating to such party or its businesses or otherwise in connection
with the Transactions and, if made, such representation or warranty must not
be relied upon as having been authorized by such party, and (c) any estimates,
projections, predictions, data, financial information, memoranda,
presentations or any other materials or information provided or addressed to
any party or any of its Representatives are not and shall not be deemed to be
or to include representations or warranties unless any such materials or
information is the subject of any representation or warranty set forth in this
Agreement.

SECTION 9.06 Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all
prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties
hereto, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.
This Agreement shall not be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger, by
operation of law or otherwise), except that Parent and Merger Sub may assign
all or any of their rights and obligations hereunder to one or more direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent, provided, however, that no such
assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder if
such assignee does not perform such obligations.

  

  

SECTION 9.07 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, other than Sections 6.04 and 6.05(d) (which are
intended to be for the benefit of the persons covered thereby and may be
enforced by such persons).

  

  

SECTION 9.08 Remedies; Specific Performance. The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. Each party agrees that, in the event of any breach or
threatened breach by any other party of any covenant or obligation contained
in this Agreement, the non-breaching party shall be entitled (in addition to
any other remedy that may be available to it whether in law or equity,
including monetary damages, except as limited by Section 8.03) to seek and
obtain (a) an Order of specific performance to enforce the observance and
performance of such covenant or obligation, and (b) an injunction restraining
such breach or threatened breach. In circumstances where Parent or the Company
is obligated to consummate the Merger and the Merger has not been consummated
(other than as a result of the other party's refusal to close in violation of
this Agreement), each of Parent and the Company expressly acknowledges and
agrees that the other party and its shareholders shall have suffered
irreparable harm, that monetary damages will be inadequate to compensate such
other party and its shareholders and that such other party on behalf of itself
and its stockholders shall be entitled to enforce specifically Parent's or the
Company's, as the case may be, obligation to consummate the Merger.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, the
parties acknowledge and agree that Parent shall not be entitled to enforce
specifically the obligations of the Company to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless all of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.01 and Section 7.03 shall have been satisfied or waived in writing
by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement, the parties acknowledge and agree that the Company shall not be
entitled to enforce specifically the obligations of the Parent and Merger Sub
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless all of
the conditions set forth in Section 7.01 and Section 7.02 shall have been
satisfied or waived in writing by Parent. Each party further agrees that no
other party or any other person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post
any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 9.08, and each party
irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing
or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

SECTION 9.09 Governing Law.

  

  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of Delaware without regard to the conflicts of Law rules of
such state.

  

  

(b) The parties hereto agree that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to
enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in
connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(whether brought by any party or any of its affiliates or against any party or
any of its affiliates) shall be brought in the Delaware Chancery Court or, if
such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State
of Delaware or other Delaware State court and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding
and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection
that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit,
action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or
proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any
party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any
such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of
process on such party as provided in Section 9.02 shall be deemed effective
service of process on such party.

  

  

SECTION 9.10 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a
trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising
out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. Each
of the parties hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney
of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other
party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing
waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been
induced to enter into this Agreement and the Transactions, as applicable, by,
among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section
9.10.

  

  

SECTION 9.11 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by
action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at any
time prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that, after the adoption
of this Agreement and the Transactions by the shareholders of the Company, no
amendment shall be made except as allowed under applicable Law. This Agreement
may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the
parties hereto.

  

  

SECTION 9.12 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto
may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of
any other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and
warranties of any other party contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any agreement of any other party
or any condition to its own obligations contained herein. Any such extension
or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by
the party or parties to be bound thereby. The failure of any party to assert
any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of those rights.

SECTION 9.13 Headings. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement
are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 9.14 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission) in two or more counterparts, and by the
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed
shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement.
