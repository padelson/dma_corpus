to receive, subject to and in accordance with Section 1.4, (A) an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the Common Per Share Cash Consideration and
(B) a number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock equal to the Common Per Share
Stock 

Consideration. The amount of cash each Converting Holder holding shares of
Company Common Stock is entitled to receive for such shares of Company Common
Stock shall be rounded to the nearest cent and computed after aggregating cash
amounts for all shares of Company Common Stock held by such Converting Holder.

(B) Each share of Company Common Stock, including any Unvested Company Shares,
held by an Unaccredited Stockholder immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Dissenting Shares and shares that are owned by the Company as
treasury stock) shall be cancelled and automatically converted into the right
to receive, subject to and in accordance with Section 1.4, an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the Cash-Out Per Share Consideration. The amount of
cash each Converting Holder holding shares of Company Common Stock is entitled
to receive for such shares of Company Common Stock shall be rounded to the
nearest cent and computed after aggregating cash amounts for all shares of
Company Common Stock held by such Converting Holder.

(C) The payout of cash or Acquirer Common Stock pursuant to this Section
1.3(a)(i) in exchange for Unvested Company Shares issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be subject to the same
restrictions and vesting arrangements that were applicable to such Unvested
Company Shares immediately prior to or at the Effective Time (and no vesting
acceleration shall occur by reason of the Merger or any subsequent event, such
as termination of employment, unless otherwise provided for in the document
establishing the vesting arrangement). Therefore, in exchange for the Unvested
Company Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
(a) cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Section 1.3(a)(i)
("Unvested Proceeds") shall not automatically be payable by Acquirer at the
Effective Time and shall instead become payable by Acquirer on the date that
such Unvested Company Shares would have become vested under the vesting
schedule in place for such shares immediately prior to or at the Effective
Time and (b) shares of Acquirer Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Section
1.3(a)(i) shall be issued but subject to forfeiture or a right of repurchase
by Acquirer on the same terms that such Unvested Company Shares would have had
in place for such shares immediately prior to or at the Effective Time (in
each case, subject to the restrictions and other terms of such vesting
schedule and giving effect to the applicable Vesting Agreement). Acquirer may
in its discretion make all such required payments to holders of Unvested
Proceeds no later than the 15th day of the calendar month immediately
following the calendar month in which such Unvested Proceeds would have become
vested under the original vesting schedule and in its discretion may make such
payments through the Paying Agent. All amounts payable or issuable pursuant to
this Section 1.3(a)(i) shall be subject to any required withholding of Taxes
and shall be paid without interest. A portion of any newly vested cash so
distributed will be treated as imputed interest to the extent required under
the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. All outstanding rights to
repurchase Unvested Company Shares that the Company may hold or similar
restrictions in the Company's favor immediately prior to the Effective Time
(all such rights, the "Repurchase Rights") shall be assigned to Acquirer in
the Merger and shall thereafter be exercisable by Acquirer upon the same terms
and subject to the same conditions that were in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time (as such may be amended pursuant the terms of any
applicable Vesting Agreement), except that Repurchase Rights may be exercised
by Acquirer by retaining the Unvested Proceeds into which such Unvested
Company Shares have been converted and paying to the former holder thereof the
repurchase price in effect for each such share subject to that Repurchase
Right immediately prior to the Effective Time. No Unvested Proceeds, or right
thereto, may be pledged, encumbered, sold, assigned or transferred (including
any transfer by operation of law), by any Person, other than Acquirer, or be 

taken or reached by any legal or equitable process in satisfaction of any
Liability of such Person, prior to the distribution to such Person of such
Unvested Proceeds in accordance with this Agreement.

(D) The parties agree that the holders of Company Capital Stock shall be
permitted, by written notice to the Company delivered at least five Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, to designate which of such holder's shares
shall be deemed to receive Cash Consideration and which shall be deemed to
receive Stock Consideration in the Merger, all in accordance with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.356-1(b). As part of the draft Spreadsheet to be
delivered to Acquirer at least five Business Days prior to the Closing
pursuant to Section 5.13, the Company shall deliver to Acquirer (1) a schedule
setting forth the full list of designations received from the holders of
Company Common Stock prior to such date and (2) a preliminary calculation,
complete in all respects but based on an estimate of the respective amounts of
the Merger Consideration payable to each holder of Company Common Stock
pursuant to this Section 1.3(a)(i) that constitutes compensation reportable on
IRS Form W-2 (including a calculation supporting the amount of each holder's
income from any "disqualifying dispositions" within the meaning of Section
421(b) of the Code) and proceeds of sale reportable on IRS Form 1099-B. On the
Closing Date and as part of the final Spreadsheet, the Company shall deliver
to Acquirer a final calculation of the respective amounts of the Merger
Consideration payable to each holder of Company Common Stock that constitutes
compensation reportable on IRS Form W-2 (including the supporting calculation
described above) and proceeds of sale reportable on IRS Form 1099-B. Absent
timely receipt of such designations and the preliminary and final calculations
for a particular Company Stockholder, the designations will be disregarded
with respect to such Company Stockholder and Acquirer shall report the Merger
Consideration consistent with such Company Stockholder exchanging each of its
shares for both Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration.

(ii) Company Options and Company RSUs.

(A) At the Effective Time, each Company Option held by a Named Employee or a
Continuing Employee that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding as of the
Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall, on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, be assumed by Acquirer. Each such
Company Option so assumed by Acquirer under this Agreement shall continue to
have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including, if
applicable, the vesting arrangements and other terms and conditions set forth
in the Company Option Plan and the applicable stock option agreement) as are
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) such
Company Options shall be exercisable for that number of whole shares of
Acquirer Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the next whole
number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock, with no cash being payable for any
fractional share eliminated by such rounding) of the number of shares of
Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, (ii)
the per share exercise price for the shares of Acquirer Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of such assumed Company Option shall be equal to the quotient
(rounded up to the next whole cent) of the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock at which such option was exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio and (iii) no assumed option may
be "early exercised" (i.e., an assumed option may be exercised for shares of
Acquirer Common Stock only to the extent the assumed option is vested at the
time of exercise pursuant to the applicable vesting schedule). Consistent with
the terms of the Company Option Plan and the documents governing the
outstanding options under such plan as in effect on the Agreement Date, the
Merger shall not in and of itself terminate any of the outstanding Company
Options held by Named Employees or Continuing Employees under such plan or
accelerate the exercisability or 

vesting of such options or the shares of Acquirer Common Stock that shall be
subject to those options upon Acquirer's assumption of the options in the
Merger.

(B) At the Effective Time, each Company Option, other than the Company Options
assumed by Acquirer pursuant to Section 1.3(a)(ii)(A), shall not be assumed by
Acquirer and shall, by virtue of the Merger and without the need for any
further action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and
extinguished; provided that with respect to the portion of such cancelled
Company Option that is a Vested Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, such Vested Company Option shall be converted into the right
to receive a cash payment, without interest, with respect to each share of
Company Capital Stock underlying such Vested Company Option, equal to the
excess of the Cash-Out Per Share Consideration over the per share exercise
price of such Vested Company Option (with the aggregate amount of such payment
rounded to the nearest whole cent). For purposes of clarity, no payment shall
be made with respect to any Company Option so cancelled with a per-share
exercise price that equals or exceeds the amount of the Cash-Out Per Share
Consideration.

(C) At the Effective Time, each Company RSU held by a Named Employee or a
Continuing Employee that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding as of the
Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall, on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, be assumed by Acquirer. Each such
Company RSU so assumed by Acquirer under this Agreement shall continue to
have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including, if
applicable, the vesting arrangements and other terms and conditions set forth
in the Company Option Plan and the applicable restricted stock unit agreement)
as are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that such
Company RSUs shall be settled by the issuance of that whole number of Acquirer
Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the next whole number of
shares of Acquirer Common Stock, with no cash being payable for any fractional
share eliminated by such rounding) of the number of shares of Company Common
Stock that were issuable upon settlement of such Company RSU immediately prior
to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. Consistent with the
terms of the Company Option Plan and the documents governing the outstanding
Company RSUs, if any, under such plan as in effect on the Closing Date, the
Merger shall not in and of itself terminate any of the outstanding Company
RSUs held by Named Employees or Continuing Employees under such plan or
accelerate the exercisability or vesting of such Company RSUs or the shares of
Acquirer Common Stock that shall be subject to those Company RSUs upon
Acquirer's assumption of the Company RSUs in the Merger.

(D) Acquirer will not assume any Company RSUs held by Persons that are not
Named Employees or Continuing Employees.

(E) The Company shall, prior to the Closing, take or cause to be taken all
actions, and shall obtain all consents, as may be required to effect the
treatment of Company Options and Company RSUs pursuant to this Section
1.3(a)(ii).

(F) Acquirer shall cause the Company Options and Company RSUs assumed pursuant
to Sections 1.3(a)(ii)(A) and 1.3(a)(ii)(C) to be registered with the SEC on
Form S-8 or other applicable registration statement within 20 days following
the Effective Time and will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as such
Company Options and Company RSUs shall remain outstanding.

(iii) Company Warrants. 

(A) At the Effective Time, each Company Warrant that is unexpired, unexercised
and outstanding as of the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall
not be assumed by Acquirer and shall, by virtue of the Merger and without the
need for any further action on the part of the holder thereof, shall be
converted into the right to receive a cash payment, without interest, with
respect to each share of Company Capital Stock underlying such Company
Warrant, equal to the excess of the Cash-Out Per Share Consideration over the
exercise price per share of such Company Warrant (with the aggregate amount of
such payment rounded to the nearest whole cent). For purposes of clarity, no
payment shall be made with respect to any Company Warrants so cancelled with a
per-share exercise price that equals or exceeds the amount of the Cash-Out Per
Share Consideration.

(B) The payout of cash pursuant to this Section 1.3(a)(iii) in exchange for
Unvested Company Warrant issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be subject to the same restrictions and vesting
arrangements that were applicable to such Unvested Company Warrant immediately
prior to or at the Effective Time (and no vesting acceleration shall occur by
reason of the Merger or any subsequent event, unless otherwise provided for in
the document establishing the vesting arrangement). Therefore, amounts
otherwise payable or issuable pursuant to this Section 1.3(a)(iii) in exchange
for the Unvested Company Warrants issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time ("Unvested Warrant Proceeds") shall not automatically be
payable by Acquirer at the Effective Time, and shall instead become payable by
Acquirer on the date that such Unvested Warrants would have become vested
under the vesting schedule in place for such Company Warrants immediately
prior to or at the Effective Time. Acquirer may in its discretion make all
such required payments to holders of Unvested Warrant Proceeds no later than
the 15th day of the calendar month immediately following the calendar month in
which such Unvested Warrant Proceeds would have become vested under the
original vesting schedule and in its discretion may make such payments through
the Paying Agent. All amounts payable or issuable pursuant to this Section
1.3(a)(iii) shall be subject to any required withholding of Taxes and shall be
paid without interest. A portion of any newly vested cash so distributed will
be treated as imputed interest to the extent required under the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder. All outstanding rights to cancel Unvested
Company Warrants that the Company may hold or similar restrictions in the
Company's favor immediately prior to the Effective Time (all such rights, the
"Unvested Warrant Rights") shall be assigned to Acquirer in the Merger and
shall thereafter be exercisable by Acquirer upon the same terms and subject to
the same conditions that were in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except that Unvested Warrant Rights may be exercised by Acquirer by
retaining the Unvested Warrant Proceeds into which such Unvested Company
Warrants have been converted. No Unvested Warrant Proceeds, or right thereto,
may be pledged, encumbered, sold, assigned or transferred (including any
transfer by operation of law), by any Person, other than Acquirer, or be taken
or reached by any legal or equitable process in satisfaction of any Liability
of such Person, prior to the distribution to such Person of such Unvested
Warrant Proceeds in accordance with this Agreement.

(C) The Company shall, prior to the Closing, take or cause to be taken all
actions, and shall obtain all consents, as may be required to effect the
treatment of Company Warrants pursuant to this Section 1.3(a)(iii).

(b) Treatment of Company Capital Stock Owned by the Company. At the Effective
Time, all shares of Company Capital Stock that are owned by the Company as
treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof or payment of any cash or other
property or consideration therefor and shall cease to exist. 

(c) Treatment of Merger Sub I Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the First Merger and without any action on the part of Acquirer, Merger Sub
I or any other Person, each share of capital stock of Merger Sub I that is
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one share of common stock of the First Step
Surviving Corporation (and the shares of the First Step Surviving Corporation
into which the shares of Merger Sub I capital stock are so converted shall be
the only shares of the First Step Surviving Corporation's capital stock that
are issued and outstanding immediately after the Effective Time). From and
after the Effective Time, each certificate evidencing ownership of a number of
shares of Merger Sub I capital stock will evidence ownership of such number of
shares of common stock of the First Step Surviving Corporation.

(d) Treatment of Merger Sub II Membership Interests. At the Second Effective
Time, by virtue of the Second Merger and without any action on the part of
Acquirer, Merger Sub II or any other Person, each share of common stock of the
First Step Surviving Corporation that is issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Second Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished without
any conversion thereof. At the Second Effective Time, each membership interest
of Merger Sub II that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Second Effective Time will constitute a membership interest of the Final
Surviving Entity (and the membership interests of the Final Surviving Entity
shall be the only membership interests of the Final Surviving Entity issued
and outstanding immediately after the Second Effective Time).

(e) Adjustments. In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into capital stock), reorganization, reclassification, combination,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to the Company Capital
Stock or Acquirer Common Stock occurring after the Agreement Date and prior to
the Effective Time, all references herein to specified numbers of shares of
any class or series affected thereby, and all calculations provided for that
are based upon numbers of shares of any class or series (or trading prices
therefor) affected thereby, shall be equitably adjusted to the extent
necessary to provide the parties the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend,
reorganization, reclassification, combination, recapitalization or other like
change.

(f) Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, any Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the right to receive
the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration, but shall instead be
converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to
be due with respect to any such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the DGCL or the
CCC. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who, pursuant to the DGCL or the CCC,
becomes entitled to payment thereunder for such shares shall receive payment
therefor in accordance with the DGCL or the CCC (but only after the value
therefor shall have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to such
provisions). If, after the Effective Time, any Dissenting Shares shall lose
their status as Dissenting Shares, then any such shares shall immediately be
deemed to have converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the
applicable portion of the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares as if
such shares never had been Dissenting Shares, and Acquirer shall issue and
deliver to the holder thereof, at (or as promptly as reasonably practicable
after) the applicable time or times specified in Section 1.4(a), following the
satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 1.4(a), the
applicable portion of the Merger Consideration as if such shares never had
been Dissenting Shares. The Company shall provide to Acquirer (i) prompt
notice of any demands for appraisal or purchase received by the Company,
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments related to such demands
served pursuant to the DGCL or the CCC and received by the Company and (ii)
the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands under the DGCL or the CCC. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Acquirer, or as otherwise required under the DGCL or
the CCC, voluntarily make any payment or offer to make any payment with
respect to, or settle 

or offer to settle, any claim or demand in respect of any Dissenting Shares.
Subject to Section 8.2, the payout of consideration under this Agreement to
the Company Stockholders (other than in respect of Dissenting Shares, which
shall be treated as provided in this Section 1.3(f) and under the DGCL or the
CCC) shall not be affected by the exercise or potential exercise of appraisal
rights or dissenters' rights under the DGCL or the CCC by any other Company
Stockholder.

(g) Rights Not Transferable. The rights of the Company Securityholders under
this Agreement as of immediately prior to the Effective Time are personal to
each such Company Securityholder and shall not be transferable for any reason,
other than by operation of law, will or the laws of descent and distribution
without action taken by or on behalf of such Company Securityholder. Any
attempted transfer of such right by any holder thereof (other than as
permitted by the immediately preceding sentence) shall be null and void.

(h) Fractional Shares. The number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock into
which a Converting Holder's shares of Company Common Stock are converted
pursuant to this Article I shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number
of shares of Acquirer Common Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares of
Acquirer Common Stock to which any Converting Holder would otherwise be
entitled (after aggregating, for each particular stock certificate
representing Company Capital Stock, all fractional shares of Acquirer Common
Stock to be received by such holder), such Converting Holder shall receive
from Acquirer an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to
the product of (i) such fraction and (ii) the Acquirer Stock Price.

(i) No Interest. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
interest shall accumulate on any cash payable in connection with the
consummation of the Merger or the other Transactions.



1.4 Payment and Exchange Procedures.

(a) Surrender of Certificates.

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date (and in any event
within two Business Days), to the extent not previously delivered, Acquirer
shall mail, or cause to be mailed by the Paying Agent, a letter of transmittal
together with instructions for use thereof to every holder of record of
Company Capital Stock in the form attached as Exhibit J-1 hereto (the "Letter
of Transmittal (Company Capital Stock)") and a letter of transmittal together
with instructions for use thereof to every holder of Company Warrant in the
form attached as Exhibit J-2 hereto (the "Letter of Transmittal (Company
Warrants)" together with the Letter of Transmittal (Company Capital Stock),
the "Letter of Transmittal") that was issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. The Letter of Transmittal (Company Capital Stock) shall
specify that delivery of the certificates or instruments that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented issued and outstanding Company Capital
Stock (the "Certificates") shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon surrender thereof (or, in the case of
any lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, compliance with Section
1.4(a)(vii)), together with a properly completed and duly executed Letter of
Transmittal, duly executed on behalf of each Person effecting the surrender of
such Certificates. To the extent reasonably practicable, the Company will make
electronic copies of the Letter of Transmittal available in advance of Closing
(by delivering electronic copies of the Letter of Transmittal to the Company's
legal counsel) to each record holder of Company Capital Stock and Company
Warrants in order to allow submission of such Letter of Transmittal concurrent
with the Closing. 

(ii) Promptly following the Closing, but in no event later than the next
Business Day, Acquirer shall cause to be deposited with Citibank N.A. or other
bank or trust company selected by Acquirer and reasonably satisfactory to the
Company (the "Paying Agent") the portion of the Merger Consideration payable
to Company Stockholders pursuant to Section 1.3(a)(i) in respect of their
shares of Company Common Stock, subject to Section 1.4(b) (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, excludes the Unvested Proceeds and the Unvested Warrant
Proceeds) by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

(iii) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of delivery to the
Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed and duly
executed Letter of Transmittal (Company Capital Stock) and any other
documentation required thereby, (A) the holder of record of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive (I) the amount of cash and (II) the number of
shares of Acquirer Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 1.3(a)(i) in respect of such Certificate, less such
Converting Holder's Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Amount (with cash and stock
allocations thereof as set forth on the Spreadsheet), and (B) such Certificate
shall be cancelled.

(iv) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of delivery to the
Paying Agent of a Letter of Transmittal (Company Warrants) and any other
documentation required thereby, (A) the holder of record of such Company
Warrant shall be entitled to receive the amount of cash that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.3(a)(iii) in respect of such
Company Warrant and (B) such Company Warrant shall be cancelled.

(v) Any certificates or book-entry entitlements representing the shares of
Acquirer Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 1.3(a) shall bear the
following legends to the extent applicable (along with any other legends that
may be required under Applicable Law):

"THE SHARES EVIDENCED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT
OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT"), OR UNDER APPLICABLE STATE
SECURITIES LAWS AND HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT AND NOT WITH A VIEW TO,
OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE SALE OR DISTRIBUTION THEREOF. NO SUCH SALE OR
DISTRIBUTION MAY BE EFFECTED WITHOUT AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT
RELATED THERETO OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR THE COMPANY THAT SUCH
REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR APPLICABLE STATE
SECURITIES LAWS."

It is Acquirer's current policy not to issue stock certificates representing
shares of its capital stock, and all new issuances of capital stock are
reflected on Acquirer's books and records in book entry only, with appropriate
notations reflecting the applicable legends.

(vi) Promptly following the Closing, but in no event later than the next
Business Day, Acquirer will instruct the Paying Agent, subject to any
applicable Vesting Agreement or other vesting restrictions, (A) (I) to pay to
each Converting Holder by check or wire transfer of same‑day funds the
aggregate amount of cash payable to such Converting Holder pursuant to Section
1.3(a)(i), less such Converting Holder's Pro Rata Share of the Cash Escrow
Amount, and (II) to deliver to each Converting Holder the aggregate number of
shares of Acquirer Common Stock issuable to such Converting Holder pursuant to
Section 1.3(a)(i), less such Converting Holder's Pro Rata Share 

of the Stock Escrow Amount, in each case other than in respect of Dissenting
Shares to holders thereof, and (B) to pay to each Company Warrantholder by
check or wire transfer of same-day funds the aggregate amount of cash payable
to such Company Warrantholder pursuant to Section 1.3(a)(iii), in each case as
promptly as practicable following, in the case of Company Capital Stock, the
submission of a Certificate to the Paying Agent and a duly executed Letter of
Transmittal (Company Capital Stock) by such Converting Holder and in the case
of Company Warrants, the submission of a duly executed Letter of Transmittal
(Company Warrants) by such Company Warrantholder.

(vii) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such document to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and such Person agreeing to indemnify the Paying
Agent and Acquirer for the consequences thereof, the Paying Agent will pay and
deliver, respectively, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed document
the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration payable and issuable,
respectively, pursuant to Section 1.3(a)(i) in respect of their shares of
Company Common Stock, less the applicable portion of such Converting Holder's
Pro Rata Share of the Cash Escrow Amount and of the Stock Escrow Amount.

(b) Escrow Amount. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the other
provisions of this Article I, Acquirer shall withhold from each Converting
Holder's applicable portion of the Merger Consideration payable and issuable
to such Converting Holder pursuant to Section 1.3(a) such Converting Holder's
Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Amount (with cash and stock allocations thereof
as set forth on the Spreadsheet, it being understood and agreed that
Unaccredited Stockholders shall first contribute cash and all other Converting
Holders shall contribute their Pro Rata Share of the remainder of the Escrow
Amount in cash and shares of Acquirer Common Stock), and shall deposit the
Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 8.1. The cash and
shares of Acquirer Common Stock deposited into the Escrow Fund shall, to the
maximum extent possible, consist of vested cash and vested shares of Acquirer
Common Stock. The Escrow Fund shall constitute partial security for the
benefit of Acquirer (on behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Person) with
respect to any Indemnifiable Damages pursuant to the indemnification
obligations of the Converting Holders under Section 1.6(i) and Article VIII,
and shall be held and distributed in accordance with Section 1.6(i) and
Section 8.1. The adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the principal
terms of the Merger by the Company Stockholders shall constitute, among other
things, approval of the Escrow Amount, the withholding of the Escrow Amount by
Acquirer and the appointment of the Stockholders' Agent.

(c) Transfers of Ownership. If any cash amount or share of Acquirer Common
Stock payable or issuable pursuant to Section 1.3(a) is to be paid or issued
to a Person other than the Person to which the Certificate or Company Warrant
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the
payment or issuance thereof that such Certificate or Company Warrant shall be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such exchange shall have paid to Acquirer or any agent
designated by Acquirer any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
payment of cash or issuance of shares of Acquirer Common Stock in any name
other than that of the registered holder of such Certificate or Company
Warrant, or established to the satisfaction of Acquirer or any agent
designated by Acquirer that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.4, no party hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly
paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Applicable Law.

(e) Unclaimed Consideration. Each holder of a Certificate or Company Warrant
who has not theretofore complied with the exchange procedures set forth in and
contemplated by this Section 1.4 

shall look only to Acquirer (subject to abandoned property, escheat and
similar Applicable Law) for its claim, only as a general unsecured creditor
thereof, to any portion of the Merger Consideration payable or issuable
pursuant to Section 1.3(a) in respect of such Certificate or Company Warrant.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if any Certificate
or Company Warrant has not been surrendered prior to the earlier of the first
anniversary of the Effective Time and such date on which the applicable
portion of the Merger Consideration payable or issuable pursuant to Section
1.3(a) in respect of such Certificate or Company Warrant would otherwise
escheat to, or become the property of, any Governmental Entity, any amounts
payable in respect of such Certificate or Company Warrant shall, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of Acquirer, free and clear
of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.



1.5 No Further Ownership Rights in the Company Capital Stock, Company Options,
Company RSUs or Company Warrants. The applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration paid or payable and issued or issuable following the surrender
for exchange of the Certificates in accordance with this Agreement shall be
paid or payable, issued or issuable in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Capital Stock represented by such
Certificates, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
records of the First Step Surviving Corporation or Final Surviving Entity of
shares of Company Capital Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate or
document or instrument representing a Company Option or Company RSU is
presented to the First Step Surviving Corporation or Final Surviving Entity
for any reason, such Certificate, Company Option, Company RSU or Company
Warrant shall be cancelled and exchanged or assumed as provided in this
Article I.



1.6 Company Net Working Capital and Company Net Cash Adjustment.

(a) Pursuant to Section 5.13, the Company shall deliver the Company Closing
Financial Certificate to Acquirer not later than five Business Days prior to
the Closing Date.

(b) Within 75 days after the Closing, Acquirer may object to the calculation
of Company Net Working Capital and/or Company Net Cash included in the Company
Closing Financial Certificate (the "Calculations") by delivering to the
Stockholders' Agent a notice (the "Acquirer Notice") setting forth Acquirer's
calculation of Company Net Working Capital and/or Company Net Cash and the
amount by which Company Net Working Capital and/or Company Net Cash as
calculated by Acquirer is less than Company Net Working Capital and/or Company
Net Cash as set forth in the Company Closing Financial Certificate, in each
case together with supporting documentation, information and calculations as
is reasonably necessary for the Stockholders' Agent to review such
calculations.

(c) The Stockholders' Agent may object to the calculation of Company Net
Working Capital and/or Company Net Cash set forth in the Acquirer Notice by
providing written notice of such objection to Acquirer within 30 days after
receipt of the Acquirer Notice (the "Notice of Objection"), together with
supporting documentation, information and calculations, as is reasonably
necessary for Acquirer to review such calculations. Any matters not set forth
in the Notice of Objection shall be deemed to have been accepted by the
Stockholders' Agent on behalf of the Converting Holders.

(d) If the Stockholders' Agent timely provides the Notice of Objection, then
Acquirer and the Stockholders' Agent shall confer in good faith for a period
of up to 10 Business Days following Acquirer's timely receipt of the Notice of
Objection in an attempt to resolve any disputed matter set forth in the Notice
of Objection, and any resolution by them shall be in writing and shall be
final and binding on the parties hereto and the Converting Holders. 

(e) If, after the 10 Business Day period set forth in Section 1.6(d), Acquirer
and the Stockholders' Agent cannot resolve any matter set forth in the Notice
of Objection, then Acquirer and the Stockholders' Agent shall engage
PricewaterhouseCoopers or, if such firm is not able or willing to so act,
another auditing firm acceptable to both Acquirer and the Stockholders' Agent
(the "Reviewing Accountant") to review only the matters in the Notice of
Objection that are still disputed by Acquirer and the Stockholders' Agent and
the Calculations to the extent relevant thereto. After such review and a
review of the Company's relevant books and records, the Reviewing Accountant
shall promptly (and in any event within 60 days following its engagement)
determine in writing the resolution of such remaining disputed matters, which
written determination shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and the
Converting Holders, and the Reviewing Accountant shall provide Acquirer and
the Stockholders' Agent with a calculation of Company Net Working Capital
and/or Company Net Cash in accordance with such determination.

(f) If there is a Final Shortfall, the Converting Holders shall severally but
not jointly indemnify and hold harmless Acquirer, for the full amount of:

(i) the Final Shortfall; and

(ii) all fees, costs and expenses of the Reviewing Accountant to be paid by
the Converting Holders pursuant to Section 1.6(h)(ii) or Section 1.6(h)(iii),
if any.

(g) If there is a Final Surplus, then Acquirer shall promptly deposit with the
Paying Agent for payment to the Converting Holders:

(i) the Final Surplus; and

(ii) all fees, costs and expenses of the Reviewing Accountant to be paid by
Acquirer pursuant to Section 1.6(h)(i) or Section 1.6(h)(iii), if any.

(h) The fees, costs and expenses of the Reviewing Accountant shall be paid (i)
by Acquirer in the event the difference between the Final Net Working Capital
and/or Final Net Cash as determined by the Reviewing Accountant pursuant to
Section 1.6(e) and the Calculations set forth in the Acquirer Notice (such
difference, the "Acquirer's Difference") is greater than the difference
between the Final Net Working Capital and/or as determined by the Reviewing
Accountant pursuant to Section 1.6(e) and the Calculations set forth in the
Notice of Objection (such difference, the "Stockholders' Agent's Difference"),
(ii) by the Converting Holders if the Acquirer's Difference is less than the
Stockholders' Agent's Difference or (iii) equally by Acquirer on the one hand,
and the Converting Holders on the other hand, if the Acquirer's Difference is
the same as the Stockholders' Agent's Difference.

(i) To the extent that the Converting Holders have an obligation to indemnify
Acquirer pursuant to this Section 1.6, Acquirer shall first satisfy such
obligation from the Escrow Fund. Acquirer's right to indemnification pursuant
to this Section 1.6 will not be subject to any of the limitations set forth in
Article VIII. Any payments made pursuant to this Section 1.6 shall be treated
as adjustments to the Merger Consideration for all Tax purposes to the maximum
extent permitted under Applicable Law.

except as provided in Section 5.15, neither Acquirer nor the Merger Subs make
any representations or warranties to the Company or to any Company
Securityholder regarding the Tax treatment of the Merger, or any of the Tax
consequences to the Company or any Company Securityholder of this Agreement,

Merger or the other Transactions or the other agreements contemplated by this

Securityholders are relying solely on their own Tax advisors in connection
with this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions and the other
agreements contemplated by this Agreement.



1.8 Certain Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration
and other Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the applicable Company
Securityholder when due, and such Company Securityholder shall, at its own
expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect
to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other
Taxes and fees.



1.9 Withholding Rights. Each of Acquirer, the First Step Surviving
Corporation, the Final Surviving Entity and the Paying Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any payments of cash or issuances of Acquirer

Agreement as having been paid or issued, as applicable, to such Persons in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

Company Transaction Document or to consummate the Transactions in accordance
with this Agreement or any other Company Transaction Document and Applicable
Law.



2.4 Financial Statements; No Undisclosed Liabilities.

(a) The Company has delivered to Acquirer its audited, consolidated financial
statements for each fiscal year subsequent to December 31, 2011 and its
unaudited, consolidated financial statements for the seven-month period ended
July 31, 2015 (including, in each case, balance sheets, statements of

Statements"), which are included as Schedule 2.4(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter. The Financial Statements (i) are derived from and in accordance with
the books and records of the Company, (ii) complied as to form with applicable
accounting requirements with respect thereto as of their respective dates,
(iii) fairly and accurately present the consolidated financial condition of
the Company at the dates therein indicated and the consolidated results of

normal recurring year-end audit adjustments, none of which individually or in
the aggregate are or will be material in amount), and (iv) were prepared in
accordance with GAAP, except for the absence of footnotes in the unaudited
Financial Statements, applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved if such consistent basis is in accordance with GAAP.

(b) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any Liabilities required to be
reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP other than
(i) those set forth or adequately provided for in a consolidated balance sheet
of the Company and its Subsidiaries included in the Financial Statements as of
July 31, 2015 (such date, the "Company Balance Sheet Date" and such balance
sheet, the "Company Balance Sheet"), (ii) those incurred in the conduct of the
Company's and any Subsidiary's business since the Company Balance Sheet Date
in the ordinary course consistent with past practice, if such past practice is
in accordance with GAAP, and do not result from any breach of Contract,
warranty, infringement, tort or violation of Applicable Law, (iii) those that
are not in excess of $100,000 individually or $500,000 in the aggregate and
(iv) those incurred by the Company in connection with the execution of this
Agreement. Except for Liabilities reflected in the Financial Statements,
neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any off-balance sheet Liability of
any nature to, or any financial interest in, any third parties or entities,
the purpose or effect of which is to defer, postpone, reduce or otherwise
avoid or adjust the recording of expenses incurred by the Company any
Subsidiary. All reserves that are set forth in or reflected in the Company
Balance Sheet have been established in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied and are adequate. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has ever guaranteed any debt or other
obligation of any other Person.

(c) Schedule 2.4(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of all Company Debt, including, for each item of
Company Debt, the agreement governing the Company Debt and the interest rate,
maturity date, any assets securing such Company Debt and any 

prepayment or other penalties payable in connection with the repayment of such
Company Debt at the Closing.

(d) Schedule 2.4(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth the names and
locations of all banks and other financial institutions at which the Company
or any Subsidiary maintains accounts and the names of all Persons authorized
to make withdrawals therefrom.

(e) The accounts receivable of the Company and any Subsidiary (the "Accounts
Receivable") as reflected on the Company Balance Sheet and as will be
reflected in the Company Closing Financial Certificate arose in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice and represent bona fide
claims against debtors for sales and other charges. Allowances for doubtful
accounts and warranty returns have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied and in accordance with the Company's past practice if
such past practices are in accordance with GAAP and are sufficient to provide
for any losses that may be sustained on realization of the applicable Accounts
Receivable. The Accounts Receivable arising after the Company Balance Sheet
Date and before the Closing Date (i) arose or shall arise in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice and (ii) represented or shall
represent bona fide claims against debtors for sales and other charges. As of
the date hereof, none of the Accounts Receivable is subject to any claim of
offset, recoupment, set-off or counter-claim and, to the knowledge of the
Company, there are no facts or circumstances (whether asserted or unasserted)
that could give rise to any such claim.

(f) The Company has established and maintains a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances (i) that transactions,
receipts and expenditures of the Company and any Subsidiary are being executed
and made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations of management and
the Board, (ii) that transactions are recorded as necessary (A) to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and (B) to
maintain accountability for assets, (iii) regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of
Company and any Subsidiary and (iv) that the amount recorded for assets on the
books and records of the Company is compared with the existing assets at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences. None of the Company, any Subsidiary, the Company's independent
auditors and, to the knowledge of the Company, any current or former employee,
consultant or director of the Company, has identified or been made aware of
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves the Company's or any
Subsidiary's management or other current or former employees, consultants or
directors of the Company who have a role in the preparation of financial
statements or the internal accounting controls utilized by the Company or any
Subsidiary, or any claim or allegation regarding any of the foregoing. None of
the Company, any Subsidiary and, to the knowledge of the Company, any
Representative of the Company or any Subsidiary has received or otherwise had
or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim, whether written or oral, in each case, regarding deficient accounting
or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the Company or
its internal accounting controls or any material inaccuracy in the Company's
financial statements. No attorney representing the Company or any Subsidiary,
whether or not employed by the Company or any Subsidiary, has reported to the
Board or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of the Company or
any Subsidiary evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of
fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company or any Subsidiary or their
Representatives. There are no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses
in the design or operation of the Company's or any Subsidiary's internal
controls that could adversely affect the Company's or any Subsidiary's ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial data.



2.5 Absence of Changes. Between May 1, 2015 and the date hereof, (i) the
Company and each Subsidiary has conducted the Business only in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, (ii) there has not occurred
a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary and
(iii) 

neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has done, caused or permitted any of
the actions described in Section 4.2 if such action were taken by the Company
or any Subsidiary, without the written consent of Acquirer, between the
Agreement Date and the earlier of the termination of this Agreement and the
Effective Time.



2.6 Litigation. There is no Legal Proceeding to which the Company or any
Subsidiary is a party pending before any Governmental Entity, or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any Subsidiary or
any of their assets or any of their directors, officers or employees (in their
capacities as such or relating to their employment, services or relationship

the Company, any other Person, and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary (A)
has waived any breach thereof by any other Person, (B) has received any notice
of termination of any such Contract and (C) has knowledge of any circumstances

of the Code has either obtained from the IRS a favorable determination letter
as to its qualified status under the Code, including all amendments to the
Code effected by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent legislation, or has
applied (or has time remaining in which to apply) to the IRS for such a

favorable determination or has been established under a standardized prototype

any Company Employee Plan subject to Section 401(a) of the Code.

any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate to any Company Employee Plan have been
made on or before their due dates and a reasonable amount has been accrued for
contributions to each Company Employee Plan for the current plan years (and no
further contributions will be due or will have accrued thereunder as of the

business consistent with past practice after the Company Balance Sheet Date as
a result of the operations of the Company or any Subsidiary after the Company
Balance Sheet Date). In addition, with respect to each Company Employee Plan
intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement, the Company, each
Subsidiary and each of the ERISA Affiliates have made timely deposits of
employee salary reduction contributions and participant loan repayments, as
determined pursuant to regulations issued by the United States Department of

ERISA Affiliate has incurred or expects to incur any Liability under Title IV
of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. Each Company Employee Plan can be
terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Effective Time in accordance
with its terms, without Liability to Acquirer (other than ordinary and

Affiliate have prepared in good faith and timely filed all requisite

5.9 Expenses; Company Debt. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, except
as otherwise set forth herein, all costs and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the Transactions (including Transaction Expenses)
shall be paid by the party incurring such expense; provided that the fees and

Section 1.6(h). At or as soon as commercially practicable following the
Closing, Acquirer shall repay or cause to be repaid all Company Debt. The
Company shall use Company Cash if and to the extent available to pay its
unpaid Transaction Expenses and unpaid Company Debt prior to the Closing.
During the period from the Agreement Date and 

continuing until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Acquirer with respect to any
commercial or real estate agreement that requires a letter of credit such that
as of the Closing such requirement is either waived by the counterparty to
such agreement or a new letter of credit for the benefit of Acquirer is
substituted.



5.10 Terminated Employees. Effective no later than immediately prior to the
Closing (or at such other time designated by Acquirer), the Company shall
terminate the employment of each of those Company employees who shall not
continue their employment with the Company, the First Step Surviving

Employees"), and the Company shall require such Terminated Employees to
execute a Separation Agreement as a condition to the receipt of any severance
paid by the Company, and shall cause all Company Options or Company RSU held
by such Terminated Employees to be terminated in accordance with their terms
at the time of such termination.



5.11 Termination of Benefit Plans. Effective as of the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date, the Company shall terminate the remaining reserve
under the Company Option Plan and shall terminate all Company Employee Plans
that are "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of ERISA, including any
Company Employee Plans intended to include a Section 401(k) arrangement

Business Days prior to the Closing Date that such 401(k) plans shall not be
terminated). The Company shall provide Acquirer with evidence that such
Company Employee Plan(s) and the Company Option Plan have been terminated
(effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date)
pursuant to resolutions of the Board or any applicable committee thereof. The
form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable
review and approval by Acquirer. The Company also shall take such other
actions in furtherance of terminating such Company Employee Plan(s) as
Acquirer may reasonably require. In the event that termination of the
Company's 401(k) Plan would reasonably be anticipated to trigger liquidation
charges, surrender charges or other fees (other than ordinary and customary
administrative fees in connection with such termination) then the Company
shall take such actions as are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of
such charges and/or fees and provide such estimate in writing to Acquirer.



5.12 Issuance of RSUs; Company Options.

(a) At least five Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall issue
(a) Company RSUs in amounts and with respect to the Promised Equity and (b)

evidence satisfactory to Acquirer that each Company Option was properly
executed or accepted by the Company Optionholder holding such Company Option.



5.13 Certain Closing Certificates and Documents. The Company shall prepare and
deliver to Acquirer a draft of each of the Company Closing Financial
Certificate and the Spreadsheet not later than five Business Days prior to the
Closing Date and a final version of the Company Closing Financial Certificate
and the Spreadsheet to Acquirer not later than three Business Days prior to
the Closing Date. In the event that Acquirer notifies the Company that there
are reasonably apparent errors in the drafts of the Company Closing Financial
Certificate and the Spreadsheet, Acquirer and the Company shall discuss such
errors in good faith and the Company shall correct such errors prior to
delivering the final versions of the same in accordance with this Section
5.13. Without limiting the foregoing or Section 5.7, the Company shall provide
to Acquirer, together with the Company Closing Financial Certificate and the
Spreadsheet, such supporting 

documentation, information and calculations as are reasonably necessary for
Acquirer to verify and determine the calculations, amounts and other matters
set forth in the Company Closing Financial Certificate and the Spreadsheet.



5.14 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.



(a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation (including the advancement
of expenses) from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Closing (including with respect to the Transactions) existing as of the
date hereof in favor of the current or former directors, officers and
employees of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, as provided in
their respective certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or similar
organizational documents) or the indemnification agreements of any of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company listed on Schedule 5.14 of the
Company Disclosure Letter and made available to Acquirer prior to the date
hereof, and pursuant to Applicable Law, shall survive the Transactions and
shall continue in full force and effect without amendment, modification or
repeal in accordance with their terms for a period of not less than six years
after the Closing; provided that if any claims are asserted or made within
such period, all rights to indemnification (and to advancement of expenses)
hereunder in respect of any such claims shall continue, without diminution,
until disposition of any and all such claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the obligations of Acquirer, the First-Step Surviving Corporation, the Final
Surviving Entity, or their respective successors (i) shall be subject to any
limitation imposed by Applicable Law and (ii) shall not be deemed to release
any Indemnitee hereunder who is also an officer or director of the Company or
its subsidiaries from his or her obligations pursuant to this Agreement or any
applicable indemnification agreement. Any repeal or modification of the
aforementioned provisions of the Certificate of Incorporations or Bylaws (or
the equivalent organizational documents of the Company's Subsidiaries) shall
not adversely affect any right or protection of the directors or officers of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries existing as of or prior to the Closing,
or increase the liability of any director or officer of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries with respect to acts or omissions of any such director or
officer occurring prior to or at the Closing. Acquirer shall use reasonable
efforts to ensure that any successors of the Final Surviving Entity shall
fulfill the obligations of the Final Surviving Entity set forth in this
Section 5.14.

(b) The provisions of this Section 5.14 shall survive the consummation of the
Transactions and the Effective Time of the First Merger and Second Effective
Time of the Second Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and
enforceable by, each party indemnified pursuant to this Section 5.14 (or as
otherwise referenced in this Section 5.14) and his or her successors.

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase a prepaid "tail" policy
on the current directors' and officers' liability insurance policy of the
Company for a period of six years from the Effective Time and in a form and on
terms reasonably acceptable to Acquirer with coverage of six years (the "Tail
Policy"), with the cost of such Tail Policy, to the extent unpaid as of the
Closing, being included in the Transaction Expenses.



5.15 Tax Matters.

(a) All Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are required to
be filed after the Closing Date for any Pre-Closing Tax Period will be
prepared and filed (or will be caused to be prepared and filed) by Acquirer.
With respect to any such Tax Returns that are income Tax Returns, Acquirer
shall provide such Tax Return to the Stockholders' Agent for the Stockholders'
Agent's review at least 15 days prior to the due date therefor and Acquirer
shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments provided by the
Stockholders' Agent within ten days of the Stockholders' Agent's receipt of
such Tax Return. 

(b) Acquirer shall notify the Stockholders' Agent in writing upon receipt by
Acquirer, the Final Surviving Entity or any of their Affiliates of any written
notice from a Governmental Entity of an Action with respect to Taxes of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries which may give rise to a claim for Taxes
for which the Company Securityholders may have a material indemnification
obligation ("Tax Contest Claim"); provided that any failure by Acquirer to so
notify the Stockholders' Agent shall not relieve the Company Securityholders
of their indemnification obligations hereunder unless and to the extent that
the Company Securityholders are materially and adversely prejudiced thereby.
Acquirer shall keep the Stockholders' Agent reasonably informed of the
progress of any such Tax Contest Claim and consider reasonable comments
provided by Stockholders' Agent regarding the conduct of such Tax Contest
Claim. Acquirer shall at all times remain in control of the conduct of such
Tax Contest, including entering into any settlement or compromise of such Tax
Contest Claim.

(c) Each of Acquirer, the Stockholders' Agent, the Company Securityholders and
the Company shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested
by any of the others, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any
Legal Proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon request therefor) the provision of records and information
reasonably relevant to any such Legal Proceeding and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Acquirer, the Company, the
Stockholders' Agent and the Company Securityholders agree to retain all books
and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to
any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until expiration of the
statute of limitations of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Tax Authority.

(d) The Company shall cause each Company Securityholder to further agree, upon
request, to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or
other document from any Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
(including with respect to the Transactions).

(e) Acquirer, the Company, the Final Surviving Entity and each Company
Securityholder agree to report the Merger for U.S. tax purposes as a tax-free
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code unless
otherwise required by Applicable Law. Each party and its Affiliates shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Acquirer and
the Company intend that the cash and shares of Acquirer Common Stock payable
to the holders of Company Capital Stock pursuant to Section 1.3(a)(i) will be
treated as received in exchange for the applicable holder's Company Capital
Stock, and intend to report such payments for U.S. federal income Tax purposes
as consideration for such holder's Company Capital Stock and, except as
otherwise required by Applicable Law, not as compensation for services.

(f) Neither Acquirer nor any Person related to Acquirer within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(4) (an "Acquirer Related Person") has
any plan or intention to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, directly or
indirectly, any of the Acquirer Common Stock that will be issued pursuant to
the Merger, other than pursuant to any stock repurchase or stock buy-back
program of Acquirer or any Acquirer Related Person that does not distinguish
between Acquirer Common Stock issued pursuant to the Merger and other Acquirer
Common Stock. No Company Securityholder has any plan or intention to sell to
Acquirer or any Acquirer Related Person any of the Acquirer Common Stock that
was issued to it pursuant to the Merger. To the knowledge of Acquirer, there
are no facts or circumstances that, either alone or in combination, would
reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

(g) Acquirer or its subsidiaries will use commercially reasonable efforts to
continue the historic business of the Company (or alternatively, if the
Company has more than one line of business, at least one significant line of
the Company's historic business) or use a significant portion (at least 33
1/3% by value) of the Company's historic business assets in a business, within
the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d).



5.16 280G Stockholder Approval. Promptly following the execution of this
Agreement, the Company shall submit to the Company Stockholders for approval
(in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Acquirer), by such number of holders
of Company Stockholders as is required by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B)
of the Code, any payments and/or benefits that may separately or in the
aggregate, constitute "parachute payments" pursuant to Section 280G of the
Code ("Section 280G Payments") (which determination shall be made by the
Company and shall be subject to review and approval by Acquirer, such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), such that such
payments and benefits shall not be deemed to be Section 280G Payments, and
prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Acquirer notification and
documentation reasonably satisfactory to Acquirer that a vote of the holders
of Company Capital Stock was solicited in conformance with Section 280G of the
Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder and either (i) that the
requisite stockholder approval was obtained with respect to any payments
and/or benefits that were subject to the stockholder vote (the "280G
Stockholder Approval") or (ii) that the 280G Stockholder Approval was not
obtained and as a consequence, that such payments and/or benefits shall not be
made or provided to the extent they would constitute Section 280G Payments,
pursuant to the Parachute Payment Waivers that were executed by the affected
individuals prior to the solicitation of the vote of the holders of Company
Capital Stock pursuant to this Section 5.16.



5.17 Confirmatory IP Assignments. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall (a)
work in good faith with Acquirer to identify any trademarks or domains of the
Company, or that are associated with the Company (including by way of prior
acquisitions), that are not otherwise currently registered in the name of the
Company and (b) use commercially reasonable efforts at the sole cost and
expense of the Company to properly assign such trademarks and domains to the
Company prior to the Closing.

pursuant to Section 1.3(a)(i) and shall deposit the Cash Escrow Amount and the
Stock Escrow Amount with Citibank, N.A. (or another institution selected by

"Escrow Agent") (the aggregate amount of cash and shares of Acquirer Common
Stock so held by the Escrow Agent from time to time, together with any non-
taxable stock dividends declared and paid in respect of such shares, the
"Escrow Fund"), which Escrow Fund shall be governed by this Agreement and the
escrow agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit I with
such changes as Acquirer and the Stockholders' Agent may agree in writing (the
"Escrow Agreement"). The Escrow Fund shall constitute security for the benefit
of Acquirer (on behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Person) with respect
to any Indemnifiable Damages pursuant to the indemnification obligations of
the Converting Holders under Section 1.6(i) and this Article VIII. Subject to
Section 8.4, the Escrow Agent shall hold that portion Escrow Fund other than
the Mini-Escrow Fund (such portion, the "First Distribution Amount") until
11:59 p.m. local time on the date that is 18 months after the Effective Time
(the "First Escrow Release Date") and shall hold the remainder of the Escrow
Fund until 11:59 p.m. local time on the date that is three years after the
Effective Time (the "Second Escrow Release Date"). Except to the extent there
is a cancellation of shares of Acquirer Common Stock held in the Escrow Fund
in connection with Indemnifiable Damages, shares of Acquirer Common Stock held
in the Escrow Fund shall be treated by Acquirer as issued and outstanding
stock of Acquirer, and the Converting Holders shall be entitled to exercise
voting rights (which rights shall be exercised on behalf of such Converting
Holders by the Stockholders' Agent) and to receive dividends with respect to
such shares. The Converting Holders shall be treated for tax reporting
purposes as the owners of the Stock Escrow Amount. Acquirer shall be treated
for tax purposes as the owner of the Cash Escrow Amount, and all interest and
other income earned on the Cash Escrow Amount, if any, shall, as of the end of
each calendar year and to the extent required by the Applicable Law, be
reported as having been earned by Acquirer, whether or not such income was
disbursed during such calendar year. Neither the Escrow Fund (including any
portion thereof) nor any beneficial interest therein may be pledged, subjected
to any Encumbrance, sold, assigned or transferred by any Converting Holder or
be taken or reached by any legal or equitable process in satisfaction of any
debt or other Liability of any Converting Holder, in each case prior to the
distribution of the Escrow Fund to any Converting Holder in accordance with
Section 8.1(b), except that each Converting Holder shall be entitled to assign
such Converting Holder's rights to such Converting Holder's Pro Rata Share of
the Escrow Fund by will, by the laws of intestacy or by other operation of
law.

(b) Within five Business Days following the First Escrow Release Date, the
Escrow Agent will distribute to each Converting Holder such Converting
Holder's Pro Rata Share of the First Distribution Amount less any portion of
the First Distribution Amount with respect to pending but unresolved claims
set forth in a valid Claims Certificate, to be necessary to satisfy all
unsatisfied or disputed claims for indemnification specified in any Claim
Certificate delivered to the Stockholders' Agent on or prior to the First
Escrow Release Date in accordance with this Article VIII. Any portion of the
First Distribution Amount held by the Escrow Agent following the First Escrow
Release Date with respect to pending but unresolved claims for indemnification
that is not awarded to Acquirer upon the resolution of such claims shall be
distributed by the Escrow Agent to the Converting Holders within five Business
Days following resolution of such claims and in accordance with each such
Converting Holder's Pro Rata Share of such portion of the First Distribution
Amount. 

(c) Within five Business Days following the Second Escrow Release Date, the
Escrow Agent will distribute to each Converting Holder such Converting
Holder's Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Fund less any portion of the Escrow Fund
with respect to pending but unresolved claims set forth in a valid Claims
Certificate, to be necessary to satisfy all unsatisfied or disputed claims for
indemnification specified in any Claim Certificate delivered to the
Stockholders' Agent on or prior to the Second Escrow Release Date in
accordance with this Article VIII. Any portion of the Escrow Fund held by the
Escrow Agent following the Second Escrow Release Date with respect to pending
but unresolved claims for indemnification that is not awarded to Acquirer upon
the resolution of such claims shall be distributed by the Escrow Agent to the
Converting Holders within five Business Days following resolution of such
claims and in accordance with each such Converting Holder's Pro Rata Share of
such portion of the Escrow Fund.

(d) Any distribution from the Escrow Fund to a Converting Holder shall be in
accordance with the cash and stock allocations set forth on the Spreadsheet,

Converting Holders shall be paid their Pro Rata Share of the remainder of such
distribution.

extent that such payments or issuances, in the aggregate, exceed the value of

such Dissenting Shares, and any interest, costs, expenses and fees actually
incurred by any Indemnified Person in connection with the exercise of any
dissenters' or appraisal rights;

that a matter be or not be "reasonably expected" or "reasonably likely" to

Effect" in any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation

representation or warranty, or a breach of such covenant, agreement or
obligation, exists, and shall not be taken into account in determining the
amount of any Indemnifiable Damages with respect to such failure or breach.



8.3 Indemnifiable Damage Threshold; Other Limitations.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Indemnified
Person may make a claim against the Escrow Fund in respect of any claim for
Indemnifiable Damages arising out of, resulting from or in connection with the
matters listed in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (vi) or (vii) of Section 8.2 

(a) (other than claims arising out of, resulting from or in connection with
(i) fraud or intentional misrepresentation by or on behalf of the Company or
such Converting Holder or (ii) any failure of any of the Special
Representations (as defined below) to be true and correct as aforesaid) unless
and until a Claim Certificate (together with any other delivered Claim
Certificates) describing Indemnifiable Damages in an aggregate amount greater
than $4,500,000 (the "Basket") has been delivered, in which case the
Indemnified Person may make claims for indemnification, compensation and
reimbursement and may receive cash or shares of Acquirer Common Stock from the
Escrow Fund for all Indemnifiable Damages (including the amount of the
Basket). The Basket shall not apply to any other Indemnifiable Damages or
claims therefor.

(b) If the Merger is consummated, recovery from the Escrow Fund shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy for the indemnity obligations of each
Converting Holder under this Agreement for Indemnifiable Damages (and not
specific performance or other equitable remedies) arising out of, resulting
from or in connection with the matters listed in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or
(vi) of Section 8.2(a), except (i) in the case of fraud or intentional
misrepresentation by or on behalf of the Company or such Converting Holder and
(ii) any failure of any of the representations and warranties made by (A) the
Company in Section 2.1 (Organization, Standing, Power and Subsidiaries),
Section 2.2 (Capital Structure), Section 2.3(a) (Authority; Non-
contravention), Section 2.11 (Taxes), or (B) the Company in any certificate
delivered to Acquirer pursuant to this Agreement that are within the scope of
those covered by the foregoing Sections (collectively, the "Special
Representations") to be true and correct as aforesaid. In addition, from and
after the Closing, the indemnification procedures set forth in this Article
VIII shall represent the sole and exclusive remedy for all claims by the
Indemnified Persons in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided that nothing in this Agreement shall limit the
right of any Indemnified Person to (x) specific performance or other equitable
remedies or (ii) to pursue remedies under any Stockholder Agreement, Joinder
Agreement, Investor Representation Letter, Offer Letter, Non-Competition
Agreement or Vesting Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, to the extent an Indemnified Person chooses to recover
Indemnifiable Damages arising out of, resulting from or in connection with the
matters listed in clause (ix) of Section 8.2(a) from the Escrow Fund, such
recovery shall be made against the Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Fund of the
Converting Holder who provided such Investor Representation Letter; provided
that the foregoing does shall not limit the right of any Indemnified Person to
pursue remedies under such Investor Representation Letter.

(c) In the case of any claims for Indemnifiable Damages arising out of,
resulting from or in connection with the failure of any of the Special
Representations to be true and correct as aforesaid or the matters listed in
clauses (iv), (v) or (vii)-(xii) of Section 8.2(a) (collectively, "Fundamental
Claims"), after Indemnified Persons have exhausted or made claims upon all
amounts of cash and/or shares of Acquirer Common Stock held in the Escrow Fund
(after taking into account all other claims for indemnification, compensation
and reimbursement from the Escrow Fund made by Indemnified Persons), or
following the First Escrow Release Date, each Converting Holder shall have
Liability for such Converting Holder's Pro Rata Share of the amount of any
Indemnifiable Damages resulting therefrom, subject to the limitations herein.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the total liability
of a Converting Holder for all claims under this Agreement, taken as a whole,
other than in the case of fraud or intentional misrepresentation by such
Converting Holder (for which total liability shall be uncapped) shall be
limited to the aggregate amount of cash and the aggregate number of shares of
Acquirer Common Stock actually paid and issued, respectively, to such
Converting Holder pursuant to Section 1.3(a) (inclusive of any contribution to
the Escrow Fund).

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) no
Converting Holder shall have any right of indemnification, compensation,
reimbursement, contribution or right of advancement from Acquirer, the First
Step Surviving Corporation, the Final Surviving Entity or any other
Indemnified 

Person (based upon such Converting Holder's position as an officer, director,
employee or agent of the Company or otherwise) with respect to any
Indemnifiable Damages claimed by any Indemnified Person or any right of
subrogation against the Company, the First Step Surviving Corporation or the
Final Surviving Entity with respect to any indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement of an Indemnified Person by reason of any of the matters set
forth in Section 8.2(a), (ii) the rights and remedies of the Indemnified
Persons after the Effective Time shall not be limited by (x) any investigation
by or on behalf of, or disclosure to (other than in the Company Disclosure
Letter with respect to clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 8.2(a), subject to any
limitations expressly set forth therein), any Indemnified Person at or prior
to the Effective Time regarding any failure, breach or other event or
circumstance or (y) any waiver of any condition to the Closing related thereto
and (iii) if an Indemnified Person's claim under this Article VIII may be
properly characterized in multiple ways in accordance with this Article VIII
such that such claim may or may not be subject to different limitations
depending on such characterization, then such Indemnified Person shall have
the right to characterize such claim in a manner that maximizes the recovery
and time to assert such claim permitted in accordance with this Article VIII.

(e) All Indemnifiable Damages shall be calculated net of the amount of any
actual recoveries actually received by an Indemnified Person prior to the
final resolution of the associated claim under any existing insurance policies
and contractual indemnification or contribution provisions (in each case,
calculated net of any actual collection costs and reserves, expenses,
deductibles or premium adjustments or retrospectively rated premiums (as
determined in good faith by an Indemnified Person) incurred or paid to procure
such recoveries) in respect of any Indemnifiable Damages suffered, paid,
sustained or incurred by any Indemnified Person; provided that no Indemnified
Person shall have any obligation to seek to obtain or continue to pursue any
such recoveries.



8.4 Period for Claims. Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 8.4, the
period (the "Claims Period") during which claims may be made (i) against the
Escrow Fund for Indemnifiable Damages arising out of, resulting from or in
connection with (A) the matters listed in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (vi),
(vii) or (ix) of Section 8.2(a) (other than with respect to any of the Special
Representations or the IP Representations) shall commence at the Closing and
terminate at 11:59 p.m. local time on the date that is 15 months following the
Closing Date and (B) any failure of any of the representations and warranties
made by the Company in Section 2.10 (Intellectual Property) (the "IP
Representations") shall commence at the Closing and terminate at 11:59 p.m.
local time on the First Escrow Release Date and (ii) for Indemnifiable Damages
arising out of, resulting from or in connection with all other matters,
including Fundamental Claims shall commence at the Closing and terminate at
11:59 p.m. local time on the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations for such matter. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, such portion of the Escrow Fund at the First Escrow Release
Date or Second Escrow Release Date as in the reasonable judgment of Acquirer
may be necessary to satisfy any unresolved or unsatisfied claims for
Indemnifiable Damages specified in any Claim Certificate delivered to the
Stockholders' Agent on or prior to the First Escrow Release Date or Second
Escrow Release Date shall remain in the Escrow Fund until such claims for
Indemnifiable Damages have been resolved or satisfied. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the Claims Period for claims for
Indemnifiable Damages arising out of, resulting from or in connection with
fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful conduct shall not be limited.
For the avoidance of doubt, it is the intention of the parties hereto that the
foregoing respective survival periods supersede any applicable statute of
limitations that would otherwise apply.



8.5 Claims.

(a) During the Claims Period, Acquirer may deliver to the Stockholders' Agent
one or more certificates signed by any officer of Acquirer (each, a "Claim
Certificate"): 

(i) stating that an Indemnified Person has incurred, paid, reserved or
accrued, or in good faith believes that it may incur, pay, reserve or accrue,
Indemnifiable Damages (or that with respect to any Tax matters, that any Tax
Authority may raise such matter in audit of Acquirer or its subsidiaries, that
could give rise to Indemnifiable Damages);

(ii) stating the amount of such Indemnifiable Damages (which, in the case of
Indemnifiable Damages not yet incurred, paid, reserved or accrued, may be the
maximum amount believed by Acquirer in good faith to be incurred, paid,
reserved, accrued or demanded by a third party); and

(iii) specifying in reasonable detail (based upon the information then
possessed by Acquirer) the individual items of such Indemnifiable Damages
included in the amount so stated and the nature of the claim to which such
Indemnifiable Damages are related.

(b) Such Claim Certificate (i) need only specify such information to the
knowledge of such officer of Acquirer as of the date thereof, (ii) shall not
limit any of the rights or remedies of any Indemnified Person with respect to
the underlying facts and circumstances specifically set forth in such Claim
Certificate and (iii) may be updated and amended from time to time by Acquirer
by delivering any updated or amended Claim Certificate, so long as the
delivery of the original Claim Certificate is made within the applicable
Claims Period and such update or amendment relates to the underlying facts and
circumstances specifically set forth in such original Claims Certificate;
provided that all claims for Indemnifiable Damages properly set forth in a
Claim Certificate or any update or amendment thereto shall remain outstanding
until such claims have been resolved or satisfied, notwithstanding the
expiration of such Claims Period. No delay in providing such Claim Certificate
within the applicable Claims Period shall affect an Indemnified Person's
rights hereunder, unless (and then only to the extent that) the Stockholders'
Agent or the Converting Holders are materially prejudiced thereby.



8.6 Resolution of Objections to Claims.

(a) If the Stockholders' Agent does not contest, by written notice to
Acquirer, any claim or claims by Acquirer made in any Claim Certificate within
the 30-day period following receipt of the Claim Certificate, then the Escrow
Agent shall, upon Acquirer's direction, distribute to Acquirer an amount of
cash and shares of Acquirer Common Stock (taken pro rata from cash and shares
of Acquirer Common Stock (based on Acquirer Stock Price) in such proportions
as initially deposited in the Escrow Fund at the Closing) from the Escrow Fund
having a total value (calculated by reference to the Acquirer Stock Price)
equal to the amount of any Indemnifiable Damages corresponding to such claim
or claims as set forth in such Claim Certificate.

(b) If the Stockholders' Agent objects in writing to any claim or claims by
Acquirer made in any Claim Certificate within the 30-day period set forth in
Section 8.6(a), Acquirer and the Stockholders' Agent shall attempt in good
faith for 45 days after Acquirer's receipt of such written objection to
resolve such objection. If Acquirer and the Stockholders' Agent shall so
agree, a joint written instruction setting forth such agreement shall be
prepared, signed by both parties and delivered to the Escrow Agent. Upon
receipt of such instruction, the Escrow Agent shall distribute to Acquirer an
amount of cash and shares of Acquirer Common Stock from the Escrow Fund in
accordance with the terms of such joint written instruction.

(c) If no such agreement can be reached during the 45-day period for good
faith negotiation set forth in Section 8.6(b), but in any event upon the
expiration of such 45-day period, either 

Acquirer or the Stockholders' Agent may bring an arbitration in accordance
with the terms of Section 9.11 to resolve the matter. The decision of the
arbitrator as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Claim
Certificate shall be non-appealable, binding and conclusive upon the parties
hereto and the Converting Holders, and Acquirer shall be entitled to instruct
the Escrow Agent to distribute to Acquirer an amount of cash and shares of
Acquirer Common Stock from the Escrow Fund in accordance therewith.

(d) Judgment upon any determination of an arbitrator may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction. The non-prevailing party to an arbitration shall
pay its own fees and expenses and the fees and expenses of the prevailing
party, including attorneys' fees and costs, reasonably incurred in connection
with such suit.

(e) Any portion of the Escrow Fund held by the Escrow Agent following the
First Escrow Release Date or Second Escrow Release Date shall be paid by the
Escrow Agent to the Paying Agent for further distribution to the Converting
Holders within five Business Days following resolution of such claims and in
accordance with each such Converting Holder's Pro Rata Share of such portion
of the Escrow Fund (with cash and stock allocations thereof as set forth on
the Spreadsheet, it being understood and agreed that Unaccredited Stockholders
shall first be paid cash and all other Converting Holders shall contribute
their Pro Rata Share of the remainder of the Escrow Fund).



8.7 Stockholders' Agent.

(a) At the Closing, Shareholder Representative Services LLC shall be
irrevocably constituted and appointed as the Stockholders' Agent for and on
behalf of the Converting Holders by the Converting Holders. The Stockholders'
Agent shall be the agent for and on behalf of the Converting Holders to: (i)
execute, as the Stockholders' Agent, this Agreement and any agreement or
instrument entered into or delivered in connection with the Transactions, (ii)
give and receive notices, instructions and communications, under any
agreement, document or instrument entered into or executed in connection
herewith, for and on behalf of any Converting Holder, to or from Acquirer (on
behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Person) relating to this Agreement
or any of the Transactions and any other matters contemplated by this
Agreement or by such other agreement, document or instrument (except to the
extent that this Agreement expressly contemplates that any such notice or
communication shall be given or received by each Converting Holder
individually), (iii) review, negotiate and agree to and authorize Acquirer to
reclaim an amount of cash from and/or cancel shares of Acquirer Common Stock
held in the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims asserted by Acquirer (on
behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Person, including by not objecting
to such claims) pursuant to this Article VIII, (iv) object to such claims
pursuant to Section 8.6, (v) consent or agree to, negotiate, enter into, or,
if applicable, contest, prosecute or defend, settlements and compromises of,
and demand arbitration and comply with Orders of courts and awards of
arbitrators with respect to, such claims, resolve any such claims, take any
actions in connection with the resolution of any dispute relating hereto or to
the Transactions by arbitration, settlement or otherwise, and take or forego
any or all actions permitted or required of any Converting Holder or necessary
in the judgment of the Stockholders' Agent for the accomplishment of the
foregoing and all of the other terms, conditions and limitations of this
Agreement, (vi) retain or consult with legal counsel, accountants, consultants
and other experts selected by it, solely at the cost and expense of the
Converting Holders, and incur any other reasonable expenses, in connection
with all matters and things set forth or necessary with respect to this
Agreement and any agreement or instrument entered into or delivered in
connection with the Transactions and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, (vii) consent or agree to any amendment, supplement to and waiver in
respect of this Agreement or to waive any terms and conditions of this
Agreement providing rights or benefits to the Converting Holders (other than
with respect to the payment and issuance of the Merger Consideration less the
Cash Escrow Amount and the Stock Escrow Amount, respectively) in accordance
with the terms hereof and in the manner 

provided herein, (viii) pursuant to Section 1.6, review, negotiate, object to,
accept or agree to Acquirer's calculation of Company Net Working Capital and
(ix) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the good faith judgment of
the Stockholders' Agent for the accomplishment of the foregoing, in each case
without having to seek or obtain the consent of any Person under any
circumstance. Acquirer, the Merger Subs and their respective Affiliates
(including after the Effective Time, the First Step Surviving Corporation, and
after the Second Effective Time, the Final Surviving Entity) shall be entitled
to rely on the appointment of Shareholder Representative Services LLC as the
Stockholders' Agent and treat such Stockholders' Agent as the duly appointed
attorney-in-fact of each Converting Holder having the duties, power and
authority provided for in this Section 8.7. The Converting Holders shall be
bound by all actions taken and documents executed by the Stockholders' Agent
in connection with this Article VIII, and Acquirer and other Indemnified
Persons shall be entitled to rely exclusively on any action or decision of the
Stockholders' Agent. The Person serving as the Stockholders' Agent may resign
at any time, be removed or replaced from time to time, or if such Person
resigns from its position as the Stockholders' Agent, then a successor may be
appointed, by the holders of a majority in interest of the aggregate amount of
cash and the aggregate number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock then held in
the Escrow Fund (or, in the event that there is no cash then held in the
Escrow Fund by the Converting Holders collectively having a Pro Rata Share
greater than 50%) upon not less than 30 days' prior written notice to
Acquirer. No bond shall be required of the Stockholders' Agent, and it shall
not be paid any compensation other than pursuant to that certain Engagement
Agreement to be entered into by and among Shareholder Representative Services
LLC, the Company and certain of the Converting Holders (the "Engagement
Agreement"). After the Closing, notices or communications, in writing, to or
from the Stockholders' Agent shall constitute notice to or from each of the
Converting Holders.

(b) The Stockholders' Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted
hereunder as the Stockholders' Agent while acting in good faith (and any act
done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence
of such good faith) and without gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Converting Holders shall severally but not jointly based on each Converting
Holder's Pro Rata Share indemnify and defend the Stockholders' Agent and hold
it harmless against any loss, liability damage, claim, penalty, fine,
forfeiture, action, fee, cost or expense (including the fees and expenses of
counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of document location,
duplication and shipment) (collectively, "Representative Losses") arising out
of, resulting from or in connection with the acceptance or administration of
its duties hereunder, in each case as such Representative Loss is suffered or
incurred; provided that in the event that any such Representative Loss is
finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the gross negligence or
bad faith of the Stockholders' Agent, the Stockholders' Agent will reimburse
the Converting Holders the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss
attributable to such gross negligence or bad faith. If not paid directly to
the Stockholders' Agent by the Converting Holders, such Representative Losses
may be recovered by the Stockholders' Agent from the Expense Fund and/or the
portion of the Escrow Fund otherwise distributable to the Converting Holders
(and not distributed or distributable to an Indemnified Person or subject to a
pending indemnification claim of an Indemnified Person) on or after the Second
Escrow Release Date pursuant to the terms hereof, at the time of distribution,
and such recovery will be made from the Converting Holders according to their
respective Pro Rata Shares of such Representative Losses; provided that while
this section allows the Stockholders' Agent to be paid from the Expense Fund
or the Escrow Fund, this does not relieve the Converting Holders from their
obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or
incurred, nor does it prevent the Stockholders' Agent from seeking any
remedies available to it at law or otherwise.

(c) After the Closing, any notice or communication, in writing, given or
received by, and any decision, action, failure to act within a designated
period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of,
the Stockholders' Agent, in writing that is within the scope of the
Stockholders' Agent's authority under Section 8.7(a) shall constitute a notice
or communication to or by, or a decision, 

action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent,
settlement, resolution or instruction of all the Converting Holders and shall
be final, binding and conclusive upon each such Converting Holder; and each
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to rely exclusively upon any such notice,
communication, decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of
time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of the
Stockholders' Agent in writing as being a notice or communication to or by, or
a decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time,
agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of, each and every
such Converting Holder. Acquirer, the Merger Subs, the First Step Surviving
Corporation, the Final Surviving Entity and the Indemnified Persons are hereby
relieved from any Liability to any Person for any acts done by them in
accordance with such notice, communication, decision, action, failure to act
within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution
or instruction of the Stockholders' Agent in writing.

(d) The Stockholders' Agent shall have reasonable access during regular
business hours to information about the Final Surviving Entity as is
reasonably requested by the Stockholders' Agent in the performance of its
duties hereunder and the reasonable assistance of the officers and employees
of the Final Surviving Entity during regular business hours for purposes of
performing its duties and exercising its rights under this Article VIII,
provided that the Stockholders' Agent shall treat confidentially and not
disclose any nonpublic information from or about the Final Surviving Entity or
Acquirer to anyone except (i) as required by Applicable Law, or (ii) on a need
to know basis (A) to its employees and professional advisors under similar
duties of confidentiality, (B) to those Converting Holders that sign the
Engagement Agreement and who are part of the Stockholders' Agent Advisory
Committee (as defined in the Engagement Letter) and (C) to any other
individuals approved by Acquirer in writing in advance, in each case who agree
in writing to treat such information confidentially.

(e) Immediately prior to the Closing, the Company will wire to the
Stockholders' Agent an amount to be determined by the Board in its reasonable
discretion prior to the Closing (the "Expense Fund"), which will be used for
the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the Stockholders' Agent for,
any third party expenses pursuant to this Agreement. The Converting Holders
will not receive any interest or earnings on the Expense Fund and irrevocably
transfer and assign to the Stockholders' Agent any ownership right that they
may otherwise have had in any such interest or earnings. The Stockholders'
Agent will not be liable for any loss of principal of the Expense Fund other
than as a result of its gross negligence or bad faith. As soon as practicable
following the completion of all of the Stockholders' Agent's responsibilities
hereunder, the Stockholders' Agent will deliver the balance of the Expense
Fund to the Paying Agent for further distribution to the Company
Securityholders. For tax purposes, the Expense Fund will be treated as having
been received and voluntarily set aside by the Company Securityholders at the
time of Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent any portion of the
Expense Fund remains unpaid as of the Closing, such portion will be included
as a Transaction Expense.



8.8 Third-Party Claims. In the event that Acquirer becomes aware of a third-
party claim or demand (including a threat in writing of such), or is served
with a third-party complaint, counterclaim or cross-claim in litigation
(collectively, a "Third-Party Claim") that Acquirer reasonably believes may
result in a claim for indemnification under this Agreement, Acquirer shall
promptly notify the Stockholders' Agent in the relevant Claim Certificate (or
amendment thereof) of such Third-Party Claim and (subject to any applicable
confidentiality or privacy obligations or law) the identity of the person or
party asserting such claim or demand; provided that the failure to give prompt
notice shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except if and
to the extent the Stockholders' Agent, on behalf of the Company
Securityholders, has been actually and materially prejudiced as a result of
such failure. The Stockholders' Agent shall have the right to receive copies
of all pleadings, notices and communications with respect to the Third-Party
Claim to the extent that receipt of such documents does not affect any claim
of privilege relating to any Indemnified 

Person, and subject to execution by the Stockholders' Agent of Acquirer's
(and, if required, such third party's) standard non-disclosure agreement to
the extent that such materials contain confidential or propriety information.
The Stockholders' Agent, on behalf of the Converting Holder (or, in the event
indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from a Converting Holder,
such Converting Holder), shall, at the sole expense of the Converting Holders,
be entitled to participate in any defense of such Third-Party Claim; provided
that Acquirer shall have the right in its sole discretion to determine and
conduct the defense of any Third-Party Claims. Acquirer shall be entitled to
settle such Third-Party Claim without the consent of the Stockholders' Agent;
provided that any settlement of a Third-Party Claim without the consent of the
Stockholders' Agent shall not be determinative of any indemnification Claim
that may be made hereunder resulting from such Third-Party Claim. In the event
that the Stockholders' Agent has consented to the amount of any settlement or
resolution by Acquirer of any such claim, neither the Stockholders' Agent nor
any Converting Holder shall have any power or authority to object under this
Article VIII to the amount of any claim by or on behalf of any Indemnified
Person against the Escrow Fund for indemnity with respect to such settlement
or resolution. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if
there is a Third-Party claim that if adversely determined would give rise to a
right of recovery for Indemnifiable Damages hereunder that is either, (a) not
otherwise subject to a settlement or other adjudication that is consented to
in writing by the Stockholders' Agent (or, in the event indemnification is
being sought hereunder directly from a Converting Holder, by such Converting
Holder) or (b) is not otherwise determined to constitute Indemnifiable Damages
hereunder, then 50% of any amounts incurred by the Indemnified Persons in
defense of such Third-Party Claim, shall be deemed Indemnifiable Damages and
shall be borne by the Indemnifying Parties in accordance with this Article
VIII and the remaining 50% of such amounts shall be borne by the Indemnified
Persons.



8.9 Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Acquirer, the Stockholders' Agent
and the Converting Holders agree to treat (and cause their respective
Affiliates to treat) any payment received by the Indemnified Persons pursuant
to this Article VIII as adjustments to the Merger Consideration for all Tax
purposes to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law.



ARTICLE IX

GENERAL PROVISIONS



9.1 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. If the Merger is
consummated, the representations and warranties made herein, in the Company

to be amended at any time after the Closing by execution of an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of Acquirer and the Stockholders' Agent.



9.5 Extension; Waiver. At any time at or prior to the Closing, any party
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the

sentence, no failure to exercise or delay in exercising any right under this
Agreement shall constitute a waiver of such right, and no waiver of any breach

or any other provision herein.



9.6 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties hereto and delivered to the other parties hereto; it being understood
and agreed that all parties hereto need not sign the same counterpart. The
delivery by facsimile or by electronic delivery in PDF format of this
Agreement with all executed signature pages (in counterparts or otherwise)
shall be sufficient to bind the parties hereto to the terms and conditions set
forth herein. All of the counterparts will together constitute one and the
same instrument and each counterpart will constitute an original of this
Agreement.



9.7 Entire Agreement; Parties in Interest. This Agreement and the documents
and instruments and other agreements specifically referred to herein or
delivered pursuant hereto, including all the exhibits attached hereto, the
Schedules, including the Company Disclosure Letter, (a) constitute the entire
agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, except for
the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect,
and shall survive any termination of this Agreement, in accordance with its
terms and (b) are not intended to confer, and shall not be construed as
conferring, upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder (except that Article VIII is intended to benefit the
Indemnified Persons).



9.8 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights and obligations
under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto, and any such assignment without
such prior written consent shall be null and void, except that Acquirer and/or
the Merger Subs may assign its rights and delegate its obligations under this
Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Acquirer
without the prior consent of any other party hereto; provided that
notwithstanding any such assignment, Acquirer and/or the Merger Subs, as
applicable, shall remain liable for all of its obligations under this
Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns.



9.9 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and shall be interpreted so
as reasonably necessary to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The
parties hereto shall use all reasonable efforts to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that shall achieve, to the greatest extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.



9.10 Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance. Except as otherwise provided
herein, including Article VIII, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a party hereto shall be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party hereto of any one remedy shall not preclude
the exercise of any other remedy and nothing herein shall be deemed a waiver
by any party hereto of any right to specific performance or injunctive relief.
It is accordingly agreed that, subject to Section 8.3(b), the parties hereto
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity, and the parties hereto hereby waive the requirement of any posting of
a bond in connection with the remedies described herein.



9.11 Arbitration; Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.

(a) IN THE EVENT THAT A RESOLUTION IS NOT REACHED AMONG THE PARTIES HERETO
WITHIN 60 DAYS AFTER WRITTEN NOTICE OF A DISPUTE, THE DISPUTE SHALL BE FINALLY
SETTLED BY BINDING ARBITRATION IN SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA. SUCH ARBITRATION
SHALL BE CONDUCTED IN ENGLISH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULES OF THE AMERICAN
ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION BY ONE ARBITRATOR APPOINTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH
RULES. THE ARBITRATOR SHALL ALLOW SUCH DISCOVERY AS IS APPROPRIATE TO THE
PURPOSES OF ARBITRATION IN ACCOMPLISHING A FAIR, SPEEDY AND COST-EFFECTIVE
RESOLUTION OF THE DISPUTE. THE ARBITRATOR SHALL REFERENCE THE FEDERAL RULES OF

THE AWARD OF ARBITRATION SHALL BE FINAL AND BINDING UPON THE PARTIES HERETO.
THE ARBITRATOR WILL AWARD TO THE PREVAILING PARTY ALL COSTS, FEES AND EXPENSES
RELATED TO THE ARBITRATION, INCLUDING REASONABLE FEES AND EXPENSES OF
ATTORNEYS, ACCOUNTANTS AND OTHER PROFESSIONALS INCURRED BY THE PREVAILING
PARTY, AND JUDGMENT ON THE AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR MAY BE ENTERED IN
ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION THEREOF.

(b) Subject to the foregoing, the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of California and the
Federal courts of the United States of America located in the State of
California, the place where this Agreement was entered and is to be performed,
in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this
Agreement and of the documents referred to herein, and in respect of the
Transactions, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any
action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or
thereof, that it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or
proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that
the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such
document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto
irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such action or proceeding
shall be heard and determined in such a California State or Federal court. The
parties hereto hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over
the person of such parties and over the subject matter of such dispute and
agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such
action or proceeding in the manner provided in Section 9.2 or in such other
manner as may be permitted by Applicable Law, shall be valid and sufficient
service thereof. With respect to any particular action, suit or proceeding,
venue shall lie solely in the County of San Francisco, California. A party
hereto may apply either to a court of competent jurisdiction or to an
arbitrator, if one has been appointed, for prejudgment remedies and emergency
relief pending final determination of a claim pursuant to this Section 9.11.
The appointment of an arbitrator does not preclude a party hereto from seeking
prejudgment remedies and emergency relief from a court of competent
jurisdiction.



9.12 Governing Law. This Agreement, all acts and transactions pursuant hereto
and all obligations of the parties hereto shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of California without reference to
such state's principles of conflicts of law that would refer a matter to a
different jurisdiction; provided that any matters related to the effectiveness
of the Merger shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without
reference to such state's principles of conflicts of law that would refer a
matter to a different jurisdiction.



9.13 Rules of Construction. The parties hereto have been represented by
counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, hereby waive, with respect to this Agreement, each Schedule
and each Exhibit attached hereto, the application of any Applicable Law or
rule 

of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
shall be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.



9.14 Waiver. Acquirer agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of the
Indemnified Persons, that, following the Closing, Silicon Legal Strategy and
O'Melveny and Myers LLP may serve as counsel to the Stockholders' Agent, the
Company Securityholders as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and any
of their respective Affiliates in connection with any matters related to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including any litigation,
claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby notwithstanding any representation by Silicon
Legal Strategy or O'Melveny and Myers LLP prior to the Effective Time of the
Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries. Acquirer (on behalf of itself and its
subsidiaries) and the Merger Subs hereby (a) waive any claim they have or may
have that either Silicon Legal Strategy or O'Melveny and Myers LLP has a
conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited from engaging in such
representation and (b) agree that, in the event that a dispute arises after
the Effective Time between any Indemnified Person, on the one hand, and the
Stockholders' Agent or any Company Securityholder, on the other hand, or any
of their respective Affiliates, Silicon Legal Strategy and/or O'Melveny and
Myers LLP may represent such Company Securityholders and the Stockholders'
Agent and any of their respective Affiliates in such dispute even though the
interests of such Person(s) may be directly adverse to Acquirer, the First
Step Surviving Corporation or the Final Surviving Entity or their respective
subsidiaries and even though Silicon Legal Strategy or O'Melveny and Myers LLP
may have represented the Company or its Subsidiaries in a matter substantially
related to such dispute. In the event that a dispute arises between Acquirer,
the First Step Surviving Corporation, the Final Surviving Entity or any of
their respective Subsidiaries and a third party other than the Stockholders'
Agent or any of the Company Securityholders or any of their respective
Affiliates after the Effective Time, Acquirer, the First Step Surviving
Corporation, the Final Surviving Entity and their respective subsidiaries may
assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential
communications by Silicon Legal Strategy or O'Melveny and Myers LLP to such
third party; provided that none of Acquirer, First Step Surviving Corporation,
Final Surviving Entity nor any such subsidiary may waive such privilege
without the prior written consent of the Stockholders' Agent.
