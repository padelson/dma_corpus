                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

         This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 25, 2001 (as
amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, this
"Agreement"), is entered into by and between Washington Mutual, Inc., a
Washington corporation ("Washington Mutual"), and Dime Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Dime").

         The respective Boards of Directors of each of Washington Mutual and
Dime have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective
companies and stockholders to consummate the business combination transaction

amended (the "Code").

         Simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, Washington Mutual
is entering into an agreement with Warburg, Pincus Equity Partners, L.P.
("Warburg") in the form of Exhibit A hereto (the "Voting/Purchase Agreement")
pursuant to which Warburg has agreed, among other things, to vote its shares of
Dime Common Stock in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and to sell to
Washington Mutual on the Closing Date (as defined below) all of the warrants it
holds to purchase Dime securities, all on the terms set forth therein.

         Therefore, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

terms.

2.   The Merger

         2.1. The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act (the "WBCA") and the
Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL") at the Effective Time (as defined
in Section 2.2 hereof), Dime shall merge (the "Merger") with and into Washington
Mutual. Washington Mutual shall be the surviving corporation (hereinafter
sometimes called the "Surviving Company") in the Merger, and shall continue its
corporate existence under the laws of the State of Washington. The name of the
Surviving Company shall be Washington Mutual, Inc. Upon consummation of the
merger, the separate corporate existence of Dime shall terminate.

         2.2. Effective Time. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in
the articles of merger (the "Articles of Merger") which shall be filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Washington (the "Washington Secretary") and
in the certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") which shall be filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Secretary"),
on the Closing Date (as defined in Section 2.4 hereof). The term "Effective
Time" shall mean the time on the Closing Date when the Merger becomes effective,
as set forth in the Articles of Merger and the Certificate of Merger.

         2.3. Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects set forth in the WBCA and the DGCL.

         2.4. Closing of the Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, except as provided in the following paragraph, the closing of the
Merger (the "Closing") will take place at the offices of Simpson Thacher &
Bartlett at 425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York at 9:00 a.m. Pacific time
on the first Friday which is a Business Day occurring at least two Business Days
after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the latest to
occur of the conditions set forth in Section 8 hereof, other than conditions
which by their terms are to be satisfied at Closing, or such other date or time
as the parties may mutually agree (the "Closing Date"). For purposes of this
Agreement, a "Business Day" shall mean any day that is

                                       4

<PAGE>   9


not a Saturday, a Sunday or other day on which the office of the Washington
Secretary or the Delaware Secretary is closed.

         If the Closing shall not have occurred prior to January 4, 2002, at any
time during the five- Business Day period beginning on the first Business Day
following the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.1 and 8.2
(other than conditions which by their terms are to be satisfied at Closing),
Washington Mutual may deliver a notice to Dime (the "Extension Notice")
specifying that the Closing Date shall be January 4, 2002. Upon receipt of the
Extension Notice, Dime shall within five Business Days deliver to Washington
Mutual a certificate signed on behalf of Dime by the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer of Dime to the effect set forth in Section 8.2(a) as of
such date of delivery. If the certificate referred to in the immediately
preceding sentence has been delivered in response to an Extension Notice, the
certificate contemplated to be delivered at Closing pursuant to Section 8.2(a)
will be required to certify only that there have been no intentional breaches of
the representations and warranties contained in Section 4, subject to the
standard in the proviso contained in Section 8.2(a), and upon delivery thereof
Section 8.2(a) will be deemed satisfied.

         2.5. Conversion of Dime Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, without
any action on the part of Washington Mutual, Dime or the holder of any of the
shares of common stock of Dime, the Merger shall be effected in accordance with
the following terms:

              (a) All shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Dime
         (the "Dime Common Stock") owned directly by Dime (including treasury
         shares) or Washington Mutual (other than shares in trust accounts,
         managed accounts and the like or shares held in satisfaction of a debt
         previously contracted) shall be cancelled and retired and shall not
         represent capital stock of the Surviving Company and shall not be
         exchanged for shares of common stock, no par value, of Washington
         Mutual ("Washington Mutual Common Stock"), cash or other consideration.

              (b) Each outstanding share of Dime Common Stock together with the
         associated rights (the "Dime Rights") issued pursuant to the Rights
         Plan (as defined in Section 4.2(a)) which under the terms of Section
         2.6 is to be converted into the right to receive shares of Washington
         Mutual Common Stock shall, subject to Section 2.7, be converted into
         and become the right to receive a number of shares of Washington Mutual
         Common Stock (together with the requisite number of rights (the
         "Washington Mutual Rights") issued pursuant to the Washington Mutual
         Rights Agreement (as defined in Section 5.2)) equal to the Cash
         Election Price divided by the Average Market Price (the "Exchange
         Ratio"). For purposes of this Agreement, "Average Market Price" shall
         mean the average of the closing prices of shares of Washington Mutual
         Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite
         Transactions Tape for the ten consecutive full trading days (the
         "Valuation Period") ending on the tenth Business Day prior to the
         Closing Date. The Average Market Price shall be calculated to the
         nearest one-hundredth of one cent and the Exchange Ratio shall be
         calculated to the nearest ten thousandth.

              (c) Each outstanding share of Dime Common Stock which under the
         terms of Section 2.6 is to be converted into the right to receive cash
         shall be converted into the

                                       5

<PAGE>   10


         right to receive the sum of (x) 0.715341 times 1.05 times the Average
         Market Price and (y) 0.284659 times $40.8366 (the "Cash Election
         Price").

              (d) Each outstanding share of Dime Common Stock the holder of
         which has perfected his right to dissent under applicable law and has
         not effectively withdrawn or lost such right as of the Effective Time
         (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent a
         right to receive shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock or cash
         hereunder, and the holder thereof shall be entitled only to such rights
         as are granted by applicable law. Dime shall give Washington Mutual
         prompt notice upon receipt by Dime of any such demands for payment of
         the fair value of such shares of Dime Common Stock and of withdrawals
         of such notice and any other instruments provided pursuant to
         applicable law (any shareholder duly making such demand being
         hereinafter called a "Dissenting Shareholder"), and Washington Mutual
         shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
         with respect to any such demands. Dime shall not, except with the prior
         written consent of Washington Mutual, voluntarily make any payment with
         respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment,
         or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal
         or the taking of any other action by such Dissenting Shareholder as may
         be necessary to perfect appraisal rights under the DGCL. Any payments
         made in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be made by the Surviving
         Company.

              (e) If any Dissenting Shareholder shall effectively withdraw or
         lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) his right to such
         payment at or prior to the Effective Time, such holder's shares of Dime
         Common Stock shall be converted into a right to receive cash or
         Washington Mutual Common Stock in accordance with the applicable
         provisions of this Agreement. If such holder shall effectively withdraw
         or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) his right to such
         payment after the Effective Time, each share of Dime Common Stock of
         such holder shall be converted on a share by share basis into either
         the right to receive the Cash Election Price or Washington Mutual
         Common Stock as Washington Mutual shall determine in its sole
         discretion.

              (f) The Exchange Ratio set forth above shall be subject to
         appropriate adjustments in the event that, subsequent to the date of
         this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding
         Washington Mutual Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased,
         changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or
         securities through reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
         stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other like changes
         in Washington Mutual's capitalization.

         2.6. Election Procedures. An election form as Washington Mutual and
Dime shall mutually agree ("Election Form") will be sent no later than 15
Business Days prior to the expected Effective Time (provided that it need not be
sent until the Requisite Regulatory Approvals (as defined in Section 8.1(c))
have been obtained) to each holder of record of Dime Common Stock and to each
holder of record of warrants (each, a "Warrant Holder") with respect to Deemed
Shares (as defined in the Voting/Purchase Agreement) permitting such holder (or
in the case of nominee record holders, the beneficial owner through proper
instructions and documentation) (i) to elect to receive Washington Mutual Common
Stock with respect to each

                                       6

<PAGE>   11


share of such holder's Dime Common Stock as provided herein or, in the case of
each Warrant Holder, Deemed Shares as provided herein (the "Dime Stock Election
Shares") or (ii) to elect to receive cash with respect to each share of such
holder's Dime Common Stock as provided herein or, in the case of each Warrant
Holder, with respect to the Deemed Shares as provided herein (the "Dime Cash
Election Shares"). Any shares of Dime Common Stock or Deemed Shares with respect
to which the holder thereof or the Warrant Holder shall not, as of the Election
Deadline, have made such an election by submission to an exchange agent that
Washington Mutual shall designate with Dime's reasonable consent (the "Exchange
Agent"), on an effective, properly completed Election Form shall be deemed to be
Dime Stock Election Shares. Any Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to be Dime
Cash Election Shares, and with respect to such shares the holders thereof shall
in no event receive consideration comprised of Washington Mutual Common Stock.

         The term "Election Deadline", as used below, shall mean 5:00 p.m.,
Eastern time, on the 20th Business Day following but not including the date of
mailing of the Election Form or such other date as Dime and Washington Mutual
shall mutually agree upon.

         Any election to receive Washington Mutual Common Stock or cash shall
have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received
a properly completed Election Form by the Election Deadline. Any Election Form
may be revoked or changed by the person submitting such Election Form to the
Exchange Agent by written notice to the Exchange Agent only if such notice is
actually received by the Exchange Agent at or prior to the Election Deadline.
The certificate or certificates representing Dime Common Stock relating to any
revoked Election Form shall be promptly returned without charge to the person
submitting the Election Form to the Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent shall
have discretion to determine when any election, modification or revocation is
received and whether any such election, modification or revocation has been
properly made.

         Within five Business Days after the Election Deadline, the Exchange
Agent shall calculate the allocation among holders of Dime Common Stock (and
each Warrant Holder with respect to Deemed Shares) of rights to receive
Washington Mutual Common Stock or cash in the Merger in accordance with the
Election Forms as follows:

              (i) If the number of Dime Cash Election Shares is greater than the
         quotient of (x) $1,428,809,000 divided by (y) the Cash Election Price
         (the "Cash Conversion Shares"), then:

                   (1) all Dime Stock Election Shares will be converted into the
              right to receive Washington Mutual Common Stock, and

                   (2) each Dime Cash Election Share will be converted into the
              right to receive Washington Mutual Common Stock and cash in the
              following manner:

                        (A) a proration factor (the "Cash Proration Factor")
                   shall be determined by dividing (x) $1,428,809,000 , by (y)
                   the product of the number of Dime Cash Election Shares
                   multiplied by the Cash Election Price;

                                       7

<PAGE>   12


                        (B) the number of Dime Cash Election Shares held by each
                   holder of shares of Dime Common Stock that will be converted
                   into the right to receive cash pursuant to the terms of
                   Section 2.5(c) shall be determined by multiplying the Cash
                   Proration Factor by the number of Dime Cash Election Shares
                   held by such holder; and

                        (C) all Dime Cash Election Shares other than those
                   shares converted into the right to receive cash in accordance
                   with the preceding subparagraph (B) shall be converted into
                   the right to receive Washington Mutual Common Stock in
                   accordance with the terms of Section 2.5(b); or

              (ii) If the number of Dime Cash Election Shares is less than the
         Cash Conversion Shares, then:

                   (1) all Dime Cash Election Shares (subject to the provisions
              of Section 2.5(d) with respect to any Dissenting Shares) will be
              converted into the right to receive cash, and

                   (2) each Dime Stock Election Share will be converted into the
              right to receive Washington Mutual Common Stock and cash in the
              following manner:

                        (A) a proration factor (the "Stock Proration Factor")
                   shall be determined by dividing the Stock Conversion Shares
                   (as defined below) by the number of Dime Stock Election
                   Shares. The "Stock Conversion Shares" shall mean the
                   difference between (x) the total number of shares of Dime
                   Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
                   Time plus the Deemed Shares minus (y) the Cash Conversion
                   Shares;

                        (B) the number of Dime Stock Election Shares held by
                   each holder of shares of Dime Common Stock that will be
                   converted into the right to receive shares of Washington
                   Mutual Common Stock pursuant to the terms of Section 2.5(b)
                   shall be determined by multiplying the Stock Proration Factor
                   by the number of Dime Stock Election Shares held by such
                   holder; and

                        (C) all Dime Stock Election Shares other than those
                   shares converted into the right to receive Washington Mutual
                   Common Stock in accordance with the preceding subparagraph
                   (B) shall be converted into the right to receive cash in
                   accordance with the terms of Section 2.5(c); or

                   (iii) If the number of Dime Stock Election Shares is equal to
              the number of Stock Conversion Shares and the number of Dime Cash
              Election Shares is equal to the number of Cash Conversion Shares,
              then subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above shall not apply and all Dime
              Stock Election Shares will be converted into the right to receive
              Washington Mutual Common Stock and all Dime Cash Election Shares
              (subject to the provisions of Section 2.5(d)) will be converted
              into the right to receive cash.

         2.7. No Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for fractional shares of Washington
Mutual Common Stock shall be

                                       8

<PAGE>   13


issued in the Merger. Each holder who otherwise would have been entitled to a
fraction of a share of Washington Mutual Common Stock shall receive in lieu
thereof cash (without interest) in an amount determined by multiplying the
fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled
(after taking into account all shares of Dime Common Stock owned by such holder
at the Effective Time) by the Washington Mutual Share Price . The "Washington
Mutual Share Price " shall mean the average of the closing sale prices of one
share of Washington Mutual Common Stock for the ten trading days immediately
preceding the Closing Date on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") as
reported by The Wall Street Journal. No such holder shall be entitled to
dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share.

         2.8. Washington Mutual Common Stock; Washington Mutual Preferred Stock.
At and after the Effective Time, each share of Washington Mutual Common Stock
and each share of any preferred stock of Washington Mutual issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued and
outstanding share of common stock or preferred stock, as the case may be, of
Washington Mutual and shall not be affected by the Merger.

         2.9. Treatment of Options and Other Stock-Based Awards. (a) At the
Effective Time, each option granted or heretofore assumed by Dime to purchase
shares of Dime Common Stock (each an "Dime Option") which is outstanding and
unexercised (whether or not exercisable) immediately prior thereto shall cease
to represent a right to acquire shares of Dime Common Stock and shall be
converted automatically into an option to purchase shares of Washington Mutual
Common Stock in an amount and at an exercise price determined as provided below
(and otherwise shall remain subject to the terms of the Dime Stock Incentive
Plan, as amended to the date hereof, the Dime 1991 Stock Incentive Plan, as
amended to the date hereof, the Dime Stock Incentive Plan for Outside Directors,
as amended to the date hereof, the Dime 1992 Stock Option Plan, as amended to
the date hereof, the Dime 1990 Stock Option Plan, as amended to the date hereof,
the Dime 1997 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended to the date hereof, the Dime 1997
Stock Incentive Plan for Outside Directors, as amended to the date hereof, the
Dime Pride Shares Program, as amended to the date hereof, the Dime Pride Shares
II Program, as amended to the date hereof, the Dime 1993 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan, as amended to the date hereof, and the North American Mortgage Company
Incentive Stock Option Plan, as amended to the date hereof, as applicable
(collectively, the "Dime Stock Option Plans"), and the agreements or letters
evidencing grants thereunder):

                   (i) the number of shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock to
              be subject to the converted option shall be equal to the product
              of (x) the number of shares of Dime Common Stock subject to the
              Dime Option and (y) the Exchange Ratio (the "Option Conversion
              Ratio"), provided that any fractional shares of Washington Mutual
              Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded
              up to the nearest whole share; and

                   (ii) the exercise price per share of Washington Mutual Common
              Stock under the converted option shall be equal to the exercise
              price per share of Dime Common Stock under the Dime Option divided
              by the Option Conversion Ratio, provided that such exercise price
              shall be rounded down to the nearest cent.

                                       9

<PAGE>   14


              In the case of any Dime Options which are "incentive stock
         options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code), the exercise price,
         the number of shares purchasable pursuant to such options and the terms
         and conditions of exercise of such options shall be determined in order
         to comply with Section 424(a) of the Code and to avoid a "modification"
         of any such option under Code Section 424(h). Except as otherwise
         provided in this Section 2.9, the duration and other terms of each
         converted option shall be the same as the applicable Dime Option except
         that all references to Dime shall be deemed to be references to
         Washington Mutual.

                  In addition to the foregoing, in the event that any Dime
         Option has associated with it a stock appreciation right and/or limited
         stock appreciation right, the number and kind of shares subject to such
         right and the exercise price thereof shall be adjusted in the same
         manner as provided above for such Dime Option, and the terms and
         conditions thereof shall otherwise remain the same as they were
         immediately prior to the Effective Time.

              (b) At the Effective Time, each share of restricted stock (a
         "Restricted Share" and, collectively, the "Restricted Shares")
         outstanding as of the Effective Time and issued pursuant to a Dime
         Stock Option Plan or any other equity-based plans or agreements of or
         with Dime or any of its Subsidiaries providing for the grant of
         Restricted Share awards, to the extent not already vested, shall vest
         and shall represent a right to receive the same rights provided to
         other holders of Dime Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.5 above.

              (c) Except as provided herein or as otherwise agreed to by the
         parties, the Dime Stock Option Plans and any other plan, program or
         arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest
         in respect of the capital stock of Dime or any Subsidiary thereof shall
         terminate as of the Effective Time, and Dime shall ensure that
         following the Effective Time no holder of a Dime Option nor any holder
         of a Restricted Share or any other equity-based right shall have any
         right to acquire equity securities of Dime or the Surviving Corporation
         (except to the extent required under any qualified plan maintained by
         Dime or any of its Subsidiaries).

         2.10. Litigation Tracking Warrant Conversion. At and following the
Effective Time, each outstanding Litigation Tracking Warrant ("LTW") issued by
Dime pursuant to the Warrant Agreement, dated as of December 21, 2000 (the
"Warrant Agreement"), among Dime, the EquiServe Trust Company, N.A. ("ETC") and
EquiServe Limited Partnership ("ELP", and together with ETC, the "Warrant
Agent") shall entitle the holder thereof to receive upon exercise of such LTW in
accordance with the terms of the Warrant Agreement Merger Consideration
consistent with the terms thereof. In addition, in accordance with the
provisions of the Dime Stock Option Plans and the Dime Voluntary Deferred
Compensation Plan, the Dime Voluntary Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors,
the Deferred Compensation Plan for Board Members of The Dime Savings Bank of New
York, FSB, and the Benefit Restoration Plan of The Dime Savings Bank of New
York, FSB (the "Dime Phantom Stock Plans"), any Dime Options, shares of
restricted Dime Common Stock, and any other Dime equity-based compensation
(including the phantom Dime Common Stock provided for in the Dime Phantom Stock
Plans) that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that, as
of such time, entitle the holder

                                       10

<PAGE>   15


thereof to receive LTWs (or, as applicable, the economic value of such LTWs),
shall at and following the Effective Time entitle the holder or beneficiary
thereof to receive LTWs (or, as applicable, their economic value), representing
the right to receive shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock upon the exercise
of such LTWs, consistent with the methodology and procedures described in
resolutions heretofore adopted by the Board of Directors and Compensation
Committee of Dime.

         2.11. Articles of Incorporation. At the Effective Time, the Articles of
Incorporation of Washington Mutual, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Company,
until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.

         2.12. Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Washington Mutual,
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the
Surviving Company until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.

         2.13. Board of Directors. Subject to Section 7.14, the directors of
Washington Mutual immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be
the directors of the Surviving Company, each to hold office in accordance with
the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Company, until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed (as the case may be) and
qualified.

         2.14. Tax Consequences. It is intended that the Merger shall constitute
a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this
Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" as that term is used in
Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

         2.15. Reservation of Right to Revise Structure. Washington Mutual may
at any time change the method of effecting the business combination contemplated
by this Agreement if and to the extent that it deems such a change to be
desirable, including, without limitation, to provide for a merger of Dime with a
wholly owned subsidiary of Washington Mutual; provided, however, that no such
change shall (A) alter or change the amount or kind of consideration to be
received by holders of Dime Common Stock under this Agreement (the "Merger
Consideration") or their method of electing such Merger Consideration, or (B)
adversely affect the anticipated tax consequences of the Merger to the holders
of Dime Common Stock as a result of receiving the Merger Consideration, or (C)
materially impede or delay consummation of the Merger. In the event Washington
Mutual elects to make such a change, the parties agree to execute appropriate
documents to reflect the change.

3.   Exchange of Certificates for Merger Consideration

         3.1. Washington Mutual to Make Merger Consideration Available. At or
promptly after the Election Deadline (but in no event prior to the Effective
Time), Washington Mutual shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the
Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates (as defined
below) and for the benefit of each Warrant Holder in respect of the purchase
price under the Voting/Purchase Agreement, for exchange in accordance with this
Section 3, certificates representing the shares of Washington Mutual Common
Stock and an estimated amount of cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash
Election Price payable hereunder

                                       11

<PAGE>   16


and thereunder and any cash that may be payable in lieu of any fractional shares
(such cash and certificates for shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock,
together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund").

         3.2. Exchange of Shares.

              (a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange
         Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate formerly
         representing shares of Dime Common Stock (a "Certificate") a form of
         letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
         effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
         only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and
         instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
         exchange for certificates representing, as the case may be, the shares
         of Washington Mutual Common Stock, cash in respect of the Cash Election
         Price and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Washington Mutual Common
         Stock, if any, into which the shares of Dime Capital Stock represented
         by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted pursuant
         to this Agreement. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange
         and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly
         completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such
         Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as
         applicable, (i) a certificate representing that number of shares of
         Washington Mutual Common Stock (if any) to which such former holder of
         Dime Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions
         of Section 2 hereof, (ii) a check representing that amount of cash (if
         any) to which such former holder of Dime Common Stock shall have become
         entitled in respect of the Cash Election Price pursuant to the
         provisions of Section 2 hereof and (iii) a check representing the
         amount of cash (if any) payable in lieu of fractional shares of
         Washington Mutual Common Stock, which such former holder has the right
         to receive in respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to the
         provisions of this Section 3, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
         forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash
         payable in lieu of fractional shares.

              (b) No dividends or other distributions with a record date after
         the Effective Time with respect to Washington Mutual Common Stock shall
         be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder
         thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this
         Section 3. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this
         Section 3, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any
         such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon,
         which theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of
         Washington Mutual Common Stock represented by such Certificate.

              (c) If any certificate representing shares of Washington Mutual
         Common Stock is to be issued in the name of other than the registered
         holder of the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be
         a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered
         shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument
         of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the
         person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in
         advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance
         of a certificate representing shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock
         in the name of and payment of cash to any person

                                       12

<PAGE>   17


         other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
         required for any other reason relating to such holder or requesting
         person, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the
         Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

              (d) At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on
         the stock transfer books of Dime of the shares of Dime Capital Stock
         which were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
         Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such
         shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be
         cancelled and exchanged for certificates representing shares of
         Washington Mutual Common Stock or payment of cash as provided in this
         Section 3.

              (e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
         stockholders of Dime for six months after the Effective Time shall be
         paid, at the request of Washington Mutual, to Washington Mutual. Any
         stockholders of Dime who have not theretofore complied with this
         Section 3 shall thereafter look only to Washington Mutual for payment
         of the shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock, cash, cash in lieu of
         any fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions on the
         Washington Mutual Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of
         Dime Common Stock held by such stockholder at the Effective Time as
         determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any
         interest thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
         herein, none of Washington Mutual, Dime, the Exchange Agent or any
         other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Dime
         Common Stock, for any amount properly delivered to a public official
         pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

              (f) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
         destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
         claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
         required by Washington Mutual, the posting by such person of a bond in
         such amount as Washington Mutual may determine is reasonably necessary
         as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
         to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such
         lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Washington Mutual
         Common Stock, cash and cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in
         respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

              (g) As soon as practicable after the Election Deadline, the
         Exchange Agent shall deliver to each Warrant Holder (i) a certificate
         representing that number of shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock
         (if any) and a check representing the amount of cash (if any) in
         respect of the Cash Election Price to which each Warrant Holder would
         have become entitled pursuant to Section 2 hereof with respect to the
         Deemed Shares if the Deemed Shares were outstanding shares of Dime
         Common Stock as of the Effective Time, and (ii) a check representing
         the amount of cash (if any) payable in lieu of fractional shares of
         Washington Mutual Common Stock to which each Warrant Holder would have
         become entitled pursuant to Section 2.7 with respect to the Deemed
         Shares if the Deemed Shares were outstanding shares of Dime Common
         Stock as of the Effective Time.

                                       13

<PAGE>   18


              (h) Washington Mutual or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to
         deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant
         to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to any holder
         of Dime Common Stock or to any Warrant Holder such amounts as
         Washington Mutual (or any Affiliate thereof) or the Exchange Agent are
         required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
         payment under the Code, or any applicable provision of U.S. federal,
         state, local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent that such amounts are
         properly withheld by Washington Mutual or the Exchange Agent, such
         withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
         having been paid to the holder of the Dime Common Stock or to any
         Warrant Holder in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were
         made by Washington Mutual or the Exchange Agent.

4.   Representations and Warranties of Dime.

         Dime hereby represents and warrants to Washington Mutual as follows:

         4.1. Corporate Organization.

              (a) Dime is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
         good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Dime has the
         corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and
         assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and
         is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in
         which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or
         location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such
         licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
         licensed or qualified would not have nor reasonably be expected to have
         a Material Adverse Effect (as defined below) on Dime. As used in this
         Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect" means, with respect to
         Dime, Washington Mutual or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
         be, a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations or
         financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole
         or a material adverse effect on such party's ability to consummate the
         transactions contemplated hereby on a timely basis; provided, however,
         that in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred,
         there shall be excluded any effect on the referenced party the cause of
         which is (i) any change in banking, savings association and similar
         laws, rules or regulations of general applicability or interpretations
         thereof by courts or governmental authorities, (ii) any change in
         generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") or regulatory
         accounting requirements applicable to banks, savings associations, or
         their holding companies generally, (iii) the announcement of this
         Agreement or any action of either party or any Subsidiary thereof
         required to be taken by it under this Agreement and (iv) any changes in
         general economic conditions affecting banks, savings associations, or
         their holding companies generally, provided that the effect of such
         changes described in this clause (iv) (including, without limitation,
         changes in the interest rates) shall not be excluded to the extent of
         any materially disproportionate impact (if any) they have on such
         party. For purposes of this Agreement, "Subsidiary" means, with respect
         to any person, any corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited
         liability company or any other entity that is consolidated with such
         person for financial reporting purposes. Dime is duly registered as a
         savings and loan holding company under the Home Owners' Loan Act, as
         amended

                                       14

         ("HOLA"), and qualifies as a savings and loan holding company of the
         type described in Section 10(c)(3)(A) of HOLA. The copies of the
         Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Dime which have previously
         been made available to Washington Mutual are true, complete and correct
         copies of such documents as in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

              (b) Each Subsidiary of Dime (i) is duly organized and validly
         existing as a savings bank, corporation or partnership under the laws
         of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly licensed or qualified
         to do business and is in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether
         federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
         property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so licensed
         or qualified and in which the failure to be so qualified would have or
         would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
         aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Dime and (iii) has all
         requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties
         and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted.

              (c) Except for its ownership of The Dime Savings Bank of New York,
         FSB ("Dime Savings Bank"), Dime does not beneficially own, either
         directly or through its Subsidiaries, any stock or equity interest in
         any depository institution (as defined in 12 U.S.C. Section
         1813(c)(1)). Dime Savings Bank is a qualified thrift lender pursuant to
         Section 10(m) of HOLA and its deposits are insured by the Federal
         Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC") through the Savings
         Association Insurance Fund ("SAIF") and the Bank Insurance Fund ("BIF")
         to the fullest extent permitted by law. Dime Savings Bank is a member
         in good standing of the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") of New York.

         4.2.     Capitalization.

              (a) The authorized capital stock of Dime consists of 350,000,000
         shares of Dime Common Stock and 40,000,000 shares of preferred stock,

         granted under Dime's Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement, dated
         as of October 20, 1995 and amended as of July 6, 2000 (the "Rights
         Plan"). All of the issued and outstanding shares of Dime Common Stock
         have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, n
         onassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability
         attaching to the ownership thereof. As of the date of this Agreement,
         except (i) as set


                                       15

         forth in Section 4.2(a) of the disclosure schedule of Dime delivered to
         Washington Mutual concurrently herewith (the "Dime Disclosure
         Schedule"), (ii) for up to 112,975,607 LTWs, warrants to acquire
         8,142.738 shares of Series C junior nonvoting convertible preferred
         stock (which are convertible into 8,142,738 shares of Dime Common
         Stock) and warrants to acquire 5,464.926 shares of Series D junior
         nonvoting convertible preferred stock (which are convertible into
         5,464,926 shares of Dime Common Stock) and (iii) as set forth elsewhere
         in this Section 4.2(a), Dime does not have and is not bound by any
         outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or
         agreements of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any
         shares of Dime Common Stock or Dime Preferred Stock or any other equity
         securities of Dime or any securities representing the right to purchase
         or otherwise receive any shares of Dime capital stock (including,
         without limitation, any rights plan or agreement). Except as set forth
         in Section 4.2(a) of the Dime Disclosure Schedule, since May 31, 2001,
         Dime has not issued any shares of its capital stock or any securities
         convertible into or exercisable for any shares of its capital stock,
         other than upon the exercise of employee stock options or pursuant to
         restricted stock awards granted prior to such date and disclosed in
         this Section 4.2(a).

              (b) Section 4.2(b) of the Dime Disclosure Schedule lists the name,
         jurisdiction of incorporation, authorized and outstanding shares of
         capital stock and record and beneficial owners of such capital stock
         (with respect to owners other than Dime or any Dime Subsidiary, to the
         extent known to Dime) for each entity in which Dime beneficially owns
         or controls, directly or indirectly, any equity interest (regardless of
         whether such entity is a Subsidiary) (a "Controlled Entity") that is a
         Significant Subsidiary (as such term is defined in Rule 1-02 of
         Regulation S-X) of Dime. Each Controlled Entity in which Dime or any
         Dime Subsidiary beneficially owns or controls, directly or indirectly,
         more than a 9.9% equity interest is a legal investment for a unitary
         savings and loan holding company and, with respect to those owned by
         Dime Savings Bank, for a federal savings association. Except as set
         forth in Section 4.2(b) of the Dime Disclosure Schedule, Dime owns,
         directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding shares of
         capital stock of or all other equity interests in each of Dime's
         Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, charges, encumbrances,
         adverse rights or claims and security interests whatsoever ("Liens"),
         and all of such shares are duly authorized and validly issued and are
         fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no
         personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. Neither Dime nor
         any Subsidiary thereof has or is bound by any outstanding
         subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of
         any character calling for the purchase, sale or issuance of any shares
         of capital stock or any other equity security of any Subsidiary of Dime
         or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise
         receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of any
         such Subsidiary.

              (c) No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness having the
         right to vote on any matters on which stockholders may vote are
         outstanding.

         4.3.     Authority; No Violation.

              (a) Dime has full corporate power and authority to execute and
         deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
         hereby. The Board of Directors of Dime at a meeting held on June 24,
         2001 has duly (i) determined that this Agreement and the Merger are
         fair to and in the best interests of Dime and its stockholders and

         the Merger, the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the

         adoption of this Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
         majority of the outstanding shares of Dime Common Stock, no other
         corporate proceedings on the part of Dime are necessary to approve this
         Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This
         Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Dime and
         (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Washington
         Mutual) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Dime, enforceable
         against Dime in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be
         limited by general principles of equity whether applied in a court of
         law or a court of equity and by bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws
         affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally.

              (b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Dime
         nor the consummation by Dime of the transactions contemplated hereby,
         nor compliance by Dime with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will
         (i) violate any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws
         of Dime or any of the similar governing documents of any of its
         Subsidiaries or (ii) assuming that the consents and approvals referred
         to in Section 4.4 are duly obtained, (x) violate any statute, code,
         ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree or
         injunction applicable to Dime or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
         their respective properties or assets, or (y) violate, conflict with,
         result in a breach of any provision of or the loss of any benefit
         under, or require redemption or repurchase or otherwise require the
         purchase or sale of any securities, constitute a default (or an event
         which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
         default) under, result in the termination of or a right of termination
         or cancellation under, accelerate the performance required by, or
         result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective
         properties or assets of Dime or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of
         the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage,
         indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument
         or obligation to which Dime or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or
         by which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be
         bound or affected, except (in the case of clause (y) above) for such
         violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults or other events which, either
         individually or in the aggregate, will not have and would not
         reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Dime.

by the Office of Thrift Supervision (the "OTS"), (ii) approval of the listing of
the Washington Mutual Common Stock to be issued in the Merger on NYSE, (iii) the

of the stockholders of Dime, (vii) the consents and approvals set forth in
Section 4.4 of the Dime Disclosure Schedule, and (viii) the consents and

defined), the failure of which to be obtained will not have and would not be
reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Dime or Washington Mutual, no consents or approvals of, or
filings or registrations with, any court, administrative agency or commission or
other governmental authority or instrumentality or self-regulatory organization

delivery by Dime of this Agreement and (B) the consummation by Dime of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

1998. Except as set forth in Section 4.5 of the Dime Disclosure Schedule, there

         been granted any waiver of any federal, state, local or foreign statute
         of limitations with respect to, or any extension of a period for the
         assessment of, any Tax.

              (g) Except as set forth in Section 4.10(g) of the Dime Disclosure
         Schedule, neither Dime nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
         agreement, contract, arrangement or plan that has resulted or would

         Agreement in the payment of any "excess parachute payments" within the
         meaning of Section 280G of the Code and neither Dime nor any of its
         Subsidiaries has made any payments and is not a party to any agreement,
         and does not maintain any plan, program or arrangement, that could

         compensation upon the exercise of a Dime Option or upon the issuance
         of any Dime Common Stock), that would not be fully deductible by reason
         of Section 162(m) of the Code.

              (h) Neither Dime nor any of its Subsidiaries has filed a consent
         to the application of Section 341(f) of the Code.

              (k) For purposes of this Agreement, "Tax Return" shall mean any
         return, report, information return or other document (including any
         related or supporting information) required to be filed with any taxing

         "Plans") by Dime or any of its Subsidiaries or by any trade or business
         related thereto, whether or not incorporated (an "ERISA Affiliate"),
         all of which together with Dime would be deemed a "single employer"
         within the meaning of Section 4001 of ERISA.

              (b) Except as set forth in Section 4.11(b) of the Dime Disclosure

         not limited to ERISA and the Code, (ii) each of the Plans intended to

         been determined to be so qualified by the Internal Revenue Service or

         amendment period and nothing has occurred that would be reasonably
         expected to result in any such plan ceasing to be qualified, (iii) with
         respect to each Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA, the present
         value of accrued benefits under such Plan, based upon the actuarial
         assumptions used for funding purposes in the most recent actuarial
         report prepared by such Plan's actuary with respect to such Plan, did
         not, as of its latest valuation date, exceed the then current value of
         the assets of such Plan allocable to such accrued benefits, (iv) no
         Plan provides benefits, including without limitation death or medical
         benefits (whether or not insured), with respect to current or former
         employees of Dime, its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate beyond their
         retirement or other termination of service, other than (w) coverage

         Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by Dime, its Subsidiaries or any
         ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full (other than payment
         of premiums not yet due to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
         (the "PBGC")), and no condition exists that would be reasonably
         expected to result in Dime, its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate
         incurring a material liability thereunder, (vi) no Plan is a
         "multi-employer pension plan", as such term is defined in Section 3(37)
         of ERISA, (vii) all contributions or other amounts payable by Dime or
         its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time with respect to each Plan in
         respect of current or prior plan years have been paid or accrued in
         accordance with GAAP and Section 412 of the Code, (viii) neither Dime,
         its Subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in a transaction
         in connection with which Dime, its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate
         could be subject to either a material civil penalty assessed pursuant
         to Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a material tax imposed pursuant to

         the knowledge of Dime, threatened or anticipated claims (other than
         routine claims for benefits) by, on behalf of or against any of the
         Plans or any trusts related thereto.

<PAGE>   27


              (d) Except as set forth in Section 4.11(d) of the Dime Disclosure
         Schedule, no Plan exists which provides for or could result in the
         payment to any Dime employee of any money or other property or rights
         or accelerate the vesting or payment of such amounts or rights to any
         Dime employee as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
         Agreement, including the Merger, whether or not such payment or
         acceleration would constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of
         Code Section 280G. Except as set forth in Section 4.11(d) of the Dime
         Disclosure Schedule, since March 31, 2001, neither Dime nor any of its
         Subsidiaries has taken any action that would result in a payment or
         acceleration described in the preceding sentence.

              (e) Except as set forth in Section 4.11(e) of the Dime Disclosure
         Schedule, (i) neither Dime nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or
         is bound by any written contract or arrangement with respect to the
         employment or compensation of any (x) consultants receiving in excess
         of $100,000 annually and (y) employees receiving compensation (salary,
         bonus and commission) in excess of $250,000 annually, and (ii) except
         as provided under the Plans set forth in Sections 4.11(d) and (e) of
         the Dime Disclosure Schedule and other agreements or arrangements set
         forth in Sections 4.11(d) and (e) of the Dime Disclosure Schedule,
         consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
         not (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional acts or
         events) result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise)
         becoming due from Dime or any Subsidiary to any officer or employee
         thereof. No officer or employee of Dime or any Subsidiary is, nor shall
         be, entitled to receive duplicative severance payments and benefits
         under both (i) an employment or severance agreement and (ii) a
         severance or change-in-control plan, program, or other arrangement.
         Dime has previously delivered or made available to Washington Mutual
         true and complete copies of all consulting agreements calling for
         payments in excess of $150,000 annually, and employment and deferred
         compensation agreements (or forms thereof) providing for compensation
         (salary, bonus and commission) in excess of $250,000 annually that are

              (f) Except as set forth in Section 4.11(f) of the Dime Disclosure
         Schedule, no current employee of Dime or any of its Subsidiaries
         received aggregate remuneration (bonus, salary and commission) in
         excess of $250,000 for 2000 or would reasonably be expected to receive
         aggregate remuneration (excluding severance or other payments which,
         pursuant to an agreement or arrangement set forth in Section 4.11(e) of
         the Dime Disclosure Schedule, are made as a result of consummation of
         the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, either alone or upon
         the occurrence of any additional acts or events) in excess of $250,000
         in 2001.

              (g) With respect to the Amended and Restated Umbrella Trust
         Agreements among Dime Bancorp, Inc., The Dime Savings Bank of New York,
         FSB and HSBC Bank USA, as Trustee, with respect to the Covered
         Arrangements of The Dime Savings Bank of New York, FSB and Related
         Entities, the Umbrella Trust Agreement among Dime Bancorp, Inc., The
         Dime Savings Bank of New York, FSB and HSBC Bank USA, as Trustee with
         respect to the Designated Arrangements of The Dime Savings Bank of New

         and Restated Umbrella Trust Agreement among Dime Bancorp, Inc., The
         Dime Savings Bank of New York, FSB and HSBC Bank USA, as Trustee with
         respect to the Covered Arrangements for Outside Directors of The Dime
         Savings Bank of New York, FSB and Related Entities, (the "Director
         Umbrella Trust" and, collectively with the Employee Umbrella Trusts,
         the "Umbrella Trust Agreements"): (i) there has been no Irrevocable
         Election (as defined in each such agreement); (ii) all Covered
         Arrangements (as defined in each such agreement) have been disclosed to
         Washington Mutual prior to the date of this Agreement, and there shall
         be no additional Covered Arrangements both approved and entered into
         after June 22, 2001, and (iii) except as provided in Section 7.7(f), at
         no time on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
         Effective Time shall the Committee (as defined in the Umbrella Trust
         Agreements during such time period) amend the Umbrella Trust Agreements
         in any way without the prior written consent of Washington Mutual.

              (h) Effective as of the date of this Agreement, all Dime Stock
         Option Plans under which grants may be made prospectively have been
         amended to delete all references to "the publication or dissemination
         of an announcement of action intended to result in a Terminating Event"
         (as defined in each applicable Dime Stock Option Plan) with respect to
         future payments.

         4.12. SEC Reports. Dime has previously made available to Washington
Mutual an accurate and complete copy of each final registration statement,
prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed since January
1, 1999 and prior to the date hereof by Dime or any of its Subsidiaries with the
SEC pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"),
or the Exchange Act (the "Dime Reports"), and no such registration statement,
prospectus, report, schedule or proxy statement contained any untrue statement
of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. Dime and its Subsidiaries
have timely filed all material Dime Reports and other documents required to be
filed by them under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and, as of their
respective dates, all Dime Reports complied as to form in all material respects
with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto.

         4.13. Compliance With Applicable Law. Except as disclosed in Section
4.13 of the Dime Disclosure Schedule, Dime and each of its Subsidiaries hold,
and have at all times held, all licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations
necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses under and
pursuant to all, and have complied with and are not in violation in any material
respect under any, applicable law, statute, order, rule, regulation, policy
and/or guideline of any Governmental Entity relating to Dime or any of its
Subsidiaries, except where the failure to hold such license, franchise, permit
or authorization or such noncompliance or violation would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Dime, and neither Dime nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of, or has
received notice of, any violations of any of the above which, individually or in
the aggregate, would have or would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Dime.

         4.14. Certain Contracts.

<PAGE>   29


              (a) Except as publicly disclosed in the Dime Reports filed prior
         to the date hereof or as set forth in Section 4.14(a) of the Dime
         Disclosure Schedule, neither Dime nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
         party to or is bound by any contract, arrangement, commitment or
         understanding (whether written or oral) (i) which is a material
         contract (as defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)
         to be performed after the date of this Agreement, (ii) which materially
         limits the freedom of Dime or any of its Subsidiaries to compete in any
         material line of business, in any geographic area or with any person,
         or which requires exclusive referrals of material business or requires
         Dime or any of its Subsidiaries to make available investment
         opportunities of a material nature or magnitude to any person on a
         priority or exclusive basis, or (iii) with or to a labor union or guild
         (including any collective bargaining agreement). Each contract,
         arrangement, commitment or understanding of the type described in this
         Section 4.14(a), whether or not publicly disclosed in the Dime Reports
         filed prior to the date hereof or set forth in Section 4.14(a) of the
         Dime Disclosure Schedule, is referred to herein as a "Dime Contract",
         and neither Dime nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of, or has received
         notice of, any violation of the above by any of the other parties
         thereto which, individually or in the aggregate, would have or would
         reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Dime. Dime
         has made available all contracts which involved payments by Dime or any
         of its Subsidiaries in fiscal year 2000 of more than $700,000 or which
         could reasonably be expected to involve payments during fiscal year
         2001 of more than $700,000, other than any such contract that is
         terminable at will on 60 days or less notice without payment of a
         penalty in excess of $125,000 and other than any contract entered into
         on or after the date hereof that is permitted under the provisions of
         Section 6.2.

              (b) Except as set forth in Section 4.14(b) of the Dime Disclosure
         Schedule, (i) each Dime Contract is valid and binding on Dime and in
         full force and effect, and, to the knowledge of Dime, is valid and
         binding on the other parties thereto, (ii) Dime and each of its
         Subsidiaries has in all material respects performed all obligations
         required to be performed by it to date under each Dime Contract, and
         (iii) no event or condition exists which constitutes or, after notice
         or lapse of time or both, would constitute a material default on the
         part of Dime or any of its Subsidiaries under any such Dime Contract,
         except, in each case, where such invalidity, failure to be binding,
         failure to so perform or default, individually or in the aggregate,
         would not have or reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
         Effect on Dime.

         4.15. Agreements With Regulatory Agencies. Except as set forth in
Section 4.15 of the Dime Disclosure Schedule, neither Dime nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order issued by, or is
a party to any written agreement, consent agreement or memorandum of
understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or similar
undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or has adopted any
board resolutions at the request of (each, whether or not set forth in Section
4.15 of the Dime Disclosure Schedule, a "Regulatory Agreement"), any
Governmental Entity that currently restricts or by its terms will in the future
restrict the conduct of its business or relates to its capital adequacy, its
credit policies, its management or its business, nor has Dime or any of its
Subsidiaries been advised by any Governmental Entity that it is considering
issuing or requesting any Regulatory Agreement. Dime is not aware of any fact or
circumstance which is reasonably likely to prevent it or Washington Mutual from
obtaining the governmental approvals and consents required in

                                       25

<PAGE>   30

connection with the consummation by Dime of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

         4.16. Undisclosed Liabilities. Except (i) for those liabilities that
are fully reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of
Dime included in the Dime Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 or (ii)
for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since March 31, 2001, neither Dime nor any of its Subsidiaries has
incurred any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued or
contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due) that, either alone or
when combined with all the liabilities not described in clause (i) or (ii), has
had, or would be reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on Dime.

         4.17. Rights Agreement; Anti-Takeover Provisions. Dime has taken all
action necessary so that the entering into of this Agreement and the
Voting/Purchase Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby do not and will not result in the grant of any rights to any
person under the Rights Agreement or enable or require the rights issuable
thereunder to be exercised, distributed or triggered. The Board of Directors of
Dime has taken all necessary action so that the provisions of Section 203 of the
DGCL and any applicable provisions of the takeover laws of any other state (and
any comparable provisions of Dime's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws), do
not and will not apply to this Agreement, the Voting/Purchase Agreement, the
Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

         4.18. Dime Information. The information relating to Dime and its
Subsidiaries to be provided by Dime for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, the registration statement on Form S-4 (the "S-4") in
which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included as a prospectus, any
filings or approvals under applicable state securities laws, any filing pursuant
to Rule 165 or Rule 425 under the Securities Act or Rule 14a-12 under the
Exchange Act, or in any other document filed with any other Governmental Entity
in connection herewith, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (except for such portions thereof as relate only to
Washington Mutual or any of its Subsidiaries) will comply as to form in all
material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

         4.19. Title to Property.

              (a) Real Property. Except as disclosed in Section 4.19(a) of the
         Dime Disclosure Schedule, Dime and its Subsidiaries have good, valid
         and marketable title to all material real property owned by them free
         and clear of all Liens, except Liens for current taxes not yet due and
         payable and other standard exceptions commonly found in title policies
         in the jurisdiction where such real property is located, and such
         encumbrances and imperfections of title, if any, as do not materially
         detract from the value of the properties and do not materially
         interfere with the present or proposed use of such properties or
         otherwise materially impair such operations. All real property and
         fixtures material to the business, operations or financial condition of
         Dime and its Subsidiaries are in substantially good condition and
         repair except as would not

                                       26

<PAGE>   31

         reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
         Material Adverse Effect on Dime.

              (b) Personal Property. Dime and its Subsidiaries have good, valid
         and marketable title to all tangible personal property owned by them on
         the date hereof, free and clear of all Liens except as publicly
         disclosed in the Dime Reports filed prior to the date hereof or as
         disclosed in Section 4.19(b) of the Dime Disclosure Schedule or as
         would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
         aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Dime. With respect to personal
         property used in the business of Dime and its Subsidiaries which is
         leased rather than owned, neither Dime nor any Subsidiary thereof is in
         default under the terms of any such lease the loss of which would
         reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
         aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Dime.

              (c) Leased Property. All leases of real property and all other
         leases material to Dime and its Subsidiaries under which Dime or a
         Subsidiary, as lessee, leases real or personal property are valid and
         binding in accordance with their respective terms, there is not under
         such lease any material existing default by Dime or such Subsidiary or
         any event which with notice or lapse of time would constitute such a
         default, and Dime or such Subsidiary quietly enjoys the premises
         provided for in such lease except as would not reasonably be expected
         to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
         Dime.

         4.20. Insurance. Dime and its Subsidiaries are insured with reputable
insurers against such risks and in such amounts as the management of Dime
reasonably has determined to be prudent in accordance with industry practice.
Dime and its Subsidiaries are in material compliance with their insurance
policies and are not in default under any of the material terms thereof. Each
such policy is outstanding and in full force and effect and, except as set forth
on Section 4.20 of the Dime Disclosure Schedule and except for policies insuring
against potential liabilities of officers, directors and employees of Dime and
its Subsidiaries, Dime or the relevant Subsidiary thereof is the sole
beneficiary of such policies. All premiums and other payments due under any such
policy have been paid, and all claims thereunder have been filed in due and
timely fashion.

         4.21. Environmental Liability. Except as set forth in Section 4.21 of
the Dime Disclosure Schedule, there are no legal, administrative, arbitral or
other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action, private environmental
investigations or remediation activities or governmental investigations of any
nature seeking to impose, or that reasonably could be expected to result in the
imposition, on Dime or any of its Subsidiaries of any liability or obligation
arising under common law standards relating to environmental protection, human
health or safety, or under any local, state or federal environmental statute,
regulation or ordinance, including, without limitation, the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended
(collectively, the "Environmental Laws"), pending or, to the knowledge of Dime,
threatened against Dime or any of its Subsidiaries, which liability or
obligation would have or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Dime. To the knowledge of Dime, there is no reasonable basis for any
such proceeding, claim, action or governmental investigation that would impose
any liability or

                                       27

<PAGE>   32

obligation that would have or would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Dime. To the knowledge of Dime, during or prior to the period
of (i) its or any of its Subsidiaries' ownership or operation of any of their
respective current properties, (ii) its or any of its Subsidiaries'
participation in the management of any property, or (iii) its or any of its

on, under or affecting any such property which would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Dime. Neither Dime nor any of its Subsidiaries
is subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by or
with any court, governmental authority, regulatory agency or third party
imposing any material liability or obligation pursuant to or under any

Material Adverse Effect on Dime.

         4.22. Opinion Of Financial Advisor. Dime has received the opinions of
Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation and Merrill Lynch & Co., each dated as of
the date of this Agreement, to the effect that, as of such date, the Merger
Consideration to be received by holders of Dime Common Stock in the Merger is
fair from a financial point of view to such holders of Dime Common Stock.

         4.23. Loan Matters.

              (a) Each outstanding Loan and each commitment to extend credit has
         been solicited and originated and is administered and serviced in
         accordance with the relevant loan documents and Dime's underwriting
         standards, except to the extent that any such failure would not have
         and would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in
         the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Dime.

              (b) Each of Dime and its Subsidiaries which is required to be so
         approved is approved by and is in good standing: (i) as a supervised
         mortgagee by the Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") to

         GNMA I and II Issuer by the Government National Mortgage Association

         4.24. Labor Matters. Neither Dime nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to or is bound by any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other
agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization; nor is Dime
or any of its Subsidiaries the subject of a proceeding asserting that it or any
such Subsidiary has committed an unfair labor practice (within the meaning of
the National Labor Relations Act) or seeking to compel Dime or any such
Subsidiary to bargain with any labor organization as to wages or conditions of
employment, nor is there any strike or other material labor dispute or disputes
involving it or any of its Subsidiaries pending, or to Dime's knowledge,
threatened except for such disputes as would not have and would not reasonably
be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on Dime, nor is Dime aware of any activity involving its or any of its


                                       28

Subsidiaries' employees seeking to certify a collective bargaining unit or
engaging in other organizational activity.

Disclosure Schedule, neither Dime nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any

order, rule, regulation, policy and/or guideline of any Governmental Entity
relating to Washington Mutual or any of its Subsidiaries, except where the

Adverse Effect on Washington Mutual.

         date of this Agreement)), by merger, consolidation, asset purchase or
         other business combination, or by contributions to capital, or make any
         material property transfers or material purchases of any property or
         assets, in or from any other individual, corporation, joint venture or
         other entity other than a wholly owned Subsidiary of Dime, except as
         expressly required by the terms of any contracts or agreements in force
         at the date of this Agreement and set out in Section 6.2 of the Dime
         Disclosure Schedule;

              (d) enter into, renew, extend or terminate any Loan, lease,

         calls for aggregate annual payments of $700,000 and which is not either

         in any negotiations concerning, or provide any nonpublic information

                                       35

<PAGE>   40

         any discussions with, any person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal,
         or (iii) waive any provision of or amend the terms of the Rights
         Agreement (or redeem the rights issued thereunder) in respect of an
         Acquisition Proposal; provided that, in the event Dime receives an
         unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal and Dime's board of
         directors concludes in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal
         constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal,
         Dime may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and their
         Representatives to, take any action described in clause (ii) above to
         the extent that the board of directors of Dime concludes in good faith
         (based on the advice of its outside counsel) that failure to take such
         actions would more likely than not result in a violation of its
         fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided that prior to providing
         any nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the
         foregoing proviso, Dime shall have entered into a confidentiality
         agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable to Dime than
         the Confidentiality Agreement. Dime will immediately cease and cause to
         be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted
         before the date of this Agreement with any persons other than
         Washington Mutual with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and will use
         its reasonable best efforts to enforce any confidentiality or similar
         agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Dime will promptly
         (within one Business Day) advise Washington Mutual following receipt of
         any Acquisition Proposal of the substance thereof (including the
         identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal), and will keep
         Washington Mutual apprised of any related developments, discussions and
         negotiations (including the terms and conditions of the Acquisition
         Proposal) on a current basis. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
         prevent Dime or its board of directors from complying with Rule 14d-9
         and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition
         Proposal, provided that such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify
         the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have
         under this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal"
         shall mean any tender or exchange offer, proposal for a merger,
         consolidation or other business combination involving Dime or any of
         its Subsidiaries or any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner more
         than 15% of the voting power in, or more than 15% of the business,
         assets or deposits of, Dime or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As used in this Agreement,
         "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
         which the board of directors of Dime concludes in good faith to be more
         favorable from a financial point of view to its stockholders than the
         Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (1) after
         receiving the advice of its financial advisors (who shall be nationally
         recognized investment banking firms), (2) after taking into account the
         likelihood of consummation of such transaction on the terms set forth
         therein (as compared to, and with due regard for, the terms herein) and
         (3) after taking into account all legal (with the advice of outside
         counsel), financial (including the financing terms of any such
         proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and any other
         relevant factors permitted under applicable law; provided that for
         purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal", the references to
         "more than 15%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be
         deemed to be references to "a majority" and the definition of
         Acquisition Proposal shall only refer to a transaction involving Dime
         and not its Subsidiaries;

              (g) other than in accordance with contracts entered into prior to
         the date of this Agreement which were disclosed to Washington Mutual
         prior to the date hereof or

                                       36

<PAGE>   41


         otherwise in accordance with this Agreement, make (i) any capital
         expenditures relating to technology initiatives (including Internet web
         sites) or (ii) any other capital expenditures in excess of (A) $400,000
         per project or related series of projects or (B) $2,500,000 in the
         aggregate, other than expenditures necessary to maintain existing
         assets in good repair;

              (h) expand its private banking business in any material respect
         or, except in the ordinary course of business, make application for the
         opening, relocation or closing of any, or open, relocate or close any,
         branch office or loan production or servicing facility (provided that
         Dime shall not open any new branch office or loan production or
         servicing facility in any state in which it does not have such
         operations at the date of this Agreement);

              (i) except for Loans or commitments for Loans that have previously
         been approved by Dime prior to the date of this Agreement, (A) make or
         acquire any Loan or issue a commitment for any Loan other than Loans
         made or acquired in the ordinary course of business consistent with
         past practice which have (x) in the case of commercial and commercial
         real estate Loans, (i) a principal balance not in excess of $10,000,000
         and (ii) involve aggregate borrowings by the applicable borrower not in
         excess of $20,000,000, or (y) in the case of Loans for the purchase of
         single-family residences, a principal balance not in excess of
         $1,500,000 unless, in each such case, Dime promptly provides to
         Washington Mutual copies of the approvals for such Loans; provided that
         Washington Mutual may in its reasonable judgment determine to require
         that it consent in advance to Loans of the types referred to in clauses
         (x) or (y)and in such event, Washington Mutual and Dime will work in a
         cooperative manner to establish procedures by which such consent will
         be provided in order to ensure that this consent process does not
         materially interfere with the continued operations of Dime in the
         ordinary course of business consistent with past practice; (B) take any
         action that would result in any discretionary releases of collateral or
         guarantees or otherwise restructure any Loan or commitment for any Loan
         with a principal balance in excess of the respective amounts set forth
         in clause (A) above; or (C) agree to guarantee the obligations of any
         person other than any wholly owned Subsidiary of Dime;

              (j) settle any claim, action or proceeding involving monetary
         damages, except in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
         practice, or agree or consent to the issuance of any injunction,
         decree, order, agreement or judgment restricting its business or
         operations;

              (k) amend its certificate of incorporation, bylaws or similar
         governing documents, or enter into a plan of consolidation, merger,
         share exchange or reorganization with any person (other than
         consolidations, mergers or reorganizations solely among wholly owned
         subsidiaries of Dime), or a letter of intent or agreement in principle
         with respect thereto;

              (l) materially change its investment securities portfolio policy,
         or the manner in which the portfolio is classified or reported;

                                       37

              (m) make any material changes in its policies and practices with
         respect to (i) underwriting, pricing, originating, acquiring, selling,
         servicing, or buying or selling rights to service loans, (ii) hedging
         its loan positions or commitments, or (iii) without prior notice to
         Washington Mutual, pricing of its other products and services;

              (n) take any action that is intended or may reasonably be expected
         to result in any of its representations and warranties set forth in
         this Agreement being or becoming untrue in any material respect at any
         time prior to the Effective Time, or in any of the conditions to the
         Merger set forth in Section 8.1 or 8.2 not being satisfied or in a
         material violation of any provision of this agreement, except, in every
         case, as may be required by applicable law;

              (o) make any changes in its accounting methods or method of Tax
         accounting, practices or policies, except as may be required under law,
         rule, regulation or GAAP, in each case as concurred in by Dime's
         independent public accountants;

              (p) enter into any commercial loan securitizations or create any
         special purpose funding entity;

              (q) enter into any agreement or amend or terminate any agreement
         between Dime or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Warburg
         or any of its affiliates, on the other, in each case other than

         the ordinary course of its banking business;

              (r) introduce any material new products or services, any material

7.   Additional Agreements

         7.1. Regulatory Matters

              (a) Washington Mutual and Dime shall promptly prepare and file
         with the SEC the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the S-4. Each of
         Washington Mutual and Dime shall use reasonable best efforts to have
         the S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
         practicable after such filing, and Dime shall thereafter mail the Proxy
         Statement/ Prospectus to its stockholders.

              (b) Dime acknowledges that Washington Mutual desires to cause at
         or promptly following the Effective Time the merger (the "Second
         Merger") of Dime Savings Bank with and into one of Washington Mutual's
         wholly owned depository institution Subsidiaries to be selected by
         Washington Mutual.

              (c) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the parties
         hereto shall cooperate with each other and use reasonable best efforts
         to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all
         applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as
         practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all
         third parties and Governmental Entities which are necessary or
         advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
         (including without limitation the Merger and the Second Merger) and to
         comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents,
         approvals and authorizations of all such third parties and Governmental
         Entities.

              (d) Washington Mutual and Dime shall, upon request, furnish each
         other with all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries,
         directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be
         reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy
         Statement/Prospectus, the S-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or
         application made by or on behalf of Washington Mutual, Dime or any of
         their

                                       39

<PAGE>   44

         respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with
         the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
         Agreement.

              (e) Washington Mutual and Dime shall promptly advise each other
         upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity whose
         consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions
         contemplated by this Agreement which causes such party to believe that
         there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval
         (as defined in Section 8.1(c) below) will not be obtained or that the
         receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed or conditioned.

         7.2. Access to Information

              (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating
         to the exchange of information, Dime shall, and shall cause each of its
         Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants,
         counsel and other Representatives of Washington Mutual access, during
         normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to
         all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and to
         its officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other
         representatives, in each case in a manner not unreasonably disruptive
         to the operation of the business of Dime and its Subsidiaries, and,
         during such period, Dime shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
         make available to Washington Mutual (i) a copy of each report,
         schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received
         by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of Federal
         securities laws or Federal or state banking, mortgage lending, real
         estate or consumer finance or protection laws (other than reports or
         documents which Dime is not permitted to disclose under applicable law)
         and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and
         personnel as such other party may reasonably request. Neither Dime nor
         any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to
         disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or
         prejudice the rights of its customers, jeopardize the attorney-client
         privilege of the institution in possession or control of such
         information or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment,
         decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the
         date of this Agreement or in the ordinary course of business consistent
         with past practice. The parties hereto will make appropriate and
         reasonable substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
         which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

              (b) Washington Mutual shall hold all information furnished by Dime
         or any of its Subsidiaries or representatives pursuant to Section
         7.2(a) in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with,
         the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated May 2, 2001,
         between Washington Mutual and Dime (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

              (c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
         Representatives shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants
         or agreements of the other set forth herein.

         7.3. Stockholder Approval

              (a) Dime shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice
         of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as
         practicable following

                                       40

<PAGE>   45

the date upon which the Form S-4 becomes effective (the "Dime Stockholders
Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the required vote of the holders of Dime
Common Stock with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and, subject to Section 7.3(b), shall take all lawful action to solicit the
adoption of this Agreement by such stockholders. The Board of Directors of Dime
shall recommend adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of Dime and shall
not (x) withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Washington Mutual
such recommendation or (y) take any other action or make any other public
statement in connection with the Dime Stockholders Meeting inconsistent with
such recommendation (collectively, a "Change in Dime Recommendation"), except as
and to the extent expressly permitted by Section 7.3(b). Notwithstanding any
Change in Dime Recommendation, this Agreement shall be submitted to the
stockholders of Dime at the Dime Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of
adopting this Agreement and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve
Dime of such obligation. In addition to the foregoing, Dime shall not submit to
the vote of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger.

              (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing Dime and its Board of Directors
         shall be permitted to effect a Change in Dime Recommendation, if and
         only to the extent that:

                   (i) Dime's Board of Directors, based on the advice of its
              outside counsel, determines in good faith that failure to take
              such action would result in a violation of its fiduciary duties
              under applicable law, and

                   (ii) If the Board of Directors of Dime intends to effect a
              Change in Dime Recommendation following an Acquisition Proposal,
              prior to effecting such Change in Dime Recommendation, (A) Dime
              shall have complied in all material respects with Section 6.2(f),
              (B) the Board of Directors of Dime shall have concluded in good
              faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
              Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments which may
              be offered by Washington Mutual pursuant to clause (D) below, (C)
              Dime shall notify Washington Mutual, at least five Business Days
              in advance, of its intention to effect a Change in Dime
              Recommendation in response to such Superior Proposal, specifying
              the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal
              and furnishing to Washington Mutual a copy of the relevant
              proposed transaction agreements with the party making such
              Superior Proposal and other material documents, and (D) prior to
              effecting such a Change in Dime Recommendation, Dime shall, and
              shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, during the period
              following Dime's delivery of the notice referred to in clause (C)
              above, negotiate with Washington Mutual in good faith (to the
              extent Washington Mutual desires to negotiate) to make such
              adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that
              such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
              Proposal.

         7.4. Legal Conditions to Merger.

              (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of
         Washington Mutual and Dime shall, and shall cause their respective
         Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (i) to take, or
         cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper

                                       41

<PAGE>   46

         or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements which may
         be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger
         and, subject to the conditions set forth in Section 8 hereof, to
         consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) to
         obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any consent,
         authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any
         Governmental Entity and any other third party which is required to be
         obtained by Dime or Washington Mutual or any of their respective
         Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
         contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that no party shall
         be required to take any action pursuant to the foregoing sentence if
         the taking of such action or the obtaining of such consents,
         authorizations, orders, approvals or exemptions is reasonably likely to
         result in a condition or restriction having an effect of the type
         referred to in Section 8.2(c).

              (b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of
         Washington Mutual and Dime agrees to use reasonable best efforts to
         take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
         done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
         effective, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the
         transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, using
         reasonable best efforts to (i) modify or amend any contracts, plans or
         arrangements to which Washington Mutual or Dime is a party (to the
         extent permitted by the terms thereof) if necessary in order to satisfy
         the conditions to closing set forth in Section 8 hereof, (ii) lift or
         rescind any injunction or restraining order or other order adversely
         affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions
         contemplated hereby, and (iii) defend any litigation seeking to enjoin,
         prevent or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
         hereby or seeking material damages.

         7.5. Affiliates. Dime shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
each director, executive officer and other person who is an "affiliate" (for
purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of Dime to deliver to Washington
Mutual, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and in any
event prior to the date of the stockholders meeting called by Dime pursuant to
Section 7.3 hereof, a written agreement, in the form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Washington Mutual, relating to required transfer restrictions on
the Washington Mutual Common Stock received by them in the Merger pursuant to
Rule 145.

         7.6. Stock Exchange Listing. Washington Mutual shall use its best
efforts to cause the shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock to be issued in
the Merger, to each Warrant Holder pursuant to the Voting/Purchase Agreement and
to LTW holders pursuant to the Warrant Agreement to be approved for listing on
the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

         7.7. Employees; Employee Benefit Plans

              (a) The benefits to be provided to employees of Dime and its
         Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time ("Covered Employees") shall be
         the benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Washington
         Mutual, which shall be so provided as soon as practicable after the
         Effective Time, but in no event later than the date the Covered
         Employees are placed on the same payroll service as such employees of
         Washington Mutual; provided, however, that until such time that the
         Covered Employees are placed on the same payroll service as such
         employees of Washington Mutual, Washington Mutual shall, or shall cause
         its Subsidiaries to provide benefits no less

                                       42

<PAGE>   47

favorable, in the aggregate, than the benefits provided to similarly situated
employees under Washington Mutual's plans, programs and arrangements. Washington
Mutual shall, from and after the Effective Time, (i) comply with the contractual
commitments of Dime to its current and former employees in accordance with their
terms and honor all employee benefit obligations to current and former employees
of Dime and its Subsidiaries under the applicable contractual commitment, (ii)
provide Covered Employees credit for the most recent period of uninterrupted
service (including any bridging or prior service credit, without regard to
whether there has been an interruption in service, solely to the extent provided
by Dime and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof) with Dime or any of its
Subsidiaries (and their predecessors) prior to the Effective Time for all
purposes under employee benefit plans of Washington Mutual or its Subsidiaries
(including for purposes of benefit accrual), (iii) cause any and all
pre-existing condition limitations (to the extent such limitations did not apply
to a pre-existing condition under comparable Plans) and eligibility waiting
periods under group health plans of Washington Mutual to be waived with respect
to Covered Employees (and their eligible dependents) who become participants in
such group health plans and (iv) use reasonable efforts to give credit for or
otherwise take into account the out-of-pocket expenses and annual expense
limitations paid by each Covered Employee under the comparable Plans for the
year in which the Effective Time occurs; provided, however, that no credits for
service as described in clause (ii) above shall be permitted if to do so would
result in duplication of benefits under such plans. From and after the Effective
Time, Washington Mutual shall honor all vacation and paid time off of the
Covered Employees accrued as of the Effective Time, in accordance with the Dime
policy as in effect on the date hereof. Except as otherwise prohibited under
this Section 7.7, nothing in this Section 7.7 shall be interpreted as preventing
Washington Mutual or its Subsidiaries from amending, modifying or terminating
any Plans or other contracts, arrangements, commitments or understandings, in a
manner consistent with their terms and applicable law.

         (b) Subject to applicable law and the amendment provisions of any
defined contribution plans maintained by Dime or its Subsidiaries (the "401(k)
Plans"), Dime agrees to amend the 401(k) Plans prior to the Effective Time so
that new participant loans are no longer available as of the Effective Time.

         (c) Dime shall be permitted to pay up to an aggregate of $8 million as
retention bonuses to such employees of Dime or any of its Subsidiaries as Dime
may determine (but not including any employees who are parties to any individual
employment or change in control agreements), with such bonus amounts payable on
the earlier of the first anniversary of the Effective Time or the date the
eligible employee's employment is terminated by Dime or Washington Mutual or any
of their Subsidiaries.

         (d) With respect to the Severance Pay Program for Employees of Dime and
Participating Subsidiaries (including the programs in place for Non-Officers,
Vice Presidents or lower, and Senior Vice President), as soon as practicable
after the date hereof but in any event prior to the Effective Time, Dime shall,
or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, amend such plans to provide that the
payments to be made to any participants therein shall only be made in a lump sum
cash amount, and in no event shall Dime provide the participants the right to
elect to receive such payments in the form of an annuity. In addition, as soon
as practicable after the date hereof but in any event prior to the Effective
Time, Dime shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best
efforts to cause Covered Employees who are parties to employment, change-in-

                                       43

<PAGE>   48

control or severance agreements (which have been previously disclosed to
Washington Mutual on Section 4.11(a) of the Dime Disclosure Schedule) to agree
to receive any severance or other related payments thereunder, which would
otherwise be paid in the form of an annuity, in a lump sum payment within thirty
(30) days after the date such payments would otherwise commence (or, if such
payments have already commenced, after the date of such amendment); provided,
however, that all such Covered Employees shall continue to be entitled to all
other rights and benefits to which they are previously entitled under any such
agreements, which shall remain in full force and effect, as modified to take
into account solely the provisions described herein; and provided, further,
however, that in no event shall any such amendments be made to those agreements
pursuant to which any Covered Employee is entitled to receive an amount payable
either (i) in respect of a covenant not to solicit or (ii) expressly not in
respect of any severance obligation.

         (e) With respect to the Dime Employee Stock Purchase Plan, Dime shall
take all actions necessary to cause the offering period commencing on July 1,
2001 under such plan to terminate effective prior to the Effective Time, and
Washington Mutual shall provide that all Covered Employees shall, effective as
of the Effective Time, be eligible to participate in the Washington Mutual
Employee Stock Purchase Plan, on the same terms and conditions as similarly
situated employees of Washington Mutual.

         (f) With respect to the Committee as defined under the Employee
Umbrella Trusts (the "Employee Committee") and the Committee as defined under
the Director Umbrella Trust (the "Director Committee"), prior to the Effective
Time, Dime shall cause all actions necessary to be taken to provide that at and
following the Effective Time, each such committee shall be made up of three
members, selected as follows: (i) two of the members of the Employee Committee
shall be current senior executive officers of Dime and two of the members of the
Director Committee shall be nonemployee directors of Dime (and each such
committee member, a "Dime Member"), in each case selected by the Employee
Committee (or Director Committee, as applicable) as constituted immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) the third member of the Employee Committee
and the Director Committee shall be selected by Washington Mutual. In addition,
in the event that a Dime Member ceases to serve on the Employee Committee (or
Director Committee, as applicable), he or she shall be permitted to designate
his or her successor (or, in the case of his or her death or disability, the
other remaining Dime Member shall be permitted to so designate).

         7.8. Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

              (a) From and after the Effective Time, in the event of any claim,
         action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or
         administrative, including, without limitation, any such claim, action,
         suit, proceeding or investigation in which any person who is now, or
         has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who
         becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer or employee of
         Dime or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") is, or is
         threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising
         in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or
         was a director, officer or employee of Dime, any of its Subsidiaries or
         any of their respective predecessors or was prior to the Effective Time
         serving at the request of any such party as a director, officer,
         employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation,

                                       44

<PAGE>   49

         partnership, trust or other enterprise (a list of which directors,
         officers and employees of Dime or any of its Subsidiaries who as of the
         date of this Agreement are serving in any such capacity with another
         corporation, trust, partnership, trust or other enterprise is set forth
         in Section 7.8(a) of the Dime Disclosure Schedule) or (ii) this
         Agreement, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and all
         actions taken by an Indemnified Party in connection herewith, whether
         in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time,
         Washington Mutual shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the
         fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each such Indemnified Party
         against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses
         (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses in advance of the
         final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to
         each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by law upon
         receipt of an undertaking, to the extent required by law, from such
         Indemnified Party to repay such advanced expenses if it is determined
         by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
         jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to
         indemnification hereunder), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
         settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual claim,
         action, suit, proceeding or investigation). Any Indemnified Party
         wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 7.8, upon learning
         of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall
         notify Washington Mutual thereof, provided that the failure to so
         notify shall not affect the obligations of Washington Mutual under this
         Section 7.8 except (and only) to the extent such failure to notify
         materially prejudices Washington Mutual.

              (b) Without limiting any of the obligations under paragraph (a) of
         this Section 7.8, Washington Mutual agrees that all rights to
         indemnification and all limitations of liability existing in favor of
         the Indemnified Parties as provided in Dime's Certificate of
         Incorporation or Bylaws or in the corresponding constituent documents
         of any of Dime's Subsidiaries as in effect as of the date of this
         Agreement with respect to matters occurring on or prior to the
         Effective Time shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
         force and effect thereafter, without any amendment thereto; provided,
         however, that nothing contained in this Section 7.8(b) shall be deemed
         to preclude the liquidation, consolidation or merger of Dime or any
         Subsidiary thereof, in which case all of such rights to indemnification
         and limitations on liability shall be deemed to so survive and continue
         notwithstanding any such liquidation, consolidation or merger and shall
         constitute rights which may be asserted against Washington Mutual.
         Nothing contained in this Section 7.8(b) shall be deemed to preclude
         any rights to indemnification or limitations on liability provided in
         Washington Mutual's Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws or the similar
         governing documents of any of Washington Mutual's Subsidiaries with
         respect to matters occurring subsequent to the Effective Time to the
         extent that the provisions establishing such rights or limitations are
         not otherwise amended to the contrary.

              (c) Washington Mutual shall use its best efforts to cause the
         persons serving as officers and directors of Dime immediately prior to
         the Effective Time to be covered for a period of six (6) years from the
         Closing Date by the directors' and officers' liability insurance policy
         or policies maintained by Washington Mutual (provided that Washington
         Mutual's policy or policies provide at least the same coverage and
         amounts containing terms and conditions which are in the aggregate no
         less advantageous to such directors and officers of Dime than the terms
         and conditions of the existing directors' and

                                       45

<PAGE>   50

         officers' liability insurance policy of Dime, and provided further that
         in no event will Washington Mutual be required to expend in any one
         year an amount in excess of 200% of the annual premiums currently paid
         by Dime for such insurance (the "Insurance Amount"), and further
         provided, that if Washington Mutual is unable to maintain or obtain the
         insurance called for by this Section 7.8(c) as a result of the
         preceding proviso, Washington Mutual shall use its reasonable best
         efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as available for the
         Insurance Amount) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to
         the Effective Time which were committed by such officers and directors
         in their capacity as such. The provisions of this Section 7.8 are
         intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
         Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

         7.9. Advice of Changes; Other Matters

              (a) Washington Mutual and Dime shall promptly advise the other
         party of any change or event which, individually or in the aggregate
         with other such changes or events, has a Material Adverse Effect on it
         or which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or
         constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties
         or covenants contained herein.

              (b) Dime will use all reasonable best efforts to implement, within
         30 days after the date of this Agreement, procedures developed jointly
         by the parties to ensure compliance with state and local consumer
         protection laws relating to its retail subprime loan origination and
         servicing businesses.

         7.10. Subsequent Interim and Annual Financial Statements.

              (a) As soon as reasonably available, but in no event more than 45
         days after the end of each fiscal quarter (other than the fourth
         quarter of a fiscal year) or 90 days after the end of each fiscal year
         ending after the date of this Agreement, each party will deliver to the
         other party its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or its Annual Report on
         Form 10-K, as the case may be, as filed with the SEC under the Exchange
         Act.

              (b) As soon as reasonably practicable and as soon as they are
         available, but in no event more than 30 days, after the end of each
         calendar month ending after the date of this Agreement, Dime shall
         furnish to Washington Mutual (i) consolidated and consolidating
         financial statements (including balance sheet, statement of operations
         and stockholders' equity) of Dime and each of its Subsidiaries as of
         and for such month then ended, (ii) servicing reports regarding cash
         flows, delinquencies and foreclosures on asset pools serviced or master
         serviced by Dime or any of its Subsidiaries, and (iii) any internal
         management reports relating to the foregoing. All information furnished
         by Dime to Washington Mutual pursuant to this Section 7.10(b) shall be
         held in confidence by Washington Mutual to the extent required by, and
         in accordance with, the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

         7.11. Reorganization. Neither Washington Mutual nor Dime shall take, or
cause or permit any of its Subsidiaries to take, any action that could
reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

                                       46

<PAGE>   51

         7.12. Exemption From Liability Under Section 16(b). Assuming that Dime
delivers to Washington Mutual the Section 16 Information (as defined below)
reasonably in advance of the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of
Washington Mutual, or a committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such
term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall
reasonably promptly thereafter and in any event prior to the Effective Time
adopt a resolution providing that the receipt by the Dime Insiders (as defined
below) of Washington Mutual Common Stock in exchange for shares of Dime Common
Stock, and of options to purchase Washington Mutual Common Stock upon conversion
of Dime Options, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby
and to the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information
provided by Dime to Washington Mutual prior to the Effective Time, are intended
to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act
such that any such receipt shall be so exempt. "Section 16 Information" shall
mean information accurate in all respects regarding the Dime Insiders, the
number of shares of Dime Common Stock held by each such Dime Insider and the
number and description of the Dime Options held by each such Dime Insider. "Dime
Insiders" shall mean those officers and directors of Dime who are subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and who are listed
in the Section 16 Information.

         7.13. Warrant Agreement Assumption. Washington Mutual shall enter into
an agreement with the Warrant Agent confirming the rights of holders of LTWs as
provided in Section 4.2(d) of the Warrant Agreement. Washington Mutual shall use
its best efforts to maintain the trading designation of the LTWs on the Nasdaq
Stock Market.

         7.14. Board of Directors. At or promptly following the Effective Time,
Washington Mutual shall take all action necessary to appoint one member of
Dime's Board of Directors, selected by Washington Mutual after consultation with
Dime, to Washington Mutual's board of directors.

         7.15. Insider Loan Disclosure. Within 30 days after the date of this
Agreement Dime shall prepare and deliver to Washington Mutual a schedule setting
forth the following information as of a date not more than 15 days prior to such
date of delivery: (i) all evidences of indebtedness reflected as assets on the
books and records of Dime and its Subsidiaries ("Loans") by Dime and its
Subsidiaries to executive officers (as such term is defined in Part 215 of Title
12 of the Code of Federal Regulations) of Dime or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii)
any such Loans to any employee, officer, director or other affiliate on which
the borrower is paying a rate other than that reflected in the note or the
relevant credit agreement or on which the borrower is paying a rate which was
below market at the time the Loan was made; and (iii) any such Loans which were
not made in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal laws
and regulations.

         7.16. Insurance Disclosure. Within 30 days after the date of this
Agreement Dime shall prepare and deliver to Washington Mutual a schedule setting
forth the following information as of a date not more than 15 days prior to such
date of delivery: a true and complete list and a brief description (including
name of insurer, agent, coverage and expiration date) of all insurance policies
in force with respect to the business and assets of Dime and its Subsidiaries
(other than insurance policies under which Dime or any Subsidiary thereof is
named as a loss payee, insured

                                       47

or additional insured as a result of its position as a secured lender on
specific loans and mortgage insurance policies on specific loans).

         7.17. Management Consultation Meetings and Distribution of Information.

Mutual) responsible for the integration of Washington Mutual and Dime, shall
confer on a regular basis regarding the business and operations of Washington
Mutual and Dime.


         7.18. Redesign of Branches. Dime shall cooperate with Washington Mutual
and use reasonable efforts to take all actions, in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of business, necessary to facilitate the
redesign of Dime's branch offices with the view toward obtaining all necessary
permits and completing all other steps reasonably necessary for construction, at
Washington Mutual's direction and expense, to begin as promptly as possible
after the Closing Date.

8.   Conditions Precedent

         8.1. Conditions to Each Party's Obligation to Effect the Merger. The
respective obligations of each party to effect the Merger shall be subject to
the satisfaction at or prior to the Effective Time of the following conditions:

              (a) Stockholder Approval. The agreement of merger contained in
         this Agreement shall have been approved and adopted by the requisite
         affirmative vote of the stockholders of Dime entitled to vote thereon.

              (b) NYSE Listing. The shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock to
         be issued to the holders of Dime Common Stock upon consummation of the
         Merger, to each Warrant Holder in respect of the Deemed Shares in
         accordance with the terms of the Voting/Purchase Agreement and to LTW
         holders in accordance with the Warrant Agreement shall have been
         authorized for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of
         issuance.

              (c) Other Approvals. All regulatory approvals required to
         consummate the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been
         obtained and shall remain in full force and effect and all statutory
         waiting periods in respect thereof shall have expired or been
         terminated (all such approvals and the expiration or termination of all
         such waiting periods being referred to herein as the "Requisite
         Regulatory Approvals").

              (d) S-4 Effectiveness. The S-4 shall have become effective under
         the Securities Act, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
         S-4 shall have been issued and no proceedings for that purpose shall
         have been initiated or threatened by the SEC.

              (e) No Injunctions or Restraints; Illegality. No order, injunction

<PAGE>   53

         prohibition (an "Injunction") preventing the consummation of the Merger
         or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
         be in effect. No statute, rule, regulation, order, injunction or decree
         shall have been enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced by any
         Governmental Entity which prohibits or makes illegal the consummation
         of the Merger.

         8.2. Conditions to Obligations of Washington Mutual. The obligations of
Washington Mutual to effect the Merger are also subject to the satisfaction or
waiver by Washington Mutual at or prior to the Effective Time of the following
conditions:

              (a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and
         warranties of Dime set forth in this Agreement shall be true and
         correct in all respects as of the date of this Agreement and (except to
         the extent such representations and warranties speak as of an earlier
         date) as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing
         Date; provided, however, that for purposes of determining the
         satisfaction of this condition, no effect shall be given to any
         exception in such representations and warranties relating to
         materiality or a Material Adverse Effect, and instead, for purposes of
         this condition, such representations and warranties (other than the
         representations and warranties contained in Section 4.2(a), which shall
         be true and correct in all material respects) shall be deemed to be
         true and correct in all respects unless the failure or failures of such
         representations and warranties to be so true and correct, individually
         or in the aggregate, results or would reasonably be expected to result
         in a Material Adverse Effect on Dime. Washington Mutual shall have
         received a certificate signed on behalf of Dime by the Chief Executive
         Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Dime to the foregoing effect.

              (b) Performance of Obligations of Dime. Dime shall have performed
         in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by it
         under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date, and Washington
         Mutual shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of Dime by
         the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Dime to
         such effect.

              (c) Burdensome Condition. There shall not be any action taken, or
         any statute, rule, regulation or order enacted, entered, enforced or
         deemed applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
         by any Governmental Entity, in connection with the grant of a Requisite
         Regulatory Approval or otherwise, which imposes any restriction or
         condition which would be reasonably likely to have or result in a
         Material Adverse Effect on the Surviving Company or Washington Mutual.

              (d) Director Resignations. Washington Mutual shall have received
         resignations from each director of each Dime Subsidiary designated by

         of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, counsel to Washington Mutual, dated the
         Closing Date, to the effect that, on the basis of facts,
         representations and assumptions set forth in such opinion, (i) the
         Merger constitutes a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
         368(a) of the Code and (ii) each of Washington Mutual and Dime will be
         a party to that

                                       49

<PAGE>   54

         reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code. In
         rendering its opinion, such counsel may require and rely upon written
         representations from Dime, Washington Mutual and stockholders of Dime.

              (f) Satisfaction of Voting/Purchase Agreement Conditions. All
         conditions precedent to the obligation of Washington Mutual to purchase
         warrants from each Warrant Holder pursuant to the Voting/Purchase
         Agreement shall have been duly satisfied or waived.

         8.3. Conditions To Obligations Of Dime. The obligation of Dime to
effect the Merger is also subject to the satisfaction or waiver by Dime at or
prior to the Effective Time of the following conditions:

              (a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and
         warranties of Washington Mutual set forth in this Agreement shall be
         true and correct in all respects as of the date of this Agreement and
         (except to the extent such representations and warranties speak as of
         an earlier date) as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the
         Closing Date; provided, however, that for purposes of determining the
         satisfaction of this condition, no effect shall be given to any
         exception in such representations and warranties relating to
         materiality or a Material Adverse Effect, and instead, for purposes of
         this condition, such representations and warranties shall be deemed to
         be true and correct in all respects unless the failure or failures of
         such representations and warranties to be so true and correct,
         individually or in the aggregate, results or would reasonably be
         expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Washington Mutual.
         Dime shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of Washington
         Mutual by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer
         of Washington Mutual to the foregoing effect.

              (b) Performance of Obligations of Washington Mutual. Washington
         Mutual shall have performed in all material respects all obligations
         required to be performed by it under this Agreement at or prior to the
         Closing Date, and Dime shall have received a certificate signed on
         behalf of Washington Mutual by the Chief Executive Officer and the
         Chief Financial Officer of Washington Mutual to such effect.

              (c) Tax Opinion. Dime shall have received an opinion of Sullivan &
         Cromwell, counsel to Dime, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that,
         on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth in
         such opinion, (i) the Merger constitutes a "reorganization" within the
         meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, (ii) each of Dime and Washington
         Mutual will be a party to that reorganization within the meaning of
         Section 368(b) of the Code and (iii) subject to customary exceptions
         and, except to the extent of any cash received, no gain or loss will be
         recognized by any of the stockholders of Dime in the Merger. In
         rendering its opinion, such counsel may require and rely upon written
         representations from Dime, Washington Mutual and stockholders of Dime.

<PAGE>   55

              (a) by mutual consent of Washington Mutual and Dime in a written
         instrument, if the Board of Directors of each so determines;

              (b) by either Washington Mutual or Dime if (i) any Governmental
         Entity which must grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied
         approval of the Merger and such denial has become final and
         nonappealable or (ii) any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction
         shall have issued a final nonappealable order enjoining or otherwise
         prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
         Agreement;

              (c) by either Washington Mutual or Dime if the Effective Time
         shall not have occurred on or before April 30, 2002, unless the failure
         of the Effective Time to occur by such date shall be due to the failure
         of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe
         the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;

              (d) by either Washington Mutual or Dime (provided that the
         terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation,
         warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if the other
         party shall have breached (i) any of the covenants or agreements made
         by such other party herein or (ii) any of the representations or
         warranties made by such other party herein, and in either case, such
         breach (x) is not cured within 30 days following written notice to the
         party committing such breach, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be
         cured prior to the Closing and (y) would entitle the non-breaching
         party not to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby under
         Section 8 hereof;

              (e) by either Washington Mutual or Dime if any approval of the
         stockholders of Dime contemplated by this Agreement shall not have been
         obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at the
         Dime Stockholders Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement
         thereof;

              (f) by Washington Mutual if (i) the Board of Directors of Dime
         shall have failed to recommend the Merger, or shall have withdrawn,
         modified or changed in a manner adverse to Washington Mutual its
         recommendation of the Merger (or shall have disclosed its intention to
         withdraw, modify or adversely change such recommendation), (ii) Dime
         shall have breached the terms of Section 6.2(f) hereof in any respect
         adverse to Washington Mutual, or (iii) Dime shall have materially
         breached its obligations under Section 7.3 by failing to call, give
         notice of, convene and hold the Dime Stockholders Meeting in accordance
         with Section 7.3; or

              (g) by Washington Mutual if a tender offer or exchange offer for
         25% or more of the outstanding shares of Dime Common Stock is commenced
         (other than by Washington Mutual or a Subsidiary thereof), and the
         Board of Directors of Dime recommends that the stockholders of Dime
         tender their shares in such tender or exchange offer or otherwise fails
         to recommend that such stockholders reject such tender offer or
         exchange offer within the 10 business day period specified in Rule
         14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act.

              (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either
         Washington Mutual or Dime as provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement
         shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of Washington
         Mutual, Dime, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the
         officers or directors of any of them shall have any liability of any
         nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the transactions
         contemplated hereby, except that (i) Sections 7.2(b), 9.2, and 10.2
         shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii)
         notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
         neither Washington Mutual nor Dime shall be relieved or released from
         any liabilities or damages arising out of its willful breach of any
         provision of this Agreement.

              (b) Dime shall pay Washington Mutual, by wire transfer of
         immediately available funds, the sum of $185 million (the "Termination
         Fee") if this Agreement is terminated as follows:

                   (i) if this Agreement is terminated by Washington Mutual
              pursuant to Sections 9.1(f) or 9.1(g), then Dime shall pay the
              entire Termination Fee on the second Business Day following such
              termination; and

                   (ii) if this Agreement is terminated by (A) Washington Mutual
              pursuant to Section 9.1(d) if the breach giving rise to such
              termination was willful or (B) by either Washington Mutual or Dime
              pursuant to Section 9.1(e) and in any such case an Acquisition
              Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise
              communicated or made known to the senior management or Board of
              Directors of Dime (or any person shall have publicly announced,
              communicated or made known an intention, whether or not
              conditional, to make an Acquisition Proposal) at any time after
              the date of this Agreement and prior to the date of the taking of
              the vote of the stockholders of Dime contemplated by this
              Agreement at the Dime Stockholders Meeting, in the case of clause
              (B), or the date of termination, in the case of clause (A), then
              Dime shall (x) pay Washington Mutual an amount equal to $20
              million on the second Business Day following such termination, and
              (y) if within 18 months after such termination, Dime or any of its
              Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with respect to,
              or consummates, an Acquisition Proposal, then Dime shall pay the
              Termination Fee (net of any payment made pursuant to clause (x)
              above) on the date of such execution or consummation.

              (c) Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to Section 9.2(b)
         shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
         account designated by Washington Mutual.

              (d) Dime and Washington Mutual agree that the agreement contained
         in paragraph (b) above is an integral part of the transactions
         contemplated by this Agreement, that without such agreement Washington
         Mutual would not have entered into this Agreement, and that such
         amounts do not constitute a penalty. If Dime fails to pay Washington
         Mutual the amounts due under paragraph (b) above within the time
         periods

                                       52

<PAGE>   57

         specified in such paragraph (b), Dime shall pay the costs and expenses
         (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by Washington
         Mutual in connection with any action in which Washington Mutual
         prevails, including the filing of any lawsuit, taken to collect payment
         of such amounts, together with interest on the amount of any such
         unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period
         as published in The Wall Street Journal, calculated on a daily basis
         from the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date of
         actual payment.

         9.3. Amendment. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this
Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by
their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of
the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of Dime;
provided, however, that after any approval of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by Dime's stockholders, there may not be, without further
approval of such stockholders, any amendment of this Agreement which reduces the
amount or changes the form of the consideration to be delivered to the Dime
stockholders hereunder other than as contemplated by this Agreement or which
negatively impacts the intended tax treatment of the holders of Dime Common
Stock. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

         9.4. Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto,
(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such
extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of,
or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

10.  General Provisions

         10.1. Nonsurvival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements. None
of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement

therein which by their terms apply in whole or in part after the Effective Time.

                           Attn:  Mitchell S. Eitel

         10.4. Interpretation. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and
words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement, and
Section references are to this Agreement unless otherwise specified. Whenever
the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The table of
contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to require Dime,
Washington Mutual or any of their respective officers, directors, Subsidiaries
or affiliates to take any action which would violate or conflict with any
applicable law (whether statutory or common), rule or regulation. It is agreed
that any disclosure in a particular section of a party's Disclosure Schedule
shall be deemed disclosed in respect of any other section thereof to the extent
it is readily apparent that such disclosure is applicable to such other section.

         10.5. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all
of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have

                                       54

<PAGE>   59

been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being
understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.

         10.6. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with the documents and
the instruments referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, other than the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive the execution and delivery of
this Agreement to the extent provided in Section 7.2(b).

         10.7. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, without regard to any
applicable conflicts of law provisions (except to the extent that mandatory
provisions of federal law or the DGCL are applicable).

         10.8. Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable
in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent
of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or
unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting
the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this
Agreement in any other jurisdiction, and if any provision of this Agreement is
determined to be so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable, in all cases so long as
neither the economic nor legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby
is affected in any manner materially adverse to any party or its stockholders.
Upon any such determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith in an
effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to effect the
original intent of the parties.

         10.9. Publicity. Washington Mutual and Dime shall consult with each
other before issuing any press release with respect to the Merger or this
Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement without the prior consent of the other party, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that a party may, without the prior
consent of the other party (but after prior consultation, to the extent
practicable in the circumstances) issue such press release or make such public
statement as may upon the advice of outside counsel be required by law or the
rules and regulations of the NYSE. Without limiting the reach of the preceding
sentence, Washington Mutual and Dime shall cooperate to develop all public
announcement materials and (b) make appropriate management available at
presentations related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
reasonably requested by the other party. In addition, Dime and its Subsidiaries
shall (a) consult with Washington Mutual regarding communications with
customers, stockholders, prospective investors and employees related to the
transactions contemplated hereby, (b) provide Washington Mutual with stockholder
lists of Dime and (c) allow and facilitate Washington Mutual contact with
stockholders of Dime and other prospective investors.

         10.10. Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries. Neither this Agreement
nor any of the rights, interests or obligations of any party hereunder shall be
assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of the other party. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and permitted

                                       55

assigns. Except as otherwise specifically provided in Section 7.8 hereof, this
Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) is not
intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder.
