the enforcement by the Buyer of any such covenant. It is understood by the Parties that the covenants contained in this Article X have no independent value, but are essential elements of this Agreement and that, but for the agreement of the Sellers
to comply with such covenants, the Buyer would not have agreed to enter into this Agreement. In the event that the Buyer seeks a remedy with respect to Damages for any breach of this Article X, the absence of any portion of the Purchase Price
allocated by the Parties to the foregoing covenants shall not be considered a measure of or a limit on such Damages. Each Seller and the Buyer have independently consulted with their respective counsel and have been advised concerning the
reasonableness and propriety of such covenants with specific regard to the nature of the business conducted by the Buyer. Each Seller hereby agrees that all covenants contained in this Article X are material, reasonable and valid and waive all
defenses to the strict enforcement hereof by the Buyer. The covenants in this Article X are severable and separate, and the unenforceability of any specific covenant shall not affect the provisions of any other covenant. Moreover, in the event that
any court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that the scope, time or territorial restrictions set forth are unreasonable, then it is the intention of the Parties that such restrictions be enforced to the fullest extent which the court deems
reasonable, and the Agreement shall thereby be reformed. The covenants contained in this Article X shall not be affected by any breach of any other provision of this Agreement by any Party hereto and shall have no effect if the transactions
