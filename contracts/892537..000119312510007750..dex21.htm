(iii) each of the undersigned holders of the Companys Common Stock
(individually, a " _Seller_ " and collectively, the " _Sellers_ "), and (iv)
Michael Gualario, in his capacity as the Sellers Representative. Each Person
named in (ii) and (iii) above is referred to herein individually as a "
_Seller Party_ " and collectively as the " _Seller Parties_." The Buyer, the
Company, the Sellers and the Sellers Representative are referred to herein
individually as a " _Party_ " and collectively as the " _Parties_." The
capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein have the
meanings given to such terms as set forth in _Appendix A_ hereto.

WHEREAS, the Sellers are the record and beneficial owners of all of the
issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company; and

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the
Buyer desires to purchase from the Sellers and the Sellers desire to sell to
the Buyer all of the issued and outstanding capital stock and other equity
securities of the Company (the " _Stock Purchase_ ").

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises
herein made, and in consideration of the representations, warranties, and
covenants herein contained, the Parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES

1.1 _Stock Purchase_. On the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, for the consideration specified in Section 1.2, the Buyer agrees
to purchase from each of the Sellers, and each of the Sellers agrees to sell
to the Buyer, the shares of capital stock of the Company owned by such
Sellers, free and clear of all Encumbrances, other than restrictions of
general applicability imposed by federal or state securities laws, which
shares collectively constitute and shall constitute as of the Closing Date all
of the issued and outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Company. 

1.2 _Purchase Price_. The purchase price for the Shares shall be Two Hundred
Forty-Two Million Dollars ($242,000,000), subject to the terms and conditions
set forth herein, including, without limitation, the Purchase Price
adjustments contemplated by Section 1.4 (the " _Purchase Price_ "). The
Purchase Price _less_ the amount to be escrowed pursuant to Section 1.3
hereof (the " _Closing Payment_ ") shall be paid by the Buyer to the Sellers
at the Closing in cash by the delivery to the Sellers of immediately available
funds in the respective ownership percentages set forth on _Schedule 1.2_
next to each Sellers name.

1.3 _Escrow_. On the Closing Date, the Sellers Representative, the Buyer and
TD Bank, N.A. (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), shall enter into an Escrow Agreement
in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). The
Buyer shall withhold Twenty-Four Million Two Hundred Thousand Dollars
($24,200,000) (the " _Escrow Amount_ ") from the Purchase Price and deposit
such amount into one or more interest-bearing escrow accounts pursuant to the
terms of   the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement to
the contrary, the Escrow Funds will secure the payment of (a) the Purchase
Price adjustments, if any, pursuant to Section 1.4 and (b) the indemnity
obligations of the Sellers pursuant to Article IX. The Escrow Agreement sets
forth the terms upon which disbursements shall be made by the Escrow Agent.

1.4 _Purchase Price Adjustments_.

(a) Three (3) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the Company
shall finalize an Estimated Working Capital Statement, which shall be subject
to the approval of the Buyer, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. The Closing Payment to be paid at the Closing shall be
reduced by the following amounts, if any, as set forth on the Estimated
Working Capital Statement: (i) the amount of any Indebtedness for Borrowed
Money and (ii) the amount of any Transaction Costs. The Closing Payment to be
paid at Closing shall also be reduced by the amount of the Estimated Working
Capital Deficit, if any, or increased by the amount of the Estimated Working
Capital Surplus, if any. Such adjustments shall be referred to herein
collectively as the " _Estimated Adjustment_." The Estimated Adjustment shall
be determined without regard to the limitations set forth in Section 9.3
hereof.

(b) At least two (2) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the
Parties shall agree upon a flow of funds memorandum which shall set forth all
payments required to be made by or on behalf of all Parties at the Closing,
including for each such payment an identification of the payor, the payee, the
amount and the wire transfer information.

(c) Within one hundred twenty (120) days following the Closing Date, the Buyer
shall furnish the Sellers Representative with a statement that shall set
forth the Indebtedness for Borrowed Money, the Transaction Costs and the
Closing Working Capital (the " _Closing Working Capital Statement_ "), and a
schedule based upon the Closing Working Capital Statement setting forth any
adjustments to the Estimated Adjustment based on variances as between the
Estimated Working Capital and the Closing Working Capital (collectively, the "
_Closing Adjustment_ "). The Sellers Representative shall assist the Buyer
in the preparation of the Closing Working Capital Statement if reasonably
requested by the Buyer and the Buyer shall promptly respond to any reasonable
requests for information from the Sellers Representative regarding the
preparation of the Closing Working Capital Statement. The Parties acknowledge
that the sole purpose of the determination of Closing Working Capital is to
adjust the Purchase Price so as to reflect the difference, if any, between
the Estimated Adjustment and the Closing Adjustment for purposes of this
Section 1.4.

(d) The Sellers Representative shall have a period of thirty (30) days after
receipt of the Closing Working Capital Statement and Closing Adjustment to
notify the Buyer of its election to accept or reject the Closing Working
Capital Statement and/or the Closing Adjustment. In the case of a rejection,
such notice must contain the reasons for such rejection in reasonable detail
and must set forth the amount of the requested adjustment. In the event no
notice is received by the Buyer during such thirty (30) day period, the
Closing Working Capital Statement and the Closing Adjustment shall be deemed
accepted by the Sellers Representative and final and binding on the Parties
hereto for purposes of this Section 1.4. In the event that the Sellers
Representative shall timely reject the Closing Working Capital Statement
and/or the Closing Adjustment, the Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall
promptly (and in any event   within thirty (30) days following the date upon which the Sellers
Representative shall reject the Closing Working Capital Statement and/or
Closing Adjustment), attempt to make a joint determination of the Closing
Adjustment and such determination and any required adjustments resulting
therefrom shall be final and binding on the Parties hereto for purposes of
this Section 1.4.

(e) In the event the Sellers Representative and the Buyer shall be unable to
agree upon a joint determination of the Closing Adjustment within one hundred
eighty (180) days from the Closing Date, then within one hundred ninety (190)
days from the Closing Date, the Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall
submit the dispute to the Accounting Firm. The Buyer and the Sellers
Representative shall furnish to the Accounting Firm such work papers and other
documents and information related to the disputed issues as the Accounting
Firm may request and are available to that Party (or its independent
accountant), and each Party shall be afforded the opportunity to present to
the Accounting Firm any materials related to such issues and to discuss the
same with the Accounting Firm. The Buyer and the Sellers Representative
shall request that the Accounting Firm render its determination prior to the
expiration of two hundred forty (240) days from the Closing Date and such
determination and any required adjustments resulting therefrom shall be final
and binding on all the Parties hereto for purposes of this Section 1.4. The
obligation to pay the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be
allocated between the Buyer, on the one hand, and/or the Sellers, on the other
hand, based upon the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not
awarded to each party bears to the amount actually contested by such party, as
determined by the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm may consider only those
items and amounts comprising the Closing Adjustment that are in dispute, and
shall make no other determination.

(f) If the Closing Adjustment as finally determined in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 1.4 is in the Buyers favor, the Buyer and the
Sellers Representative shall within two (2) Business Days after such
determination execute joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse the amount thereof, together with
interest accrued thereon from the Closing Date to the date of payment at an
annual rate equal to the Prime Rate, to the Buyer in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement. If the Closing Adjustment as finally determined in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.4 is in the Sellers favor,
the amount thereof shall be paid, together with interest accrued thereon from
the Closing Date to the date of payment at an annual rate equal to the Prime
Rate, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price by the Buyer to the Sellers by
wire transfer of immediately available funds within seven (7) days after such
determination.

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary and
except for disputes based upon claims of fraud, this Section 1.4 shall
constitute the sole remedy of the Parties with respect to any dispute
regarding the computation of the Closing Working Capital Statement, the
Purchase Price adjustments or the amounts thereof. For purposes of
clarification, subject to Section 9.3(j), the limitation set forth in the
preceding sentence shall in no way restrict the Buyers ability to obtain a
remedy for any breach of any of the representations and warranties set forth
in Article III.

 

1.5 _Cash Retention_. Prior to the finalization of the Estimated Working
Capital Statement, the Company shall comply with the restrictions set forth
in Section 6.2(l); provided, however,   that the Company shall be entitled to declare and pay cash dividends to the
Sellers to the extent required to enable Sellers to pay Federal, state and/or
local income Taxes that result from net income of the Company (or reasonable
estimates thereof) being passed through to the Sellers. From and after the
finalization of the Estimated Working Capital Statement and until the later of
(x) the close of business on the day preceding the Closing Date and (y) the
finalization of the Estimated Working Capital Statement, the Company shall be
entitled to declare and pay cash dividends to the Sellers, but only to the
extent that the such dividends do not cause the Target Working Capital to
exceed the Estimated Working Capital.

1.6 _Senior Executive Employment Agreements_. Upon the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, the forms of employment agreements between the Buyer and
the Sellers attached hereto as _Exhibits B-1_ and _B-2_ (each, an " _Executive
Employment Agreement_ ") shall be final and complete in all respects. At the
Closing, each of Buyer, the Company and the Sellers shall execute and deliver
the Executive Employment Agreement(s) to which it or he, as applicable, is to
be a party to the other parties thereto.

ordinary course of business, provided that such receivables are not related
to any claims or disputes that reasonably would impair collection and are
reasonably collectible). Except as disclosed on _Schedule 3.5(b)(ii)_ , no
Person has any Encumbrance on such receivables or any part thereof, and no
agreement for deduction, free goods, discount or other deferred price or
quantity adjustment has been made by the Company with respect to any such

the Company, or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened to do so, and to the
Companys Knowledge, there has been no written or oral communication, fact,
event or action which exists or has occurred which would reasonably indicate
that any material customer of the Company would do so, whether as a result of

basis; and (vii) material information regarding the operations of the   Company and its financial condition is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys management, including its principal executive and financial
officers. Except as disclosed on _Schedule 3.5(d)_ , there are no significant
deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting that could reasonably be expected to
materially and adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process,

Liabilities, except Liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business of
the Company or (iii) taken any action, omitted any action or entered into any

the Companys Knowledge could reasonably be expected to have, any liability

liability under such Title. No Benefit Plan is subject to Section 412, 430,
431 or 432 of the Code or Title IV or Section 302, 303, 304 or 305 of ERISA.
None of the assets of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate are subject to

administrator thereof has engaged in a transaction in connection with which
the Company, any ERISA Affiliate, any of the Benefit Plans or any such trust,
could reasonably be expected to, directly or indirectly, be subject to any
material civil liability or penalty pursuant to Title I of ERISA, a material
tax imposed pursuant to Chapter 43 of the Code, or any other material
liability.

(e) All contributions required to have been made under the terms of any
Benefit Plan or pursuant to ERISA and the Code have been timely made and all
obligations in respect of each Benefit Plan have been properly accrued and
reflected in the Financial Statements.

(f) None of the Benefit Plans is, and neither the Company, nor any ERISA
Affiliate has ever contributed to or had an obligation to contribute to or
incurred any liability in respect of, any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA), a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (as
defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA), or a single employer plan that has two or
more contributing sponsors, at least two of whom are not under common control,
within the meaning of Section 4063(a) of ERISA. Except as set forth on
Exhibit 3.8(a), no Benefit Plan is maintained in the name and on behalf of the
Company through a human resources and benefits outsourcing entity,
professional employer organization, or other similar vendor or provider.

(g) Each of the Benefit Plans that is intended to be "qualified" within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and a favorable
determination or opinion letter to that effect has been issued by the IRS with
respect to each such Benefit Plan, and, to the Companys Knowledge, except as
set forth on _Schedule 3.8(g)_ , nothing has occurred that would   reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any
Benefit Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code or require the filing of a
submission under the IRSs employee plans compliance resolution system or the
taking of other corrective action pursuant to such system in order to maintain
the qualified status of such Benefit Plan. Each of the Benefit Plans that is
intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 125, 423 or 501(c)(9) of the
Code satisfies such requirements. Each of the Benefit Plans has been operated
and administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and
applicable Laws, including but not limited to ERISA and the Code. Each Person
who performs services for the Company has been, and is, properly classified by
the Company as an employee or independent contractor.

(h) There are no claims pending, or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened
(other than routine claims for benefits) against or involving any Benefit
Plan, the assets of any Benefit Plans or against the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate with respect to any Benefit Plan which would reasonably be expected
to result in a material Liability to the Company. There is no judgment,
decree, injunction, rule or order of any Government Authority or arbitrator
outstanding against or in favor of any Benefit Plan or any fiduciary thereof
(other than rules of general applicability). There are no pending or, to the
Companys Knowledge, threatened audits or investigations by any
Government Authority involving any Benefit Plan.

(i) No Benefit Plan provides benefits, including without limitation death or
medical benefits (whether or not insured), with respect to current or former
employees, directors or other service providers of or to the Company after
retirement or other termination of service (other than (i) coverage mandated
by applicable Law, (ii) death benefits or retirement benefits under any
"employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), or
(iii) deferred compensation benefits accrued as liabilities in the Financial
Statements). No Benefit Plan is funded through a "welfare benefit fund" as
defined in Section 419 of the Code.

(j) Each Benefit Plan may be amended or terminated without material liability
to the Company, other than liability for accrued benefits through the date of
the amendment or termination and administrative costs of amending or
terminating the Benefit Plan. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.8(j)_ ,
neither the execution of this Agreement or any ancillary agreement, nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, will (either
alone or together with any other event) result in or is a precondition to (i)
any current or former employee, director or other service provider of or to
the Company becoming entitled to severance or similar benefit, (ii) the
payment of, the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of, an
increase in the amount of, or the obligation to fund, any compensation or
benefit due to any current or former employee, director or other service
provider of or to the Company, or (iii) the renewal or extension of the term
of any agreement regarding the compensation of any current or former
employee, director or other service provider of or to the Company.

(k) Each Benefit Plan that provides deferred compensation subject to Section
409A of the Code complies with Section 409A of the Code (and has so complied
for the entire period during which Section 409A of the Code has applied to
such Benefit Plan). None of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any other ancillary agreement will constitute or result in a violation of
Section 409A of the Code. The Company is not a party to, or otherwise
obligated under, any Contract, plan or arrangement that provides for the
gross-up of Taxes imposed by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code. (l) No Benefit Plan subject to Title I of ERISA holds any "employer security"
or "employer real property" (each as defined in Section 407(d) of ERISA).

(m) None of the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate maintains or contributes to
any Benefit Plan subject to any Law other than U.S. federal, state or local
Law.

The Company is in compliance with its obligations under the Worker Adjustment
and Retraining Notification Act (" _WARN_ ") and similar applicable Laws, and
all other notification and bargaining obligations arising under any applicable
agreement, statute or otherwise. Except to the extent that any
such misclassification would not result in a material Liability to the
Company, the Company has properly classified its employees as exempt or
nonexempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act (" _FLSA_ "); to the Companys
Knowledge, the Company currently is not under any governmental inquiry
regarding FLSA compliance; and the Company is not party to any litigation
regarding FLSA compliance, and has no Knowledge that it owes any Company

(a) The Company has filed (or has had filed on its behalf) on a timely basis
(after giving effect to any valid extension) all Tax Returns it is required
to have filed, and all such Tax Returns are correct and complete in all
material respects, except as set forth in _Schedule 3.10(a)_. The Company has
not requested or been granted any extension of time within which to file any
Tax Return, which Tax Return has not since been filed.

(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.10(b)_ , all Taxes required to have
been paid by the Company (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been

(c) The Company has withheld and paid over all Taxes required to have been
withheld and paid over, and complied in all material respects with all
information reporting and backup withholding requirements, including
maintenance of required records thereto, in connection with amounts paid or
owing to any employee, creditor, independent contractor, or other third party.
All Persons who have provided services to the Company and have been classified
by the Company as independent contractors for the purposes of Tax withholding
laws and laws applicable to employee benefits were properly so classified,
except to the extent that any such misclassification would not result in a
material Liability to the Company, and the Company has fully and accurately
reported in all material respects its compensation on IRS Forms 1099 when
required to do so. The Company has complied in all material respects with all
sales Tax resale certificate exemption requirements.

(d) No claim has ever been made or, to the Companys Knowledge, can reasonably
be expected to be made by a Taxing Authority in a jurisdiction where the
Company does not file currently Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to
taxation (including obligations to withhold amounts in respect of any Taxes)
by that jurisdiction. The Company has not conducted activities in
any jurisdiction which will require it to pay Taxes or file Tax Returns in
such jurisdiction of a type that it had not filed in the most recently ended
preceding taxable period (as reflected on _Schedule 3.10(e))_ for which Tax or
Tax Returns of such type would be due.

(e) _Schedule 3.10(e)_ identifies all Tax Returns that the Company has filed
for taxable periods ending after, or transactions occurring after, January 1,
2006 and the taxable period covered by each such Tax Return, and identifies
those Tax Returns or taxable periods that have been audited or are currently
the subject of an audit by a Taxing Authority, and all income Tax Returns of
the Company as to which the statute of limitations for assessment of Taxes has
not yet expired. The Company has made available to the Buyer complete and

any of its shareholders with respect to the Company since January 1, 2006
that were not shown on Tax Returns filed for the relevant taxable period by
the Company or any of its shareholders with respect to the Company before such
assessment or agreement; 

(iv) all written rulings from, and written agreements with, any Taxing
Authority relating to Taxes of the Company or any of its shareholders with

period for which a Tax Return has not yet been filed by the Company or any of
its shareholders with respect to the Company, and any request for issuance of
any ruling from a Taxing Authority on behalf of the Company since January 1,
2006 (regardless of whether the requested ruling was issued); and

(v) all elections relating to Taxes of the Company or any of its shareholders
with respect to the Company that have been filed by or on behalf of the
Company or its shareholders with any Taxing Authority (other than elections
which are included in or apparent from the Tax Returns referred to in (i)
above) that would have continuing effect in the determination of Tax for
any taxable period for which a Tax Return has not yet been filed by the
Company or any of its shareholders with respect to the Company.

(f) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.10(f)_ , there is no audit or other
proceeding presently pending or threatened with regard to any Tax Liability or
Tax Return of the Company or any Seller relating to the Company. There are
no existing circumstances (including issues raised in audits of prior taxable
periods by any Taxing Authority) which, to the Companys Knowledge, reasonably
may be expected to result in the assertion of any material claim by any Taxing
Authority that the Company has unsatisfied Tax obligations with respect to
any taxable period for which Tax Returns are required to have been filed or
Tax is required to have been paid by any Seller Party. Neither the Company nor
any Person on behalf of the Company has waived any statute of limitations or
agreed to any extension of time that has continuing effect with respect to
assessment or collection of any Tax for which the Company may be held liable.
Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.10(f)_ , there is not currently in effect
any power of attorney authorizing any Person to act on behalf of the Company,
or receive information relating to the Company, with respect to any Tax matter
(other than authorizations to contact Tax Return preparers included in Tax
Returns provided pursuant to Section 3.10(e)).

(g) The Company has not participated in any "reportable transaction" within
the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(1) that was or is
required to be disclosed under Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4. No Tax

statement under Section 6662 of the Code (or any similar provision of Law).

(h) The Company is not a party to any Tax sharing agreement, Tax indemnity
agreement or similar agreement, and the Company has never assumed the Tax
Liability of any other Person by Contract. The Company is not nor has it ever
been a member of an affiliated group (within the meaning of Section 1504(a)
of the Code) or similar group of entities with which the Company joined, or
was required to join, for any taxable period in making a consolidated federal
income Tax Return or other Tax Return in which Tax Liability was or   would be computed on a consolidated, combined, unitary or similar basis, and
the Company does not have nor has it ever had a relationship to any other
Person which would cause it to be liable for Tax Liability of such other
Person (other than as a payor required to effect Tax withholding from payments
to another Person), including, without limitation, Tax payable by reason of
Contract, assumption, transferee liability, operation of Law, or Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-6(a) (or any predecessor or successor thereof or
any analogous or similar provision of Law).

(i) The Company has not been a United States real property holding corporation
within the meaning of Code Section 892(c)(2) at any time during the applicable
period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code.

of the Code (or so much of Section 356 as relates to Section 355).

(k) The Company has not participated in an international boycott as defined in
Code Section 999\.

(l) The Company has not made or agreed to make, and is not required to make,
any change in method of accounting previously used by it in any Tax Return
filed by the Company which change in method would require the Company to make
a positive adjustment to its income pursuant to Section 481(a) of the Code (or
any similar provision) on any Tax Return for any taxable period for which the
Company has not yet filed a Tax Return; and neither is there any application
pending with any Taxing Authority requesting permission for the Company to
make any change in any accounting method that would require such an
adjustment, nor has the Company received any notice that a Taxing Authority
proposes to require a change in method of accounting used in any Tax Return
which has been filed by the Company that would require such an adjustment.

(m) The Company has not taken any action not in accordance with past practice
that would, to the Companys Knowledge, reasonably be expected to have the
effect of deferring a measure of Tax from a period (or portion thereof) ending
on or before the Closing Date to a period (or portion thereof) beginning after
the Closing Date. The Company has no deferred income or Tax Liability arising
out of any transaction, except to the extent adequately reserved for on the
balance sheet included in the Interim Financials, including without
limitation, any (i) the disposition of any property in a transaction accounted
for under the installment method pursuant to Section 453 of the Code, (ii)
use of the long-term contract method of accounting, or (iii) receipt of any
prepaid amount for goods or services on or before the Closing Date.

(n) The Company does not have a "permanent establishment" in any foreign
country, as defined in any applicable Tax treaty or convention between the
United States of America and such foreign country, and has not otherwise taken
steps or conducted business operations that have exposed it to the taxing
jurisdiction of a foreign country. The Company is in compliance in
all material respects with the terms and conditions of any applicable Tax
exemptions, Tax agreements or Tax orders of any Taxing Authority to which it
may be subject or which it may have claimed, and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will not have any adverse effect on such compliance. (o) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.10(o)_ , no property owned by the
Company is (i) property required to be treated as being owned by another
Person pursuant to the provisions of Section 168(f)(8) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1954, as amended and in effect immediately prior to the enactment of
the Tax Reform Act of 1986, (ii) "tax-exempt use property" within the meaning
of Section 168(h)(1) of the Code, (iii) "tax-exempt bond financed property"
within the meaning of Section 168(g) of the Code or (iv) used predominately
outside the United States within the meaning of Section 168(g)(1)(A) of the

a lessor or lessee of "limited use property" within the meaning of Rev. Proc.
2001-28.

(q) The Company has not, in the past ten (10) years, (i) acquired assets from
another Person (and has not been treated or required to be treated for Tax
purposes as acquiring assets of a Person by reason of change in Tax status of
such Person) in a transaction in which the Companys federal income Tax basis
for the acquired assets was required to have been determined, in whole or in
part, by reference to the Tax basis of the acquired assets (or any other
property) in the hands of such transferring Person; (ii) participated in a
reorganization or other transaction to which Section 381 of the Code was

agreement or arrangement which is treated or required to be treated as a
partnership for federal income Tax purposes, and (ii) does not own any
interest in an entity that either is treated or required to be treated as an
entity disregarded as separate from its owner for federal Tax purposes or is
an entity as to which an election pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
301.7701-3 has been made.

(s) The Company has, at all times since its formation, been a "small business
corporation" within the meaning of Section 1361(b) of the Code and has had in
effect at all times during its existence a valid election under Section
1362(a) of the Code, and has validly been treated in a similar manner for
purposes of the income tax laws of all state and local jurisdictions in which
it has been subject to taxation where such treatment is legally available. The
Company has never made any election or filing to be treated as a Subchapter C
corporation for state or local income Tax purposes.

(t) At all times since its formation, (i) the Company has had only one class
of stock outstanding (treating for this purpose all classes of stock having
identical rights to current and liquidating distributions as a single class,
regardless of differences in voting power), (ii) the Company does not and has
not had any outstanding options, including the Company Options, Contracts,
indebtedness or other instruments or obligations which could constitute a
second class of stock within the meaning of Section 1361(b)(1)(D) of the Code
and Treasury Regulations Section 1.1361-1(l), (iii) there have been no binding
agreements among the Company and its shareholders or other "governing
provisions" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations   Section 1.1361-1(l)(2)(i) that caused any of the outstanding capital stock
of the Company to have different per share rights to distribution or
liquidation proceeds from any other share of then outstanding capital stock,
and (iv) all distributions by the Company with respect to its stock described
in Section 1368(a) of the Code have been proportional to the ownership of the
capital stock of the Company outstanding at the time of each such
distribution. No Seller Party has taken or omitted or caused to be taken or
omitted to be taken any actions which would cause the Company to cease to be
treated prior to the completion of the Closing as a "small
business corporation" within the meaning of Section 1361(b) of the Code for
federal and applicable state and local income tax purposes.

(u) The Company does not have any "net unrealized built-in gain" within the
meaning of Section 1374(d) of the Code that would give rise to taxation
pursuant to Section 1374 of the Code (or comparable provisions of state law)
if all of the assets of the Company were sold on the Closing Date at their
respective fair market values.

(v) The Company does not know or have reason to believe, after consultation
with counsel, that the Buyers acquisition of the Companys capital stock
pursuant to this Agreement would not qualify as a "qualified stock purchase"
within the meaning of Section 338 of the Code and Treasury Regulations
thereunder, as to which an election properly may be made under Section
338(h)(10).

(w) No payment or benefit paid or provided, or to be paid or provided, in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, to current or former
employees, directors or other service providers of or to the Company
(including pursuant to this Agreement or any ancillary agreement) will fail to
be deductible for federal income tax purposes under Section 280G of the
Code.

property owned or leased by the Company or to which the Company may have any
leasehold rights (collectively, the " _Facilities_ "). True, complete and
correct copies of all leases of real property listed on _Schedule 3.11(a)_
have been delivered to the Buyer. Except as otherwise disclosed on _Schedule
3.11(a)_ , to the Companys Knowledge, no Person other than the owner of such

under an installment contract, option to purchase, easement, right-of-way or
otherwise) with respect to the Facilities or any part thereof. All leases set
forth on _Schedule 3.11(a)_ are in full force and effect and constitute valid
and binding agreements of the Company and the other party or parties thereto
in accordance with their respective terms.

tear excepted. All material tangible personal property and equipment used
by the Company is either owned by the Company or leased under an agreement
listed on _Schedule 3.11(b)_ or has been furnished to the Company by a
Governmental Authority and is listed on _Schedule 3.14(a)_. All leases set

Sheet, consists of a quality and quantity usable and salable in the ordinary
course of business, except for obsolete items and items of below-standard
quality, all of which have been written off or written down to net realizable
value on the Balance Sheet or on the accounting records of the Company, as the
case may be. The quantities of each item of inventory (whether raw materials,
work-in-process or finished goods) are not excessive, but are reasonable in
relation to the present circumstances of the Company or the requirements of
its business. 

3.12 _Litigation_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.12_ , there is no
material Proceeding pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened
against or affecting the Company or its assets before any court, agency,
authority or arbitration tribunal, and, to the Companys Knowledge, there are
no facts that would reasonably be expected to result in the commencement of
such a Proceeding against the Company. Neither the Company nor, to the
Companys Knowledge, any of its officers or other employees is subject to or
in default with respect to any notice, order, writ, injunction or decree
of any Government Authority or arbitration tribunal.

employees, partners, principals, agents or assignees of the Company have
committed (or taken any action to promote or conceal) any violation of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-1 and -2, or any equivalent
foreign Law or otherwise paid or made any bribe, illegal rebate, payoff,
influence payment, kickback or other unlawful payment. The Company has all
material licenses, permits, approvals, qualifications or the like, from any
Government Authority or any Person used in, necessary for or related to the
conduct of its business as conducted, all such items are in full force and
effect and the Company is and has at all times been in material compliance
with the terms thereof. _Schedule 3.13(a)_  sets forth all such material
licenses and permits held by the Company and designates such licenses and
permits which terminate or   become renewable at any time prior to the first anniversary of the date of
this Agreement. To the Companys Knowledge, there are no facts or
circumstances in existence which are reasonably likely to prevent the Company
from renewing each such license or permit. The Company has not received any
written notice or citation for any actual or potential noncompliance in any

3.14 _Government Contract Regulatory Matters_.

(a) _Government Contracts and Bids_. _Schedule 3.14(a)_ lists all: (i)
Government Contracts the period of performance of which has not yet expired
or terminated or for which final payment has not yet been received and there
is a reasonable likelihood of payment or financial liability greater than
$500,000 thereunder (the " _Current Government Contracts_ "); (ii)
quotations, bids and proposals for awards of new Government Contracts in
excess of $500,000 made by the Company for which no award has been made and
for which the Company believes there is a reasonable prospect that such an
award to the Company may yet be made (the " _Government Contract Bids_ ");
and (iii) Government Contracts pursuant to which the Company is currently or,
to the Companys Knowledge, is reasonably likely to experience cost,
schedule, technical or quality problems that could result in claims against
the Company (or its successors in interest) in the amount of $500,000 or more
by a Governmental Entity, a prime contractor or a higher-tier subcontractor.
With respect to each Current Government Contract, _Schedule 3.14(a)_
accurately lists (A) the contract number, (B) the award date and (C) the
contract end date. With respect to each such Government Contract Bid,
_Schedule 3.14(a)_ accurately lists: (A) the request for proposal (RFP)
number or, if such Government Contract Bid is for a task order under a prime
contract, the applicable prime contract number; (B) the date of proposal
submission; (C) the expected award date, if known; (D) the estimated period
of performance; and (E) the estimated value based on the proposal, if any. The
Company has made available to the Buyer true and complete copies of all
Current Government Contracts and Government Contract Bids in the amount of
$500,000 or more, including any and all amendments and other modifications
thereto requested by Buyer, except in those cases where the Company is
obligated by agreement with third parties and/or by law to withhold
information which the third party has identified as proprietary and
confidential, in which cases the Company has provided (i) express written
notice to the Buyer that it is withholding information pursuant to such
obligation, and (ii) the Buyer with such information regarding such
Government Contracts and Government Contract Bids that the Company is
permitted to disclose, and has provided the Buyer with access to true and
correct copies of all documentation related thereto requested by the Buyer.
All of the Current Government Contracts were, to the Companys Knowledge,
legally awarded, and are binding on the parties thereto and are in full force
and effect. The Current Government Contracts (or, where applicable, the
prime Government Contracts under which the Current Government Contracts were
awarded) are not, as of the date of this Agreement, the subject of bid or
award protest proceedings, and, to the Companys Knowledge, no such Current
Government Contracts (or, where applicable, the prime Government Contracts
under which the Current Government Contracts were awarded) are reasonably
likely to become the subject of bid or award protest proceedings and no Person
has notified the Company that any Government Authority, prime contractor or
higher-tier subcontractor under a Government Contract intends to seek the
Companys agreement to lower rates under any of the Government Contracts or
Government Contract Bids, including, without limitation, any task order under
any Government Contract Bids. (b) _Compliance with Contract Requirements_. The Company has fully complied in
all material respects with all terms and conditions of each Government
Contract and Government Contract Bid to which it is a party, and has performed
all obligations required to be performed in all material respects by it
thereunder. The Company has complied in all material respects with all
statutory and regulatory requirements, including, without limitation, the
Armed Services Procurement Act, the Federal Procurement and Administrative
Services Act, the Federal Acquisition Regulation, any applicable agency-
specific acquisition regulation and related cost principles and the Cost
Accounting Standards, where and as applicable to each of the Current
Government Contracts and the Government Contract Bids. The
representations, certifications and warranties made by the Company with
respect to the Government Contracts or Government Contract Bids were accurate
in all material respects as of their effective dates, and the Company has
fully complied in all material respects with all such certifications. To the
Companys Knowledge, the Company has not received a substantially adverse or
negative government past performance evaluation or rating that could
reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the evaluation by
the Government Authority or other potential customer of the Companys bids or
proposals for future Government Contracts.

(c) _Notice of Non-Compliance_. With respect to the Current Government
Contracts, no Government Authority, prime contractor or higher-tier
subcontractor under a Government Contract or any other Person has notified
the Company of any actual or alleged violation or breach in any material
respects of any statute, regulation, representation, certification, disclosure
obligation, contract term, condition, clause, provision or
specification, including, without limitation, the Procurement Integrity Act,
the Service Contract Act, the Trade Agreement Act and the Buy American Act.

(d) _No Preferential Status Awards_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.14(d)_
, to the Companys Knowledge none of the Companys Current Government
Contracts or Government Contract Bids were solicited with reference to the
Companys small business status, small disadvantaged business status, protege
status, or other preferential status. Each representation and/or certification
made by the Company that it was a small business concern and/or was qualified
for other preferential status in each of its Government Contracts and
Government Contract Bids was current and accurate as of its effective date.

(e) _Charge Codes_. _Schedule 3.14(e)_ lists the Companys current project

and November 30, 2009 for work previously performed and billed; and (I)
payments due as of November 30, 2009 for work previously performed and
billed. _Schedule 3.14(e)_ will indicate which task orders are fixed price

Company is not party to any litigation that has had or, to the Companys

taken no action that has had or, to   the Companys Knowledge, could reasonably be expected to give rise to, (i)
liability under the False Claims Act, (ii) a claim for a material price
adjustment under the Truth in Negotiations Act, or (iii) any other request
for a material reduction in the price of any Government Contracts, including,
without limitation, to claims based on actual or alleged defective pricing. To
the Companys Knowledge, there exists no reasonable basis for a material
claim of any Liability of the Company by any Government Authority as a result
of defective cost and pricing data submitted to any Government Authority.

(g) _Termination for Default or Convenience_. The Company has not received any
written or, to the Companys Knowledge, oral show cause, cure, deficiency,
default or similar notice relating to the Current Government Contracts. No
termination for default, cure notice or show cause notice has been issued or,
to the Companys Knowledge, threatened and remains unresolved with respect to
any Current Government Contract or Government Contract Bid, and, to the
Companys Knowledge, no event, condition or omission has occurred or exists
that could reasonably be expected to constitute grounds for such action
resulting in a material Liability to the Company. No past performance
evaluation received by the Company with respect to any such Government
Contract has set forth a default or other failure to perform thereunder or
termination or default thereof. There has not been any material withholding
or setoff under any Current Government Contract. All invoices and claims
(including, without limitation, requests for progress payments and provisional
costs payments) submitted under each Government Contract were current,
accurate and complete in all material respects as of their submission date.
None of the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement and the other
documents contemplated hereby does or will conflict with or result in a breach
of or default under any Government Contract or give any Governmental
Authority the right to terminate any Government Contract due to loss of
preferential status. The Company has not received any written or, to the
Companys Knowledge, oral notice terminating any of the Current Government
Contracts for convenience or indicating an intent to terminate any of the
Current Government Contracts for convenience.

the Company, any Seller or any of their respective managers, trustees,
directors, officers or employees in connection with the performance of their
duties for or on behalf of the Company or any Affiliate of the Company. To
the Companys Knowledge, no   circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to warrant the
institution of suspension or debarment proceedings against the Company, any
Affiliate of the Company, any Seller or any of their respective managers,
trustees, directors, officers or employees in connection with the performance
of their duties for or on behalf of the Company or any Affiliate of the

6.4 _No Solicitation; No Trading; Voting_.

(a) The Company shall not and shall not authorize or knowingly permit any
Representative who is aware of this Agreement, including without limitation
any broker disclosed in Article III or Article IV hereof, to, during the

occur of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, accept, approve, encourage
(including by way of furnishing information), initiate, or respond to the
submission of proposals or offers from any Person for, (ii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations pertaining to, or (iii) furnish any information
to any Person, other than the Buyer, relating to, any acquisition or purchase

discontinue any and all negotiations with any Person with whom any of them is
currently engaged regarding any of the above. If the Company or any Seller
receives any unsolicited offer or proposal relating to any of the above, the
Company or such Seller shall immediately notify the Buyer thereof, including
the identity of the party making such offer or proposal and the specific
terms of such offer or proposal, and provide the Buyer with a copy thereof.

(b) Each of the Seller Parties acknowledges and agrees that each is aware
(and that each of their respective Representatives is aware or, upon receipt
of any material nonpublic information of Buyer, will be advised) of the
restrictions imposed by the United States federal securities laws and other
applicable foreign and domestic laws on a Person possessing material nonpublic
information about a public company. Each of the Seller Parties hereby agrees
that while any of them are in possession of such material
nonpublic information, none of such Person or Persons shall purchase or sell

against any action or agreement that would impede, interfere with, delay,
postpone or attempt to discourage the transactions contemplated hereby,
including but not limited to: (i) any extraordinary corporate transaction,
such as a merger, consolidation or other business combination; (ii) a sale or
transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or a
reorganization, recapitalization or liquidation of the Company; or (iii) any
material change in the Companys corporate structure or business.

6.5 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of the Parties shall give prompt
notice to the other Parties of (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any
event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which could reasonably be expected
to cause any representation or warranty of the notifying Party contained
herein to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at or prior to
the Closing and (b) any material failure of the notifying Party to comply in
any material respect with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by the notifying Party hereunder. The delivery
of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall not, without the express
written consent of the non-notifying Parties, be deemed to (x) modify the
representations or warranties hereunder of the notifying Party, (y) modify the
conditions to Closing set forth herein or (z) limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to any Party.

6.6 _Tax Matters_. 

(a) _Post-Closing Tax Returns_.

(i) The Sellers Representative shall properly and accurately prepare (or
cause to be prepared), and the Company and the Buyer shall cooperate with the
Sellers Representative in the preparation and timely filing of, all income
Tax Returns required to be filed by or on behalf of the Company after the
Closing Date for taxable periods ending on or prior to before the Closing Date
(each a " _Seller Prepared Return_ "). The cost of preparation of Seller
Prepared Returns shall be paid by the Company at the direction of the Sellers
Representative, but not in excess of the amount accrued as a liability for
such costs in the computation of Closing Working Capital, with any excess
cost to be paid by the Sellers. Each Seller Prepared Return shall be prepared
in a manner consistent with the prior practice of the Company, unless
otherwise required by applicable Tax Law, and shall properly include and
reflect the income, activities, operations and transactions of the Company
through the Closing Date. No later than fifteen (15) days prior to before the
required filing date for each such Seller Prepared Return, the Sellers
Representative shall deliver to the Buyer a draft of such Tax Return and the
Buyer shall have the right to review and approve each such Tax Return before
filing, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed.

(ii) Except for the Seller Prepared Returns, the Buyer shall properly and
accurately prepare (or cause to be prepared) and file (or cause to be filed)
each Tax Return required to be filed by the Company after the Closing Date for
a taxable period beginning before and ending after the Closing Date (each a "
_Buyer Prepared Return_ "). To the extent any Tax shown as due on such Tax
Return is payable by any Seller (taking into account indemnification
obligations hereunder), (i) such Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the prior practice of the Company unless otherwise required by
applicable Tax Law or the change   from prior practice would neither increase the amount of Tax payable by the
Company for which the Sellers are obligated to indemnify the Buyer pursuant to
Section 9.1(a) or Tax payable of the Sellers in respect of income of the
Company; (ii) such Tax Return shall be provided to the Sellers Representative
at least fifteen (15) days before the due date for filing such return (or, if
required to be filed within thirty (30) days after the Closing or within
thirty (30) days after the end of the taxable period to which such Tax Return
relates, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing); and (iii)
the Sellers Representative shall have the right to review and approve such
Tax Return before filing, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. The Buyer shall make such revisions to such Tax
Returns as are reasonably requested by the Sellers Representative and agreed
to by Buyer (which agreement shall not unreasonably be withheld, conditioned
or delayed).

(iii) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Sellers (or in the case
of the Trust Seller, any other Person who is properly treated as the owner of
the Company capital stock held by such Trust Seller for income tax purposes)
shall include any income, gain, loss, deduction or other Tax items for such
periods on their Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the Schedule K-1s
furnished to the Sellers with respect to the Company and fully satisfy the Tax
Liability arising from such inclusion. 

(b) _Allocation of Taxes_. The Parties shall, unless prohibited by applicable
Law, cause the taxable period of the Company to end as of immediately
following the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that the
taxable year of the Company, as a Subchapter S corporation, shall terminate
and end at the end of the Closing Date for federal income tax purposes (and
to the extent applicable, for state and local tax purposes as well). For
purposes of this Agreement, Company Taxes incurred with respect to a taxable
period that includes but does not end on the Closing Date, shall be allocated
to the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date (i) except as
provided in (ii) and (iii) below, to the extent feasible, on a specific
identification basis, according to the date of the event or transaction giving
rise to the Tax, and (ii) except as provided in (iii) below, with respect to
periodically assessed ad valorem Taxes and Taxes not otherwise feasibly
allocable to specific transactions or events, in proportion to the number of
days in such period occurring before the Closing Date compared to the total
number of days in such period, and (iii) in the case of any Tax based upon or
related to income or receipts, in an amount equal to the Tax which would be
payable if the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date (for the
elimination of doubt, Taxes incurred by reason of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Section 338(h)(10) Elections and
any Transfer Taxes, shall be allocated to the portion of the period ending on
the Closing Date). Any credits relating to a taxable period that begins before
and ends after the Closing Date shall be taken into account as though the
relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date. All determinations
necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations shall be made in a
manner consistent with prior practices of the Company.

(c)  _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the Sellers when
due. Notwithstanding Section 6.6(a)(ii), the Sellers shall, at their own
expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect
to all such Transfer Taxes. If required by applicable Law, the Buyer shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax
Returns and other documentation.  (d) _Cooperation, Access to Information, and Record Retention_. The Sellers,
the Company and the Buyer shall cooperate as and to the extent reasonably
requested by any other Party hereto in connection with the preparation and
filing of Tax Returns as provided herein and any Proceeding with respect to
Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Proceeding
with respect to Taxes and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. The Sellers, the Buyer and the Company shall (i) retain
all books and records with respect to Company Taxes (including Tax Returns)
relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until ninety
(90) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(including waivers and extensions) for assessment of Taxes, and (ii) give the
other Parties hereto reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if
another party so requests, allow the other party to take possession of such
books and records.

(e) _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_. All obligations of the Company
under all Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements shall have been
terminated on or before the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the
Company shall not be bound thereby or have any Liability thereunder.

(f) _Section 338(h)(10) Elections_. The Sellers will join with the Buyer in
making an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any corresponding
elections under state or local Tax law) (collectively, the " _Section
338(h)(10) Elections_ ") with respect to sale and purchase of the Shares
under this Agreement. The Buyer shall be responsible for the preparation and
filing of all forms and documents required in connection with the Section
338(h)(10) Elections and shall provide the Sellers with properly completed
copies of Form 8023 (and any corresponding state or local Tax forms) prior to
the Closing Date which shall be subject to review and approval by the Sellers
Representative prior to filing, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Subject thereto, the Sellers agree to
execute and deliver to the Buyer on the Closing Date a Form 8023 with attached
signature pages for each Seller, and any such forms that are or have
been provided by the Buyer for execution and to promptly execute such other
forms, which shall be subject to review and approval by the Sellers
Representative, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed, as may be reasonably requested by the Buyer thereafter in
connection with making or perfecting the Section 338(h)(10) Elections,
including, without limitation, any action required under section 1362(f) of
the Code to cause such election to be valid. The Parties shall cooperate
fully with each other and make available to each other such Tax data and other
information as may be reasonably required by the Buyer or the Sellers in order
to timely file the Section 338(h)(10) Elections. For income Tax purposes, the
Parties will report the purchase of the Shares as a purchase and sale,
respectively, of the assets of Company where such treatment is the required
consequence of the Section 338(h)(10) Elections.

(g) _Purchase Price Allocation_. The Parties agree that the consideration to
be paid pursuant to Article I of this Agreement and other items properly
includible in the deemed sales price of the assets of the Company pursuant to
the Section 338(h)(10) Elections shall be allocated, for Tax purposes, among
the Companys assets in a manner consistent with the provisions of Section
338 and Section 1060 of the Code and all regulations promulgated thereunder.
The IRS Form 8883 to be included with the federal income Tax Return of
Company   for the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and any similar allocation
required under state, local, or foreign law (collectively, " _IRS Form 8883_
") shall be prepared and reviewed as contemplated by Section 6.6(a). The
Company, the Sellers and the Buyer agree to report this transaction for
federal Tax purposes as a valid election under Section 338(h)(10) and in
accordance with IRS Form 8883 as ultimately filed, and shall not take any
position or action inconsistent therewith upon examination of any Tax Return,
in any refund claim, or in any Tax Proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if, in any audit of any Tax Return of the Sellers, the Company or the Buyer

dependents who received coverage immediately prior to the Closing under the
Company Welfare and Retirement Plans shall be entitled, during the period from

Employee and his or her dependents, until the expiration of their rights
to such coverage under applicable law or contract with the Former Employee,
if earlier), to continuous uninterrupted medical, dental, life insurance,
disability benefit and retirement plan coverage either (i) under the Company
Welfare and Retirement Plans in effect on the Closing Date, or (ii) under
welfare benefit plans and a pension plan subject to Section 401(k) of the Code
maintained by the Buyer and/or its Affiliates providing benefits on a
comparable basis (and at a comparable cost to the covered individuals) to the
benefit coverage available to such individuals immediately prior to the
Closing. As used herein, " _Company Welfare and Retirement Plan_ " means each
Benefit Plan sponsored or maintained by the Company that provides medical,
dental, life insurance or disability benefits or retirement benefits pursuant
to a plan subject to Section 401(k) of the Code. From and after the Closing,
the Company shall pay to the Company Employees any and all amounts accrued on
the Closing Working Capital Statement in respect of compensation and benefits.

(d) For ninety-one (91) days following the Closing Date, the Buyer agrees to

terminating any Benefit Plan or any employee benefit plan, program or policy
of Buyer and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company) (each
a " _Buyer Group Plan_ ") from time to time, (iv) nothing in this Agreement
shall be construed as an amendment of any Benefit Plan or Buyer Group Plan,
and (v) no provision of this Section 6.8 shall create any third party
beneficiary rights in any employee or former employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent of such employee or former employee) of the Company
in respect of continued employment (or resumed employment) or any other
matter. 

6.9 _Payment of Obligations_. Prior to the Closing, each Related Party shall
repay in full, in accordance with their terms, all debts and other
obligations, if any, owed to the Company.

Option Holder in consideration for the cancellation of their Company

will not terminate, suspend, revoke or in any way materially change the
Companys security clearance with respect to the Government Contracts with the
Company as a result of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Company shall undertake commercially reasonable
efforts to cause each of the Seller Parties (as applicable) to retain, as
required by the Buyer, and, at the expense of Buyer, to assist the Buyer (and
its officers, directors, employees and agents) in obtaining, the requisite
security clearances to own and operate the Company (and any successor
thereto) and its business as currently conducted without delay or
interruption.

6.12 _Books and Records_. The Buyer shall cause the Company to agree, for the
benefit of the Sellers, to retain for a period of six (6) years after the
Closing Date or such longer periods as may be required by law or prudent
business practices, any and all Books and Records (hard copy, electronic or
otherwise) related to the Company for all periods through the Closing Date or
related to the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, either Buyer or the Company may notify the Sellers Representative,
in writing, of its desire to discontinue retention of specified documents or
other materials due to a change in and in accordance with its applicable
record retention requirements during such period upon thirty (30) days prior
written notice; provided, however, that no such notice shall be given prior to
the Escrow Termination Date. The Sellers Representative may, by written
notice delivered to Buyer within thirty (30) days of the date of the
aforesaid notice, elect to assume custody thereof and Buyer shall deliver such
Books and Records to Sellers Representative. In the absence of such notice
from the Sellers Representative, the Buyer or the Company, as the case may
be, may destroy the documents or other materials referenced in its original
notice to the Sellers Representative. In the event any Seller needs access to
such Books and Records for any legitimate business purpose, the Buyer shall
allow the Sellers Representative and his or her advisors access to such   Books and Records upon reasonable notice, which shall identify the business
purpose for which access is needed, during regular business hours for the sole
purpose of obtaining information for use as aforesaid and will permit such
persons to make such extracts and copies thereof as may be necessary or
convenient and, if required for such purpose, to have access to original
documents.

6.13 _Further Assurances_. Each Seller and the Company shall prior to and
after the Closing, execute such further documents, assignments and assurances
and take such further actions as may reasonably be required by the Buyer to
consummate the Stock Purchase, to vest the Buyer with full title to all
capital stock of the Company.

paid to such Indemnified Party by such Indemnifying Party with respect to
Damages pursuant to the terms of this Agreement to the extent that such
Indemnified Party receives any insurance proceeds with respect to such
Damages. An Indemnifying Partys liability for Damages shall be reduced by any
Tax benefit actually realized with respect to such Damages.

(g) Each Party agrees to take commercially reasonable steps to mitigate their
respective Damages upon and after becoming aware of conditions giving rise to
Damages that are indemnifiable hereunder. 

(h) Upon making any payment to an Indemnified Party for an indemnification
claim under this Article IX, such Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to
the extent of such payment to any rights that such Indemnified Party may have
against any third parties with respect to the subject matter underlying such
claim.

(i) In calculating any Damages, there shall be deducted any indemnification,
contribution or other similar payment actually recovered by the Indemnified
Party from any third party with respect thereto so long as such recovered
claim has been finally determined and is not subject to appeal. If and to the
extent any Buyer Indemnified Party suffers or incurs Damages as a consequence
of failure to collect any accounts receivable (and whether or not such
Damages are indemnified hereunder or subject to any limitation on
indemnification hereunder) any amount subsequently collected on such accounts
receivable shall be deducted from any subsequent Damages to any Buyer
Indemnified Parties that are subject to payment hereunder to such Buyer
Indemnified Parties (after giving effect to all limitations on indemnification
hereunder).

(j) All indemnification payments under this Article IX shall be calculated
without duplication in any case in which more than one of the Indemnified
Parties seeks indemnification for the same Damages or in the event that any
events or circumstances giving rise to a breach of a particular representation
or warranty of any Party, contained in this Agreement or any other agreement
or any certificate executed and delivered by any Party, also constitutes a
breach of one or more other representations or warranties of any Party
contained in this Agreement or any other agreement or any certificate executed
and delivered by any Party. The Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to
indemnification under this Article IX for any Damages if and to the extent
that such Damages were taken into account (such as being applied as a
reduction in current assets or an increase in current liabilities), in the
determination of the Closing Adjustment or in any other adjustment that may be
made to the Purchase Price. (k) Damages shall not include any special, exemplary or punitive damages, and
no Party shall be liable for any special, exemplary or punitive damages under
this Article IX, except to the extent that such special, exemplary or punitive
damages are asserted and recovered by a third party.

(l) The amount of any Damages for which any Indemnified Party would otherwise
become entitled to be indemnified under this Article IX shall be reduced by
the amount, if any, of any specific accruals or reserves for such Damages
reflected in the Closing Working Capital Statement.

(m) The Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover any Damages under
this Article IX to the extent that such Damages arose primarily from the
intentional wrongdoing of any of the Indemnified Parties.

9.4 _Procedure for Claims_.

(a) Whenever an Indemnified Party desires to seek indemnification under any
part of this _Article IX __,_ it shall give notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to
the Indemnifying Party prior to the expiration of the applicable survival
period, if any, set forth in Section 9.2. Such notice shall explain in
reasonable detail the nature of the claim and the parties known to be
involved, and shall specify the actual amount of Damages suffered by the
Indemnified Party. If the matter to which a claim relates shall not have been
resolved as of the date of the Claim Notice, the Indemnified Party shall
estimate in good faith the amount of the claim in the Claim Notice, but
also specify therein that the claim has not yet been liquidated. Each
Indemnifying Party to which a Claim Notice is given shall respond to any
Indemnified Party that has given such Claim Notice (a " _Claim Response_ ")
within thirty (30) days (the " _Response Period_ ") after the date on which
such Claim Notice is given. Any Claim Notice or Claim Response shall be given
in accordance with the notice requirements hereunder, and any Claim Response
shall specify whether or not the Indemnifying Party giving the Claim Response
disputes the claim described in the Claim Notice. If the Indemnifying Party
fails to give a Claim Response within the Response Period, such Indemnifying
Party shall be deemed not to dispute the claim described in the related Claim
Notice. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to dispute all or any portion of
a claim described in a Claim Notice, whether by failing to give a timely Claim
Response or otherwise, then the undisputed amount of the actual Damages set
forth in such claim shall be conclusively deemed to be an obligation of such
Indemnifying Party (any such undisputed amount, a " _Conceded Claim_ "). If
the Indemnifying Party provides its Claim Response within the Response
Period, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall then negotiate
resolution of any claims that the Indemnifying Party did not concede or is not
deemed to concede in its Claim Response (any such claim, an " _Unresolved
Claim_ ") for a period of thirty (30) days after the date such Claim Response
is provided. If the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party are unable to
resolve such Unresolved Claim within such thirty (30) day period, the
Indemnified Party may thereafter submit such Unresolved Claim to arbitration
in accordance with Section 9.5.

(b) With respect to any Conceded Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall, subject
to the second sentence immediately succeeding, pay to the Indemnified Party
within three (3) Business Days after the last day of the Response Period the
amount to which such Indemnified Party shall be entitled, which the Parties
acknowledge, notwithstanding any provision to the   contrary contained in this Agreement, shall not, in the case of a claim
subject to Section 9.4(d), extend to Unliquidated Damages. With respect to any
Unresolved Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall, subject to the immediately
succeeding sentence, pay to the Indemnified Party within three (3) Business
Days after the final resolution of such Unresolved Claim (whether by mutual
agreement of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party or pursuant to
a definitive award in arbitration in accordance with Section 9.5), the amount,
if any, to which such Indemnified Party shall be entitled, which the Parties
acknowledge, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, shall not, in the case of a claim subject to Section 9.4(d), extend
to Unliquidated Damages. If the Indemnified Party shall be a Buyer Indemnified
Party, it shall obtain payment of the Damages to which it is entitled as
aforesaid under this _Article IX_ from the Escrow Funds, in accordance with
the Escrow Agreement, to the extent that Escrow Funds are then being held by
the Escrow Agent and are not subject to other claims for
indemnification; provided, that if the amount of the Escrow Funds available
for payment of such Damages is less than the amount of Damages to which such
Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled as aforesaid, then subject to the
limitations contained in this Article IX, the Sellers shall be liable for
such deficiency, and the Buyer Indemnified Party shall have the right to
obtain payment of such Damages from (i) the Escrow Funds to the extent
available and (ii) subject to the limitations contained in this  _Article IX_
, directly from the Sellers for the remainder of such Damages in excess of the
Escrow Funds. If any Indemnifying Party fails to pay when due as aforesaid all
or part of any indemnification obligation not subject to payment from
the Escrow Funds, which for Conceded Claims shall be five (5) days after the
date of the Claim Response corresponding to such Conceded Claim and for
Unresolved Claims shall be five (5) days after the final resolution of such
Unresolved Claim, then such Indemnifying Party shall also be obligated to pay
to the applicable Indemnified Party interest on the unpaid amount for each day
after the due date during which the obligation remains unpaid at an annual
rate equal to the Prime Rate, and the Prime Rate in effect on the first
Business Day of each calendar quarter shall apply to the amount of the unpaid
obligation during such calendar quarter.

(c) If the Indemnified Party is a Buyer Indemnified Party and, pursuant to
Section 9.4(b), such Buyer Indemnified Party is obligated to obtain any
portion of the funds to which such Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled from
the Escrow Funds, then, within five (5) Business Days from the date on which
such Buyer Indemnified Party becomes entitled to such funds, Buyer and the
Sellers Representative shall provide joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent as to (i) the amount of funds, if any, to be disbursed from the
Escrow Funds and (ii) instructions as to the manner in which such funds shall
be disbursed by the Escrow Agent.

(d) _Third Party Claims_. In connection with any claim which may give rise to
indemnity hereunder resulting from or arising out of any Proceeding by a
Person other than the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates (including, without
limitation, by any Taxing Authority or other Governmental Authority), then
notice thereof shall be given by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying
Party promptly after the Indemnified Party shall have become aware thereof;
provided, however, that if such claim is in the form of a pleading requiring
an answer, such notice shall be given at least seven Business Days prior to
the due date of the answer or other response to the pleading; provided,
further, that in any case the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party
shall have been prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party copies of all
notices and documents (including court papers)   received by the Indemnified Party relating to such claim. The Indemnifying
Party, at its sole cost and expense, may assume the defense of any such
Proceeding, except in the event that the potential aggregate Damages arising
from such Proceeding, when taken together with all other unresolved claims for
indemnification by the Indemnified Party, could reasonably be expected to
exceed the applicable limits set forth in Sections 9.3(c) or (d), upon
written notice to the Indemnified Party; and, in furtherance of the foregoing,
the Sellers Representative shall have the right to represent the Companys
interests in any Tax Proceeding and to employ counsel of the
Sellers Representatives choice, but reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer,
at the Sellers Representatives expense, to the extent such Tax Proceeding
pertains to income reportable on Tax Returns for taxable periods ending on or
before the Closing Date. If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of
any such Proceeding and at any time during the course of such Proceeding the
potential aggregate Damages arising from such Proceeding, when taken together
with all other unresolved claims for indemnification by the Indemnified
Party, could reasonably be expected to exceed the applicable limits set forth
in Sections 9.3(c) or (d), the Indemnified Party may, at its election, assume
control of the defense of such Proceeding. If the Indemnifying Party assumes
the defense of any such Proceeding, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall select
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party to conduct the defense
of such Proceeding and at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party
shall take all steps reasonably necessary in the defense or settlement
thereof, (ii) the Indemnified Party shall cooperate fully in the defense of
any such Proceeding, which cooperation shall include the retention and
(upon the Indemnifying Partys request) the provision to the Indemnifying
Party of records and information that are reasonably requested by the
Indemnifying Party or that are reasonably relevant to such Proceeding, making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis during normal business
hours to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder and providing testimony in connection with such Proceeding,
and (iii) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in (but not
control) the defense of any such Proceeding, with its own counsel and at its
own expense. The Indemnifying Party shall not consent to a settlement of, or
the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Proceeding, without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). If the Indemnifying Party does not assume
the defense of any such Proceeding resulting therefrom within thirty (30)
days after notice thereof by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party:
(i) the Indemnified Party may defend against such Proceeding in such manner as
it may deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, settling
such Proceeding, after giving notice of the same to the Indemnifying Party,
on such terms as the Indemnified Party may deem appropriate; and (ii) the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) the
defense of such Proceeding, with its counsel and at its own expense. If the
Indemnifying Party thereafter seeks to question the manner in which the
Indemnified Party defended such third party Proceeding or the amount or nature
of any such settlement, the Indemnifying Party shall have the burden to prove
by a preponderance of the evidence that the Indemnified Party did not defend
or settle such third party Proceeding in a reasonably prudent manner.

9.5 _Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration_.

(a) With respect to any Unresolved Claims, either the Buyer, on the one hand,
or the Sellers Representative, on the other, may demand arbitration of the
matter unless the amount of the loss is at issue in pending litigation with a
third party, in which event arbitration shall not   be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both Parties agree to
arbitration. In either such event, the matter shall be settled by arbitration
conducted by one arbitrator mutually agreeable to the Buyer and the Sellers
Representative. In the event that within forty-five (45) days after submission
of any dispute to arbitration, the Buyer and the Sellers Representative
cannot mutually agree on one arbitrator, the Buyer and the Sellers
Representative shall each select one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so
selected shall select a third arbitrator to handle the dispute. The arbitrator
shall set a limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce
the cost and time for discovery while allowing the Parties an opportunity,
adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrator, to discover relevant
information from the opposing party about the subject matter of the dispute.
The arbitrator shall rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and shall
have the authority to impose sanctions, including attorneys fees and costs,
to the extent of a court of competent law or equity, should the arbitrator
determine that discovery was sought without substantial justification or that
discovery was refused or objected to without substantial justification. The
decision of the arbitrator as to the validity and amount of any Unresolved
Claim shall be binding and conclusive upon the Parties to this Agreement and
the Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall act in accordance with such
decision and make payments, if any, in accordance with the procedures set
forth in Section 9.4. The arbitrators decision shall be written and shall be
supported by written findings of fact and conclusions which shall set forth
the award, judgment decree or order awarded by the arbitrator.

(b) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in Wilmington,
Delaware, or such other location mutually agreed to by the Buyer and the
Sellers Representative, under the rules then in effect for the American
Arbitration Association. The arbitrator shall determine how all expenses
relating to the arbitration shall be paid, including the respective expenses
of each party, the fees of each arbitrator and the administrative fee of the
American Arbitration Association.

9.6  _Waiver, Release and Discharge_. Effective upon the Closing, except as
expressly set forth in this Agreement, each Seller, for itself and its
Affiliates, hereby irrevocably waives, releases and discharges the Company,
the Buyer and their respective Affiliates, directors, officers and employees
(as of the Closing) from any and all Liabilities and obligations to the Seller
of any kind or nature whatsoever, whether in his capacity as a Seller
hereunder, as a shareholder, officer, director or employee of the Company or
otherwise (including, without limitation, in respect of rights of contribution
or indemnification), in each case whether absolute or contingent, liquidated
or unliquidated, known or unknown, and whether arising hereunder or under any
other agreement or understanding, at law or equity, or otherwise and each
Seller shall not seek to recover any amounts in connection therewith or
thereunder from the Company; provided, however, that this release shall
not apply to any obligation arising under this Agreement or any other
agreement delivered pursuant to this Agreement. Each Seller waives, and
acknowledges and agrees that such Seller shall not have and shall not exercise
or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert), any right of contribution,
right of indemnity or other similar right or remedy against the Company or the
Buyer in connection with any actual or alleged breach of any representation,
warranty or obligation of any Seller Party or the Sellers Representative set
forth in this Agreement (other than any obligation of the Company to be
performed subsequent to Closing). 9.7 _Sellers  Representative_.

(a) Each Seller designates Michael Gualario as such Sellers representative
(the " _Sellers  Representative_") for purposes of this Agreement. The
Sellers and their respective successors shall be deemed to have approved, and
shall be bound by, any and all actions taken by the Sellers Representative on
their behalf under or otherwise relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereunder as if such actions were expressly ratified
and confirmed by each of them. In the event the Sellers Representative is
unable or unwilling to serve or shall resign, a successor
Sellers Representative shall be jointly selected by the Sellers. A Sellers
Representative may not resign, except upon thirty (30) days prior written
notice to the Buyer. In the event of a notice of proposed resignation, or any
death, disability or other replacement of a Sellers Representative, a
successor shall be appointed effective immediately thereafter (and, in the
case of death of a Sellers Representative, the executor or other
representative of such Sellers Representatives estate shall be deemed to be
the successor) and the Buyer shall be notified promptly of such appointment by
the successor Sellers Representative. No resignation, nor any other
replacement, of any Sellers Representative is effective against the Buyer
until selection of a successor and prior written notice to the Buyer of such
selection (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Each
successor Sellers Representative shall have all the power, rights, authority
and privileges hereby conferred upon the original Sellers Representative.

(b) The Buyer shall be entitled to rely upon any communication or writings
given or executed by the Sellers Representative on behalf of the Sellers. All
communications or writings to be sent to the Sellers pursuant to this
Agreement may be addressed to the Sellers Representative and any
communication or writing so sent shall be deemed notice to both of the
Sellers. The Sellers hereby consent and agree that the Sellers Representative
is authorized to accept deliveries, including any notice, on behalf of each
Seller pursuant hereto.

(c) The Sellers Representative is hereby appointed and constituted the true
and lawful attorney-in-fact of each Seller, with full power of substitution in
such holders name and on such holders behalf to act according to the terms
of this Agreement and the other documents contemplated hereby in the absolute
discretion of the Sellers Representative; and in general to do all things and
to perform all acts including, without limitation, executing and delivering
all agreements, certificates, receipts, instructions, notices and
other instruments contemplated by or deemed advisable in connection with this
Agreement, including without limitation Article IX hereof and the other
documents contemplated hereby. This power of attorney and all authority hereby
conferred is granted subject to the interest of the Sellers hereunder and in
consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements made herein, and shall be
irrevocable and shall not be terminated by any act of any Seller, by operation
of law, whether by such holders death, disability or by any other event.

(d) Each Seller Party hereby agrees that, notwithstanding any other provision
set forth in this Agreement, the Sellers Representative, in his capacity as
such, shall have no liability to any Seller Party for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by him or any agent thereof hereunder, or for any other
matter arising from this Agreement or any related matter, except to the
extent found by a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction to have
constituted fraud; and, except as aforesaid, each Seller Party hereby
irrevocably waives, releases and discharges the Sellers Representative, in
his capacity as such, from any and all such matters. The Sellers
Representative shall not by reason of this Agreement have a fiduciary
relationship in   respect of any Seller Party and will not be required to exercise any
discretion or take any action that exposes the Sellers Representative to
personal liability or that is contrary to this Agreement or applicable Laws.
The Sellers Representative shall not be required to make any inquiry
concerning either the performance or observance of any of the terms,
provisions or conditions of this Agreement.

(e) The Sellers Representative hereby acknowledges and agrees to serve as the
Sellers Representative in accordance with applicable terms hereof and to be
bound by such terms. At the Buyers request, the Sellers shall cause any
successor Sellers Representative to enter into an agreement in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer and the Sellers
Representative in which the Sellers Representative acknowledges and agrees to
serve as the Sellers Representative and to be bound by the applicable terms
of this Agreement.

9.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. The provisions of this Article IX shall constitute the
sole and exclusive remedy from and after the Closing of any Indemnified Party
in connection with, resulting from or arising out of, directly or indirectly
(whether or not involving a third party claim), any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made in this Agreement or in
any other agreement or any certificate delivered or provided in connection
with or related to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except (i) remedies as set forth in Article X and Section 12.3,
(ii) in the case of breach of the covenants or obligations set forth in
Section 12.8, (iii) in the case of breach of the covenants or obligations set
forth in the Executive Employment Agreements, and (iv) in the case of fraud.

ARTICLE X

COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE

10.1 _Prohibited Activities_. For the period commencing with the Closing and
ending on the fourth (4th) anniversary of the Closing Date, each Seller shall
not, for any reason whatsoever, directly or indirectly, for himself, or on
behalf of or in conjunction with any other Person:

(a) engage as a stockholder, owner, partner, joint venturer, or in a
managerial capacity, whether as a director, officer, employee, independent
contractor, consultant or advisor, in any business selling any products or
services in direct or indirect competition with the business of the Company as
currently conducted or as proposed to be conducted as of the Closing Date; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither of the Sellers nor any of their
respective Affiliates shall be precluded from the ownership of securities of
corporations that are listed on a national securities exchange or traded in
the national over-the-counter market in an aggregate amount that shall not
exceed five percent (5%) of the outstanding shares of any such corporation or
entity;

(b) employ, or call upon for the purpose or with the intent of enticing or
soliciting away from or out of the employ of the Buyer, the Company or any of
the Buyers Affiliates, any person who is at that time, or was within six (6)
months prior to that time, an employee of the Buyer, the Company or any of the
Buyers Affiliates;

(c) other than on behalf of the Buyer or its Affiliates, sell products or
services in direct or indirect competition with the business of the Company as
currently conducted and as proposed to be conducted as of the Closing Date
to, or call upon for the purpose of soliciting or   selling products or services in direct or indirect competition with the
business of the Company as currently conducted and as proposed to be conducted
as of the Closing Date to, any Person who is at that time, or has been within
one (1) year prior to that time, a customer or prospective customer of the
Buyer, the Company or any of the Buyers Affiliates; or

(d) without in any manner limiting the ability of such Seller to exercise any
and all rights, benefits and privileges under this Agreement and the
additional agreements contemplated hereby, publish any statement or make any
statement (under any circumstances reasonably likely to become public)
critical of the Buyer, the Company or any of the Buyers Affiliates, or in any
way adversely affecting or otherwise maligning the reputation of the Buyer,
the Company or any of the Buyers Affiliates.

The Parties intend that the covenants contained in this Section 10.1 shall be
deemed to be a series of separate covenants, one for each county in each state
of the United States and, except for geographic coverage, each such separate
covenant shall be identical in terms to the covenant contained in this
Section 10.1.

10.2 _Confidentiality_.

(a) Each Seller and each of their respective Affiliates, (i) shall treat and
hold as confidential all information concerning this Agreement and the
business and affairs of the Company, the Buyer and the Buyers Affiliates that
is not already generally available to the public (the " _Confidential
Information_ "), (ii) shall not disclose, transfer, transmit or use any of
the Confidential Information except in connection with this Agreement and as
authorized by the Buyer or the Company, and (iii) shall deliver promptly to
the Buyer, at the request and option of the Buyer, all tangible embodiments
(and all copies) of the Confidential Information which are in his possession
or under his control. Each Seller hereby acknowledges that such Confidential
Information constitutes proprietary and trade secret information of the Buyer
or the Company, as the case may be.

(b) In the event that any Seller is requested or required (by oral question or
request for information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory,
subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar process) to disclose any
Confidential Information, the Seller shall notify the Buyer promptly of the
request or requirement so that the Buyer may seek an appropriate protective
order or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 10.2. If, in the
absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, any Seller
is, on the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any Confidential
Information to any tribunal or other Government Authority or any official or
agency thereof, such Seller may disclose the Confidential Information thereto;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such Seller shall use his commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, at the request and expense of the Buyer, an
order or other assurance that confidential treatment shall be accorded to such
portion of the Confidential Information required to be disclosed as the Buyer
shall designate.

10.3 _Damages_. Because of the difficulty of measuring economic losses to the
Buyer and its Affiliates as a result of a breach of the foregoing covenants
in this Article X, and because of the immediate and irreparable damage that
could be caused to the Buyer and its Affiliates for which it would have no
other adequate remedy, each Seller agrees that the foregoing covenant   may be enforced by the Buyer in the event of breach or threatened breach by
such Seller, in addition to, but not in lieu of, any other available remedies
(including, without limitation, monetary Damages), by injunctions,
restraining orders or other equitable remedies.

10.4 _Reasonable Restraint_. It is agreed by the Parties that the foregoing
covenants in this Article X impose a reasonable restraint on the applicable
Seller in light of the activities and business of the Buyer, the Company and
the Buyers Affiliates on the date of the execution of this Agreement and the
current plans of the Buyer and its Affiliates; but it is also the intent of
the Parties that such covenants be construed and enforced in accordance with
the changing activities and business of the Buyer and its
Affiliates throughout the term of this covenant.

10.5 _Independent Covenant_. Each of the covenants in this Article X shall
be construed as an agreement independent of any other provision in this
Agreement, and the existence of any claim or cause of action of any Seller
against the Buyer, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall
not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Buyer of any such
covenant. It is understood by the Parties that the covenants contained in this
Article X have no independent value, but are essential elements of this
Agreement and that, but for the agreement of the Sellers to comply with such
covenants, the Buyer would not have agreed to enter into this Agreement. In
the event that the Buyer seeks a remedy with respect to Damages for any breach
of this Article X, the absence of any portion of the Purchase Price allocated
by the Parties to the foregoing covenants shall not be considered a measure of
or a limit on such Damages. Each Seller and the Buyer have independently
consulted with their respective counsel and have been advised concerning
the reasonableness and propriety of such covenants with specific regard to
the nature of the business conducted by the Buyer. Each Seller hereby agrees
that all covenants contained in this Article X are material, reasonable and
valid and waive all defenses to the strict enforcement hereof by the Buyer.
The covenants in this Article X are severable and separate, and the
unenforceability of any specific covenant shall not affect the provisions of
any other covenant. Moreover, in the event that any court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that the scope, time or territorial restrictions
set forth are unreasonable, then it is the intention of the Parties that such
restrictions be enforced to the fullest extent which the court
deems reasonable, and the Agreement shall thereby be reformed. The covenants
contained in this Article X shall not be affected by any breach of any other
provision of this Agreement by any Party hereto and shall have no effect if
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated.

ARTICLE XI

11.1 _Termination_.

(a) This Agreement may, by notice given on or prior to the Closing Date, in

to its representations in this Agreement or in any ancillary document or the
due and timely performance by the Buyer of any of the Buyers covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement or in any ancillary document, and such
misrepresentation, default or breach shall not have been cured within twenty
(20) days after receipt by the Buyer of notice specifying particularly such
misrepresentation, default or breach;  (ii) by the Buyer if there has been a material misrepresentation or a material
default or breach by any Seller Party with respect to any of their respective

(iii) by mutual written agreement of the Sellers Representative and the
Buyer;

(iv) by either the Company or the Buyer if the Closing shall not have occurred
on or before the ninetieth (90th) day after the date hereof; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement shall not
because of its (and in the case of the Company, the Sellers) breach or
violation of any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein have
caused the Closing not to have occurred;

(v) by the Buyer if there shall have occurred (i) an effect, event or change
involving the Company which, individually or in the aggregate, has had or
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company
or the Company and the Buyer as a whole after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) any resignation or termination of
employment (or indications of an intention or plan to resign) by a material
number of Company Employees; or

(vi) by the Sellers Representative, on the one hand, or by the Buyer, on the
other hand, if there shall be a final nonappealable order of a federal or
state court in effect preventing the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; or there shall be any action taken, or any
statute, rule, regulation or order enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed
applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any
Government Authority which would make the consummation of the transactions
illegal.

(b) In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
11.1(a), (i) the Stock Purchase shall be abandoned; (ii) the provisions of
Section 10.2, this Article XI and Article XII shall remain in full force and
effect and survive any termination of this Agreement; and (iii) each Party
shall remain liable for any breach of this Agreement prior to its termination.

ARTICLE XII

MISCELLANEOUS

12.1 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon the Parties and their respective successors and assigns;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no Party may make an assignment of this
Agreement or any interest herein without the prior written consent of the
other Parties hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement or any of
the severable rights or obligations inuring to the benefit of or to be
performed by the Buyer hereunder may be assigned by the Buyer to an Affiliate
or successor, in whole or in part, without   the prior written consent of the other Parties, provided that such
assignment shall not release the Buyer from its obligations hereunder. Any
purported assignment not permitted hereby shall be void and of no force or
effect.

12.2 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Venue_. This Agreement shall in all
