owned subsidiary of Buyer (" _Buyer Sub_ "), and Beech Street Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (" _Beech_ "). The parties hereto are sometimes
hereinafter referred to collectively as the " _Companies_." Buyer Sub and

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of the Companies deem it advisable

corporation in such Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and the separate
existence of Buyer Sub shall thereupon cease. The Merger shall have
the effects set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law (" _GCL_ ").
Immediately following the Effective Time of the Merger, the Surviving

1.2 _Effective Time of the Merger_. The Merger shall become effective upon
the completion of the filing of a properly executed Certificate of Merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which filing shall be made on
the Closing Date after satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
_Article VIII_. When used in this Agreement, the term " _Effective Time_ "
with respect to the Merger shall mean the date and time at which such
Certificate of Merger is successfully filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware. 



ARTICLE II

_BUYER AND THE SURVIVING CORPORATION_



2.1 _Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation_. The Articles of
Incorporation of Buyer Sub as in effect at the Effective Time shall be the

effect at the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.



2.3 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.



 

(a) The directors of Buyer Sub at the Effective Time shall be the initial
directors of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office from the
Effective Time until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed
and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in the
manner provided in the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation, or as otherwise provided by law.



(b) The officers of Buyer Sub at the Effective Time shall be the initial
officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office from the Effective

provided in the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation, or as otherwise provided by law.



ARTICLE III

_EXCHANGE OF SHARES_



3.1 _Disposition of Constituent Corporation Shares_. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof:



(a) The shares of Buyer Sub common stock which shall be outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger shall be converted into
a number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation equal to the
number of shares of common stock of Buyer Sub then outstanding.



(b) Each share of common stock of Beech held in the treasury of Beech or by
any subsidiary of Beech and each such Beech share held by Buyer or any
subsidiary of Buyer immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled
and retired and cease to exist, and no consideration shall be given in
exchange therefor.



(c) Each share of Beech Series A voting common stock, $0.001 par value,
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (taking into account any
shares, warrants or options that are vested or accelerated as a result of the
Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby and exercised immediately prior
to the Merger, but other than shares held by Beech, Buyer, Buyer Sub or any
other subsidiary of Buyer or Beech, which shall be canceled as set forth in
_Section 3.1(b)_ above) (" _Series A Shares_ ") and each share of Beech Series
B nonvoting common stock, $0.001 par value, outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (taking into account any shares, warrants or options that
are vested or accelerated and exercised as a result of the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby and exercised immediately prior to the
Merger, but other than Series B Shares held by Beech, Buyer, Buyer Sub or any
other subsidiary of Buyer or Beech, which shall be canceled as set forth in
_Section 3.1(b)_ above) (" _Series B Shares_ ," and together with the Series
A Shares, the " _Shares_ ,") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to
receive an aggregate amount in cash equal to the Purchase Price (as defined
in  _Section 3.5_ )  



 

2  divided by the sum of (i) the number of Series A Shares, plus (ii) the
number of Series B Shares, such amount payable to the holder thereof, without
interest thereon, upon the surrender of the certificate formerly representing
such Share in accordance with _Section 3.3_ of this Agreement; provided that
an amount equal to seven and one-half percent (7.5%) of the Purchase Price
(the " _Indemnification Escrow Payment_ ") shall be held by an escrow agent
to be mutually agreed by the parties (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") as provided for
in _Section 10.1(c)_ hereof.



3.2 _Treatment of Stock Options and Warrants_. Beech shall cause all issued
and outstanding warrants, options or other similar rights (the " _Options_ ")
to acquire shares or capital stock or other equity securities of Beech (the "
_Option Shares_ ") to be canceled, exercised or terminated as of the Closing
Date and immediately prior to the Effective Time. Buyer is not assuming or
replacing any Options that have been granted by Beech under the Beech Street
Corporation 1999 Stock Incentive Plan (the "1999 Stock Plan") or otherwise.



3.3 _Exchange of Beech Shares_.



(a) Immediately following the Effective Time, each record holder (a "
_Stockholder_ ") of any certificate or certificates representing Shares (the "
_Certificates_ ") shall be entitled to surrender his or her Certificates to
the Buyer for cancellation in exchange for the payment of such Stockholders
pro rata portion of the Purchase Price less his or her pro rata portion of the
Indemnification Escrow Payment less to the extent applicable any amounts
required to be withheld under any provision of federal, state, local or
foreign law with respect to Taxes (as defined in _Section 5.15(k)_ ), and
Buyer hereby agrees to cause such amount to be paid to such person at such
time. If any Stockholder shall fail to surrender his or her Certificates
immediately following the Effective Time, the Buyer shall send to such
Stockholder notice of the Merger and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the payment hereunder, and the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
solely such Stockholders pro rata portion of the Purchase Price, less his pro
rata portion of the Indemnification Escrow Payment if such escrowed amount has
not already been released in accordance with this Agreement, and less to the
extent applicable any amounts required to be withheld under any provision of
federal, state, local or foreign law with respect to Taxes, and such
Certificate shall forthwith be canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrued
for the benefit of the Stockholders on the consideration payable upon the
surrender of the Certificates. It shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper
form for transfer.



(b) From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Beech shares which
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, the Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation
for payment, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Section 3.3_.



(c) At or prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, Buyer shall deliver
irrevocably to the Escrow Agent immediately available funds in an aggregate
amount equal to the Indemnification Escrow Payment. As provided in _Section
10.1(c)_ hereof, the Indemnification Escrow Payment shall be held in escrow
(the " _Indemnification Escrow_ ") and invested by the Escrow Agent. Income
and earnings therefrom shall become funds of the  



 

3  Indemnification Escrow to be disbursed as provided in _Section 10.1(f)_ and
_(g)_ of this Agreement and in the Escrow Agreement.



3.4 _No Further Rights in Beech Shares_. All cash, or cash
equivalents, received by any Stockholders pursuant to this Agreement shall be
deemed to have been delivered and received in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Stockholders Shares. At the Effective Time of the Merger,
the record holders of the Certificates shall cease to have any rights with
respect to shares (other than such rights as they may have as dissenting
Stockholders under the GCL), and their sole right shall be to receive their
pro rata share of the Purchase Price in accordance with _Section 3.3(a)_
above. Dissenting Stockholders shall have the rights accorded by the GCL.

Price_ ") for all outstanding Beech Shares shall be a cash amount equal to
One Hundred Sixty Five Million Dollars ($165,000,000).

ARTICLE IV _ _

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER_



As used in this Agreement, (i) the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means
any change in or effect on a party or any of its subsidiaries that
individually or in the aggregate is materially adverse to the business,
assets, results of operations or financial condition of such party and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole, or is reasonably likely to materially and
adversely affect the ability of such party to conduct its business in the
manner in which it is currently conducted or is reasonably likely to affect
its ability to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, or results in Beech or its subsidiaries
losing any license, permit or other authorization necessary to permit Beech
and its subsidiaries to lawfully conduct and operate their businesses in
substantially the manner they currently conduct and operate such businesses
and to permit Beech and its subsidiaries to own and use their assets in
substantially the manner in which they currently own and use such assets, (ii)
the word " _subsidiary_ " when used with respect to any party means any
corporation or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, of
which such party or any other subsidiary of such party is a general partner
(excluding partnerships the general partnership interests of which held by
such party or any subsidiary of such party do not have a majority of the
voting interests in such partnership) or of which at least a majority of the
securities or other interests having by their terms ordinary voting power to
elect a majority of the board of directors or others performing similar
functions with respect to such corporations or other organizations is directly
or indirectly owned or controlled by such party and/or by any one or more of
the subsidiaries, and (iii) the term " _Knowledge_ " shall mean the actual
knowledge of the applicable partys executive officers after reasonable
inquiry.



Buyer and Buyer Sub represent and warrant to Beech as of the date hereof,
except as disclosed to Beech in writing prior to the execution of
this Agreement, as follows:



4.1 _Organization_. Each of Buyer and Buyer Sub is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation and has the corporate power to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, or in the case of Buyer Sub presently
proposed to be conducted, and to own all of its properties and assets. Buyer
is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do business and is in good
standing (to the extent the concept of good standing exists) in each
jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or held under lease
or the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except
where the failure to be so qualified will not have a Material Adverse Effect.



4.2 _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. Each of Buyer and Buyer Sub has
the corporate power to enter into this Agreement and to carry out its
obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Buyer
and Buyer Sub and the consummation by  



 

6  each such company of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
authorized by the respective boards of directors of Buyer and Buyer Sub and
this Agreement and each of the transactions contemplated hereby has been
approved by the Buyer as the sole stockholder of Buyer Sub, no other corporate
proceedings on the part of either such company are necessary to approve this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and this Agreement
constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Buyer and Buyer Sub,
enforceable against each in accordance with the Agreements terms, subject to
laws of general application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief
of debtors and the rules of law governing specific performance, injunctive
relief and other equitable remedies.



4.3 _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_. Except for applicable
requirements of state or foreign laws relating to takeovers, state securities
or blue sky laws, filings under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act of 1976 (" _HSR_ "), as amended, and filing and recordation of a
Certificate of Merger under the GCL, no filing with, and no permit,
authorization, consent or approval of, any public body or authority is
necessary for the consummation by Buyer or Buyer Sub of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Buyer or Buyer Sub, nor the consummation by Buyer or Buyer Sub
of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance by Buyer or Buyer Sub
with any of the provisions hereof, will (a) result in any breach of the
Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of either company, (b) result in a
violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of
time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration) under, or result in the acceleration or creation
of any material lien, pledge or security interest or other encumbrance on
assets under, or change any material rights or obligations under, any of the
terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
license, contract, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which Buyer
or Buyer Sub is a party or by which any of them or any of their properties or
assets may be bound, (c) violate any order, writ, injunction, judgment or
decree applicable to Buyer or Buyer Sub or any of its or their properties or
assets, or (d) violate any constitution, law, statute, rule or regulation
applicable to Buyer or Buyer Sub or any of its or their properties or assets

 (a) Buyer agrees that for acts occurring prior to the Effective Time, all rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses existing in favor of the directors and officers of Beech (the " _Indemnified Directors and Officers_ ") under the provisions existing on the date hereof of the Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws and indemnification agreements of Beech shall survive the Effective Time for a period of six (6) years, and Buyer agrees to indemnify and advance expenses during such six- (6) year period to the Indemnified Directors and Officers to the full extent required or permitted under the provisions existing on the date hereof of Beechs Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws and indemnification agreements. 



 (b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Buyer shall maintain, with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred before the Effective Time, officers and directors liability insurance covering the Indemnified Directors and Officers who are currently covered (in their capacities as officers and directors) by Beechs existing officers and directors liability insurance policies, on terms substantially no less advantageous to such officers and directors than such existing insurance for so long as the annual premium in respect thereof is not in excess of 150% of the last annual premium paid by Beech prior to the date hereof (the " _Current Premium_ "). If, during such six- (6) year period, Buyer determines that it is unable to maintain such liability insurance for a premium that is not in excess of 150% of the Current Premium, but maintains comparable liability insurance for persons who are directors and officers of Buyer or its affiliates, then Buyer may provide liability insurance to the Indemnified Directors and Officers for the remainder of such six- (6) year period on the same basis as Buyer maintains such liability insurance for persons who are then directors and officers of Buyer or its affiliates 



 (c) Buyer acknowledges that the transactions contemplated under this Agreement will trigger a change of control under the Bill Hale Employment Agreement and that the Surviving Corporation will succeed to Beechs obligations thereunder. The parties further acknowledge that Buyer intends to restructure the Bill Hale Employment Agreement without impacting the amount that Bill Hale is entitled to receive under the Bill Hale Employment Agreement as a result of the change of control triggered by the Merger. 



7.4 _Public Announcements_. Each of Buyer and Beech agrees that it will obtain
the approval of the other prior to issuing any press release with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or termination thereof and
will use its best efforts to consult with the others before otherwise making
any public statement or responding to any press inquiry with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or termination thereof,
except as may be required by law or any governmental agency.



7.5 _Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be



 

28  paid by the party incurring such expenses; provided, however, that the cost
of all filing fees to be paid in respect of any filings required by the HSR
shall be shared equally by Buyer and Beech.



7.6 _Additional Agreements_.



 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, including without limitation those set forth in the proviso to _Section 6.4_ hereof, each of the parties hereto agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using all reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary waivers, consents and approvals, and to effect all necessary registrations and filings. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers or directors of the Companies shall take all such necessary action. 



 (b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, including without limitation those set forth in the proviso to _Section 6.4_ hereof, Buyer and Beech will cooperate with each other and use all commercially reasonable efforts to prepare all necessary documentation to effect promptly all necessary filings and to obtain all necessary permits, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations of or any exemptions by, all third parties and governmental bodies necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 



(c) Each party will keep the other party apprised of the status of
any inquiries made of such party by any governmental agency or authority or
members of their respective staffs with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated herein.



7.7 _Confidentiality_. All confidential information disclosed by any party to
this Agreement to any other party to this Agreement in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be kept confidential by such other
party and shall not be used by such other party otherwise than as herein
contemplated, except to the extent that (a) it may be disclosed to such other
party, its lenders and potential lenders as well as to such other partys and
such lenders and potential lenders employees, accountants, financial
advisors, and representatives in connection with the contemplated transaction
so long as such lenders, potential lenders, employees, accountants, financial
advisors and representatives agree to keep such information confidential, (b)
it is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result
of a wrongful disclosure by a party receiving such confidential information
hereunder, (c) it was readily available to the party receiving such
information on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure hereunder, (d)
it was already lawfully in the receiving partys possession prior to its
disclosure hereunder, (e) it becomes available to the receiving party on a
non-confidential basis from a source other than the disclosing party hereunder
without violation of such sources confidentiality agreement with the
disclosing party or its representatives or of legal, fiduciary or ethical
constraints on disclosure of such information, (f) it may be required by law,
or (g) such duty as to confidentiality is waived by the other party. Such
obligation as to confidentiality and non-use shall survive the termination of
this Agreement for any reason. This _Section 7.7_ shall survive for three (3)
years from the date hereof and shall replace any prior confidentiality
agreements entered into by the parties hereto.

 (a) By mutual written consent of Buyer and Beech. 



 (b) By Buyer or Beech if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before October 31, 2005, unless the failure of the Effective Time to occur by such date shall be due to (i) the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein, or (ii) the fact that the HSR waiting period has not expired by such date.

ARTICLE X 

SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS __

_AND WARRANTIES; INDEMNIFICATION_



10.1 _Survival; Indemnification_.



 (a) No representations, warranties or agreements to be made or performed on or prior to the Closing Date and contained herein shall survive beyond the Effective Time except that (i) the agreements contained in _Sections 3.1_, _3.2_ , _3.3_ , _3.4_ , _3.5_ , _3.7_ , _7.3_ , _7.4_ , _7.5_ , _7.6_ , _7.7_ , and _9.2_ and _Articles X_ and _XI_ hereof shall survive beyond the Effective Time and (ii) the representations and warranties and other agreements of Buyer and Beech in this Agreement to be made or performed on or prior to the Closing Date shall survive beyond the Effective Time for one year following the Effective Time (the " _Termination Date_ "). 



 (b) The Surviving Corporation, Buyer, Buyer Sub and each of their officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives and affiliates (collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ," and individually each an " _Indemnitee_ ") (subject to the terms and conditions of _subparagraph (c)_ below) will be entitled to be indemnified and held harmless against and in respect of any claims, damages, losses, costs, expenses, liabilities (absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise), and reasonable legal fees and expenses (collectively, " _Losses_ ") incurred or suffered by any Indemnitee, directly or indirectly caused by or arising out of or related to (i) any untruth, inaccuracy, error in, or breach of, any representation or warranty of Beech contained in this Agreement, when made or deemed to be made, (ii) any breach or nonfulfillment by Beech of any of its covenants, agreements or other obligations hereunder, (iii) any amounts becoming due and payable prior to the Termination Date for contingent payment obligations arising under the Share Purchase Agreement (" _BestCare Agreement_ ") among Beech Street Corporation, BestCare Incorporated and Charles D. Calvi, Jr., dated as of September 10, 2004, or (iv) amounts paid by the Surviving Corporation on or prior to the Termination Date to former Beech employees upon  



 

32  termination of employment with the Surviving Corporation related to paid
time off accrued as of the Closing and not utilized prior to such
termination, determined on a first-in, first-out basis (i.e., oldest accrued
time would be deemed to be used up first as time off is taken subsequent to
Closing). The rights of the Indemnitees to indemnification under _Section
10.1(b)_ shall be satisfied first out of the Indemnification Escrow pursuant
to the terms of the Escrow Agreement described in _subparagraph (c)_ below.
All indemnification requests of the Indemnitees hereunder shall be made by or
through Buyer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article X_ ,
the reasonable legal fees and expenses of the Indemnitor shall be payable by
the Indemnitor separate and apart from the Indemnification Escrow, and the
reasonable legal fees and expenses of the Indemnitee with respect to a claim
of indemnification or a demand for the creation of a reserve for any
unliquidated claim shall be payable by the Indemnitor from the Indemnification
Escrow, unless (x) the Representative objects to the claim or the demand, (y)
an agreement between the Representative and the claiming Indemnitee is not
reached, and (z) at arbitration, the arbitrators determine that no part of the
Indemnification Escrow is to be delivered to the Indemnitee or is to be set
aside in a reserve for any unliquidated claim.



 (c) By voting to approve this Agreement or by surrendering his or her Certificate(s) evidencing Beech shares at Closing, each Stockholder (other than Stockholders who have perfected dissenter rights under the GCL) agrees that an amount equal to seven and one-half percent (7.5%) of the Purchase Price shall be placed in the Indemnification Escrow provided for in an Escrow Agreement to be entered into, as of the Effective Time, between Buyer, Beech and the Escrow Agent, in the form of _Exhibit "A"_ attached hereto. The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized from time to time to transfer all or any portion of the amounts so deposited in satisfaction of the indemnity obligation as contemplated in the Escrow Agreement. 



 (d) If any Indemnitee shall have any liquidated claim of indemnification pursuant to _subparagraph (b)_ above, it shall promptly request that Buyer give written notice thereof to the Representative (as defined in _subparagraph (h)_ below) and the Escrow Agent, including a brief description of the facts upon which such claim is based and the amount thereof. Any Indemnitee may also request that Buyer provide written notice to the Representative and the Escrow Agent of any unliquidated claim of indemnification pursuant to _subparagraph (b)_ above, including a brief description of the facts upon which such claim is based and a demand for a reserve amount to be created in respect of such claim. Any claim made by any Indemnitee for Losses that are unliquidated shall not be paid but funds equal to such claim shall be held in the Indemnification Escrow until such Losses are fully liquidated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amount will be delivered to an Indemnitee pursuant to a written claim notice (with respect to either a liquidated or unliquidated claim) pursuant to _subparagraph (b)_ above unless and only to the extent that the aggregate amount of Losses sustained by the Indemnitees as a group and as to which written claim notices have been given (other than Indemnitees reasonable legal fees and expenses with respect to any such claim and Losses caused by a breach or nonfulfillment by Beech of any of its covenants, agreements, obligations, representations or warranties set forth in _Sections 3.2_, _5.2_ , _6.1(b)_ , _6.1(c)(i)_ - _(vii)_ , _6.1(c)(ix)_ ,  _6.3_ or _6.9_ ) exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (taking into account any reduction of prior noticed claims resulting from the dispute resolution procedures of _subparagraph (e)_ below) at which point the Indemnitees shall be entitled to receive the aggregate Losses in excess of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the aggregate liability of the Stockholders for Losses under the Agreement shall not exceed an amount equal to (i) seven and  



 

33  one-half percent (7.5%) of the Purchase Price plus (ii), if the aggregate
amount of all Losses indemnifiable by Stockholders (including,
without limitation, the aggregate amount of Indemnitees total reasonable
legal fees and expenses related thereto) exceeds seven and one-half percent
(7.5%) of the Purchase Price, the lesser of (A) the total amount of such
excess, or (B) the sum of (1) the aggregate amount of Indemnitees reasonable
legal fees and expenses and (2) all Losses caused by a breach or
nonfulfillment by Beech of any of its covenants, agreements, obligations,
representations or warranties set forth in _Sections 3.2_, _5.2_ , _6.1(b)_
, _6.1(c)(i)_ - _(vii)_ , _6.1(c)(ix)_ , _6.3_ or _6.9_.



 (e) If the Representative shall notify the Escrow Agent in writing (within fifteen (15) days of delivery to the Escrow Agent by Buyer of a written notice of claim for indemnification) of his objection to a claim of indemnification or a demand for the creation of a reserve for any unliquidated claim (or the amount thereof), the Escrow Agent shall hold the disputed amount of funds in the Indemnification Escrow until the rights of the Beech Stockholders and the Indemnitees with respect thereto have been agreed upon between the Representative and the claiming Indemnitee. In the event such an agreement is reached, the claiming Indemnitee shall request Buyer to provide to the Escrow Agent a written notice signed by the Representative and the claiming Indemnitee in the form specified in the Escrow Agreement. If no such agreement has been reached, either the Indemnitee or the Representative may, not earlier than thirty (30) days after the date of the initial claim notice, submit the dispute to confidential, binding arbitration in Orange County, California before a panel of three arbitrators, one each to be selected by the Buyer and the Representative, and the third to be selected by the other two arbitrators, pursuant to the procedures and rules for commercial arbitration of the American Health Lawyers Association Alternative Dispute Resolution Service. The Escrow Agent may rely on the order or other determination of such arbitrators. If such arbitrators shall determine that any part of the Indemnification Escrow is to be delivered to an Indemnitee or is to be set aside in a reserve for any unliquidated claim, the Escrow Agent shall promptly following receipt of a copy of such determination establish such reserve or deliver to such Indemnitee the lesser of (i) the amount of the claim or claims as awarded to the Indemnitee to be satisfied, subject to the limitation set forth in _subparagraph (d)_ above, or (ii) the excess of seven and one-half percent (7.5%) of the Purchase Price over all amounts previously disbursed (or currently reserved) in respect of Losses (other than (x) Indemnitees reasonable legal fees and expenses and (y) Losses caused by a breach or nonfulfillment by Beech of any of its covenants, agreements, obligations, representations or warranties set forth in _Sections 3.2_, _5.2_ , _6.1(b)_ , _6.1(c)(i)_ - _(vii)_ , _6.1(c)(ix)_ , _6.3_ or _6.9_ ). Any disputed amounts not awarded to the Indemnitee shall promptly be transferred to the unreserved portion of the Indemnification Escrow. Buyer and the Representative shall each bear their respective costs and expenses of any such arbitration. 



 (f) On the Termination Date, the Escrow Agent shall distribute to the Stockholders on a proportional basis consistent with _Section 3.1_ all remaining amounts in the Indemnification Escrow, less an amount equal to the dollar amount of all claims pursuant to _subparagraph (d)_ above that are still in process of resolution pursuant to  _subparagraph (d)_ above. No new claims may be brought under this _Section 10.1_ after the Termination Date with respect to representations and warranties to be made on or prior to the Closing Date hereunder or agreements to be performed prior to the Closing Date hereunder. 



 

34 (g) After the Termination Date, (i) as each matter referred to in _subparagraph (e)_ above is resolved or otherwise concluded and (ii) as each undisputed unliquidated claim under _subparagraph (b)_ above which remains unliquidated as of the Termination Date is liquidated, the Escrow Agent shall distribute to the Stockholders their respective share in the Indemnification Escrow then determined by the Escrow Agent to be free of any rights of any Indemnitee under _subparagraphs (b)_ through  _(d)_ above, and, when all such matters are resolved and such claims are liquidated, the obligations under _subparagraph (b)_ above shall terminate with respect to representations and warranties to be made on or prior to the Closing Date hereunder or agreements to be performed prior to the Closing Date hereunder. The Indemnification Escrow shall be terminated when all of the funds in the Indemnification Escrow shall have been disbursed in accordance with the provisions hereof and the Escrow Agreement. 



 (h) As of the Effective Time of the Merger, the Stockholders shall, by virtue of the approval of this Agreement by the requisite vote of the Stockholders, be deemed, for themselves and their heirs and representatives and successors, to have constituted and appointed, effective from the Effective Time, Norman H. Werthwein, as their agent and attorney-in-fact (the " _Representative_ ") to take all action required or permitted under the Indemnification Escrow as provided in the Escrow Agreement or herein with respect to the interests and rights of the Stockholders. In the event of the death, physical or mental incapacity or resignation of the Representative a replacement Representative shall be appointed as provided in the Escrow Agreement. 



In taking any action whatsoever hereunder, the Representative shall be
protected in relying upon any notice, paper or other document reasonably
believed by him to be genuine, or upon any evidence reasonably deemed by them
to be sufficient. The Representative may consult with counsel in connection
with his duties hereunder and shall be fully protected in any act taken,
suffered or permitted by him in good faith or in accordance with the advice of
counsel. The Representative shall not be liable to the Stockholders for the
performance of any act or the failure to act so long as he acted or failed to
act in good faith within what he reasonably believed to be the scope of his
authority and for a purpose which he reasonably believed to be in the best
interests of the Stockholders.



10.2  _Indemnification by Buyer and the Surviving Corporation_. Subject to
_Section 10.5(b)_, Buyer at all relevant times hereunder, and the Surviving
Corporation, after the Closing Date, jointly and severally, covenant and agree
to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholders and their heirs and
successors from and against, and shall compensate and reimburse the
Stockholders for, any Losses that are suffered or incurred by the Stockholders
(regardless of whether such Losses relate to any third-party claim), directly
or indirectly arising or resulting from or connected with (a) any breach of
any representation or warranty made by Buyer or Buyer Sub in this Agreement;
or (b) any breach of any covenant, agreement or other obligation of Buyer or
Buyer Sub contained in this Agreement.



10.3 _Procedure_. In the event that at any time or from time to time after the
Effective Time a person indemnified under _Section 10.1_ or _Section 10.2_
(" _Indemnified Party_ ") shall sustain a Loss, such Indemnified Party shall
notify the party hereto obligated to provide such indemnification (the "
_Indemnitor_ ") of any such Loss so sustained. If Indemnitor is Buyer,
Indemnitor shall within thirty (30) days after transmittal of such notice pay
to such Indemnified



 

35  Party the amount of such Loss so sustained, subject to the right to contest
any claim which has not yet resulted in a Loss, as herein provided. If
Indemnitor is the Escrow Agent, payment shall be governed by the Escrow
Agreement. The Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnitor of the
existence of any claim, demand, or other matter involving liabilities to third
parties to which the Indemnitors indemnification obligations would apply.
The Buyer shall have a reasonable opportunity to defend the same or prosecute
such action to conclusion or settlement satisfactory to the Representative
with counsel of the Buyers selection (who shall be approved by
Representative, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld); provided
that the Representative shall at all times also have the right to fully
participate in the defense at its own expense. If the Buyer shall, within a
reasonable time after said notice, fail to defend, the Representative shall
have the right, but not the obligation, to undertake the defense of, and to
compromise or settle (exercising reasonable business judgment) the claim or
other matter on behalf, for the account, and at the risk and expense of
Indemnitor. Neither the Indemnitor nor the Indemnified Party shall compromise
or settle the claim or other matter without the prior written consent of the
other. If the claim is one that cannot by its nature be defended solely by
the Buyer, the Representative shall make available all information and
assistance that the Buyer may reasonably request; provided that any associated
expenses shall be payable out of the Indemnification Escrow.



10.4 _Contest; Challenge_. If Indemnitor contests or challenges any claim or
action asserted against Indemnified Party referred to in this Article, it
shall do so at its own cost and expense, holding Indemnified Party harmless
from all costs, fees, expenses, debts, liabilities and charges in connection
with such contest; shall diligently defend against any such claim; and shall
hold Indemnified Partys business and assets free and harmless from any
attachment, execution, judgment, lien or other legal process. 



10.5 _Sole Remedy_.



 (a) Other than rights to equitable relief or claims for fraud, to the extent available under applicable law or under applicable securities laws, the sole remedy available to any Indemnitee or other person for breaches of this Agreement or any other agreement or transaction contemplated hereby shall be limited to the rights set forth in this _Article X_. The maximum aggregate amounts payable by the Stockholders to any and all of the Indemnitees for any and all Losses arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement, any agreement contemplated hereby, any certificate, any other document delivered, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, are the amounts specified as limitations in _Section 10.1_ hereof. In no event will any other person except the named Indemnitees have any rights to any payments whatsoever. 



 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the maximum aggregate liability of the Buyer, Buyer Sub and the Surviving Corporation, in the aggregate for any and all Losses under the Agreement (other than the obligation to pay the Purchase Price due at Closing hereunder) shall not exceed seven and one-half percent (7.5%) of the Purchase Price, and (ii) Buyer shall not be liable under _Section 10.2_ or otherwise unless and until the Losses for which it would otherwise be liable exceed One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), at which point Buyer shall become liable for the aggregate amount of Losses in excess of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000).
