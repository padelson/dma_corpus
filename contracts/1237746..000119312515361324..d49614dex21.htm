accordance with Section 259 of the DGCL.

 

Section 2.02 _The Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will
take place at 9:01 a.m., (New York City time), as soon as practicable after
(but in any event no later than the third (3rd) Business Day after) the
satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions
set forth in _Article 7_ (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
(to the extent permitted hereunder) of such conditions at the Closing) unless
another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be obligated to effect the Closing prior
to the third (3rd) Business Day following the final day of the
Marketing Period or such earlier date as Parent shall request on two (2)
Business Days prior written notice to the Company (but, subject in such case,
to the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions set forth in _Article 7_
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted
hereunder) of such conditions at the Closing)). The Closing shall be held at
the offices of Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton LLP, One Liberty Plaza, New
York, New York, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto.

 

Section 2.03 _Effecting the Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL,
concurrently with the Closing, Parent and the Company shall cause a
certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed,

State of Delaware for filing, all in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the DGCL.

Section 2.04 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective on such date
and at such time as when the Certificate of Merger has been received for
filing by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later
time and date as may be agreed by the parties hereto in writing and specified

18 Section 2.05 _Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall
be merged with and into the Company in accordance with the DGCL, whereupon
the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall be the
surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), and the
separate corporate existence of the Company, with all its rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger.

 

Section 2.06 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the applicable provisions of the DGCL, this Agreement and the
Certificate of Merger.

Section 2.07 _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holders thereof or any other Person:

(a) except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.07(b)_, _Section 2.09_ or
_Section 2.10_, each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive $32.00 without
interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ ");

(b) each Share held by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled without any conversion thereof and no
payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto; and

 

(c) each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid,
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 2.08 _Surrender and Payment_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent and Payment Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
appoint a paying agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration
certificates representing Shares (the " _Certificates_ ;" _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any references herein to "Certificates" are deemed to
include references to effective affidavits of loss in accordance with _Section
2.14_ or to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of
Shares). As of the Effective Time, Parent shall have deposited, or shall have
taken all steps necessary to enable and cause the Surviving Corporation to
deposit, with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid
in respect of the Certificates (the " _Payment Fund_ "). Promptly after the
Effective Time and in any event no later than three (3) Business Days after
the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Paying Agent to
send, to each record holder of Shares at the Effective Time, in each case
whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 2.07(a)_, a letter of transmittal and instructions
(which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery or transfer of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other
customary provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) for use in such
payment.

 



19 (b) _Surrender of Shares_. Each holder of Shares that have been converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive
the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares represented by a Certificate
promptly upon (i) surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together
with a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and such
other customary documents as may reasonably be requested by the Paying Agent
or Parent, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or
such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent or Parent may
reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Shares. Until so
surrendered or transferred, each Share and each such Certificate shall
represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive
such Merger Consideration and no other rights or interests whatsoever. No
interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender or
transfer of such Certificate.

 

(c) _Unregistered Transferees_. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is
to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i)
either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall
pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Tax required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid
or is not payable.

(d) _No Other Rights_. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of
Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate and from and after the Effective Time, there
shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for transfer,
the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall provide the holder of such
Certificates with such instructions as may be necessary to permit such holder
to receive the Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to the Merger.

 

(e) _Termination of the Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand,
and any such holder who has not exchanged Shares for the Merger Consideration
in accordance with this _Section 2.08_ prior to that time shall thereafter
look only to the Surviving Corporation as a general creditor thereof for
payment of the Merger Consideration.

 

Section 2.09 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section 2.07_ or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled
to appraisal and who has properly exercised appraisal rights for such shares
in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall
not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead
shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder
of Dissenting Shares; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if, after the Effective
Time, such holder fails to timely perfect,

 



20  effectively withdraws or loses such holders right to appraisal, pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section
262 of the DGCL, such Shares shall immediately cease to be Dissenting Shares
and shall be treated as if they had been Shares converted as of the Effective
Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with
_Section 2.07(a)_, without interest thereon, upon surrender of such
Certificate formerly representing such Share. The Company shall provide Parent
prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of
Shares, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or
instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL that relate to such demand, and Parent shall have the
opportunity and right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned), the
Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or
actually settle, or otherwise negotiate any such demands.

 

Section 2.10 _Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Company Stock Options_. The Company shall take all requisite action so
that, as of the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as follows:

(i) Each Company Stock Option held by a Small Holder shall be fully vested
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each non-Executive who is not a Small
Holder (a " _Non-Executive Holder_ ") shall have twenty-five percent (25%) of
any unvested Company Stock Options granted prior to November 2, 2015 vest in
full (pro rata as to all grants to such Non-Executive Holder) immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

(ii) As of the Effective Time, each (A) vested In-the-Money Company Stock
Option that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (taking into account any accelerated vesting immediately prior
to the Effective Time as provided in _Section 2.10(a)(i)_ or required
pursuant to the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan or any individual
award agreement governing such Company Stock Option), and (B) outstanding and
unexercised Company Stock Option held by a Small Holder (each of (A) and (B),
a " _Cashed Out Option_ ") that is outstanding and unexercised as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of the holder of
such Cashed Out Option with respect thereto, an amount in cash, rounding such
amount down to the nearest whole cent, equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Cashed Out Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(y) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration _less_ the exercise price
per share of Company Common Stock issuable under such Cashed Out Option (the
" _Option Consideration_ "). All payments provided pursuant to this _Section
2.10(a)(ii)_ shall be subject to any applicable Tax withholding requirements.
In no event shall any Company Stock Options described in this _Section
2.10(a)(ii)_ be assumed by Parent. If the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock issuable under any Cashed Out Option equals or exceeds the Merger
Consideration, the Option Consideration therefor shall be zero. 

 



21 (iii) Except as described in _Section 2.10(a)(ii)_, as of the Effective Time,
each (A) unvested Company Stock Option (whether or not an In-the-Money
Company Stock Option) and (B) each vested Out-of-the-Money Company Stock
Option, in the case of each of (A) and (B), held by any individual or entity
other than a Small Holder (the " _Assumed Options_ "), that is outstanding
and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be assumed by
Parent and shall be converted into and replaced with a stock option (a "
_Parent Stock Option_ ") to acquire Parent Stock in accordance with this
_Section 2.10_. Each such Parent Stock Option so assumed and converted shall
continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as
applied to such Assumed Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (but
taking into account any changes thereto provided for in the applicable Company
Stock Plan, in any award agreement or in such Assumed Option by reason of this
Agreement or the Merger). Except as described in _Section 2.10(a)(ii)_, as
of the Effective Time, each such Parent Stock Option as so assumed and
converted shall be for that number of whole shares of Parent Stock (rounded
down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Assumed Option _multiplied by_
(ii) a fraction (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), the numerator of which is the
Merger Consideration and the denominator of which is the volume weighted
average price of Parent Stock for a ten (10) trading day period, starting with
the opening of trading on the eleventh (11th) trading day prior to the
Closing Date to the closing of trading on the second to last trading day prior
to the Closing Date, as reported by Bloomberg. The exercise price per share of
such Parent Stock Option (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) shall
equal (x) the per share exercise price for the Company Common Stock subject
to such Assumed Option immediately prior to the Effective Time _divided by_
(y) the Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , that the exercise price and the number
of shares of Parent Stock subject to the Parent Stock Option shall be
determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the
Code, and, in the case of Assumed Options that are intended to qualify as
incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code,
consistent with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code.

(b) _Company RSUs_. The Company shall take all requisite action so that, as
of the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be treated as follows:

 

(i) (A) all Company RSUs held by Small Holders will vest in full, (B) all
Company RSUs that vest based on the achievement of total shareholder return
performance goals shall vest in accordance with the terms set forth in the
applicable award agreement, and (C) twenty-five percent (25%) of the Company
RSUs that vest based solely on continued employment granted prior to November
2, 2015 (but excluding the Company RSUs scheduled on Section 2.10(b)(i) of the
Company Disclosure Schedules) that are held by a Non-Executive Holder will
vest (pro rata as to all applicable grants to such Non-Executive Holder). 

(ii) Each Company RSU that vests based on the achievement of revenue or other
metrics (each a " _CAGR RSU_ ") (A) will be deemed earned at the one hundred
percent (100%) target level and (B) shall vest on the last day of the original
applicable measurement period subject to continued employment through the last
day of the original applicable measurement period or earlier accelerated
vesting upon certain terminations of employment, if any, as provided by the
terms of the individual award agreements governing the CAGR RSUs or such
holders retention or employment agreement with the Company or any Company
Subsidiary.

 



22 (iii) Each vested Company RSU (after taking into account any vesting
accelerated by reason of  _Section 2.10(b)(i)_ and the terms of any
applicable Company Stock Plan or any individual award agreement governing such
Company RSU) (the " _Cashed Out Company RSUs_ "), at the Effective Time and by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders
thereof, shall be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into the right
to receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of the holder of such Company
RSU with respect thereto, an amount in cash, rounding such amount down to the
nearest whole cent, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Cashed Out
Company RSUs immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Merger
Consideration (the " _RSU Consideration_ ").

(iv) Each Company RSU that is not a Cashed Out Company RSU shall at the
Effective Time be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into a restricted
stock unit award for Parent Stock (the " _Parent RSUs_ ") with associated
rights to the issuance of additional shares of Parent Stock in accordance
with this _Section 2.10_. Each Parent RSU so assumed and converted shall
continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as
applied to the applicable Company RSUs immediately prior to the Effective
Time (but taking into account any changes thereto, including any necessary
changes to any issuance provisions, provided for or permitted in the
applicable Company Stock Plan, in any award agreement or in such Company RSUs,
by reason of this Agreement or the Merger). As of the Effective Time, the
number of shares of Parent Stock underlying each such Parent RSU as so assumed
and converted shall be equal to the product of (x) the Shares underlying the
applicable Company RSUs _multiplied by _ the Exchange Ratio (which shall be
rounded (x) up to the nearest whole share if half a share or more or (y) down
to the nearest whole share if less than half a share).

 

(c) Any current or former employee of the Company entitled to Option
Consideration or RSU Consideration shall be paid, without interest
and subject to applicable withholding Tax, such Option Consideration and/or
RSU Consideration through the payroll system of the Surviving Corporation or,
if not a current or former employee of the Company, through the Paying Agent,
in each case, payable as soon as practicable following the Closing Date (and,
in the case of current or former employees of the Company, in no event later
than the next regularly scheduled payroll run of the Surviving Corporation
following the Closing Date).

 

(d) _Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. As soon as practicable following
the date of this Agreement, the Company shall take all requisite actions,
including adopting any necessary resolution, to (i) terminate the Company 2007
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Company ESPP_ ") as of immediately prior
to the Closing Date, (ii) ensure that no Plan Period (as defined in the
Company ESPP) shall be commenced on or after the date of this Agreement, (iii)
if the Closing shall occur prior to the end of the Plan Period in existence
under the Company ESPP on the date of this Agreement, cause a new Exercise
Date (as defined in the Company ESPP) to be set under the Company ESPP, which
date shall be the Business Day immediately prior to the anticipated Closing
Date, (iv) prohibit participants in the Company ESPP from altering
their payroll deductions from those in effect on the date of this Agreement
(other than to discontinue their participation in the Company ESPP in
accordance with the terms

 



23  and conditions of the Company ESPP), and (v) provide that the amount of the
accumulated contributions of each participant under the Company ESPP as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, to the extent not used to
purchase Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Company
ESPP (as amended pursuant to this _Section 2.10(d)_), be refunded to such
participant as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (without
interest).

(e) _Authorization of Equity Award Treatment_. At or prior to the Effective
Time, the Company Board and the Compensation Committee of such Company Board,
as applicable shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions (including
delivering all required notices, obtaining any employee consents and making
any determinations) that may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of
this _Section 2.10_ and _Section 6.01(b)(ii)_. At or prior to the Effective
Time, other than as set forth in _Section 2.10(a)(iii)_ and _Section
2.10(b)(iv)_, the Company shall terminate each Company Stock Option and each
Company RSU without any further Liability on the part of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

 

Section 2.11 _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split) or combination,
exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend, all
references herein to specified numbers of shares affected thereby, and any
calculations that are based upon such numbers of shares affected thereby,
including the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to
this Agreement, shall be appropriately adjusted. Nothing in this _Section
2.11_ shall be construed as permitting the Company to take any action that is
otherwise prohibited by this Agreement.

 

Section 2.12 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold from such
payment under any provision of any applicable Tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted and withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction, withholding and payment was made. Any
amounts so withheld shall be timely paid over to an appropriate Taxing
Authority.

 

Section 2.13 _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any cash from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to and in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Applicable Law. If any Certificate shall not have been
surrendered immediately prior to such date on which any amounts payable
pursuant to this _Article 2_ would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Authority, any such amounts shall, to the extent permitted
by Applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



24 Section 2.14 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
customary amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will
issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares formerly represented by
such Certificate, as contemplated under this _Article 2_.

Section 2.15 _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of Shares shall
thereafter be made.

 

ARTICLE 3

any further action on the part of the Company or Merger Sub, the certificate

of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with its terms and Applicable Law.

Section 3.02 _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time and without any further action
on the part of the Company or Merger Sub, the bylaws of Merger Sub (which

duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the Applicable
Law of the state of Delaware. The Company has full corporate power and
authority required to carry on its business as now conducted. The Company is
duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except
for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified has not had, and

has Made Available correct and complete copies of the Organizational Documents
of the Company as of the date of this Agreement and (i) the Organizational

in the case of the consummation of the Merger, the receipt of the Requisite
Stockholder Approval. The Company has duly executed and delivered this
Agreement and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent
and Merger Sub, this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of

Section 6.02 _Go-Shop; Non-Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing
until 11:59 p.m., New York time, on November 21, 2015, the Company and its
Representatives may, directly or indirectly (i) initiate, solicit, seek,
authorize, or encourage or facilitate the submission or making of,
any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal,
offer or request for information, with respect to, or that could reasonably be
expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate or engage in
negotiations or discussions with, or furnish any information concerning the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to, any Third Party relating to an
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal, offer
or request for information that could reasonably be expected to result in an
Acquisition Proposal (but only if, prior to so furnishing such information,
the Company (A) receives from such Third Party an executed Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement or (B) if such Third Party is already party with
the Company to a valid and existing confidentiality agreement as of the date
of this Agreement, amends such existing agreement so that it is an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement), (iii) grant a waiver under any "standstill"
provisions or similar obligations of any Person with respect to the Company to
allow such Person to submit an Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) resolve or agree
to do any of the foregoing; _provided_ , that the Company shall promptly (and
in any case within forty-eight (48) hours) provide to Parent any material
nonpublic information concerning the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, as
provided to any such Third Party and that was not previously provided
to Parent or Made Available. No later than 12:00 noon, New York time, on
November 22, 2015, the Company shall notify Parent in writing of the identity
of each Excluded Party or confirm to Parent that there are no Excluded
Parties, as the case may be, and the Company shall promptly provide to
Parent: (i) an unredacted copy of the most recent Acquisition Proposal made in
writing by such Excluded Party (including any related financing commitments)
and (ii) a written summary of the material terms of the most recent
Acquisition Proposal made (but not in writing) by such Excluded Party
(including any related financing commitments).

 

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 6.02_, from 12:01 a.m.,
New York time, on November 22, 2015 (the " _No-Shop Start Date_ ") until the
Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, the Company will not, and shall cause its Affiliates and its
and their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i)
initiate, solicit, authorize or knowingly encourage, or knowingly facilitate
the submission or making of, any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry,
expression of interest, proposal, offer or request for information that could

of interest, proposal, offer or request for information that could reasonably
be expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into any
Competing Acquisition Arrangement relating to an Acquisition Proposal or (iv)
resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing. On the No-Shop Start Date

Party on the date such Excluded Party ceases to be an Excluded Party,
the Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their
respective Representatives to, (A) immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry,
expression of interest, proposal, offer or request for information that could
reasonably be expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal, (B) terminate
access by any Third Party to any physical or electronic data room or other
access to data of the Company, in each case relating to or in connection with,
any Acquisition Proposal and (C) enforce the provisions of any existing
confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement entered into with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or any potential Acquisition Transaction, including any
standstill provisions contained therein. Notwithstanding the commencement of
the Companys obligations under this _Section 6.02(b)_ on the No-Shop Start
Date, the parties agree that the Company may continue to engage in the
activities described in _Section 6.02(a)_ with respect to any Excluded Party
on and after the No-Shop Start Date until the earlier of the time (A) the
Requisite Stockholder Approval is obtained and (B) such Person or group ceases
to be an Excluded Party. Any material violation of the restrictions set forth
in this _Section 6.02_ by any Representative of the Company or any of its
Affiliates shall constitute a breach of this _Section 6.02_ by the Company.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if,
at any time on or after the No-Shop Start Date and prior to the receipt of the
Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company receives an unsolicited, written
bona fide Acquisition Proposal (which Acquisition Proposal was made after the
date of this Agreement or which Acquisition Proposal was made or renewed on or
after the No-Shop Start Date and did not result from a material breach of this
_Section 6.02_), the Company and the Company Board and their Representatives
may, subject to compliance with this _Section 6.02(c)_, engage in
negotiations or discussions with, or furnish any information and access to,
any Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives if,
and only if, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result
in, a Superior Proposal and failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under Applicable Law; _provided_ , that (i) prior to providing access to or
furnishing any such information, the Company (A) receives from such Third
Party an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement or (B) if such Third
Party is already party with the Company to a valid and existing
confidentiality agreement as of the date of this Agreement, amends such
existing agreement so that it is an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, (ii)
any such information so furnished has been previously provided to Parent or
Made Available or is provided to Parent substantially concurrently with it
being so furnished to such Third Party and (iii) the Company shall give Parent
written notice of such determination promptly after the Company Board makes
such determination and in any event prior to furnishing any such information
or engaging in such negotiations or discussions.

 



59 (d) Except as otherwise provided in the last sentence of this _Section
6.02(d)_ and  _Section 6.02(e)_, until the Effective Time or, if earlier,
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw (or qualify or
modify in any manner adverse to Parent), or publicly propose to withdraw (or
so qualify or modify), the Board Recommendation, (ii) fail to include the
Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement; (iii) if an Acquisition Proposal
has been made by a Third Party or a Material Development (as defined below)
has occurred, fail to publicly reaffirm the Board Recommendation within three
(3) Business Days after Parent so requests in writing, (iv) fail to recommend,
in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, against any
Acquisition Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act within
ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such Acquisition Proposal, or
(v) approve, adopt or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, or propose publicly
to approve, adopt or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described
in clauses (i) though (v) is referred to herein as a " _Change in
Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, at any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder
Approval, in the event a material development or material change in
circumstances (other than relating to or in connection with an Acquisition
Proposal) occurs or arises after the date of this Agreement (any such
development or change, a " _Material Development_ ") that was not known and
not reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the date of
this Agreement, the Company Board may make a Change in Recommendation under
clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of the definition thereof if the Company Board
determines in good faith that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the stockholders of
the Company under Applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Company has provided
Parent four (4) Business Days prior written notice advising Parent that it
intends to take such action and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons
for such action.

(e) At any time prior to receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, if,
in response to a written bona fide Acquisition Proposal first made after the
date of this Agreement that did not result from a material breach of this
_Section 6.02_, the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that (i)
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure
to approve or recommend such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with the
Company Boards fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under
Applicable Law, the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.01(d)(i)_ and this _Section 6.02(e)_; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)(i)_
and this _Section 6.02(e)_ unless the Company (x) has complied in all
material respects with this _Section 6.02_, including its obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.02(e)_ and _Section 6.02(f)_, (y) pays, or causes
to be paid, to Parent the Company Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section
8.03(a)_ prior to or concurrently with such termination and (z) substantially
concurrently with such termination, enters into a definitive Alternative
Acquisition Agreement that documents the terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 6.02(e)_ and _Section 8.01(d)(i)_, (x) unless the Company shall
have provided to Parent four (4) Business Days prior written notice (the "
_Superior Proposal Notice_ ") advising Parent that the Company intends to
take such action (and specifying, in reasonable detail, the terms and
conditions of any such

 



60  Superior Proposal, including the identity of the Third Party who has made
such Superior Proposal) and, if applicable, provided Parent a copy of the
relevant proposed transaction agreement or the latest draft thereof
(including any related financing commitments) or, if no such agreement or
draft exists, a written summary of the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal, and (y):

 

(i) during such four (4) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the
Company shall have engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent (and the
Company shall have caused its Affiliates and Representatives, including,
without limitation, its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, to have
engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives)
regarding changes to the terms of this Agreement intended to cause such
Acquisition Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; and

(ii) the Company shall have considered any adjustments to this Agreement
(including a change to the price terms hereof) and any other agreements that
may be proposed in writing by Parent (the " _Proposed Changed Terms_ ") no
later than 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the third (3rd) Business Day of
such four (4) Business Day period and shall have determined in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors)
that the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if
such Proposed Changed Terms were to be given effect.

 

The parties acknowledge and agree that, (A) if Parent, within four (4)
Business Days following its receipt of a Superior Proposal Notice makes
a proposal that, as determined in good faith by the Company Board (after
consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors) results in the
applicable Acquisition Proposal no longer being a Superior Proposal, then the
Company shall have no right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
6.02(e)_ or _Section 8.01(d)(i)_ as a result of such Acquisition Proposal,
and (B) any (1) material revisions to the terms of a Superior Proposal or (2)
material revisions to an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board had
determined no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal, shall constitute a new
Acquisition Proposal, and shall in each case require the Company to deliver to
Parent a new Superior Proposal Notice and comply with the requirements of
this _Section 6.02(f)_ with respect to such new Superior Proposal Notice,
except that the references to a four (4) Business Day period shall be deemed
to be references to a three (3) Business Day period.

(g) From and after the No-Shop Start Date, the Company shall promptly (and in
any event within twenty-four (24) hours) advise Parent orally or in writing
in the event that the Company receives any Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry, expression of interest, proposal, offer or request for information
that could reasonably be expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal, and
in connection with such notice, provide to Parent the material terms and
conditions (including the identity of the Third Party making any such
Acquisition Proposal and copies of any documentation, including copies of any
related financing commitments) received by the Company with respect to any
such Acquisition Proposal. From and after the No-Shop Start Date, the Company
shall (i) promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) notify
Parent of any material change to the terms of any such Acquisition Proposal
(including any determination by the Company Board pursuant to  _Section
6.02(c)_) and (ii) provide to Parent as soon as practicable (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt from any Third Party of any
written indication of interest (or amendment thereto) or any written material

 



61  received in connection therewith (or amendment thereto) including copies of
any proposed Competing Acquisition Arrangements (including any drafts thereof)
and any proposed financing commitments related thereto (including drafts
thereof).

(h) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through their respective
Representatives, from (i) taking and disclosing any position or disclosing any
information reasonably required under Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making
any "stop, look and listen" communication to the Companys stockholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ ,
that no Change in Recommendation may be made except in accordance with the
terms hereof.

Time, to its officers, employees, agents, properties, books, Contracts and
records and shall furnish Parent and Merger Sub all financial, operating and
other data and information in the Companys or any Company
Subsidiarys possession or control as Parent and Merger Sub through their
officers, employees or agents, may reasonably request, _provided_ , _however_
, that the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not be required to
provide access to any information or documents which would, in the reasonable
judgment of the Company after consultation with its outside legal counsel (i)
breach any Contract with any Person or violate any Applicable Law, or (ii)
result in a loss or waiver of the attorney-client or other privilege held by
the Company or any Company Subsidiary (it being agreed that the Company shall
give notice to Parent of the fact that it is withholding such information or
documents pursuant to clause (i) or clause (ii) above, and thereafter the
Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate to cause such information to be
provided in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to waive the
applicable privilege or protection or violate the applicable restriction);
_provided_ , _further_ , that any access or investigation pursuant to this
_Section 6.03(a)_ shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the business and operations of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary.

to affect or modify any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein, the conditions to the obligations of the parties to
consummate the Merger in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof or
otherwise prejudice in any way the rights and remedies of Parent or Merger Sub
hereunder, nor shall any such information, knowledge or investigation be

the Companys reasonable security measures and insurance requirements. The

information obtained by Parent or any of its

 



62  Representatives in connection with any investigation conducted pursuant to
the access contemplated by this _Section 6.03_. Nothing in this _Section
6.03_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to require the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective Representatives to
prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other information.

 

Section 6.04 _Notice of Certain Events_. During the Pre-Closing Period, each
party hereto shall promptly notify the other in writing of:

connection with the Merger;

(b) any notice or other communication received by such party or any of its
Subsidiaries from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby; and

 

(c) any fact, event or circumstance known to it that would be reasonably
expected to result in (i) the failure of any representation or warranty of
such party contained in this Agreement to be true or accurate at or prior to
the Closing or (ii) any failure of such party to comply with any of such
partys covenants or agreements hereunder, in the case of each of
the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), only to the extent that any such failure,
when considered together with all other such failures, would reasonably be
expected to result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in
_Article 7_ to be satisfied; _provided_ , that the failure to deliver any
notice pursuant to this _Section 6.04_ shall not be considered in determining
whether the conditions set forth in _Article 7_ have been satisfied;

pursuant to this _Section 6.04_ shall (A) limit or otherwise affect any of
the representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or conditions
contained in this Agreement, (B) otherwise prejudice in any way the rights and
remedies contained in this Agreement, (C) be deemed to affect or modify
such partys reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements made by the other parties in this Agreement or (D) be deemed to
amend or supplement the Company Disclosure Schedules or prevent or cure any
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach of covenant by such party.

Section 6.05 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "control share acquisition,"
"business combination," "fair price," "moratorium" or other anti-takeover
Applicable Law becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby, then
each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, and their respective Boards of
Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so

contemplated hereby and otherwise act to render such anti-takeover Applicable
Law inapplicable to the foregoing.

part under Applicable Law and rules and policies of Nasdaq to enable the
delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the Shares from Nasdaq and
the deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time (if such delisting and deregistration
will not have already occurred at or prior to the Effective Time).

 

(b) At the Closing, upon the written request of Parent or its Representatives,
the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence reasonably satisfactory to

Time), effective at the Effective Time.

Section 6.08 _Director and Officer Liability_.

 

(a) To the fullest extent required by the Organizational Documents of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as in effect on the date hereof (except
as may be limited by Applicable Laws), after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, advance expenses and hold
harmless all individuals who on or prior to the Effective Time were the
current and former directors and officers of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates or any of their
predecessors in all of their capacities (including as a stockholder,
controlling or otherwise) or who were serving at the request of the Company
or a Company Subsidiary as an officer or director of any other corporation,
partnership or joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise, including, in each case, the heirs, executors, trustees,
fiduciaries and administrators of any such officer or director (each, an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") from and against any and all costs, fees and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and investigation expenses), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any Proceeding or inquiry to the extent such Proceeding or
inquiry arises directly or indirectly out of or pertains directly or
indirectly to (i) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in
their capacities as such or taken at the request of any of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates (regardless of whether
such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to or
at the Effective Time), or (ii) any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, subject to the Expense Limitation (as
defined below), the Company shall or, if the Company is unable to, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to, obtain and
fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of the directors and
officers liability coverage of the Companys existing directors and
officers insurance policies and the Companys existing fiduciary liability
insurance policies (collectively, the " _D andO Insurance_"), in each case for
a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after
the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period of time at
or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as the Companys current DandO Insurance carrier with
respect to directors and officers

 



64  liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable to the
Indemnified Parties as the Companys existing policies. If the Company or the
Surviving Corporation for any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies as of the Effective Time, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall,
subject to the Expense Limitation, continue to maintain in effect, for a
period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO
Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement with the Companys current
insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current DandO Insurance carrier with respect to
directors and officers liability insurance in an amount and scope at least
as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as the Companys existing policies, or
(ii) Parent will, subject to the Expense Limitation, cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide, for a period of not less than six years after the
Effective Time, the Indemnified Parties who are insured under the Companys
DandO Insurance with comparable DandO Insurance that provides coverage for events
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Companys current DandO Insurance carrier,
that is no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties than the existing policy
of the Company or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is
unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
satisfying its obligation under this _Section 6.08(b)_, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay, and the Company shall not
pay, annual premiums (or the equivalent thereof in the case of a fully-paid
policy) in excess of 200% (the " _Expense Limitation_ ") of the amount
per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year prior to the date of
this Agreement (the " _Current Premium_ ") and if such premiums for such
insurance would at any time exceed the Expense Limitation, then Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain policies of insurance that
provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the
Expense Limitation. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain
such policies in full force and effect for their full term, and continue to
honor the obligations thereunder.

 

(c) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation, expense
advancement and indemnification for acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time existing as of the date of this Agreement in favor of the
Indemnified Parties, as provided in the Companys or each of the Company
Subsidiaries respective Organizational Documents or in any agreement, shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries to fully honor in all
respects the respective obligations of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, as applicable, to the maximum extent permitted under Applicable
Law, including pursuant to (i) each indemnification agreement in effect
between the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and an Indemnified
Party; and (ii) any indemnification provision, any expense advancement
provision, and any exculpation provision set forth in the Companys or each of
the Company Subsidiaries respective Organizational Documents or in any
agreement as in effect on the date of this Agreement. In addition, for a
period of six years following the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, cause the
Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
contain provisions with respect to indemnification, expense advancement and
exculpation that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as the
indemnification, expense advancement and exculpation provisions contained in
the Organizational Documents of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and during such six-year period, such
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner
that is less favorable to any Indemnified Party in any material respect.

 



65 (d) The provisions of this _Section 6.08_ shall survive the Closing and
are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her Representatives and (ii) in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification,
expense advancement, or contribution that any such individual may have under
the Organizational Documents of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any Applicable Law
or under any agreement that any such individual may be party to with the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the obligations under this _Section 6.08_
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
any Indemnified Party without the consent of such Indemnified Party or such
other person.

(e) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to comply with its
obligations under this _Section 6.08_, including by making capital
contributions to, lending money to, or otherwise making funds available to,
the Surviving Corporation to the extent the Surviving Corporation has
insufficient funds available to satisfy its obligations under this _Section
6.08_. In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries (or any of their respective successors or assigns) shall
consolidate or merge with any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger, or transfers
at least 50% of its properties and assets to any other Person, then in
each case proper provision shall be made so that the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity (or its successors or assigns, if applicable), or
transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this  _Section 6.08_.

Section 6.09 _Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company and
Parent shall each use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate
with the other parties in doing, all things reasonably necessary under
Applicable Law to consummate the Merger, including (i) the obtaining of
all necessary actions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental
Authorities, the expiry or early termination of any applicable waiting
periods, and the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including
filings with Governmental Authorities, if any) and the taking of such
reasonable steps as may be reasonably necessary to obtain an approval or
waiver from, or to avoid an action or Proceeding by, any Governmental
Authorities, (ii) the delivery of required notices to, and the obtaining of
required consents or waivers from, Third Parties and (iii) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the
Merger and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the undertakings pursuant to this
_Section 6.09_, each of Parent and the Company shall (i) prepare and file
any notification and report forms and related material required under the HSR
Act, and any additional filings or notifications and related material that are
necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the Merger, as
promptly as practicable (but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days
from the date of this Agreement for the filing of any notification and report
forms and related material

 



66  required under the HSR Act except by mutual consent confirmed in writing)
and (ii) provide or cause to be provided as promptly as practicable any
information and documentary material that may be requested by the DOJ or FTC
under the HSR Act.

(c) Subject to Applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, the
Company and Parent and their respective counsel shall (i) have the right to
review in advance, and to the extent practicable each shall consult the other
on, any material filing made with, or written materials to be submitted to,
any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) promptly inform each other of any material communication (or
other material correspondence or memoranda) received from, or given to, any

Subsidiaries or Affiliates, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority
or its respective staff, on the other hand, with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Company and Parent shall, to the extent practicable,
provide the other party and its counsel with advance notice of and
the opportunity to participate in any material discussion or meeting with any
Governmental Authority in respect of any filing, investigation or other
inquiry in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.09_, materials
provided to the other party or its counsel may be redacted to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries.

 

(d) Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate,
except where prohibited by Applicable Law, in determining the strategy for
dealing with any Governmental Authority regarding Applicable Law relating to
antitrust matters. Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, the Company
shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, (i) offer to
sell, divest, hold separate, license, cause a Third Party to acquire, or
otherwise dispose of, any Company Subsidiary, operations, divisions,
businesses, product lines, customers or assets of Parent, its Affiliates, the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries contemporaneously or after the Closing
and regardless as to whether a Third Party purchaser must be identified or
approved prior to the Closing (a " _Divestiture_ "), (ii) agree or otherwise
commit to undertake a Divestiture, (iii) take or commit to take such other
actions that may limit Parents, its Affiliates the Companys or the Company
Subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one
or more of its operations, divisions, businesses, products lines, customers
or assets (a " _Restraint_ ") or (iv) enter into any Order, consent decree or
other agreement to effectuate any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall not be required to offer,
negotiate, agree to, effect, commit to, or undertake any Divestiture or
Restraint, or enter into any Order, consent decree or other agreement to
effectuate any of the foregoing provisions of this  _Section 6.09_ if doing
so will cause a material and adverse effect on Parent or the Company.

(e) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all reasonable actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the
amendments and consents listed on  _Section 6.09(e)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedules (it being understood and agreed that the failure to
obtain any of the foregoing shall not in itself be a condition to or otherwise
affect Parents or Merger Subs obligations hereunder).

 



67 Section 6.10 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to:

 

(i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter and Fee Letter in accordance with
their terms; and

 

(ii) satisfy (or, if deemed advisable by Parent, obtain the waiver of) on a
timely basis all conditions in the Commitment Letter, Fee Letter and the
Definitive Agreements and comply with its obligations thereunder.

(b) Unless, and to the extent, Parent or Merger Sub have sufficient cash from
other sources (including by reason of a capital markets or other financing
transaction) available to satisfy their obligations under this Agreement, from
and after the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing on the
terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter and Fee Letter,
including using reasonable best efforts to:

 

(i) negotiate definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (the "
_Definitive Agreements_ ") not materially less favorable to Parent and Merger
Sub, in the aggregate, than the terms and conditions contained therein
(including, as necessary, the "flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter);
and

 

(ii) consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing.

 

(c) Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, conditioned or denied), permit
any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any provision (including
any remedy) under, or voluntarily replace (it being understood that any
Alternative Debt Financing shall not be deemed a voluntary replacement for
purposes of the sentence), the Commitment Letter or Fee Letter if such
amendment, modification, or waiver or voluntary replacement (w) adds new (or
adversely modifies any existing) conditions to the consummation of the Debt
Financing as compared to those in the Commitment Letter and Fee Letter as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, (x) adversely affects the ability of
Parent to enforce its rights against other parties to the Commitment Letter,
Fee Letter or the Definitive Agreements as so amended, replaced, supplemented
or otherwise modified, relative to the ability of Parent to enforce its rights
against such other parties to the Commitment Letter and Fee Letter as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, (y) reduces the aggregate amount of the
Debt Financing (unless after giving effect to such reduction, the
representation and warranty in _Section 5.09(d)_ shall be true and correct),
or (z) would otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede
or materially delay the Closing; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt,
no consent from the Company shall be required for (A) any amendment,
replacement, supplement or modification of the Commitment Letter that
is limited to adding lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents
or similar entities that have not executed the Commitment Letter as of the
date of this Agreement (including in replacement of a Lender), (B)
implementation or exercise of any "flex" provisions provided in the Fee
Letter as in effect as of the date hereof or (C) any amendment, replacement,
supplement or modification to the Commitment Letter, Fee Letter or Definitive
Agreements so long as such action would not be prohibited by the foregoing
clauses (w) - (z).

 



68 (d) Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current
basis of the status of its efforts to consummate the Debt Financing. Parent
shall provide the Company with prompt notice of any breach, default,
termination or repudiation (or any written notice thereof) by any party to any
Commitment Letters or the Definitive Agreements of which Parent gains
knowledge and that would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede
or materially delay the Closing. Unless, and to the extent, Parent or Merger
Sub have sufficient cash from other sources (including by reason of a capital
markets or other financing transaction) available to satisfy their obligations
under this Agreement, from and after the execution of this Agreement, in the
event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable (other than
as a result of a breach by the Company of this Agreement which prevents or
renders impracticable the consummation of the Debt Financing), Parent will (1)
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative debt financing (the "
_Alternative Debt Financing_ ") from the same or other sources, in an amount
such that the representation in _Section 5.09(d)_ shall be true and correct,
and which Alternative Debt Financing does not include any
incremental conditionality to the consummation thereof that are more onerous
to Parent or the Company, in the aggregate, than the conditions set forth in
the Commitment Letter and Fee Letter in effect as of the date of this
Agreement and (2) promptly notify the Company of such unavailability and the
reason therefor.

(e) For purposes of the foregoing _Sections 6.10(a)  (d)_, (i) the term
"Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include any commitment letter (or
similar agreement) with respect to any Alternative Debt Financing, (ii) the
term "Fee Letter" shall be deemed to include any fee letter (or similar
agreement) with respect to any Alternative Debt Financing and (iii) the term
"Lenders" shall be deemed to include any lenders providing the Alternative
Debt Financing. Other than for purposes of  _Section 5.09_, the term "Debt
Financing" shall be deemed to include any permitted Alternative Debt Financing
or any capital markets or other financing transactions intended to or that
does fund Parent and Merger Subs obligations under this Agreement.

Section 6.11 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts
to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Subsidiaries
to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause their respective officers,

other related Persons, the " _Debt Financing Sources_ "), and in sessions
with rating agencies or other syndication activities;

 



69 (ii) provide reasonable access by Parent and any Debt Financing Sources, and
their respective officers, employees, consultants and advisors (including

the Company Subsidiaries and assist with due diligence activities relating to
the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries financial information;

in, collateral;

(iv) request and cooperate in obtaining customary payoff letters, lien
terminations and instruments of discharge, relating to any indebtedness of

Exhibit D to the Commitment Letter, including the comfort letters referenced
in such paragraph 7 (all such financial statements, information and comfort
letters, the " _Required Information_ "); and

(viii) subject to the occurrence of the Closing, take all corporate actions
necessary to permit consummation of the Debt Financing; _provided, in each
case_ that nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it
would interfere materially and unreasonably with the business or operations
of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries. The Company hereby consents to the
pre-approved use in each case of its and the Company Subsidiaries logos in
connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_  that such logos are used
solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or
disparage the Company or any of the Company

 



70  Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or any of their logos and on such other customary terms
and conditions as the Company shall reasonably impose.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause the
Company Subsidiaries to, and shall cause their respective officers,
employees, consultants and advisors, including legal and accounting advisors
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to, furnish to Parent and its Debt
Financing Sources:

 

(i) customary authorization and representation letters in connection with the
materials and other documents used in connection with the Debt Financing,
which may include customary representations that such information does not
contain a material misstatement or omission and that the public-side versions

with respect to the Company, its Affiliates or any of its or their respective
securities for purposes of any applicable securities laws; and

 

(ii) at least four (4) Business Days prior to the anticipated Effective Time,

Subsidiaries required by applicable "know your customer" and anti-money

requested at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the anticipated Effective
Time, in each case, as required to be delivered pursuant to the Commitment
Letter or that is otherwise necessary to satisfy the conditions in Exhibit D
thereof.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.11_ to the contrary, neither
the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be required to (i) bear
any out-of-pocket cost or expense that is not reimbursed pursuant to this
_Section 6.11(c)_ or pay any fee in connection with the Debt Financing prior
to the Effective Time, (ii) incur any liability (or cause their respective
directors, officers or employees to incur any liability) under the Debt
Financing prior to the Effective Time that is not contingent on the Closing or
(iii) enter into any agreement or commitment that would be effective prior to
the Effective Time (other than such authorization and representation letters
described above and the consents of accountants for use of their reports in
any materials relating to the matters described above). Furthermore, Parent
shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives in connection with their respective obligations
pursuant to this _Section 6.11_. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives
from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses
suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the Debt Financing and
any information utilized in connection therewith (other than any information
provided in writing specifically for use by or on behalf of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries), in each case other than to the extent any of
the foregoing arises from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct of, or breach of this Agreement by, the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates, officers, directors,
employees, accountants, agents or Representatives.

 

Section 6.12 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) notify
Parent in writing of, and shall

Stockholder Litigation shall be agreed to by the Company without Parents
prior written consent.

Section 6.13 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release or making any other public
statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any such other
public statement without the consent of the other party, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed, except (i) as such release or
announcement that Parent or the Company determines, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, is required by Applicable Law or any listing agreement
with or rule of any national securities exchange or association upon which the
securities of the Company or Parent, as applicable, are listed, in which case
the party required to make the release or announcement shall consult with the

Section 6.14 _Section 16 Matters and Form S-8_. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall take all actions as may be reasonably requested by any
party hereto to cause any dispositions of equity securities of the Company

effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as such Parent Stock Options and Parent RSUs remain
outstanding. The Company and its counsel shall reasonably cooperate with
Parent in the preparation of such registration statement.

 

Section 6.15 _FIRPTA Certificate_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Parent a statement, issued by the Company in accordance with

72 Section 6.16 _Employment Matters_.

 

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time until the earlier of (i) the first
anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) December 31, 2016, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to Company
Employees who continue to be employed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (the "
_Continuing Company Employees_ ") for so long as the applicable Continuing
Company Employee remains employed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation,
compensation and benefits (excluding any equity or equity-based plan, program
or arrangement), that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
compensation and benefits (excluding any equity or equity-based plan, program
or arrangement) paid and provided to similarly situated employees of Parent
and Subsidiaries of Parent (other than the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries); _provided_ , that for purposes of the foregoing sentence the
employee benefit plans generally provided to Company Employees as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed to be substantially
comparable, on an aggregate basis, to those provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries for purposes of this sentence, it
being understood that the Company Employees may commence participation in
Parents benefit plans on different dates following the Effective Time with
respect to different benefit plans.

(b) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, cause any employee benefit plans sponsored or maintained by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries in which the
Continuing Company Employees are eligible to participate following the
Closing Date (collectively, the " _Post-Closing Plans_ ") to recognize the
service of each Continuing Company Employee with the Company prior to the
Closing Date for purposes of eligibility, vesting and levels of benefits
under such Post-Closing Plans, in each case, to the same extent such service
was recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time under a comparable
Company Employee Plan in which such Continuing Company Employee was eligible
to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that such
recognition of service shall not (i) apply for purposes of any plan that
provides retiree welfare benefits, (ii) apply for purposes of benefit accruals
or participation eligibility under any defined benefit pension plan or plan
providing post-retirement pension plan benefits, (iii) operate to duplicate
any benefits of a Continuing Company Employee with respect to the same period
of service, and (iv) apply for purposes of any plan, program or arrangement
(x) under which similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do
not receive credit for prior service or (y) that is grandfathered or frozen,
either with respect to level of benefits or participation. With respect to
any Post-Closing Plan that provides medical, dental or vision insurance
benefits, for the plan year in which such Continuing Company Employee is first
eligible to participate, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
(A) cause any pre-existing condition limitations or eligibility waiting
periods under such plan to be waived with respect to such Continuing Company
Employee to the extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied
under the Company Employee Plan in which such Continuing Company Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B) credit each
Continuing Company Employee for an amount equal to any medical, dental or
vision expenses incurred by such Continuing Company Employee in the year that
includes the Closing Date (or, if later, the year in which such Continuing
Company Employee is first eligible to participate in such Post-Closing Plan)
for purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense
requirements under any such Post-Closing Plan to the extent such expenses
would have been

 



73  credited under the Company Employee Plan in which such Company Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to the
applicable information being provided to Parent in a form that Parent
reasonably determines is administratively feasible to take into account under
its plans. Such credited expenses shall also count toward any annual or
lifetime limits, treatment or visit limits or similar limitations that apply
under the terms of the applicable plan.

(c) From and after the Closing Date, each Continuing Company Employee, may
use, in accordance with the vacation policy of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation as in effect from time to time, and shall be credited with the
number of vacation days of such Continuing Company Employee that accrued but
were not yet used or cashed out as of the Closing Date under the Companys
vacation policy as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date.

(d) With respect to a Continuing Company Employee who is a party to a
severance agreement set forth in Section 6.16(d) of the Company Disclosure
Schedules, in the event such Continuing Company Employees employment is
terminated (other than for cause) by Parent or the Surviving Corporation
during the one year period immediately following the Closing Date, Parent
agrees to provide such Continuing Company Employee with severance benefits
(taking into account for such purpose such Continuing Company Employees
service and compensation with the Company prior to the Closing Date and any
additional service and compensation with Parent from and after the Closing
Date) that are no less favorable than those to which such Continuing Company
Employee is entitled under the terms and conditions of such severance
agreement.

(e) If requested by Parent in writing delivered to the Company not less than
ten (10) Business Days before the Closing Date, the Company Board (or the
appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate
action as is necessary to terminate the Companys 401(k) plan (the " _Company
401(k) Plan_ "), effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date. Following
the Effective Time and as soon as practicable following receipt of a favorable
determination letter from the IRS on the termination of the Company 401(k)
Plan, the assets thereof shall be distributed to the participants, and Parent
shall, to the extent permitted by Parents applicable 401(k) plan (the "
_Parent 401(k) Plan_ "), permit the Continuing Company Employees who are then
actively employed to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code,
exclusive of loans), in the form of cash, in an amount equal to the full
account balance (excluding loans) distributed to such Company Employee from
the Company 401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to amend, or cause
to be amended, the Parent 401(k) Plan to accept a rollover of outstanding
loans from the Company 401(k) Plan. If the amendment to the Parent 401(k) Plan
described in the immediately preceding sentence is obtained, any rollover
contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) by a Continuing Company Employee to the Parent
401(k) Plan described in the immediately preceding sentence shall be in an
amount equal to the full account balance (including loans) distributed to
such Company Employee from the Company 401(k) Plan.

 



74 (f) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee or other
service provider any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with
or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their Affiliates, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge
or terminate the services of any Company Employee at any time for any reason
whatsoever, with or without cause. In no event shall the terms of this
Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Company Employee
Plan or any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or
any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or
sponsored by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, Company and the Company
Subsidiaries) or Affiliates; or (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries (including, after the
Closing Date, Company and the Company Subsidiaries) or Affiliates to amend,
modify or terminate any Company Employee Plan or any other compensation or
benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this _Section 6.16_ shall create any third party
beneficiary rights in any Company Employee or current or former service
provider of the Company or its Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents
thereof).

Section 6.17 _Proxy Statement; Stockholder Approval_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, and in no
event later than one (1) Business Day after the No-Shop Start Date, the
Company shall file with the SEC a preliminary Proxy Statement. Parent shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the Company in the
preparation of the Proxy Statement, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to promptly furnish all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub that is
necessary or appropriate in connection with the preparation of the Proxy
Statement. Parent shall cause the information supplied or to be supplied by or
on behalf of Parent and Merger Sub specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement not to contain, on the date
of the mailing to the Companys stockholders and at the time of the Company
Meeting, any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The Company will prepare the Proxy Statement such that it will
not, on the date of filing with the SEC, at the time the Proxy Statement is
mailed and at the time of the Company Meeting, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Company will
cause the Proxy Statement to comply in all material respects with the
provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and
other Applicable Law.

(b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to
any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC on the Proxy Statement. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to
be mailed to its stockholders as promptly as practicable (and in any event
within five (5) Business Days following the later of (i) the resolution of
any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to the
preliminary Proxy Statement and (ii) the expiration of the ten-day waiting
period provided in Rule 14a-6(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (such
later date, the " _Clearance Date_ ")) and

 



75  to cause the Clearance Date to occur as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the date hereof. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or
response to staff comments on, the Proxy Statement will be made by the
Company, without providing Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon and giving reasonable consideration in good faith
to such comments (it being understood that Parent and its counsel shall
provide any comments thereon as soon as reasonably practicable in order to
provide the Company and its counsel sufficient opportunity to review and
consider such comments in advance of any such filing, amendment or
supplement). If at any time prior to the Company Meeting (or any adjournment
or postponement thereof) any information relating to the Company or Parent, or
any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, is discovered by
the Company or Parent which is required to be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly file an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information with the SEC
and, to the extent required by Applicable Law, disseminate such amendment or
supplement to the stockholders of the Company. The Company shall notify Parent
promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC
and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall
supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of
its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on
the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement, or the transactions
contemplated hereby. At the Companys reasonable request, Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts and shall cause its counsel to use reasonable best
efforts to assist and cooperate with the Company and its counsel in the
resolution of any such comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC with
respect to the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this _Section 6.17_, (x) the right of Parent and its counsel to comment on
the preliminary or the definitive Proxy Statement, any amendment or supplement
thereto or any comments or communications received from the SEC or its staff
shall not apply with respect to any disclosure, amendment or supplement made
by the Company to effect a Change in Recommendation in accordance with
_Section 6.02_, and (y) the Company shall have no responsibility with
respect to any information or statements made or incorporated by reference in
the Proxy Statement which were based on information supplied by or on behalf
of Parent specifically for inclusion in the Proxy Statement.

(c) The Company shall take all actions necessary to duly call, establish a
record date for, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders, for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement
(the " _Company Meeting_ "), so that the Company Meeting occurs as soon as
possible following the Clearance Date, in accordance with Applicable Laws and
the Companys Organizational Documents; _provided_ , that the Company may
postpone or adjourn the Company Meeting after consultation with Parent, (i) if
as of the time for which the Company Meeting is originally scheduled (as set
forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient Shares represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of the Company Meeting or to the extent that at such time the
Company has not received proxies sufficient to allow the receipt of the
Requisite Stockholder Approval at the Company Meeting or (ii) to allow time
for the filing and dissemination of, and a sufficient period for evaluation by
the Companys stockholders of, any supplemental or amended disclosure

 



76  document to the extent that the Company Board has determined in good faith
(after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel) is necessary or
required under Applicable Laws. Once the Company has established a record
date for the Company Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date or
establish a different record date for the Company Meeting without the prior
written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or
conditioned), unless required to do so by the DGCL. If the record date for the
Company Meeting is changed, the Company shall, as to that record date, comply
with each of its obligations under this _Section 6.17_. In connection with
the Company Meeting, the Company shall (i) unless there has been a Change in
Recommendation in accordance with _Section 6.02_, use reasonable best efforts
to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval and (ii) otherwise comply with
all legal requirements applicable to such meeting. The Company shall include
in the Proxy Statement the Company Recommendation, unless there has been a
Change in Recommendation in accordance with  _Section 6.02_. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall submit this
Agreement for adoption by its stockholders at the Company Meeting whether or
not a Change in Recommendation shall have occurred or an Acquisition Proposal
shall have been publicly announced or otherwise made known to the Company, the
Company Board, or the Companys Representatives or its stockholders.

 

Section 6.18 _Investment Company Act_. Prior to, but subject to the occurrence
of, the Effective Time, the Company shall, if requested by Parent in writing
no less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, cause Constant
Contact Securities Corporation (" _CCSC_ ") to (x) merge with and into the
Company with the Company as the surviving corporation in such merger, (y)
liquidate and distribute all of its assets (excluding any assets required to
be distributed to creditors of CCSC) to the Company or (z) sell, transfer or
otherwise distribute to the Company all of its assets that constitute
"Investment Securities" as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (the " _1940 Act_ ") in exchange for consideration that is not
"Investment Securities" as defined in the 1940 Act.

Requisite Stockholder Approval:

 

(a) by mutual written agreement of the Company and Parent;

 

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if:

 

(i) the Closing shall not have occurred at or before 6:00 P.M. Eastern Time on

respect any of its covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement
or any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement

satisfied and (B) is incapable of being cured or has not been cured by the
Company within twenty (20) calendar days after written notice has been given

(ii) the Company pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)(i)_; or

 

(iii) Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(c)(i)_;

 

then, in any such case, the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent

81 (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
Company acknowledges and agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates that
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)(ii)_ or _Section
8.01(d)(iii)_ and the receipt of the Parent Termination Fee (in circumstances
in which it is payable) shall (x) constitute the sole and exclusive remedy
under this Agreement of the Company and each of its Affiliates and
Representatives and holders of Shares and any other Company Related Party, and
(y) be deemed to be liquidated damages, for any and all losses or damages
suffered or incurred by the Company and its Affiliates and Representatives,
holders of Shares and any other Company Related Party in connection with or as
a result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
or the failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated or
any matter forming the basis for termination of this Agreement, and none of
the Company and its respective Affiliates or Representatives, any holder of
Shares or any other Company Related Party shall be entitled to bring or
maintain any Proceeding against Parent, Merger Sub, any Parent Related Party
or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger, the Debt Financing, or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (or the abandonment or
termination thereof) or any matters forming the basis for such termination.
The Company shall not be entitled to specific performance under _Section
9.09_ if the Company has terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.01(d)(ii)_ or _Section 8.01(d)(iii)_ and Parent has paid in full the
Parent Termination Fee as provided in _Section 8.03(c)_, and in no event
shall the Company or its Affiliates be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance of Parents and Merger Subs obligations to
cause the Closing to occur pursuant to _Section 2.02_ and the Parent
Termination Fee.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent acknowledges and agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates that,
(i) in the event of termination of this Agreement in a circumstance in which
the Company Termination Fee becomes payable to Parent pursuant to _Section
8.03(a)(i)_, _Section 8.03(a)(ii)_ or _Section 8.03(a)(iii)_, the receipt of
the Company Termination Fee shall (except in the case of any willful breach or
fraud, to which the limitations set forth in this subsection (e) shall not
apply) (x) constitute the sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement of
Parent and each of its Affiliates and Representatives and any other Parent
Related Party, and (y) be deemed to be liquidated damages, for any and all
losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent and its Affiliates and
Representatives and any other Parent Related Party in connection with or as a
result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated or any matter forming
the basis for termination of this Agreement, and (ii) in the event of any such
termination of this Agreement in a circumstance in which the Company
Termination Fee becomes payable to Parent pursuant to _Section 8.03(a)(i)_,
_Section 8.03(a)(ii)_ or _Section 8.03(a)(iii)_, then, following Parents
receipt of the Company Termination Fee, none of Parent and its respective
Affiliates or Representatives or any other Parent Related Party shall (except
in the case of any willful breach or fraud, to which the limitations set forth
in this clause (e) shall not apply) be entitled to bring or maintain any
Proceeding against the Company or any Company Related Party or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives arising out of or in connection with
this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby (or the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters
forming the basis for such termination.

 



82 (f) For the avoidance of doubt, any payment by the Company or Parent under
this  _Section 8.03_ shall be payable only once with respect to this
_Section 8.03_ and not in duplication even though such payment may be payable
under one or more provisions hereof.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if Parent or Merger Sub
fail to complete the Merger for any or no reason or otherwise breach this
Agreement, fail to perform hereunder or under the Debt Financing (in any case,
whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) then, except
for an order of specific performance as and only to the extent
expressly permitted by _Section 9.09_, the sole and exclusive remedy
(whether at law, in equity, in contract in tort or otherwise) of the Company,
its Affiliates and any other Person against Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent
Related Party for any such failure, breach, loss, damage or otherwise shall
be for the Company to terminate this Agreement and receive payment of the
Parent Termination Fee, if payable hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt,
under no circumstance will the Company, any of its Affiliates, any holder of
Shares or any other Company Related Party be entitled to aggregate monetary
damages (when taken together with all other monetary damages and the payment
of the full or partial amount of the Parent Termination Fee) from Parent,
Merger Sub and the Parent Related Parties to the Company, any of the Companys
Affiliates, any holder of Shares or any other Company Related Party in
connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing, for any breach, failure to
perform hereunder or thereunder (in any case, whether willfully,
intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) or other liability of any kind
suffered as a result of any breach of this Agreement or the failure to
complete the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the Debt Financing (including the abandonment or termination hereof or
thereof) for any loss or otherwise, in excess of the amount of the Parent
Termination Fee.

 

 __(h) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this _Section 8.03_ are an integral part of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and that without such
agreements the Company, Parent and Merger Sub would not have entered into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
fails to pay the fees due pursuant to this _Section 8.03_ or any portion
thereof and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company, Parent or Merger
Sub (as applicable, the "Prevailing Party") commences a suit which results in
an Order against the other party (the " _Other Party_ ") for such fee or any
portion thereof, the Other Party shall pay to the Prevailing Party its costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the
applicable fee (or any portion thereof that has not been paid timely in
accordance with this Agreement) and on the amount of such costs and expenses,
in each case from and including the date payment of such amount was due to
through the date of actual payment at the prime rate set forth in _The Wall
Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. __

Section 9.05 _Assignment; Benefit_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by
any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without

Merger Sub, upon prior written notice to the Company, may assign, in its sole
discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of
its obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is
intended to confer on any Person other than the parties hereto or their
respective successors, and permitted assigns any rights, remedies,
obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, except (i)
for the provisions of _Section 6.08_,

 



85  which shall inure to the benefit of the Persons or entities benefiting

to receive pursuant to and in accordance with Section 2.07 and Section 2.08,
only from and after the Effective Time). For the avoidance of doubt, other
than as expressly provided in this _Section 9.05_, no holder of Shares shall
have any third-party beneficiary rights under this _Section 9.05_ or any
other provision of this Agreement.

 

Section 9.06 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any Proceedings arising out
of or related hereto or to the Merger or to the inducement of any party
hereto to enter into this Agreement (whether for breach of contract, tortious
conduct or otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute or

of the State of Delaware, including all matters of construction, validity,
and performance, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such State
that would refer a matter to the laws of another jurisdiction.

 

Section 9.07 _Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) The parties hereto agree that any Proceeding seeking to enforce any
provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in the
Chancery Court of the State of Delaware located in Wilmington, Delaware and
any state appellate court therefrom located in Wilmington, Delaware, or, if no
such state court has proper jurisdiction, the Federal District Court for the
District of Delaware located in Wilmington, Delaware, and any appellate court
therefrom. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such court in respect of any legal or equitable Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, or relating to enforcement of any of the terms of this Agreement, and
hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, as a defense in any such Proceeding,
any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of such court,
that the Proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the
Proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each party
hereto agrees that notice or the service of process in any Proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be properly served or delivered if delivered in the manner contemplated
by _Section 9.01_ or in any other manner permitted by Applicable Law.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each party hereto further
agrees that New York State or United States Federal courts sitting in the
borough of Manhattan, City of New York shall have exclusive jurisdiction over
any action (whether at law or at equity and whether brought by any party
hereto or any other person) brought against any Lender or other Debt
Financing Source in connection with the Debt Financing or this Agreement, and
that no party hereto will bring, or permit any of their Affiliates to bring,
any such action in any other court.

 



86 Section 9.08 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR IN ANY ACTION RELATING TO THE DEBT FINANCING OR INVOLVING A LENDER
OR OTHER DEBT FINANCING SOURCE. 

Section 9.09 _Specific Performance; Remedies_.

 

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the
parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware
located in Wilmington, Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom
located in Wilmington, Delaware, or, if no such state court has proper
jurisdiction, the Federal District Court located in Wilmington, Delaware, and
any appellate court therefrom, and, in any action for specific performance,
each party waives the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and waives any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such
remedy, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity (subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including
_Section 9.09(a)_), it is explicitly agreed that the Companys right to
specific performance of or other equitable remedies with respect to Parents
and Merger Subs obligations to consummate the Merger shall be subject to the
requirements that: (i) all of the conditions precedent to Parents and Merger
Subs obligations set forth in _Section 7.01_ and _Section 7.02_ have been
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but which conditions are capable of being satisfied
at the Closing), (ii) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded in
accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing, (iii) Parent and Merger Sub
fail to complete the Closing by the time the Closing was required to have
occurred pursuant to _Section 2.02_, (iv) the Company has irrevocably
confirmed in writing delivered to Parent that if specific performance is
granted and the Debt Financing is funded, then it would take such actions
that are within its control to consummate the Closing in accordance with the
terms hereof (including satisfaction of the conditions to Parents and Merger
Subs obligations in  _Section 7.01_ and _Section 7.02_ that contemplate an
action be taken or documents be delivered at the Closing), and (v) Parent
fails to complete the Closing within three (3) Business Days following
delivery of the confirmation pursuant to clause (iv) above and the Company
stood ready, willing and able to complete the Closing throughout such three
(3) Business Day period. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing provisions
of this  _Section 9.09(b)_ shall not be deemed to limit in any way the
Companys right to specific performance of or other equitable remedies to any
of Parents or Merger Subs other agreements or obligations hereunder
(including under _Section 6.10_) other than its obligation to consummate the
Merger. In no event

 



87  shall the Company be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance or
other equitable remedies with respect to Parents obligations to consummate
the Merger other than solely under the specific circumstances and as
specifically set forth in this _Section 9.09(b)_. In no event shall any
Person other than the Company be entitled to seek the remedy of specific
performance of any of Parents or Merger Subs obligations to consummate the
Merger. In no event shall any Person other than Parent and/or Merger Sub be
entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of the Companys
obligations to consummate the Merger. Each party agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of specific performance and other equitable relief on the
basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy at law or that an award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity;  _provided_ , that nothing contained in this sentence shall prohibit
a party from opposing a grant of specific performance or other equitable
relief on the basis that such remedy is not permitted pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, while the Company or Parent may
pursue both a grant of specific performance as and only to the extent
expressly permitted by this _Section 9.09_ and the payment of the Parent
Termination Fee (only to the extent expressly permitted by _Section
8.03(c)_) or the payment of the Company Termination Fee (only to the extent
expressly permitted by _Section 8.03(a)_), as applicable, under no
circumstances shall Parent or the Company, as applicable, be obligated to
both specifically perform its obligations to consummate the Merger, on the one
hand, and pay the Parent Termination Fee or the Company Termination Fee, as
applicable, on the other hand.

 

Section 9.10 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party; _provided_ , that the parties intend that the
remedies and limitations on remedies contained in this Agreement (including
the limitations on equitable remedies and provisions providing that the
termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company, its Affiliates and any other
Person against Parent, Merger Sub and the Parent Related Parties) to be
construed as integral provisions of this Agreement and that such remedies and
limitations shall not be severable in any manner that increases Parents,
Merger Subs or any Parent Related Partys liability or obligations hereunder.
Upon such a determination, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner, in order that the Merger be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

Section 9.11 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement, the exhibits to this Agreement, the Schedules, the
Company Disclosure Schedules and any documents delivered by the parties hereto
in connection herewith constitute the entire agreement among the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with
respect thereto.

Section 9.12 _Rules of Construction_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges
that it has been represented by counsel of its choice throughout all
negotiations that have preceded the

 



88  execution of this Agreement, and that it has executed the same with the
advice of said independent counsel. Each party hereto and its counsel
cooperated and participated in the drafting and preparation of this Agreement
and the documents referred to herein, and any and all drafts relating thereto
exchanged among the parties shall be deemed the work product of all of the
parties and may not be construed against any party hereto by reason of its
drafting or preparation. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision
that would require interpretation of any ambiguities in this Agreement against
any party that drafted or prepared it is of no application and is
hereby expressly waived by each of the parties hereto, and any controversy
over interpretations of this Agreement shall be decided without regards to
events of drafting or preparation. Any matter set forth on the Company
Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed to constitute an admission by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, or to otherwise imply, that any such matter
is material, is required to be disclosed by the Company under this Agreement
or falls within relevant minimum thresholds or materiality standards set
forth in this Agreement, nor shall be construed as an admission or indication
to any Third Party that any breach or violation exists or has actually
occurred.

 

Section 9.13 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties
hereto. Until and unless each party hereto has received a counterpart hereof
signed by each other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no
party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any
other oral or written agreement or other communication). Signatures to this
Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in PDF
form, or by any other electronic means designed to preserve the original
graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will be deemed to have the
same effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the original
signatures.

Section 9.14  _Non-Recourse_.

(a) This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim or cause of
action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby may only be brought against the Persons that
are expressly named as parties hereto and then only with respect to the
specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such
party. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Parent Related
Party nor Debt Financing Source shall have any Liability (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) to the Company, any holder of
Shares or any other Company Related Party for any obligations or Liabilities
to any party hereto under this Agreement or the Debt Financing or for any
claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby and no Parent Related Party shall have any rights or
claims against any Company Related Party (other than, following the Closing,
the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Merger Sub).

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary that may be expressed or implied
in this Agreement and without limiting the generality of  _Section 9.14(a)_,
no Parent Related Party nor Debt Financing Source shall have any Liability to
the Company or any of its Affiliates or Representatives, or any holder of
Shares, or any Company Related Party claiming by, under or 

 



89  through the Company, relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt
Financing or in respect of any other document or theory (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise).

VOTING AGREEMENT

This VOTING AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as of
October 30, 2015 by and between Endurance International Group Holdings, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), and the undersigned stockholders
of Constant Contact, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), set
forth on Schedule A hereto (each a " _Stockholder_ " and, collectively the "
_Stockholders_ ").

 

WITNESSETH:

WHEREAS, Parent, Paintbrush Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and the Company
have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger of even date herewith (as it
may be modified or amended from time to time, the " _Merger Agreement_ "),
which provides for, among other things, the merger of Merger Sub with and into
the Company (the " _Merger_ ") with the Company continuing as the
surviving corporation of the Merger and pursuant to which all Common Shares
will be converted into the right to receive the consideration set forth in the
Merger Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof each Stockholder is the beneficial owner (as
defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the " _Exchange Act_ ")) of the number of Common Shares set forth opposite
the name of such Stockholder on Schedule A hereto;

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has, prior to the execution of
this Agreement, approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby; and

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger
Sub to enter into the Merger Agreement, each Stockholder (in its capacity as
such) has agreed to enter into this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below
intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

1\. _Certain Definitions_. All capitalized terms that are used but not defined
herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Merger
Agreement. For all purposes of and under this Agreement, the following terms
shall have the following respective meanings:

 

" _Common Shares_ " shall mean, with respect to any Stockholder, (i) all
shares of Company Common Stock, all Company Stock Options, all Company RSUs
and all rights to purchase Company Common Stock, in each case, owned by such
Stockholder as of the date hereof, and (ii) all additional shares of Company
Common Stock, Company Stock Options and rights to purchase Company Common
Stock, of which such Stockholder acquires ownership during the period from the
date of this Agreement through the Expiration Date (including by means of
purchase, dividend, distribution, stock split, split-up, merger,
consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, combination, exchange or
similar transaction or issued upon the exercise of any warrants or options,
the vesting or settlement of Company RSUs, or the conversion of any
convertible securities or otherwise).

 

" _Expiration Date_ " shall mean the earlier to occur of (i) the termination
of the Merger Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof, (ii) such date
and time as the Merger shall become effective in accordance with the terms and
provisions of the Merger Agreement, and (iii) the date of any material
modification, waiver or amendment to any provision of the Merger Agreement
that reduces the amount, changes the form or otherwise adversely affects, in
any material respect, the consideration payable to any Stockholder without the
written consent of such Stockholder. " _Transfer_ " A Person shall be deemed to have effected a " _Transfer_ " of
a Common Share if such Person, directly or indirectly, (i) sells, issues,
pledges, encumbers, assigns, grants an option with respect to, transfers,
tenders or otherwise disposes of such Common Shares or any interest in such
Common Shares in any manner, for or without consideration, or (ii) enters into
an agreement or commitment providing for the sale of, issuance of, pledge of,
encumbrance of, assignment of, grant of an option with respect to, transfer
of, tender of or other disposition of such Common Shares or any interest
therein in any manner, for or without consideration, _provided_ , that, for
the avoidance of doubt, "Transfer" does not include granting a proxy
or voting or consent instructions with respect to any matter other than those
specified in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of _Section 3(a)_.

 

2\. _Transfer of Common Shares_.

 

(a) _Transfer Restrictions_ _._ During the term of this Agreement and subject
to _Section 2(c)_, no Stockholder shall Transfer (or cause or permit the
Transfer of) any Common Shares (or enter into any agreement or arrangement
relating to the Transfer of any Common Shares) except to Parent or with
Parents prior written consent. Any Transfer, or purported Transfer, of
Common Shares in breach or violation of this Agreement shall be void and of no
force or effect and each Stockholder acknowledges that the Company will not
register or permit the registration of or otherwise facilitate or effect any
such Transfer.

(b) _Transfer of Voting Rights_ _._ Without limiting the generality of
_Section 2(a)_, each Stockholder agrees not to deposit (or cause or permit
the deposit of) any Common Shares in a voting trust or grant any proxy or
enter into any voting agreement or similar agreement with respect to any of
the Common Shares or otherwise take any similar action in contravention of
the obligations of each Stockholder under this Agreement.

(c) _Permitted Transfers_. Nothing in this  _Section 2_ shall prohibit a
Transfer of Common Shares by a Stockholder (i) to any member of such
Stockholders immediate family, or to a trust for the benefit of such
Stockholder or any member of such Stockholders immediate family, (ii) by
will or operation of law or upon the death such Stockholder, (iii) in
connection with or for the purpose of personal tax-planning or estate-
planning, (iv) to Affiliates of such Stockholder, (v) for charitable purposes
or as charitable gifts or donations, or (vi) pursuant to any Rule 10b5-1 plan
in effect as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that a
Transfer referred to in subclauses (i)-(v) of this  _Section 2(c)_ shall be
permitted only if, as a precondition to such transfer, the transferee agrees
in writing to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement. In addition,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, a Stockholder may
make: (A) with respect such Stockholders Company Stock Options, Transfers of
the underlying Company Shares to the Company (or cancellations) in payment of
the exercise price of such Stockholders Company Stock Options, and (B) with
respect to such Stockholders Company Stock Options or Company RSUs, (x)
Transfers or cancellations of the underlying Common Shares to the Company in
order to satisfy Taxes applicable to the exercise of such Stockholders
Company Stock Options, or (y) Transfers or cancellations of Common Shares or
Company RSUs to the Company in order to satisfy Taxes applicable to the
vesting or settlement of such Stockholders Company RSUs.

 

3\. _Agreement to Vote Common Shares; Irrevocable Proxy_.

 

(a) At every meeting of the stockholders of the Company, and at every
adjournment or postponement thereof, and on every action or approval
by written consent of the stockholders of the Company, each Stockholder (in
such Stockholders capacity as such), to the extent not so voted by the

 



2  Person(s) appointed under a Proxy (as defined below), shall, or shall cause
the holder of record on any applicable record date to, vote all Common Shares
as to which such Stockholder has sole or shared voting power and entitled to
vote or act by written consent:

(i) in favor of (A) the adoption of the Merger Agreement and any other matter
that must be approved by the stockholders of the Company in order for the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to be consummated and (B)
any adjournment, recess, delay or postponement recommended by the
Company (and not publicly opposed by Parent) with respect to any stockholder
meeting with respect to the Merger Agreement;

(ii) against approval of any proposal made in opposition to, made in
competition with, or that would reasonably be expected to result in a breach
of, the Merger Agreement, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement; and

 

(iii) against any of the following actions (other than those actions in
furtherance of the Merger and the Merger Agreement): (A) any merger,
consolidation, business combination, sale of assets, reorganization or
recapitalization of or involving the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, (B) any sale, lease or transfer of all or substantially all of
the assets of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, (C) any
reorganization, recapitalization, extraordinary dividend, dissolution,
liquidation or winding up of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries,
(D) any material change in the capitalization of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, or the corporate structure of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, (E) any Acquisition Proposal with respect to the
Company, or (F) any other action that is intended, or would reasonably be
expected, to impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage or adversely
affect the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement.

 

Each Stockholder shall retain at all times the right to vote its Common Shares
in its sole discretion and without any other limitation on those matters
other than those set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) that are at any
time or from time to time presented for consideration to the Companys
stockholders generally. For the avoidance of doubt, clauses (i), (ii), and
(iii) of this  _Section 3(a)_ shall not apply to votes, if any, solely on
the election or removal of directors as recommended by the Company Board.

 

(b) In furtherance of the agreements herein and concurrently with the
execution of this Agreement, each Stockholder shall deliver to Parent a proxy
in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (each such proxy, a " _Proxy_ "),
which shall be irrevocable to the fullest extent permissible by law, with
respect to all of such Stockholders Common Shares.

 

(c) Each Stockholder hereby represents and warrants to Parent that any proxies
heretofore given by it in respect of its Common Shares are not irrevocable,
that any such proxies have heretofore been effectively revoked, and that
written notice of revocation of such proxies has been delivered to any such
proxy holders.

 

(d) Each Stockholder hereby affirms that the Proxy is given in connection
with, and in consideration of, the execution of the Merger Agreement by
Parent, and that such irrevocable proxy is given to secure the performance of
the duties of such Stockholder under this Agreement. Each Stockholder hereby
further affirms that the Proxy is coupled with an interest sufficient in law
to support an irrevocable power and may under no circumstances be revoked.
Such Stockholder hereby ratifies and confirms all that such Proxy may lawfully
do or cause to be done by virtue hereof. Such Proxy is executed and intended
to be irrevocable in accordance with the provisions of Section 212 of the
DGCL until the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

(e) Each Stockholder shall not enter into any agreement or understanding with
any Person to vote or give instructions in any manner inconsistent with the
terms of this _Section 3_.

 



3 4\. _Agreement Not to Exercise Appraisal Rights_. Each Stockholder shall not
exercise, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, any statutory
rights (including under Section 262 of the DGCL) to demand appraisal of any
Common Shares that may arise in connection with the Merger or the Merger
Agreement.

 

5\. _Directors and Officers_. It is understood that each Stockholder enters
into this Agreement solely in such Stockholders capacity as a stockholder of
the Company. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as preventing or limiting a
Stockholder or affiliate of a Stockholder, who is a director or officer of
the Company, from taking (or omitting to take) any action in such capacity or
fulfilling the obligations of such office, including by performing the
obligations required by the fiduciary obligations of such Person, in each
case, in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Company. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall modify any rights or
obligations under the Merger Agreement.

 

6\. _Representations and Warranties of the Stockholders_. Each Stockholder
hereby covenants, represents and warrants to Parent, severally and not
jointly, and solely as to itself and its Common Shares, as follows:

(a) _Ownership_. Such Stockholder (i) is the beneficial owner (as defined in
Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of, and has good, valid and marketable
title to, the Common Shares set forth opposite such Stockholders name on
Schedule A hereto, free and clear of any and all Liabilities, Liens, proxies,
voting trusts or agreements, options, rights, understandings or arrangements
or any other encumbrances whatsoever on title, transfer, or exercise of any
rights of a stockholder in respect of such Common Shares (collectively, "
_Encumbrances_ ") except for restrictions on Transfer under the Securities Act
or Encumbrances arising hereunder; (ii) does not own as of the date hereof, of
record or beneficially, any shares of capital stock of the Company (or rights
to acquire any such shares) other than the Common Shares set forth on Schedule
A hereto; and (iii) has the sole right to vote, dispose of and exercise and
holds sole power to issue instructions with respect to the matters set forth
in  _Sections 2_ , _3_ , and _4_ hereof, sole power to demand appraisal
rights and sole power to agree to all of the matters set forth in this
Agreement with respect to all of such Stockholders Common Shares, with no
limitations, qualifications or restrictions on such rights, subject to
applicable federal securities laws and the terms of this Agreement.

(b)  _Power; Binding Agreement_ _._ Such Stockholder has the legal capacity
and all requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and the Proxy, to perform such Stockholders obligations hereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and
performance by such Stockholder of this Agreement and the consummation by such
Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly
authorized by such Stockholder, and no other actions on the part of such
Stockholder are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery by such
Stockholder of this Agreement and the consummation by such Stockholder of the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by such Stockholder, and, assuming this Agreement
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Parent, constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of such Stockholder, enforceable against such Stockholder
in accordance with its terms, except that such enforceability may be limited
by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar Applicable Laws affecting or relating
to creditors rights generally and is subject to general principles of equity
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or law).

 



4 (c) _No Conflicts_ _._ None of the execution and delivery by such Stockholder
of this Agreement, the performance by such Stockholder of its obligations
hereunder or the consummation by each Stockholder of the transactions
contemplated hereby will (i) result in a violation or breach of, or constitute
(with or without notice or lapse of time or both) a default under, or
conflict with (A) in the case of a Stockholder that is not a natural person,
any provisions of the Organizational Documents of such Stockholder or (B) any
agreement to which such Stockholder is a party or by which such Stockholders
Common Shares are bound, or (ii) violate, or require any consent, approval, or
notice under, any provision of any judgment, order or decree or any Applicable
Law that is applicable to such Stockholder or any of such Stockholders
Common Shares (other than filings required pursuant to the Exchange Act),
except, in the case of (i) or (ii) above, as would not reasonably be expected,
either individually or in the aggregate, to impair the ability of such
Stockholder to perform its obligations hereunder on a timely basis.

(d) _Absence of Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no action,
arbitration, claim, proceeding, suit or investigation pending or, to the
knowledge of such Stockholder, threatened against such Stockholder before or

Stockholder to perform its obligations hereunder or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby on a timely basis.

 

(e) _Reliance by Parent_. Such Stockholder has received and reviewed a copy of
the Merger Agreement. Such Stockholder understands and acknowledges that

warrants to the Stockholders as follows:

 

(a) _Power; Binding Agreement_ _._ Parent has the legal capacity and all
requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to
perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by Parent, and, assuming this Agreement constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of each Stockholder, constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of Parent, enforceable against Parent in accordance with its terms,
except that such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Applicable Laws
affecting or relating to creditors rights generally and is subject to general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a proceeding in equity or law).

 

(b) _No Conflicts_ _._ The execution, delivery, and performance of this
Agreement by Parent and the consummation by Parent of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not (i) result in a violation or breach of, or
constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) a default under,
or conflict with (A) any provisions of the Organizational Documents of Parent
or (B) any Contract to which Parent is a party or by which Parents assets may
be bound, or (ii) violate, or require any consent, approval, or notice under,
any provision of any judgment, order or decree or any Applicable Law that is
applicable to Parent (other than filings required pursuant to the Exchange
Act), except, in the case of (i) or (ii) above, as would not reasonably be
expected, either individually or in the aggregate, to impair the ability
of Parent to perform its obligations hereunder on a timely basis.

8\. _Certain Restrictions_. Each Stockholder agrees, while this Agreement is
in effect, (a) not to take, agree or commit to take any action that would
reasonably be expected to make any representation or warranty of such
Stockholder contained in this Agreement inaccurate in any respect as of any
time during the term of this Agreement and (b) to take all reasonable action
necessary to prevent any such representation or warranty from being inaccurate
in any respect at any such time.

 



5 9\. _Non-Solicitation_. Each Stockholder, in such Stockholders capacity as
a stockholder of the Company, agrees (a) to be bound by and comply with the
terms and provisions of Section 6.02 of the Merger Agreement, to the extent
such terms and provisions are applicable to Representatives thereunder and (b)
not to make any statement or proposal inconsistent with the Board
Recommendation.

10\. _Disclosure_. Each Stockholder shall permit Parent to publish and
disclose in all documents and schedules filed with the SEC or any other
similar Governmental Authority, and any press release or other disclosure
document that Parent reasonably determines to be necessary or desirable in
connection with the Merger and any transactions related to the Merger, such
Stockholders identity and ownership of Common Shares and the nature of such
Stockholders commitments, arrangements and understandings under this
Agreement.

 

11\. _No Ownership Interest_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to vest in Parent any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of
ownership of or with respect to any Common Shares. Except as provided in this
Agreement, all rights, ownership and economic benefits relating to the Common
Shares shall remain vested in and belong to each Stockholder.

 

12\. _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, upon the request of Parent, each Stockholder shall execute and
deliver any additional documents and take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, all things as may reasonably be deemed by
Parent to be necessary or desirable to fulfill such Stockholders
obligations under this Agreement.

13\. _Stop Transfer Instructions_. At all times commencing with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the Expiration Date, in
furtherance of this Agreement, each Stockholder shall, and hereby does
authorize and instruct the Company or its counsel to notify the Companys
transfer agent that, from the date hereof until the Expiration Date, subject
to the terms hereof, there is a stop transfer order with respect to all of the
Common Shares of such Stockholder (and that this Agreement places limits on
the voting and transfer of such Common Shares until the Expiration Date).

14\. _Termination_. This Agreement and each Proxy, and all rights and
obligations of the parties hereunder and thereunder, shall terminate and
shall have no further force or effect as of the Expiration Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing set forth in this Section 14 or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall relieve any party hereto from liability, or
otherwise limit the liability of any party hereto, for any material breach of
this Agreement prior to such termination. This Section 14 and Sections 1, 5,
15 (as applicable _)_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

 

15\. _Miscellaneous_.

(a)  _Severability_ _._ If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated. Upon such a determination, the parties agree to negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner, in order that
substance of this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the
fullest extent possible.

 

(b) _Binding Effect and Assignment_ _._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations of the parties hereunder may be assigned by
any of the parties (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without prior
written consent of the other parties, except that Parent may assign, in its
sole discretion and without the consent of any other party, any of or all of
its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to one or more direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent. Subject

 



6  to the preceding sentence, this Agreement and all of the provisions hereof
shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by, the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and the
provisions of this Agreement are not intended to confer upon any person other
than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder

 

(c) _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto only by
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

(d) _Specific Performance; Injunctive Relief_ _._ The parties hereto
acknowledge that Parent shall be irreparably harmed and that there shall be
no adequate remedy at law for a violation of any of the covenants or
agreements of any Stockholder set forth herein. Therefore, it is agreed that,
in addition to any other remedies that may be available to Parent upon any
such violation at law or in equity, Parent shall have the right to enforce
such covenants and agreements by specific performance, injunctive relief or by
any other means available to Parent at law or in equity, without
the requirement of posting a bond or other security.

(e) _Notices_. Any notices or other communications required or permitted

writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given (i) when delivered or sent
if delivered in person or sent by facsimile transmission (provided

IRREVOCABLE PROXY

The undersigned Stockholder (the " _Stockholder_ ") of Constant Contact,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), hereby irrevocably (to the
fullest extent permitted by law) appoints Endurance International
Group Holdings, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware ("
_Parent_ "), acting through any of its authorized signatories, as the sole and
exclusive attorneys and proxies of the undersigned, with full power of
substitution and resubstitution, to vote and exercise all voting and related
rights (to the full extent that the undersigned is entitled to do so) with
respect to all of the shares of capital stock of the Company that now are or
hereafter may be beneficially owned by the undersigned, and any and all other
shares or equity securities of the Company issued or issuable in respect
thereof on or after the date hereof (collectively, the " _Shares_ ") in
accordance with the terms of this Irrevocable Proxy until the Expiration Date
(as defined below); _provided_ , _however_ , that such proxy and voting and
related rights are expressly limited to the matters discussed in clauses (i)
through (iii) in the fourth paragraph of this Irrevocable Proxy. Upon the
undersigneds execution of this Irrevocable Proxy, any and all prior proxies
given by the undersigned with respect to any Shares are hereby revoked and the
undersigned agrees not to grant any subsequent proxies with respect to the
Shares until after the Expiration Date, _provided that_ , the undersigned may
grant subsequent proxies with respect to any matter other than those discussed
in clauses (i) through (iii) in the fourth paragraph of this Irrevocable
Proxy.

This Irrevocable Proxy is irrevocable to the fullest extent permitted by
Applicable Law, is coupled with an interest sufficient in law and is granted
pursuant to that certain Voting Agreement of even date herewith by and between
Parent and the undersigned Stockholder (the " _Voting Agreement_ "), and is
granted as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent,
Paintbrush Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ ") to enter into that certain Agreement
and Plan of Merger of even date herewith (as it may be amended from time to
time, the " _Merger Agreement_ "), among Parent, Merger Sub and the Company.
The Merger Agreement provides for, among other things, the merger of Merger
Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") with the Company continuing
as the surviving corporation of the Merger and pursuant to which all
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock will be converted into the right to
receive the consideration set forth in the Merger Agreement.

 

As used herein, the term " _Expiration Date_ " shall mean the earlier to occur
of (i) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with the terms
thereof, (ii) such date and time as the Merger shall become effective in
accordance with the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement, and (iii)
the date of any material modification, waiver or amendment to any provision
of the Merger Agreement that reduces the amount, changes the form or otherwise
adversely affects, in any material respect, the consideration payable to the
Stockholder without the written consent of the Stockholder.

 

The attorneys and proxies named above, and each of them, are hereby authorized
and empowered by the undersigned, at any time prior to the Expiration Date,
to act as the undersigneds attorney and proxy to vote the Shares, and to
exercise all voting, consent and similar rights of the undersigned with
respect to the Shares (including, without limitation, the power to execute
and deliver written consents) at every annual, special, adjourned or
postponed meeting of stockholders of the Company and in every written consent
in lieu of such meeting:

 

(i) in favor of (A) the adoption of the Merger Agreement (as it may be
modified or amended from time to time) and any other matter that must be
approved by the stockholders of the Company in order for the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement to be consummated and (B) any
adjournment, recess, delay or postponement recommended by the Company (and not
publicly opposed by Parent) with respect to any stockholder meeting with
respect to the Merger Agreement; (ii) against approval of any proposal made in opposition to, made in
competition with, or that would reasonably be expected to result in a breach
of, the Merger Agreement, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement; and

 

(iii) against any of the following actions (other than those actions in
furtherance of the Merger and the Merger Agreement): (A) any merger,
consolidation, business combination, sale of assets, reorganization or
recapitalization of or involving the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, (B) any sale, lease or transfer of all or substantially all of
the assets of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, (C) any
reorganization, recapitalization, extraordinary dividend, dissolution,
liquidation or winding up of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries,
(D) any material change in the capitalization of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, or the corporate structure of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, (E) any Acquisition Proposal with respect to the
Company, or (F) any other action that is intended, or would reasonably be
expected to impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage or adversely
affect the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement.

 

The attorneys and proxies named above may not exercise this Irrevocable Proxy
on any other matter. The undersigned Stockholder may vote the Shares in its
sole discretion on all other matters. For the avoidance of doubt, clauses (i)
through (iii) in the fourth paragraph of this Irrevocable Proxy shall not
apply to votes, if any, on the election or removal of directors
as recommended by the Company Board.

Any obligation of the undersigned hereunder shall be binding upon the
successors and permitted assigns of the undersigned.

This Irrevocable Proxy shall terminate, and be of no further force and effect,
automatically upon the Expiration Date.

reason of the fact that he or she is or was, or has agreed to become, a

serve, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer, partner,
employee or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee
benefit plan) (all such persons being referred to hereinafter as an "
_Indemnitee_ "), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or

under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, and amounts paid
in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee

reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the
Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no
reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination
of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction
or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself,
create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner
which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best
interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was

shall indemnify any Indemnitee who was or is a party to or threatened to be
made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in

or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve,
at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer, partner, employee
or trustee of, or in a similar capacity

 



2  with, another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise (including any employee benefit plan), or by reason of any action
alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all expenses
(including attorneys fees) and, to the extent permitted by law, amounts paid
in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee
in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom,
if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably
believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation,
except that no indemnification shall be made under this Section 2 in respect
of any claim, issue or matter as to which Indemnitee shall have been adjudged
to be liable to the Corporation, unless, and only to the extent, that the
Court of Chancery of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was
brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of
such liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is
fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses (including
attorneys fees) which the Court of Chancery of Delaware or such other court
shall deem proper.

3\. _Indemnification for Expenses of Successful Party_. Notwithstanding any
other provisions of this Article Eight, to the extent that an Indemnitee has
been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any action, suit or
proceeding referred to in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article Eight, or
in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, or on appeal from any such
action, suit or proceeding, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all
expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by or on
behalf of Indemnitee in connection therewith. Without limiting the foregoing,
if any action, suit or proceeding is disposed of, on the merits or otherwise
(including a disposition without prejudice), without (i) the disposition being
adverse to Indemnitee, (ii) an adjudication that Indemnitee was liable to the
Corporation, (iii) a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by Indemnitee, (iv) an
adjudication that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner he or
she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation, and (v) with respect to any criminal proceeding, an adjudication
that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was
unlawful, Indemnitee shall be considered for the purposes hereof to have been
wholly successful with respect thereto.

4\. _Notification and Defense of Claim_. As a condition precedent to an
Indemnitees right to be indemnified, such Indemnitee must notify the
Corporation in writing as soon as practicable of any action, suit, proceeding
or investigation involving such Indemnitee for which indemnity will or could
be sought. With respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of
which the Corporation is so notified, the Corporation will be entitled to
participate therein at its own expense and/or to assume the defense
thereof at its own expense, with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to
Indemnitee. After notice from the Corporation to Indemnitee of its election so
to assume such defense, the Corporation shall not be liable to Indemnitee for
any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in connection
with such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, other than as provided
below in this Section 4 of this Article Eight. Indemnitee shall have the right
to employ his or her own counsel in connection with such action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
incurred after notice from the Corporation of its assumption of the defense
thereof shall be at the expense of Indemnitee unless (i) the employment of
counsel by Indemnitee has been authorized by the Corporation, (ii) counsel to
Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of
interest or position on any significant issue between the Corporation
and Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such action, suit, proceeding
or investigation or (iii) the Corporation shall not in fact have employed
counsel to assume the defense of such action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, in 

 



3  each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel for Indemnitee shall be
at the expense of the Corporation, except as otherwise expressly provided by
this Article Eight. The Corporation shall not be entitled, without the
consent of Indemnitee, to assume the defense of any claim brought by or in the
right of the Corporation or as to which counsel for Indemnitee shall have
reasonably made the conclusion provided for in clause (ii) above. The
Corporation shall not be required to indemnify Indemnitee under this Article
Eight for any amounts paid in settlement of any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation effected without its written consent. The Corporation shall not
settle any action, suit, proceeding or investigation in any manner which would
impose any penalty or limitation on Indemnitee without Indemnitees written
consent. Neither the Corporation nor Indemnitee will unreasonably withhold or
delay its consent to any proposed settlement.

5\. _Advance of Expenses_. Subject to the provisions of Section 6 of this
Article Eight, in the event of any threatened or pending action, suit,
proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation receives notice under
this Article Eight, any expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by or on
behalf of Indemnitee in defending an action, suit, proceeding or
investigation or any appeal therefrom shall be paid by the Corporation in
advance of the final disposition of such matter; provided, however, that the
payment of such expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in advance of
the final disposition of such matter shall be made only upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced in
the event that it shall ultimately be determined that Indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article;
and provided further that no such advancement of expenses shall be made under
this Article Eight if it is determined (in the manner described in Section 6)
that (i) Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner he or she
reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the
Corporation, or (ii) with respect to any criminal action or proceeding,
Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.
Such undertaking shall be accepted without reference to the financial ability
of Indemnitee to make such repayment.

 

6\. _Procedure for Indemnification and Advancement_. In order to obtain
indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to Section 1, 2, 3 or 5
of this Article Eight, an Indemnitee shall submit to the Corporation a written
request. Any such advancement of expenses shall be made promptly, and in any
event within 60 days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request
of Indemnitee, unless (i) the Corporation has assumed the defense pursuant to
Section 4 of this Article Eight (and none of the circumstances described in
Section 4 of this Article Eight that would nonetheless entitle the Indemnitee
to indemnification for the fees and expenses of separate counsel have
occurred) or (ii) the Corporation determines within such 60-day period that
Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard of conduct set forth in
Section 1, 2 or 5 of this Article Eight, as the case may be. Any such
indemnification, unless ordered by a court, shall be made with respect to
requests under Section 1 or 2 only as authorized in the specific case upon a
determination by the Corporation that the indemnification of Indemnitee is
proper because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth
in Section 1 or 2, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made in
each instance (a) by a majority vote of the directors of the Corporation
consisting of persons who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or
proceeding in question ("disinterested directors"), whether or not a quorum,
(b) by a committee of disinterested directors designated by majority vote of
disinterested directors, whether or not a quorum, (c) if there are no
disinterested directors, or if the disinterested 

 



4  directors so direct, by independent legal counsel (who may, to the extent
permitted by law, be regular legal counsel to the Corporation) in a written
opinion, or (d) by the stockholders of the Corporation.

7\. _Remedies_. The right to indemnification or advancement of expenses as
granted by this Article shall be enforceable by Indemnitee in any court of
competent jurisdiction. Neither the failure of the Corporation to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification is
proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable
standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Corporation pursuant
to Section 6 of this Article Eight that Indemnitee has not met such applicable
standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption
that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct. Indemnitees
expenses (including attorneys fees) reasonably incurred in connection with
successfully establishing Indemnitees right to indemnification, in whole or
in part, in any such proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any suit brought by Indemnitee to enforce a
right to indemnification hereunder it shall be a defense that the Indemnitee
has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

8\. _Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article
Eight, except as set forth in Section 7 of this Article Eight, the Corporation
shall not indemnify an Indemnitee pursuant to this Article Eight in connection
with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee unless the
initiation thereof was approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article Eight, the
Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee to the extent such Indemnitee
is reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, and in the event the Corporation
makes any indemnification payments to an Indemnitee and such Indemnitee is
subsequently reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, such Indemnitee shall
promptly refund indemnification payments to the Corporation to the extent of
such insurance reimbursement.

9\. _Subsequent Amendment_. No amendment, termination or repeal of this
Article Eight or of the relevant provisions of the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware or any other applicable laws shall adversely affect or
diminish in any way the rights of any Indemnitee to indemnification under the
provisions hereof with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation arising out of or relating to any actions, transactions or facts
occurring prior to the final adoption of such amendment, termination or
repeal.

10\. _Other Rights_. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided
by this Article Eight shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to
which an Indemnitee seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be
entitled under any law (common or statutory), agreement or vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in
Indemnitees official capacity and as to action in any other capacity while
holding office for the Corporation, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who
has ceased to be a director or officer, and shall inure to the benefit of the
estate, heirs, executors and administrators of Indemnitee. Nothing contained
in this Article Eight shall be deemed to prohibit, and the Corporation is
specifically authorized to enter into, agreements with officers and directors
providing indemnification rights and procedures different from those set
forth in this Article Eight. In addition, the Corporation may, to the extent
authorized from time to time by its Board

 



5  of Directors, grant indemnification rights to other employees or agents of
the Corporation or other persons serving the Corporation and such rights may
be equivalent to, or greater or less than, those set forth in this Article
Eight.

11\. _Partial Indemnification_. If an Indemnitee is entitled under any
provision of this Article Eight to indemnification by the Corporation for
some or a portion of the expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments,
fines or amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on
behalf of Indemnitee in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation and any appeal therefrom but not, however, for the total amount
thereof, the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the
portion of such expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines or
amounts paid in settlement to which Indemnitee is entitled.

12\. _Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its
expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) against any expense,
liability or loss incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out
of his or her status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the
power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

13\. _Savings Clause_. If this Article Eight or any portion hereof shall
be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the
Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Indemnitee as to any expenses
(including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal or administrative, including an action by or in the right of
the Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of
this Article Eight that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law.

14\. _Definitions_. Terms used herein and defined in Section 145(h) and
Section 145(i) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware shall
have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in such Section 145(h) and
Section 145(i).

 

ARTICLE NINE

The directors shall have powers without the assent or vote of the
stockholders to fix and vary the amount to be reserved for any proper purpose;
to authorize and cause to be executed mortgages and liens upon all or any part
of the property of the Corporation; to determine the use and disposition of
any surplus or net profits; and to fix the times for the declaration and
payment of dividends.

 

ARTICLE TEN

The directors in their discretion may submit any contract or act for approval
or ratification at any annual meeting of the stockholders or at any meeting of
the stockholders called for the purpose of considering any such act or
contract, and any contract or act that shall be approved or be ratified by
the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the Corporation which is
represented in person or by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote thereat
(provided 

 



6  that a lawful quorum of stockholders be there represented in person or by
proxy) shall be as valid and as binding upon the Corporation and upon all the
stockholders as though it had been approved or ratified by every stockholder
of the Corporation, whether or not the contract or act would otherwise be open
to legal attack because of directors interest, or for any other reason.

 

ARTICLE ELEVEN

In addition to the powers and authorities hereinbefore or by statute
expressly conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise
all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by
the Corporation;  _subject_ , _nevertheless_ , to the provisions of the
statutes of Delaware, of this certificate, and to any By-laws from time to
time made by the stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that no By-laws so
made shall invalidate any prior act of the directors which would have been
valid if such bylaw had not been made.

ARTICLE TWELVE

 

Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended from time to
time, shall not apply to the Corporation.

serve, as a director or officer of the Corporation.

 

NOW THEREFORE, the Corporation and the Indemnitee do hereby agree as follows:

 

1\. _Definitions._ As used in this Agreement:

 

(a) The term "Proceeding" shall include any threatened, pending or completed

 (d) The term "Change in Control" shall mean the occurrence of any one of the

objection to such nomination) shall be an Incumbent Director; provided,
however, that no individual initially elected or nominated as a director of
the Corporation as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with
respect to directors or as a result of any other actual or threatened
solicitation of proxies by or on behalf of any person other than the Board
shall be deemed to be an Incumbent Director;

 

(ii) any "person" (as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of

event described in this paragraph (ii) shall not be deemed to be a Change in
Control by virtue of any of the following acquisitions: (A) by the Corporation
or any subsidiary, (B) by any employee benefit plan (or related trust)
sponsored or maintained by the Corporation or any subsidiary, (C) by any

Securities were converted pursuant to such Business Combination), and such
voting power among the holders thereof is in substantially the same
proportion as the voting power of such Corporation Voting Securities among the
holders thereof immediately prior to the Business Combination, (B) no person
(other than any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or
maintained by the Surviving Corporation or the Parent Corporation), is or
becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 35% or more of the
total voting power of the outstanding voting securities eligible to elect
directors of the Parent Corporation (or, if there is no Parent Corporation,
the Surviving Corporation) and (C) at least half of the members of the board
of directors of the Parent Corporation (or, if there is no
Parent Corporation, the Surviving Corporation) following the consummation of
the Business Combination were Incumbent Directors at the time of the Boards
approval of the execution of the initial agreement providing for such Business
Combination (any Business Combination which satisfies all of the criteria
specified in (A), (B) and (C) above shall be deemed to be a "Non-Qualifying
Transaction");

 

 (iv) the stockholders of the Corporation approve a plan of complete
liquidation or dissolution of the Corporation;

(v) the consummation of a sale of all or substantially all of the
Corporations assets; or

(vi) the occurrence of any other event that the Board determines by a duly
approved resolution constitutes a Change in Control.

(e) The term "Independent Counsel" shall mean a law firm, or a member of a law
firm, that is experienced in matters of corporation law and neither currently
is, nor in the past five years has been, retained to represent: (i) the
Corporation or the Indemnitee in any matter material to either such party or
(ii) any other party to the Proceeding giving rise to a claim for
indemnification hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term
"Independent Counsel" shall not include any person who, under the applicable
standards of professional conduct then prevailing, would have a conflict of
interest in representing either the Corporation or the Indemnitee in an action
to determine the Indemnitees rights under this Agreement.

 

(f) References to "other enterprise" shall include employee benefit plans;
references to "fines" shall include any excise tax assessed with respect to
any employee benefit plan; references to "serving at the request of the
Corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by,
such director, officer, employee, or agent with respect to an employee benefit
plan, its participants, or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith
and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interests of the
participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to
have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation"
as referred to in this Agreement.

 

2\. _Indemnity of Indemnitee._ Subject to Sections 5, 6 and 8, the Corporation
shall indemnify the Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding as to which
the Indemnitee is, was or is threatened to be made a party (or is otherwise
involved) by reason of the Indemnitees Corporate Status, to the fullest
extent permitted by law (as such may be amended from time to time).
In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof:

(a) _Indemnification in Third-Party Proceedings._ The Corporation shall
indemnify the Indemnitee in accordance with the provisions of this Section
2(a) if the Indemnitee was or is a party to or threatened to be made a party
to or otherwise involved in any Proceeding (other than a Proceeding by or in
the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor or a
Proceeding referred to in Section 5 below) by reason of the Indemnitees
Corporate Status or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or
omitted in connection therewith, against all Expenses, judgments, fines,
penalties and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by
or on behalf of the Indemnitee in connection with such Proceeding, if the
Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner which the Indemnitee reasonably
believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation
and, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, had no reasonable cause to
believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.

 

 (b) _Indemnification in Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation. _
The Corporation shall indemnify the Indemnitee in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 2(b) if the Indemnitee was or is a party to or
threatened to be made a party to or otherwise involved in any Proceeding by or
in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason
of the Indemnitees Corporate Status or by reason of any action alleged to
have been taken or omitted in connection therewith, against all Expenses and,
to the extent permitted by law, amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably incurred by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in connection with such
Proceeding, if the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner which the
Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best
interests of the Corporation, except that, if applicable law so requires, no
indemnification shall be made under this Section 2(b) in respect of any claim,
issue or matter as to which the Indemnitee shall have been adjudged to be
liable to the Corporation, unless, and only to the extent, that the Court of
Chancery of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought
shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of such
liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, the Indemnitee is
fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such Expenses as the Court of
Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.

 

3\. _Indemnification of Expenses of Successful Party._ Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that the Indemnitee has been
successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any Proceeding or in
defense of any claim, issue or matter therein (other than a Proceeding
referred to in Section 5), the Indemnitee shall be indemnified against
all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of the
Indemnitee in connection therewith.

4\. _Indemnification for Expenses of a Witness._ To the extent that the
Indemnitee is, by reason of the Indemnitees Corporate Status, a witness in
any Proceeding to which the Indemnitee is not a party, the Indemnitee shall be
indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by or on
behalf of the Indemnitee in connection therewith.

5\. _Exceptions to Right of Indemnification. _ Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary to this Agreement, except as set forth in Section 9,

(a) the Corporation shall not indemnify the Indemnitee under this Agreement
in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by the Indemnitee
unless (i) the initiation thereof was approved by the Board of Directors of
the Corporation or (ii) the Proceeding was commenced following a Change in
Control; and

(b) the Corporation shall not indemnify the Indemnitee to the extent the
Indemnitee is reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, and in the event the
Corporation makes any indemnification payments to the Indemnitee and the
Indemnitee is subsequently reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, the
Indemnitee shall promptly refund such indemnification payments to the
Corporation to the extent of such insurance reimbursement.

6\. _Notification and Defense of Claim_.

(a) As a condition precedent to the Indemnitees right to be indemnified, the
Indemnitee must notify the Corporation in writing as soon as practicable of
any Proceeding for which indemnity will or could be sought. With respect to
any Proceeding of which the Corporation is so notified, the 

 

  Corporation will be entitled to participate therein at its own expense
and/or to assume the defense thereof at its own expense, with legal counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee. After notice from the Corporation to
the Indemnitee of its election so to assume such defense, the Corporation
shall not be liable to the Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such Proceeding,
other than as provided below in this Section 6\. The Indemnitee shall have the
right to employ his or her own counsel in connection with such Proceeding, but
the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from
the Corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the
expense of the Indemnitee unless (i) the employment of counsel by the
Indemnitee has been authorized by the Corporation, (ii) counsel to the
Indemnitee shall have reasonably determined that there may be a conflict of
interest or position on any significant issue between the Corporation and the
Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such Proceeding or (iii) the
Corporation shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of
such Proceeding, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel for
the Indemnitee shall be at the expense of the Corporation, except as otherwise
expressly provided by this Agreement, and provided that Indemnitees counsel
shall cooperate reasonably with the Corporations counsel to minimize the cost
of defending claims against the Corporation and the Indemnitee. The
Corporation shall not be entitled, without the consent of the Indemnitee, to
assume the defense of any claim brought by or in the right of the Corporation
or as to which counsel for the Indemnitee shall have reasonably made the
determination provided for in clause (ii) above.

 

(b) The Corporation shall not be required to indemnify the Indemnitee under
this Agreement for any amounts paid in settlement of any Proceeding effected
without its written consent. The Corporation shall not settle any Proceeding
in any manner that would impose any penalty or limitation on the Indemnitee
without the Indemnitees written consent. Neither the Corporation nor the
Indemnitee will unreasonably withhold or delay their consent to any proposed
settlement.

7\. _Advancement of Expenses._ Subject to the provisions of Section 8, in the
event that (a) the Corporation does not assume the defense pursuant to Section
6 of any Proceeding of which the Corporation receives notice under this
Agreement or (b) the Corporation assumes such defense but Indemnitee is,
pursuant to Section 6, entitled to have the fees and costs of Indemnitees own
counsel paid for by the Corporation, any Expenses actually and reasonably
incurred by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in defending such Proceeding shall
be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such
Proceeding; _provided_ , _however,_ that the payment of such Expenses incurred
by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of such
Proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf
of the Indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it shall
ultimately be determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Agreement. Such
undertaking shall be accepted without reference to the financial ability of
the Indemnitee to make repayment. Any advances and undertakings to repay
pursuant to this Section 7 shall be unsecured and interest-free.

8\. _Procedures_. 

(a) In order to obtain indemnification or advancement of Expenses pursuant to
this Agreement, the Indemnitee shall submit to the Corporation a written
request, including in such request such documentation and information as is
reasonably available to the Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to
determine whether and to what extent the Indemnitee is entitled
to indemnification or advancement of Expenses. Any such indemnification or
advancement of

 

  Expenses shall be made promptly, and in any event within (i) in the case of
advancement of Expenses under Section 7, 30 calendar days after receipt by the
Corporation of the written request of the Indemnitee, or (ii) in the case of
all other indemnification, 60 calendar days after receipt by the Corporation
of the written request of the Indemnitee, subject to the provisions of
Sections 8(b) and (c) below.

 

(b) With respect to requests for indemnification under Section 2,
indemnification shall be made unless the Corporation determines that
Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section
2\. Any determination as to whether Indemnitee has met the applicable standard
of conduct set forth in Section 2, and any determination that advanced
Expenses must be subsequently repaid to the Corporation, shall be made, in the
discretion of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, (1) by a majority
vote of the directors of the Corporation consisting of persons who are not
at that time parties to the Proceeding ("disinterested directors"), whether
or not a quorum, (2) by a committee of disinterested directors designated by a
majority vote of disinterested directors, whether or not a quorum, (3)
if there are no disinterested directors, or if the disinterested directors so
direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, or (4) by
the stockholders of the Corporation. Any such determination with respect to
requests under Section 2 shall be made within the 60-day period referred to
in clause (ii) of Section 8(a) (unless extended by mutual agreement by the
Corporation and Indemnitee). For the purpose of the foregoing determination
with respect to requests under Section 2 or repayment of advanced Expenses,
the Indemnitee shall be entitled to a presumption that he or she has met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 2\.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if a
request for indemnification is made after a Change in Control, at the
election of the Indemnitee made in writing to the Corporation, any
determination required to be made pursuant to Section 8(b) above as to whether
the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct or is required to
repay advanced Expenses shall be made by Independent Counsel selected as
provided in this Section 8(c). The Independent Counsel shall be selected by
the Indemnitee, unless the Indemnitee shall request that such selection be
made by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The party making the
determination shall give written notice to the other party advising it of the
identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. The party receiving such
notice may, within seven days after such written notice of selection shall
have been given, deliver to the other party a written objection to such
selection. Such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the
Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements
of "Independent Counsel" as defined in Section 1, and the objection shall set
forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion. Absent a proper
and timely objection, the person so selected shall act as Independent Counsel.
If a written objection is made, the Independent Counsel so selected may not
serve as Independent Counsel unless and until a court has determined that such
objection is without merit. If, within 20 days after submission by the
Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification, no Independent Counsel
shall have been selected or if selected, shall have been objected to, in
accordance with this paragraph either the Corporation or the Indemnitee may
petition the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or other court of
competent jurisdiction for resolution of any objection which shall have been
made by the Corporation or the Indemnitee to the others selection of
Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a
person selected by the court or by such other person as the court shall
designate, and the person with respect to whom an objection is favorably
resolved or the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel. The
Corporation shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of Independent Counsel
incurred in connection with its acting in such capacity. The

 

  Corporation shall pay any and all reasonable and necessary fees and expenses
incident to the procedures of this paragraph, regardless of the manner in
which such Independent Counsel was selected or appointed.

(d) The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of
itself, create a presumption that the Indemnitee did not act in good faith and
in a manner that the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed
to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal
Proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was
unlawful.

(e) The Indemnitee shall cooperate with the person, persons or entity making
such determination with respect to the Indemnitees entitlement to
indemnification, including providing to such person, persons or entity upon
reasonable advance request any documentation or information which is not
privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably
available to the Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination.
Any Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in so
cooperating shall be borne by the Corporation (irrespective of the
determination as to the Indemnitees entitlement to indemnification) and the
Corporation hereby indemnifies the Indemnitee therefrom.

 

9\. _Remedies._ The right to indemnification or advancement of Expenses as
provided by this Agreement shall be enforceable by the Indemnitee in any
court of competent jurisdiction if the Corporation denies such request, in
whole or in part, or if no disposition thereof is made within the applicable
period referred to in Section 8\. Unless otherwise required by law,
the burden of proving that indemnification is not appropriate shall be on the
Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification is
proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable
standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Corporation that the
Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense
to the action or create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the
applicable standard of conduct. The Indemnitees Expenses actually and
reasonably incurred in connection with successfully establishing the
Indemnitees right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any
such Proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation.

10\. _Partial Indemnification._ If the Indemnitee is entitled under
any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Corporation for
some or a portion of the Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid
in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of the
Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding but not, however, for the total
amount thereof, the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify the Indemnitee
for the portion of such Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid
in settlement to which the Indemnitee is entitled.

11\. _Subrogation._ In the event of any payment under this Agreement, the
Corporation shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the
rights of recovery of the Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required
and take all action necessary to secure such rights, including execution of
such documents as are necessary to enable the Corporation to bring suit to
enforce such rights.

 

 12\. _Term of Agreement._ This Agreement shall continue until and terminate
upon the later of (a) six years after the date that the Indemnitee shall have
ceased to serve as a director or officer of the Corporation or, at the request
of the Corporation, as a director, officer, partner, trustee, member, employee
or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, limited
liability company or other enterprise or (b) the final termination of all
Proceedings pending on the date set forth in clause (a) in respect of which
the Indemnitee is granted rights of indemnification or advancement of
Expenses hereunder and of any proceeding commenced by the Indemnitee pursuant
to Section 9 of this Agreement relating thereto.

 

13\. _Indemnification Hereunder Not Exclusive._ The indemnification and
advancement of Expenses provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which the Indemnitee may be entitled under
the Certification of Incorporation, the By-Laws, any other agreement, any vote
of stockholders or disinterested directors, the General Corporation Law of
Delaware, any other law (common or statutory), or otherwise, both as to action
in the Indemnitees official capacity and as to action in another capacity
while holding office for the Corporation. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall be deemed to prohibit the Corporation from purchasing and maintaining
insurance, at its expense, to protect itself or the Indemnitee against any
expense, liability or loss incurred by it or the Indemnitee in any such
capacity, or arising out of the Indemnitees status as such, whether or not
the Indemnitee would be indemnified against such expense, liability or loss
under this Agreement.

 

14\. _No Special Rights._ Nothing herein shall confer upon the Indemnitee any
right to continue to serve as an officer or director of the Corporation for
any period of time or at any particular rate of compensation.

15\. _Savings Clause._ If this Agreement or any portion thereof shall be
invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the
Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify the Indemnitee as to Expenses,
judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement with respect to
any Proceeding to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this
Agreement that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law.

 

16\. _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall constitute the original.

 

17\. _Successors and Assigns._ This Agreement shall be binding upon the
Corporation and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of
the estate, heirs, executors, administrators and personal representatives of
the Indemnitee.

18\. _Headings._ The headings of the paragraphs of this Agreement are
inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute part of
this Agreement or to affect the construction thereof.

 

19\. _Modification and Waiver._ This Agreement may be amended from time to
time to reflect changes in Delaware law or for other reasons. No supplement,
modification or amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed
in writing by both of the parties hereto. No waiver of any of the provisions
of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any
other provision hereof nor shall any such waiver constitute a continuing
waiver.

 

 20\. _Notices._ All notices, requests, demands and other communications
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given (i) when
delivered by hand or (ii) if mailed by certified or registered mail with
postage prepaid, on the third day after the date on which it is so mailed:

21\. _Applicable Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and
enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware. The
Indemnitee may elect to have the right to indemnification or reimbursement or
advancement of Expenses interpreted on the basis of the applicable law in
effect at the time of the occurrence of the event or events giving rise to
the applicable Proceeding, to the extent permitted by law, or on the basis of
the applicable law in effect at the time such indemnification or reimbursement
or advancement of Expenses is sought. Such election shall be made, by a
notice in writing to the Corporation, at the time indemnification or
reimbursement or advancement of Expenses is sought; _provided_ , _however,_
that if no such notice is given, and if the General Corporation Law of
Delaware is amended, or other Delaware law is enacted, to permit further
indemnification of the directors and officers, then the Indemnitee shall be
indemnified to the fullest extent permitted under the General Corporation Law,
as so amended, or by such other Delaware law, as so enacted.

22\. _Enforcement._ The Corporation expressly confirms and agrees that it has
entered into this Agreement in order to induce the Indemnitee to continue to
serve as an officer or director of the Corporation, and acknowledges that the
Indemnitee is relying upon this Agreement in continuing in such capacity.

 

23\. _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement of the
parties hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein and
supercedes all prior agreements, whether oral or written, by any officer,
employee or representative of any party hereto in respect of the subject
matter contained herein; and any prior agreement of the parties hereto in
respect of the subject matter contained herein is hereby terminated and
cancelled. For avoidance of doubt, the parties confirm that the foregoing does
not apply to or limit the Indemnitees rights under Delaware law or the
Corporations Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws.

 

 24\. _Consent to Suit._ In the case of any dispute under or in connection with
this Agreement, the Indemnitee may only bring suit against the Corporation in
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. The Indemnitee hereby consents
to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts of the State of
Delaware, and the Indemnitee hereby waives any claim the Indemnitee may have
at any time as to forum non conveniens with respect to such venue. The
Corporation shall have the right to institute any legal action arising out of
or relating to this Agreement in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any
judgment entered against either of the parties in any proceeding hereunder may
be entered and enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction.

 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly
executed as of the day and year first above written.
