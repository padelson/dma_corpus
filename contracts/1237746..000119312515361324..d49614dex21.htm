an action, suit, proceeding or investigation or any appeal therefrom shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such matter; provided, however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in
advance of the final disposition of such matter shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it shall ultimately be determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to
be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article; and provided further that no such advancement of expenses shall be made under this Article Eight if it is determined (in the manner described in Section&nbsp;6) that
(i)&nbsp;Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, or (ii)&nbsp;with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, Indemnitee had reasonable

Section&nbsp;1, 2, 3 or 5 of this Article Eight, an Indemnitee shall submit to the Corporation a written request. Any such advancement of expenses shall be made promptly, and in any event within 60 days after receipt by the Corporation of the
written request of Indemnitee, unless (i)&nbsp;the Corporation has assumed the defense pursuant to Section&nbsp;4 of this Article Eight (and none of the circumstances described in Section&nbsp;4 of this Article Eight that would nonetheless entitle

specific case upon a determination by the Corporation that the indemnification of Indemnitee is proper because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section&nbsp;1 or 2, as the case may be. Such determination shall be

met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Corporation pursuant to Section&nbsp;6 of this Article Eight that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a
presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct. Indemnitee&#146;s expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees) reasonably incurred in connection with successfully establishing Indemnitee&#146;s right to indemnification, in
whole or in part, in any such proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any suit brought by Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder it shall be a defense that the Indemnitee has not

extent such Indemnitee is reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, and in the event the Corporation makes any indemnification payments to an Indemnitee and such Indemnitee is subsequently reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, such Indemnitee
shall promptly refund indemnification payments to the Corporation to the extent of such insurance reimbursement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">9. <U>Subsequent

Indemnitee shall cooperate with the person, persons or entity making such determination with respect to the Indemnitee&#146;s entitlement to indemnification, including providing to such person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request any
documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination. Any Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the
Indemnitee in so cooperating shall be borne by the Corporation (irrespective of the determination as to the Indemnitee&#146;s entitlement to indemnification) and the Corporation hereby indemnifies the Indemnitee therefrom. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">9. <U>Remedies.</U> The right to indemnification or advancement of Expenses as provided by this Agreement shall be enforceable by the
Indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction if the Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or if no disposition thereof is made within the applicable period referred to in Section&nbsp;8. Unless otherwise required by law, the
burden of proving that indemnification is not appropriate shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification is proper in the circumstances
because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Corporation that the Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the
Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct. The Indemnitee&#146;s Expenses actually and reasonably incurred in connection with successfully establishing the Indemnitee&#146;s right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such
Proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">10. <U>Partial Indemnification.</U> If the Indemnitee is entitled under any
provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Corporation for some or a portion of the Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in connection with
any Proceeding but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify the Indemnitee for the portion of such Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement to which the Indemnitee is
entitled. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">11. <U>Subrogation.</U> In the event of any payment under this Agreement, the Corporation shall be subrogated to the extent of
such payment to all of the rights of recovery of the Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and take all action necessary to secure such rights, including execution of such documents as are necessary to enable the Corporation to bring
suit to enforce such rights. </P>
