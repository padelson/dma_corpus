THE MERGER

  

  

2.1. The Merger.

  

  

(a) At the Effective Time, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, Oneida shall be merged with and into CBSI, the separate
existence of Oneida shall cease and CBSI shall continue as the surviving
corporation. CBSI as the surviving corporation after the Merger is hereinafter
sometimes referred to as the "Surviving Corporation."

  

  

(b) At or contemporaneously with the Closing, the parties shall cause the
Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger or articles of
merger as contemplated by the DGCL and/or the MGCL, together with any required
related documents, with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and
the Department of Assessments and Taxation of the State of Maryland, in such
form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions
of the DGCL and/or the MGCL (the time of the last of such filings being the
"Effective Time").

  

  

2.2. Merger Consideration. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of any Person, each share of Oneida Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted at the
election of the holder thereof (in accordance with the election and allocation
procedures set forth in this Section 2.2) into either (i) shares of CBSI
Common Stock based upon the Exchange Ratio; (ii) cash, at the rate of $20.00
for each share of Oneida Common Stock; or (iii) a combination of such shares
of CBSI Common Stock and cash, as more fully set forth in Section 2.2(a)(iii)
(the shares of CBSI Common Stock issuable and the cash payable in connection
with the Merger sometimes being referred to as the "Merger Consideration").

  

  

(a) Election as to Outstanding Oneida Common Stock. The shareholders of Oneida
shall be given the following options in connection with the exchange of their
Oneida Common Stock pursuant to the Merger:

  

  

(i) At the option of each holder of Oneida Common Stock, all of such holder's
Oneida Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive such number
of shares of CBSI Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Oneida Common
Stock held by such holder multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (such election, the
"All Stock Election" and such shares, the "Stock Election Shares"), provided
that:

  

  

(A) Fractional shares will not be issued and cash (payable by check) will be
paid in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.2(j); and

  

  

(B) After giving effect to Section 2.2(a)(i), (ii), and (iii), in no event
shall, in the aggregate, more than sixty percent (60%) of Oneida Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time be converted
into and become shares of CBSI Common Stock; or

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) At the option of each holder of Oneida Common Stock, all of such holder's
Oneida Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive cash (payable
by check) in an amount equal to the number of shares of Oneida Common Stock
held by such holder multiplied by $20.00 (such election, the "All Cash
Election" and such shares, the "Cash Election Shares"), provided that:

  

  

(A) After giving effect to Section 2.2(a)(i), (ii), and (iii), in no event
shall, in the aggregate, more than forty percent (40%) of Oneida Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time be converted
into and become cash; or

  

  

(iii) At the option of each holder of Oneida Common Stock, sixty percent (60%)
of such holder's aggregate number of shares of Oneida Common Stock (the "Stock
Portion") shall be converted into the right to receive such number of shares
of CBSI Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Oneida Common Stock in
the Stock Portion multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, and forty percent (40%) of
such holder's aggregate number of shares of Oneida Common Stock (the "Cash
Portion") shall be converted into the right to receive cash (payable by check)
in an amount equal to the number of shares of Oneida Common Stock in the Cash
Portion multiplied by $20.00 (such election, the "Mixed Election" and such
shares, the "Mixed Election Shares"), provided that:

  

  

(A) Fractional shares will not be issued and cash (payable by check) will be
paid in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.2(j); and

  

  

(B) After giving effect to Section 2.2(a)(i), (ii) and (iii), in no event
shall, in the aggregate, more than sixty percent (60%) of Oneida Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time be converted
into and become shares of CBSI Common Stock;

  

  

(C) After giving effect to Section 2.2(a)(i), (ii), and (iii), in no event
shall, in the aggregate, more than forty percent (40%) of Oneida Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time be converted
into and become cash; or

  

  

(iv) If the holder of Oneida Common Stock indicates on the Election Form that
such record holder has no preference as to the receipt of cash or CBSI Common
Stock for such shares, or if no election is validly made by a holder by the
Election Deadline pursuant to Section 2.2(d) ("Non-election Shares"), all of
such holder's shares of Oneida Common Stock shall be converted into the right
to receive CBSI Common Stock as set forth in Section 2.2(a)(i), cash as set
forth in Section 2.2(a)(ii), or any combination of CBSI Common Stock and cash
as determined by CBSI; provided, however, that no fractional shares shall be
issued and cash will be paid in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.2(j).
Prior to any allocation of Cash Election Shares, Stock Election Shares or
Mixed Election Shares pursuant to Section 2.2(f) and (g), such Non-election
Shares of Oneida Common Stock shall be allocated by CBSI on a pro rata basis
among non-electing holders based upon the number of shares of Oneida Common
Stock for which an election has not been received by the Election Deadline in
order to achieve the overall ratio of sixty percent (60%) of Oneida Common
Stock to be converted into CBSI Common Stock and forty percent (40%) of Oneida
Common Stock to be converted into cash. Notice of such allocation shall be
provided promptly to each holder of Non-election Shares whose shares of Oneida
Common Stock are allocated pursuant to this Section 2.2(a)(iv).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Treasury Shares and Shares Held by CBSI. There are no shares of Oneida
Common Stock or Preferred Stock held in treasury by Oneida. Each share of
Oneida Common Stock owned by any Subsidiary of Oneida, CBSI or any Subsidiary
of CBSI (in each case other than in a fiduciary capacity) immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be cancelled without any conversion thereof and no
payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

  

  

(c) Procedures for Election. CBSI shall prepare an election form and other
appropriate and customary transmittal materials in such form as is reasonably
acceptable to Oneida (the "Election Form") which shall be mailed to Oneida's
shareholders of record five (5) business days prior to the mailing date so as
to permit Oneida's shareholders to exercise their right to validly elect the
form of Merger Consideration (the "Election") set forth in Section 2.2(a)
prior to the Election Deadline, subject to the allocation and election
procedures set forth in this Section 2.2. CBSI shall mail the Election Form no
later than twenty (20) days prior to the Election Deadline, and shall use
reasonable efforts to make available as promptly as possible a duplicate
Election Form to any shareholder of Oneida who requests such Election Form
following the initial mailing of the Election Forms and prior to the Election
Deadline. As used herein, "Election Deadline" means 5:00 p.m. on the date
selected by CBSI as the last day on which Election Forms may be validly
returned by Oneida shareholders, which day shall be not less than twenty (20)
days after the initial mailing of the Election Forms and be no later than five
(5) days prior to the Closing Date.

  

  

(d) Perfection of the Election. Any Election shall have been made properly
only if the Exchange Agent shall have received by 5:00 p.m. local time in the
city in which the principal office of such Exchange Agent is located, on the
date of the Election Deadline, an Election Form properly completed and signed
and accompanied by certificates of the shares of Oneida Common Stock to which
such Election Form applies or by an appropriate customary guarantee of
delivery of such certificates, as set forth in such Election Form, from a
member of any registered national securities exchange or a commercial bank or
trust company in the United States; provided, that such certificates are in
fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time required in such guarantee of
delivery. Failure to deliver shares of Oneida Common Stock covered by such a
guarantee of delivery within the time set forth on such guarantee shall be
deemed to invalidate any otherwise properly made Election, unless otherwise
determined by CBSI, in its sole discretion. Oneida and CBSI shall cooperate to
issue a press release reasonably satisfactory to each of them announcing the
date of the Election Deadline not more than fifteen (15) business days before,
and at least five (5) business days prior to, the Election Deadline.

  

  

(e) Withdrawal of Shares. Any holder of Oneida Common Stock may at any time
prior to the Election Deadline revoke the holder's election and either (i)
submit a new Election Form in accordance with the procedures in Section
2.2(d), or (ii) withdraw the certificate(s) for Oneida Common Stock deposited
therewith by providing written notice that is received by the Exchange Agent
by 5:00 p.m., local time for the Exchange Agent, on the Election Deadline. In
the event of the termination of this Agreement, the Exchange Agent shall
return any certificates deposited by the holder of Oneida Common Stock to such
holder at the address and to the Person set forth in the Election Form.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) Reduction of Shares Deposited for Cash. If more than forty percent (40%)
of the total number of shares of Oneida Common Stock issued and outstanding at
the Election Deadline, have been deposited for exchange with cash pursuant to
the All Cash Election and/or the Mixed Election and not withdrawn pursuant to
Section 2.2(e), CBSI will cause to be eliminated by the Exchange Agent, from
the shares deposited pursuant to the All Cash Election (subject to the
limitations described in Section 2.2(f)(iv)), a sufficient number of such
shares so that the total number of shares remaining on deposit for exchange
into cash pursuant to the All Cash Election and the Mixed Election does not
exceed forty percent (40%) of the shares of Oneida Common Stock issued and
outstanding on the Election Deadline. The holders of Oneida Common Stock who
have made the Mixed Election shall not be required to have more than sixty
percent (60%) of their shares of Oneida Common Stock converted into CBSI
Common Stock. After giving effect to Section 2.2(a)(iv), such elimination will
be effected as follows:

  

  

(i) Subject to the limitations described in Section 2.2(f)(iv), CBSI will
eliminate or cause to be eliminated from the shares deposited pursuant to the
All Cash Election, and will add or cause to be added to the shares deposited
for CBSI Common Stock pursuant to the All Stock Election, on a pro rata basis
in relation to the total number of shares deposited pursuant to the All Cash
Election minus the number of shares so deposited by the holders described in
Section 2.2(f)(iv), such number of whole shares of Oneida Common Stock on
deposit for cash pursuant to the All Cash Election as may be necessary so that
the total number of shares remaining on deposit for cash pursuant to the All
Cash Election or the Mixed Election is equal, as nearly as practicable, to
forty percent (40%) of the shares of Oneida Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time;

  

  

(ii) All shares of Oneida Common Stock that are eliminated pursuant to Section
2.2(f)(i) from the shares deposited for cash pursuant to All Cash Election
shall be converted into CBSI Common Stock as provided by Section 2.2(a)(i);

  

  

(iii) Notice of such allocation shall be provided by CBSI or the Exchange
Agent promptly after the Election Deadline to each holder whose shares of
Oneida Common Stock are eliminated from the shares on deposit for exchange
with cash pursuant to Section 2.2(f)(i); and

  

  

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holders of one hundred (100) or fewer
shares of Oneida Common Stock of record on the date of this Agreement who have
elected the All Cash Election shall not be required to have any of their
shares of Oneida Common Stock converted into CBSI Common Stock.

  

  

(g) Increase of Shares Deposited for Cash. If fewer than forty percent (40%)
of the total number of shares of Oneida Common Stock issued and outstanding
have, at the Election Deadline, been deposited for cash pursuant to the All
Cash Election and/or the Mixed Election and not withdrawn pursuant to Section
2.2(e), CBSI will promptly add, or cause to be added by the Exchange Agent, to
such deposited shares, a sufficient number of shares of Oneida Common Stock
deposited for shares of CBSI Common Stock pursuant to the All Stock Election
so that the total number of shares of Oneida Common Stock on deposit for cash
pursuant to the All Cash Election and the Mixed Election immediately prior to
the Effective Time is not less than forty percent (40%) of the shares of
Oneida Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. The holders of Oneida Common Stock who have elected to have their shares
converted pursuant to the Mixed Election shall not be required to have more
than forty percent (40%) of their shares of Oneida Common Stock converted into
cash. After giving effect to Section 2.2(a)(iv), such addition will be
effected as follows:

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(i) CBSI will cause to be added to the shares deposited for cash pursuant to
the All Cash Election or the Mixed Election, and will eliminate or cause to be
eliminated from the shares deposited for CBSI Common Stock pursuant to the All
Stock Election, on a pro rata basis in relation to the total number of shares
of Oneida Common Stock deposited for shares of CBSI Common Stock pursuant to
the All Stock Election, such number of whole shares of Oneida Common Stock not
then on deposit for cash as may be necessary so that the number of shares
remaining on deposit for exchange with cash is equal, as nearly as
practicable, to forty percent (40%) of the shares of Oneida Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time;

  

  

(ii) All shares of Oneida Common Stock that are added pursuant to Section
2.2(g)(i) to the shares deposited for cash shall be converted into cash as
provided by Section 2.2(a)(ii); and

  

  

(iii) Notice of such allocation shall be provided by CBSI or the Exchange
Agent promptly after the Election Deadline to each holder whose shares of
Oneida Common Stock are added to the shares on deposit for cash pursuant to
Section 2.2(g)(i).

  

  

(h) CBSI Common Stock. Each share of CBSI Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall remain unchanged and shall constitute the
common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(i) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. If, subsequent to the date of this
Agreement but prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of CBSI
Common Stock or Oneida Common Stock shall be increased, decreased, changed
into or exchanged for a different number of shares, in each case by reason of
any stock split, recapitalization, or reclassification or other similar
change, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted proportionately.

  

  

(j) Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing less than one
share of CBSI Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Oneida Common Stock. In lieu of any such
fractional share, each holder of such shares who would otherwise have been
entitled to a fraction of a share of CBSI Common Stock, upon surrender of
certificates representing shares of Oneida Common Stock for exchange, shall be
paid upon such surrender cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such
fraction multiplied by $20.00.

  

  

(k) Oneida Options. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of any Person, each Oneida Option which is outstanding, unexpired
and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not
previously vested and exercisable, shall be cancelled and the holder thereof
shall receive, no later than the first payroll payment date after the
Effective Time, a cash payment equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(i) the aggregate number of shares of Oneida Common Stock that were issuable
upon the exercise of such Oneida Option and (ii) $20.00, less any exercise
price payable pursuant to such Oneida Option, without interest, less any
required withholdings (the "Option Consideration"). In the event any Oneida
Option is subject to Section 409A of the Code, the payment of the Option
Consideration shall be delayed to the extent necessary to comply with Section
409A of the Code.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(l) Oneida Stock Awards. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of any Person, each restricted stock award issued pursuant to
Oneida's 2012 Equity Incentive Plan ("Oneida Restricted Stock") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest in full and the
restrictions thereon shall lapse, and, as of the Effective Time, each such
share of Oneida Common Stock shall be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.2.

  

  

2.3. Effect of Merger.

  

  

Upon the Effective Time of the Merger:

  

  

(a) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of CBSI, each as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation, in each
case until amended in accordance with the DGCL.

  

  

(b) All respective assets, rights, franchises, and interest of Oneida and CBSI
in and to every type of property shall be vested in the Surviving Corporation
by virtue of the Merger without any deed or other transfer; and the Surviving
Corporation, without any order or other action on the part of any court or
otherwise, shall hold and enjoy all rights of property, franchises and
interest, in the same manner and to the same extent as such rights, franchises
and interests were held and enjoyed by Oneida and CBSI immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

  

  

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall be liable for all of the liabilities of
Oneida and CBSI and shall be bound by and subject to all of the obligations
and contracts of Oneida and CBSI, provided that nothing in this Agreement
shall render the Surviving Corporation liable for a liability or obligation of
Oneida, the satisfaction of which is subject to the prior approval or consent
of any regulatory authority, unless such regulatory approval or consent has
been obtained. All rights of creditors and obligees and all liens on property
of Oneida and CBSI shall be preserved and unimpaired.

  

  

(d) The directors and officers of CBSI immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving
Corporation, with the addition of the New Directors pursuant to Section
5.9(f).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

  

  

2.4. Procedure to Exchange Shares.

  

  

(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, CBSI shall cause to be deposited with
American Stock Transfer and Trust Company or another financial institution
experienced in serving as an exchange agent for a public company merger (the
"Exchange Agent"), for exchange in accordance with this Article II, the
aggregate number of shares of CBSI Common Stock, cash, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, into which the outstanding shares of Oneida
Common Stock shall be converted pursuant to Section 2.2 of this Agreement and
an estimated amount of cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
into which any fractional shares of Oneida Common Stock shall be converted
pursuant to Section 2.2(j). As soon as practical after the Effective Time, but
no later than five (5) business days after the Effective Time, CBSI shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Oneida Common
Stock who theretofore has not submitted such holder's shares of Oneida Common
Stock with an Election Form, a letter of transmittal in customary form
specifying the procedures for delivery of such holders' shares of Oneida
Common Stock to the Exchange Agent in exchange for the Merger Consideration
and cash in lieu of fractional shares issuable pursuant to this Article II.
Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its shares of Oneida Common Stock in
the manner set forth in the letter of transmittal, accompanied by a properly
completed letter of transmittal, a holder of Oneida Common Stock will be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration promptly after the Effective
Time, determined as provided in Section 2.2. Until so surrendered, each share
of Oneida Common Stock shall represent after the Effective Time, for all
purposes, only the right to receive, without interest, the applicable Merger
Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of CBSI Common Stock
to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such share of
Oneida Common Stock in accordance with this Article II.

  

  

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time with
respect to CBSI Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
share of Oneida Common Stock until such holder shall surrender such
certificate in accordance with this Agreement. After the surrender of a share
of Oneida Common Stock in accordance with this Agreement, the record holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other
distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore have become
payable with respect to shares of CBSI Common Stock.

  

  

(c) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Oneida shall be closed
and no transfer of Oneida Common Stock shall thereafter be made or recognized.
If, after the Effective Time, shares of Oneida Common Stock are presented for
transfer, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration
as provided in this Section 2.4.

  

  

(d) In the event any certificate evidencing shares of Oneida Common Stock
shall have been lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost,
stolen, destroyed or mutilated and, if required by CBSI, the making of an
indemnity agreement in a form reasonably requested by CBSI and/or the posting
by such Person of a bond in such amount as CBSI may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen,
destroyed or mutilated certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Neither CBSI nor Oneida shall be liable to any holder of shares of Oneida
Common Stock for any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. After
the first anniversary of the Effective Time, CBSI shall be entitled to
instruct the Exchange Agent to release to CBSI all of the shares of CBSI
Common Stock and cash then remaining undistributed to former shareholders of
Oneida. Thereafter, CBSI shall deliver the appropriate number of shares of
CBSI Common Stock and/or a check for cash in lieu of fractional shares, if
any, from time to time, as shares of Oneida Common Stock, the accompanying
letter of transmittal and other related documents are presented to the
Exchange Agent or CBSI, until at such time as such shares and cash are
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.

  

  

2.5. Tax Treatment. The parties hereto intend that the Merger qualify as a
tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code and that this
Agreement shall constitute a plan of reorganization as that term is used in
Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

  

  

2.6. Modification of Structure. Upon the mutual written consent of Oneida and
CBSI (which consent on the part of Oneida shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed), or at the request of any regulatory authority, CBSI shall have
the right to modify the structure of any of the Transactions, provided that
(a) there are no adverse tax consequences to the shareholders of Oneida as a
result of such modification, (b) the Merger Consideration is not changed in
kind, value or reduced in amount as a result of such modification, and (c)
consummation of the Transactions is not likely to be impaired or delayed as a
result of such modification.

  

  

2.7. Closing. The Closing of the Transactions shall be held at the offices of
Bond, Schoeneck and King, PLLC, One Lincoln Center, Syracuse, New York on the
fifth business day, or other mutually agreeable time, following satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions to consummation of the Merger set forth in Article
VI hereof (the "Closing Date"). Alternatively, the parties may agree that the
Closing shall occur without their or their counsel's physical presence in the
same location, through the transmission and execution of documents and
instruments using electronic media, including, but not limited to, email and
facsimile. Digital signatures produced by such means shall have the same force
and effect as handwritten signatures. If the parties elect to use this method
for the Closing, following the Closing, they shall promptly execute
handwritten documents and instruments and exchange the signature pages thereof
so that each party shall have a complete set of manually signed documents
memorializing the Closing.

  

  

   

  

 

ARTICLE III

 

  

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ONEIDA

  

  

Except as Previously Disclosed, Oneida hereby represents and warrants to CBSI
as follows:

  

  

3.1. Capital Structure of Oneida. The authorized capital stock of Oneida
consists of (i) 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, none of which are issued
and outstanding and (ii) 30,000,000 shares of Oneida Common Stock, of which
7,025,444 shares are issued and outstanding, which amount includes 153,000
shares granted pursuant to Oneida Restricted Stock awards. No shares of Oneida
Common Stock are held in treasury. Except for (i) 172,348 shares of Oneida
Common Stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding Oneida
Options, (ii) 153,000 shares of Oneida Common Stock subject to outstanding
Oneida Restricted Stock awards, there are no outstanding options, warrants,
agreements, arrangements, commitments or any similar Rights in existence for
the purchase of or issuance of, or which encumber in any way, Oneida Common
Stock or any equity interest in any Subsidiary of Oneida. All outstanding
shares of Oneida Common Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and
are fully paid and nonassessable. None of the shares of Oneida capital stock
has been issued in violation of the preemptive rights of any Person.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

  

  

3.2. Organization, Standing and Authority of Oneida. Each of Oneida and its
Subsidiaries is a duly organized corporation, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its incorporation with full corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate the properties it purports to own, lease
or operate and to carry on its business as now conducted. Each of Oneida and
its Subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do business in the states of
the United States and foreign jurisdictions where its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on Oneida. Oneida is registered as a savings and loan holding
company under the HOLA.

  

  

3.3. Ownership of Oneida Subsidiaries; Capital Structure of Oneida
Subsidiaries. A true and complete list of all Subsidiaries of Oneida, and each
of their respective Subsidiaries, together with the jurisdiction of
incorporation of each Subsidiary and the percentage of each Subsidiary's
outstanding capital stock owned by Oneida or another Subsidiary of Oneida, has
been Previously Disclosed and Oneida does not, directly or indirectly, own any
equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity or similar interest in, any other
Person.

  

  

3.4. Authorized and Effective Agreement.

  

  

(a) Oneida has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into and
perform all of its obligations under this Agreement and each of the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions and thereby have been
duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action in respect
thereof on the part of Oneida, except for the affirmative vote of a majority
of the issued and outstanding shares of Oneida Common Stock, which is the only
shareholder vote required to approve the Merger pursuant to Oneida's articles
of incorporation and bylaws. The Board of Directors of Oneida has approved and
adopted this Agreement and the Merger, and directed that this Agreement be
submitted to Oneida's shareholders for approval at a meeting of shareholders
to be held as soon as practicable. The Board of Directors of Oneida has
unanimously recommended that the shareholders of Oneida approve this Agreement
and the Merger. In connection with its approval of this Agreement and the
Merger, the Board of Directors of Oneida has received a written fairness
opinion dated on or about the date hereof from Keefe Bruyette and Woods, Inc.,
to the effect that, subject to the terms, limitations, and conditions set
forth therein, the Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of
view, to the common shareholders of Oneida, which opinion has not been
rescinded prior to the execution of this Agreement.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) This Agreement and each Transaction Document to which Oneida is a party
have been duly executed and delivered by Oneida and, assuming the accuracy of
the representation contained in Section 4.3(b) hereof, this Agreement
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Oneida, enforceable
against Oneida in accordance with its terms, except that such enforceability
may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency and other laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity
principles.

  

  

(c) Except as Previously Disclosed, neither the execution and delivery by
Oneida of this Agreement, nor consummation of the Transactions, nor compliance
by Oneida with any of the provisions hereof or thereof shall (i) conflict with
or result in a breach of any provision of the articles of incorporation or
bylaws of Oneida or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) assuming the consents and
approvals contemplated by Section 5.3 hereof and the consents and approvals
which are Previously Disclosed are duly obtained, constitute or result in a
breach of any term, condition or provision of, or constitute a default under,
or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration with
respect to, or result in the creation of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon
any property or asset of Oneida or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, license, agreement or other instrument or
obligation to which Oneida or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or (iii)
assuming the consents and approvals contemplated by Section 5.3 hereof and the
consents and approvals which are Previously Disclosed are duly obtained,
conflict with or violate any law, order, writ, injunction, decree, statute,
rule or regulation applicable to Oneida or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective assets; except, in case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, for any
such breach, default, right, lien, charge, encumbrances, violation or conflict
which, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on Oneida.

  

  

(d) Except as Previously Disclosed, other than as contemplated by Section 5.3
hereof, no consent, approval or authorization of, or declaration, notice,
filing or registration with, any governmental or regulatory authority, or any
other Person, is required to be made or obtained by Oneida on or prior to the
Closing Date in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party or
the consummation of the Transactions.

  

  

3.5. Regulatory Filings. Each of Oneida and its Subsidiaries has filed all
reports required by statute or regulation to be filed with any federal or
state bank regulatory agency, except where the failure to so file would not
have a Material Adverse Effect on Oneida, and such reports were prepared in
accordance with the applicable statutes, regulations and instructions in
existence as of the date of filing of such reports in all material respects.

  

  

3.6. SEC Documents; Financial Statements; Books and Records; Minute Books.
Oneida has filed or furnished all forms, reports and documents required to be
filed with or furnished to the SEC since January 1, 2012. The SEC Documents
filed or furnished by Oneida (i) were prepared in all material respects in
accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as
the case may be, and (ii) did not at the time they were filed (or if amended
or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the
date of such filing) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. The Oneida Financial Statements filed by
Oneida in its SEC Documents prior to the date of this Agreement, and the
Oneida Financial Statements filed by Oneida in its SEC Documents after the
date of this Agreement will fairly present, the consolidated financial
position of Oneida as of the dates indicated and the consolidated income,
changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows of Oneida and its consolidated
Subsidiaries for the periods then ended and each such financial statement has
been or will be, as the case may be, prepared in conformity with GAAP applied
to financial institutions applied on a consistent basis, except that the
unaudited interim financial statements were or are subject to normal and
recurring year-end adjustments which were not or are not expected to be
material in amount, and may not contain certain notes as may be permitted by
the applicable rules promulgated by the SEC. The books and records of Oneida
and each of its Subsidiaries fairly reflect in all material respects the
transactions to which it is a party or by which its properties are subject or
bound. Such books and records have been properly kept and maintained and are
in compliance with all applicable legal and accounting requirements in all
material respects. The minute books of Oneida and each of its Subsidiaries
contain records which are accurate in all material respects of all corporate
actions of its shareholders and Board of Directors (including committees of
its Board of Directors).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

20  

  

 

 

 

  

  

3.7. Material Adverse Change. Oneida has not, on a consolidated basis,
suffered any change in its financial condition, results of operations or
business since December 31, 2013, which, individually or in the aggregate with
any other such changes, would constitute a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to Oneida.

  

  

3.8. Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. Neither Oneida nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liability (contingent or otherwise) that is material to
Oneida on a consolidated basis, or that, when combined with all similar
liabilities, would be material to Oneida on a consolidated basis, except as
disclosed in the Oneida Financial Statements contained in an SEC Document
filed prior to the date hereof and except for liabilities incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since September 30,
2014.

  

  

3.9. Absence of Certain Changes. Since September 30, 2014, and except as
Previously Disclosed, Oneida has not:

  

  

(a) suffered any material damage, destruction or loss of physical property or
assets (whether or not covered by insurance);

  

  

(b) issued, sold or otherwise disposed of any of its capital stock or granted
or issued any Rights to acquire shares of its capital stock, except shares of
Oneida Common Stock issued under the DRIP Plan (which shares are included in
the number of shares issued and outstanding set forth in Section 3.1);

  

  

(c) incurred or agreed to incur any material indebtedness for borrowed money,
other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice;

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

21  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) made or obligated itself to make any capital expenditure in excess of
$75,000, individually or in the aggregate;

  

  

(e) waived any material right, except in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice;

  

  

(f) sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of any assets, or canceled, or
agreed to cancel, any material debts or claims, in each case, other than in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice;

  

  

(g) mortgaged, pledged or subjected to any charge, lien, claim or encumbrance
any of its material properties or assets, other than in the ordinary course of
business;

  

  

(h) declared, set aside or paid any dividend (whether in cash, property or
stock) with respect to any of its capital stock, or redeemed, purchased or
otherwise acquired any of its capital stock, except shares of Oneida Common
Stock purchased for issuance under the DRIP Plan (which shares are included in
the number of shares issued and outstanding set forth in Section 3.1);

  

  

(i) increased the salaries, bonuses or other compensation of any of its
directors, officers, employees or agents, or adopted or increased any benefits
under any insurance, pension or other employee benefit plan, payment or
arrangement made to, for or with any such director, officer, employee or
agent, except for changes in salaries of employees earning less than $60,000
per year made in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice;

  

  

(j) made or permitted any amendment or termination of any material contract,
agreement or license to which it is a party, other than in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice;

  

  

(k) made any material change in its accounting methods or practices with
respect to its financial condition, properties, business or operations;

  

  

(l) repaid any outstanding loans, other than repayments in the ordinary course
of business;

  

  

(m) entered into any other material transaction not in the ordinary course of
business;

  

  

(n) hired any new officers;

  

  

(o) entered into any real estate or equipment lease, requiring aggregate
rental payments in excess of $25,000; or

  

  

(p) agreed to or otherwise become obligated to do any of the foregoing.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

22  

  

 

 

 

  

  

3.10. Properties. Oneida and its Subsidiaries have good and marketable title
free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, charges, defaults or equitable
interests to all of the properties and assets, real and personal, which are
material to the business of Oneida on a consolidated basis, and which are
reflected on the Oneida Financial Statements as of September 30, 2014 or
acquired after such date, except (i) liens for taxes not yet due and payable,
(ii) pledges to secure deposits and other liens incurred in the ordinary
course of banking business as reflected in the books and records of Oneida,
(iii) such imperfections of title, easements and encumbrances, if any, as are
not material in character, amount or extent and (iv) dispositions and
encumbrances for adequate consideration in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice. All written or oral lease agreements (and all
amendments thereto) pursuant to which Oneida or any of its Subsidiaries, as
lessee, leases real and personal property which, individually or in the
aggregate, are material to the business of Oneida on a consolidated basis are
valid and enforceable against Oneida and the lessor in accordance with their
respective terms. All tangible property used in the business of Oneida is in
good condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted, and is usable in the
ordinary course of business consistent with Oneida's past practices.

  

  

3.11. Loans; Nonperforming and Classified Assets.

  

  

(a) Each loan, line of credit, extension of credit, credit enhancement,
guarantee, loan participation, lease, promissory note, borrowing arrangement
and loan commitment ("Loan") on the books and records of Oneida and its
Subsidiaries (i) arose out of a bona fide arm's-length transaction made in the
ordinary course of business, (ii) was made and has been serviced in all
material respects in accordance with their customary lending standards in the
ordinary course of business, (iii) is evidenced in all material respects by
appropriate and sufficient documentation and, (iv) to the Knowledge of Oneida,
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the obligor therein,
except as may be provided by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditor's rights or by general equity principles and
(v) Oneida has not received written notice from the obligor asserting any
defense, set-off or counterclaim with respect thereto.

  

  

(b) Oneida has Previously Disclosed to CBSI in writing as of the date of this
Agreement: (i) a listing of the Other Real Estate Owned ("OREO") acquired by
foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu thereof, including the book value thereof and
(ii) each Loan with a Related Party or an Oneida Subsidiary, or to the
Knowledge of Oneida, any Person controlling, controlled by or under common
control with any of the foregoing. All OREO is carried on the books of Oneida,
net of reserves, at fair market value less cost to sell.

  

  

(c) All reserves or other allowances for Loan losses reflected in the Oneida
Financial Statements comply with all applicable laws and are adequate under
GAAP. Neither Oneida nor any of its Subsidiaries has been notified by any
state or federal bank regulatory agency that its reserves are inadequate or
that the practices and policies of Oneida and its Subsidiaries in establishing
its reserves reflected in the Oneida Financial Statements, and in accounting
for delinquent and classified assets generally fail to comply with applicable
accounting or regulatory requirements, or that bank regulators or Oneida's
independent auditor believes such reserves to be inadequate or inconsistent
with the historical loss experience of Oneida and its Subsidiaries. Oneida's
reserves and allowances for Loan losses are in compliance with the standards
established by state and federal bank regulatory agencies, are sufficient at
the date of this Agreement to cover its reasonably anticipated Loan losses,
and are consistent with Oneida's past practices.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

23  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) All Loans owned by Oneida or any Oneida Subsidiary, or in which Oneida or
any Oneida Subsidiary has an interest, comply in all material respects with
all applicable laws, including, but not limited to, applicable usury statutes,
underwriting and recordkeeping requirements and the Truth in Lending Act, the
Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act.

  

  

(e) Each mortgage held by Oneida and each Oneida Subsidiary creates a valid
and enforceable lien on the real property described therein having the
priority indicated by the terms of such mortgage, subject only to such
exceptions as are described in attorneys' opinions regarding title or in title
insurance policies in the mortgage files relating to the Loans secured thereby
or are not material as to the collectability of such Loans. Oneida and each
Oneida Subsidiary have properly perfected or caused to be properly perfected
all security interests, liens and other interests in collateral securing any
Loans made by it. Oneida and each Oneida Subsidiary has full recourse to the
borrowers and guarantors of all Loans held by them, and neither Oneida nor any
Oneida Subsidiary has taken action which would result in a waiver or negation
of any rights or remedies available against the borrower or guarantor on any
Loan.

  

  

(f) Each outstanding Loan participation sold by Oneida or any Oneida
Subsidiary was sold with the risk of non-payment of all or any portion of that
underlying loan to be shared by each participant proportionately to the share
of such Loan represented by such participation without any recourse of such
other lender or participant to Oneida or any Oneida Subsidiary for payment or
repurchase of the amount of such Loan represented by the participation or
liability under any yield maintenance or similar obligation.

  

  

(g) Oneida has Previously Disclosed to CBSI in writing: (i) all Loans held by
Oneida or any Oneida Subsidiary that, during the past twelve months, have had
their respective terms to maturity accelerated or with respect to which Oneida
or an Oneida Subsidiary has notified the borrower of its intention to
accelerate the Loan or declare a default, (ii) all Loan commitments or lines
of credit that have been terminated or amended by Oneida or an Oneida
Subsidiary during the past 12 months by reason of a default or adverse
developments in the condition of the borrower or other events or circumstances
affecting the credit of the borrower, (iii) each borrower, customer or other
party which has notified Oneida or an Oneida Subsidiary during the past 12

(a) Oneida and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed federal and state
income Tax Returns for each year through December 31, 2013 and have timely
filed, or caused to be filed, all other Tax Returns required to be filed with
respect to Oneida or any of its Subsidiaries. All Taxes due by or on behalf of
Oneida or any of its Subsidiaries have been paid or adequate reserves have
been established on the Oneida Financial Statements for the payment of such
Taxes. Neither Oneida nor any of its Subsidiaries will have any liability for
any such Taxes in excess of the amounts so paid or reserves or accruals so
established, except where such liability would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Oneida.

  

  

(b) All Tax Returns filed by Oneida and each of its Subsidiaries are complete
and accurate in all material respects. Neither Oneida nor any of its
Subsidiaries is delinquent in the payment of any material Tax, and none of
them has requested any extension of time within which to file any Tax Returns
which have not since been filed. No material audit examination, deficiency,
adjustment, refund claim or litigation with respect to Tax Returns, paid
Taxes, unpaid Taxes or Tax attributes of Oneida has been proposed, asserted or
assessed (tentatively or otherwise). There are currently no agreements in
effect with respect to Oneida or any of its Subsidiaries to extend the period
of limitations for the assessment or collection of any Tax.

  

  

(c) Neither the Transactions nor the termination of the employment of any
employees of Oneida prior to or following consummation of the Transactions
will result in Oneida or any of its Subsidiaries (or any successor thereof)
making or being required to make any "excess parachute payment" as that term
is defined in Section 280G of the Code.

  

  

(d) Except as Previously Disclosed, neither Oneida nor any of its Subsidiaries
is a party to any agreement providing for the allocation or sharing of, or
indemnification for, Taxes.

  

  

(e) Neither Oneida nor any of its Subsidiaries is required to include in
income any adjustment in any taxable period ending after the date hereof
pursuant to Section 481(a) of the Code.

  

  

(f) Neither Oneida nor any of its Subsidiaries has executed or entered into
any written agreement with any Tax authority conceding or agreeing to any
treatment of Taxes or Tax attributes, including, without limitation, an IRS
Form 870 or Form 870-AD, closing agreement or special closing agreement,
affecting Oneida or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to Section 7121 of the
Code or any predecessor provision thereof or any similar provision of state,
local or foreign law, which agreement would have a material impact on the
calculation of the Taxes of CBSI or any of its Subsidiaries after the
Effective Time.

profit-sharing, or pension plan, program, agreement or arrangement, and each
other employee benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, sponsored,
maintained or contributed to or required to be contributed to by Oneida or any
Subsidiary or by any trade or business, whether or not incorporated, that
together with Oneida would be deemed a "single employer" under Section 414 of
the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate") for the benefit of any employee or director or
former employee or former director of Oneida or any ERISA Affiliate of Oneida.

  

  

(b) With respect to each of the Oneida Plans, Oneida has made available to
CBSI true and complete copies of each of the following documents: (i) the
Oneida Plan and related documents (including all amendments thereto); (ii) the
most recent annual reports, financial statements, and actuarial reports, if

and (iv) the most recent determination letter received from the IRS with
respect to each Oneida Plan that is intended to be qualified under the Code
and all material communications to or from the IRS or any other governmental
or regulatory agency or authority relating to each Oneida Plan.

  

  

(c) No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by Oneida or any
ERISA Affiliate of Oneida that has not been satisfied in full, and no
condition exists that presents a material risk to Oneida or any ERISA
Affiliate of Oneida of incurring a liability under such Title, other than
liability for premium payments to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation,
which premiums have been or will be paid when due.

  

  

(d) Neither Oneida nor, to the Knowledge of Oneida, any ERISA Affiliate of
Oneida, nor any of the Oneida Plans, nor any trust created thereunder, nor, to
the Knowledge of Oneida, any trustee or administrator thereof has engaged in a
prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA and Section
4975 of the Code) in connection with which Oneida or any ERISA Affiliate of
Oneida could reasonably be expected to, either directly or indirectly, incur
any material liability or material cost.

(f) The fair market value of the assets held under each Oneida Plan that is
subject to Title IV of ERISA equals or exceeds the actuarial present value of
all accrued benefits under each such Oneida Plan. No reportable event under

any reportable event occurring by reason of the Transactions or a reportable
event for which the requirement of notice to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation has been waived.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

26  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(g) None of the Oneida Plans is a "multiemployer pension plan," as such term
is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, a "multiple employer welfare
arrangement," as such term is defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA, or a single
employer plan that has two or more contributing sponsors, at least two of whom
are not under common control, within the meaning of Section 4063(a) of ERISA.

  

  

(h) A favorable determination letter has been issued by the IRS with respect
to each of the Oneida Plans that is intended to be "qualified" within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code to the effect that such plan is so
qualified and, to the Knowledge of Oneida, no condition exists that could
adversely affect the qualified status of any such Oneida Plan. Each of the
Oneida Plans that is intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 125 or
501(c)(9) of the Code satisfies such requirements in all material respects.
Each of the Oneida Plans has been operated and administered in all material
respects in accordance with its terms and applicable laws, including but not
limited to ERISA and the Code.

There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Oneida, threatened audits,
examinations or investigations by any governmental body, commission or agency
involving any Oneida Plan.

  

  

(j) Except as Previously Disclosed, the consummation of the Transactions will
not result in, and is not a precondition to, (i) any current or former
employee or director of Oneida or any ERISA Affiliate of Oneida becoming
entitled to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any similar payment,
(ii) any acceleration in the time of payment or vesting, or increase in the
amount, of any compensation due to any such current or former employee or

service of any such director or officer following consummation of the
Transactions, or (vii) any contract, agreement or understanding with a labor
union, in each case whether written or oral.

policy or other instrument whether entered into in the ordinary course of
business or otherwise and whether written or oral, and there has not occurred
any event that, with the lapse of time or giving of notice or both, would
constitute such a default, except for such defaults which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Oneida.

  

  

3.15. Legal Proceedings. Except as Previously Disclosed, there are no actions,
suits or proceedings instituted, pending or, to the Knowledge of Oneida or any
of its Subsidiaries, threatened against Oneida or any of its Subsidiaries or
against any asset, interest or right of Oneida or any of its Subsidiaries
that, if decided against Oneida or any of its Subsidiaries, would,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Oneida.
There are no actual or, to the Knowledge of Oneida, threatened actions, suits
or proceedings which present a claim to restrain or prohibit the Transactions

agreement with organized labor that would cover the employees of Oneida or any
of its Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of Oneida, there is no unfair labor
practice charge or other complaint by any employee or former employee of

between Oneida or any of its Subsidiaries and Keefe Bruyette and Woods, Inc.,
pursuant to which such firm would be entitled to any payment relating to the
Transactions.

notice of a material premium increase over current rates or cancellation with
respect to any of their insurance policies or bonds, and within the last two
calendar years, neither Oneida nor any of its Subsidiaries has been refused
any insurance coverage sought or applied for, and neither Oneida nor any of

Subsidiaries under any insurance policy. The deposits of the Oneida Banks are

nor has there ever been any presence, disposal, release or threatened release
of Hazardous Materials on, from or under any of such properties or facilities,
which may have occurred prior to Oneida having taken possession of any of such
properties or facilities. For the purposes of this Agreement, the terms
"disposal," "release," and "threatened release" shall have the definitions
assigned thereto by the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and

Oneida or any of its Subsidiaries owns or leases, are in compliance with

Subsidiaries nor, to the best Knowledge of Oneida, any third party has used,
generated, manufactured or stored on, under or about such properties or
facilities or transported or arranged for disposal to or from such properties
or facilities, any Hazardous Materials in violation of applicable
Environmental Law.

Person alleging the presence, disposal, release or threatened release of any
Hazardous Materials, on from or under any of such properties or facilities.

  

  

(d) There are no facts, circumstances or conditions relating to the properties
and facilities owned or leased by Oneida or any of its Subsidiaries known to
Oneida which are reasonably likely to give rise to a claim under any
Environmental Law or to any material Environmental Costs and Liabilities.

have properly administered all common trust funds and collective investment
funds and all accounts for which each of them acts as a fiduciary or agent,
including but not limited to accounts for which it serves as a trustee, agent,
custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or investment
advisor, in accordance with the terms of the governing documents and
applicable state and federal law and regulation and common law, except where
the failure to do so would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on Oneida. Neither Oneida nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor any of their respective directors, officers or employees acting on behalf
of Oneida or any of its Subsidiaries, has committed any breach of trust with
respect to any such common trust fund or collective investment fund or
fiduciary or agency account, and the accountings for each such common trust
fund or collective investment fund or fiduciary or agency account are true and
correct in all material respects and accurately reflect the assets of such
common trust fund or collective investment fund or fiduciary or agency
account, except for such breaches and failures to be true, correct and
accurate which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on Oneida.

  

  

3.22. Intellectual Property. Each of Oneida and its Subsidiaries owns the
entire right, title and interest in and to, or has valid licenses with respect
to, all of the Intellectual Property necessary in all material respects to
conduct their respective businesses and operations as presently conducted,
except where the failure to do so would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect on Oneida. The ownership, licensing or use of
Intellectual Property by Oneida or any of its Subsidiaries does not conflict
with, infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the Intellectual Property
rights of any other Person. None of such Intellectual Property is subject to
any outstanding order, decree, judgment, stipulation, settlement, lien,
charge, encumbrance or attachment, which order, decree, judgment, stipulation,
settlement, lien, charge, encumbrance or attachment would, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Oneida. Upon consummation of
the Transactions, CBSI will be entitled to continue to use all such
Intellectual Property without the payment of any fees, licenses or other
payments.

to all information set forth or incorporated by reference therein furnished by
Oneida relating to Oneida or any of its Subsidiaries, (i) shall comply in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Laws, and

more of such Subsidiaries or their customers, were entered into (i) in
accordance with prudent business practices and all applicable laws, rules,
regulations and regulatory policies and (ii) with parties reasonably believed
to be financially responsible; and each of them constitutes the valid and
legally binding obligation of Oneida or such Subsidiary, enforceable in
accordance with its terms (except that enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
transfer and similar laws of general equity principles), and neither Oneida
nor any of its Subsidiaries nor to Oneida's Knowledge, any other party
thereto, is in breach of any of its obligations under any such agreement or
arrangement. Oneida has previously made available to CBSI all of such
agreements and arrangements that are in effect as of the date of this
Agreement.

pertaining to Loans, services (other than as an employee), products, goods or
supplies, rental of real or personal property, or otherwise requiring
payments, provided from or to Oneida in an amount in excess of $50,000 in the
aggregate (collectively, the "Related Party Transactions"). Each Related Party

conditions that are applicable for comparable transactions to Oneida's
unaffiliated customers and, if a Loan, was approved pursuant to normal
underwriting standards.

delivery of this Agreement or any Transaction Document to which Oneida is a

the State of New York and such other applicable states as required to engage

insurance products sold by OneGroup and to otherwise conduct business as
presently conducted by OneGroup. All such licenses are in full force and
effect and in good standing and there are no pending or threatened suits or
proceedings with respect to the suspension, revocation, cancellation,
restriction or non-renewal of any such license. A true and complete list of
all licenses issued or granted to OneGroup and each Person engaged in selling
insurance for OneGroup has been Previously Disclosed to CBSI in writing.
Neither OneGroup nor any of its employees or agents has transacted any
insurance business in any jurisdiction requiring a license therefor without
possessing such a license.

  

  

(b) No insurance company or broker for which OneGroup acted during the five
years preceding the date of this Agreement has cancelled or terminated any

accounts for premiums applicable to policies of insurance effective on or
after the Effective Time except in accordance with OneGroup's historically
normal and customary course of business, and (v) not received any advance
commission payments from any insurance company on account of direct-billed
insurance policies or endorsements that are to be effective or renewed on or
after the Effective Time. All premiums collected by OneGroup which are
properly due and payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement to
insurance companies or other insurance agents or brokers applicable to premium
billings for insurance business written for OneGroup customer accounts to be
effective prior to the Effective Time, the due date of which premium billing
is prior to the Effective Time, has been paid or will be paid by OneGroup
prior to any default thereon. As of the date of this Agreement, and to the
Knowledge of Oneida, OneGroup has not received notice from any of its top
twenty (20) insurance customers (measured by aggregate insurance premiums
received during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2014) that such

a broker-dealer or investment adviser or (ii) registered representative or
investment adviser representative with the SEC or any securities or insurance

in all material respects with all laws and regulations applicable to it or its

for the operation of its business as presently conducted. There is no action,

(b) The information contained in the currently effective Forms ADV and BD as
filed with the SEC by Oneida or any Subsidiary was complete and accurate in
all material respects as of the time of filing thereof. Except as disclosed on
Forms ADV or BD filed prior to the date of this Agreement, neither Oneida, any
Subsidiary nor any of their directors, officers, employees, "associated
persons" or "affiliated persons" (as those terms are defined in the Securities
Laws) has been the subject of disqualification, censure, or other disciplinary
action, proceeding or order of or by any governmental agency.

  

  

(c) Each contract or agreement between Oneida or any applicable Subsidiary and
any client or customer receiving investment management or investment advisory
or administration services (i) has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations,
(ii) is a valid and binding agreement enforceable in accordance with its terms

as follows:

  

  

4.1. Capital Structure of CBSI. The authorized capital stock of CBSI consists
of (i) 500,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share, none of
which were issued and outstanding and (ii) 75,000,000 shares of CBSI Common

of this Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free
and clear of any preemptive rights.

  

  

4.2. Organization, Standing and Authority of CBSI. Each of CBSI and its
Subsidiaries is a duly organized corporation or bank, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of its incorporation with full corporate power
and authority to own, lease and operate the properties it purports to own,
lease or operate and to carry on its business as now conducted, except where
the failure to be in good standing or to have such power or authority would
not have a Material Adverse Effect on CBSI. Each of CBSI and its Subsidiaries
is duly licensed or qualified to do business in the states of the United
States and foreign jurisdictions where its ownership or leasing of property or
the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the
failure to be so licensed or qualified would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on CBSI. CBSI is registered as a bank holding company under the Bank
Holding Company Act.

  

  

4.3. Authorized and Effective Agreement.

  

  

(a) CBSI has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into and
perform all of its obligations under this Agreement and each of the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement and each such Transaction Document and the consummation of the
Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate
action in respect thereof on the part of CBSI. The Board of Directors of CBSI
has approved and adopted this Agreement and the Merger.

  

  

(b) This Agreement and each Transaction Document to which CBSI is a party have
been duly executed and delivered by CBSI and, assuming the accuracy of the
representation contained in Section 3.4(b) hereof, this Agreement constitutes
the legal, valid and binding obligations of CBSI, enforceable against CBSI in
accordance with its terms, except that such enforceability may be subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency and other laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.

  

  

(c) Neither the execution and delivery by CBSI of this Agreement or any
Transaction Document to which it is a party, nor consummation of the
Transactions, nor compliance by CBSI with any of the provisions hereof or
thereof shall (i) conflict with or result in a breach of any provision of the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of CBSI, (ii) assuming the consents and
approvals contemplated by Section 5.3 hereof and the consents and approvals
which are Previously Disclosed are duly obtained, constitute or result in a
breach of any term, condition or provision of, or constitute a default under,
or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration with
respect to, or result in the creation of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon
any property or asset of CBSI or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, license, agreement or other instrument or
obligation to which CBSI or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or (iii)
assuming the consents and approvals contemplated by Section 5.3 hereof and the
consents and approvals which are Previously Disclosed are duly obtained,
conflict with or violate any law, order, writ, injunction, decree, statute,
rule or regulation applicable to CBSI or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective assets; except, in case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, for any
such breach, default, right, lien, charge, encumbrances, violation or conflict
which, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on CBSI.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

36  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Other than as contemplated by Section 5.3 hereof, no consent, approval or
authorization of, or declaration, notice, filing or registration with, any
governmental or regulatory authority, or any other Person, is required to be
made or obtained by CBSI on or prior to the Closing Date in connection with
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or any of the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party or the consummation of the
Transactions.

  

  

4.4. Regulatory Filings. Each of CBSI and its Subsidiaries has filed all
reports required by statute or regulation to be filed with any federal or
state bank regulatory agency, except where the failure to so file would not
have a Material Adverse Effect on CBSI, and such reports were prepared in
accordance with the applicable statutes, regulations and instructions in
existence as of the date of filing of such reports in all material respects.

  

  

4.5. SEC Documents; Financial Statements; Books and Records; Minute Books.
CBSI has filed all forms, reports and documents required to be filed with the
SEC since January 1, 2012. The SEC Documents (i) were prepared in all material
respects in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (ii) did not at the time they were filed
(or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement,
then on the date of such filing) contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The CBSI Financial
Statements filed by CBSI in its SEC Documents prior to the date of this
Agreement fairly present, and the CBSI Financial Statements filed by CBSI in
its SEC Documents after the date of this Agreement will fairly present, the
consolidated financial position of CBSI as of the dates indicated and the
consolidated income, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows of CBSI
and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods then ended and each such
financial statement has been or will be, as the case may be, prepared in
conformity with GAAP applied to financial institutions applied on a consistent
basis, except that the unaudited interim financial statements were or are
subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments which were not or are not
expected to be material in amount, and may not contain certain related notes
as may be permitted by the applicable rules promulgated by the SEC. The books
and records of CBSI and each of its Subsidiaries fairly reflect in all
material respects the transactions to which it is a party or by which its
properties are subject or bound. Such books and records have been properly
kept and maintained and are in compliance with all applicable legal and
accounting requirements in all material respects.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

  

  

4.6. Material Adverse Change. CBSI has not, on a consolidated basis, suffered
any change in its financial condition, results of operations or business since
December 31, 2013, which, individually or in the aggregate with any other such
changes, would constitute a Material Adverse Effect with respect to CBSI.

  

  

4.7. Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. Neither CBSI nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liability (contingent or otherwise) that is material to
CBSI on a consolidated basis, or that, when combined with all similar
liabilities, would be material to CBSI on a consolidated basis, except as
disclosed in the CBSI Financial Statements contained in an SEC Document filed
prior to the date hereof and except for liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since September 30, 2014.

  

  

4.8. Properties. CBSI and its Subsidiaries have good and marketable title free
and clear of all liens, encumbrances, charges, defaults or equitable interests
to all of the properties and assets, real and personal, which are material to
the business of CBSI on a consolidated basis, and which are reflected on the
CBSI Financial Statements as of September 30, 2014 or acquired after such
date, except (i) liens for taxes not yet due and payable, (ii) pledges to
secure deposits and other liens incurred in the ordinary course of banking
business as reflected in the books and records of CBSI, (iii) such
imperfections of title, easements and encumbrances, if any, as are not
material in character, amount or extent and (iv) dispositions and encumbrances
for adequate consideration in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice. All written or oral lease agreements (and all amendments
thereto) pursuant to which CBSI or any of its Subsidiaries, as lessee, leases
real and personal property which, individually or in the aggregate, are
material to the business of CBSI on a consolidated basis are valid and
enforceable against CBSI and the lessor in accordance with their respective
terms. All tangible property used in the business of CBSI is in good
condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted, and is usable in the ordinary
course of business consistent with CBSI's past practices.

  

  

4.9. Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) CBSI and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed federal income tax
returns for each year through December 31, 2013 and have timely filed, or
caused to be filed, all other Tax Returns required to be filed with respect to
CBSI or any of its Subsidiaries, except where the failure to file timely such
federal income and other Tax Returns would not, in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on CBSI. All Taxes due by or on behalf of CBSI or any
of its Subsidiaries have been paid or adequate reserves have been established
on the CBSI Financial Statements for the payment of such Taxes, except where
any such failure to pay or establish adequate reserves would not, in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on CBSI. Neither CBSI nor any of its
Subsidiaries will have any material liability for any such Taxes in excess of
the amounts so paid or reserves or accruals so established except where such
liability would not have a Material Adverse Effect on CBSI.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) All Tax Returns filed by CBSI and each of its Subsidiaries are complete
and accurate in all material respects. Neither CBSI nor any of its
Subsidiaries is delinquent in the payment of any material Tax and none of them
has requested any extension of time within which to file any Tax Returns which
have not since been filed. Except as fully settled and paid or accrued on the
CBSI Financial Statements, no material audit examination, deficiency,
adjustment, refund claim or litigation with respect to Tax Returns, paid
Taxes, unpaid Taxes or Tax attributes of CBSI or any of its Subsidiaries has
been proposed, asserted or assessed (tentatively or otherwise).

  

  

(c) Neither CBSI nor any of its Subsidiaries is required to include in income
any adjustment in any taxable period ending after the date hereof pursuant to
Section 481(a) of the Code other than any adjustment for which it already has
made an accrual.

  

  

4.10. Employee Benefit Plans. Each of the CBSI Plans complies with the
requirements of applicable law, including ERISA and the Code, except where the
failure to so comply would not, in individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on CBSI. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"CBSI Plan" means each bonus, incentive compensation, severance pay, medical
or other insurance program, retirement plan, or other employee benefit plan
program, agreement or arrangement sponsored, maintained or contributed to by
CBSI or any ERISA Affiliate or under which CBSI or any ERISA Affiliate has any
liability or obligation. No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been
incurred by CBSI or any ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full,
and no condition exists that presents a material risk to CBSI or any ERISA
Affiliate of incurring any such liability. Full payment has been made, or will
be made in accordance with Section 404(a)(6) of the Code of all amounts that
CBSI or any ERISA Affiliate is required to pay under Section 412 of the Code
or under the terms of the CBSI Plans, and no accumulated funding deficiency
(within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code) exists with respect to any
CBSI Plan.

  

  

4.11. Legal Proceedings. There are no actions, suits or proceedings
instituted, pending or, to the Knowledge of CBSI, threatened against CBSI or
any of its Subsidiaries or against any asset, interest or right of CBSI or any
of its Subsidiaries that, if decided against CBSI or any of its Subsidiaries,
would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
CBSI. There are no actual or, to the Knowledge of CBSI, threatened actions,
suits or proceedings which present a claim to restrain or prohibit the
Transactions or to impose any material liability or restrictions in connection
therewith.

  

  

4.12. Labor Matters. With respect to their employees, neither CBSI nor its
Subsidiaries is a party to any collective bargaining or other similar
agreement with any labor organization, group or association or has engaged in
any unfair labor practice. Since December 31, 2013, neither CBSI nor its
Subsidiaries have experienced any attempt by organized labor or its
representatives to make CBSI or any of its Subsidiaries conform to demands of
organized labor relating to their employees or to enter into a binding
agreement with organized labor that would cover the employees of CBSI or any
of its Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of CBSI, there is no unfair labor
practice charge or other complaint by any employee or former employee of CBSI
or any of its Subsidiaries against any of them pending before any court,
arbitrator or governmental agency arising out of CBSI's or such Subsidiary's
activities or such employee's employment with CBSI or such Subsidiary. There
is no strike, work stoppage or labor disturbance pending or, to the Knowledge
of CBSI, threatened against CBSI or any of its Subsidiaries, and neither CBSI
nor any of its Subsidiaries has experienced any such strike, stoppage or
disturbance since December 31, 2013.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  

  

4.13. Brokers and Finders. Neither CBSI nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any
of their respective officers, directors or employees, has engaged any broker,
finder or financial advisor or become obligated to or incurred any liability
for any fees or commissions in connection with the Transactions, except for
the firm of RBC Capital Markets to provide financial advice with respect to
the Transactions provided for in this Agreement.

  

  

4.14. Environmental Liability.

or operated any properties or facilities, neither it nor any other Person has
disposed, released, or participated in or authorized the release, from or
under such properties or facilities. There is not now nor has there ever been
any presence, disposal, release, from or under any of such properties or
facilities, which may have occurred prior to CBSI having taken possession of
any of such properties or facilities. For the purposes of this Agreement, the
terms "disposal," "release," and "threatened release" shall have the

(b) The operations of CBSI or any of its Subsidiaries, and properties that
CBSI or any of its Subsidiaries owns or leases, are in compliance with

Hazardous Materials, on from or under any of such properties or facilities

Environmental Laws.

  

  

(d) There are no facts, circumstances or conditions relating to the properties

efforts to hold the Oneida Shareholders' Meeting as soon as practicable after
the Registration Statement Effective Date, subject to the applicable notice
requirements under its governing documents and the MGCL.

  

  

(b) The Board of Directors of Oneida shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain from the shareholders of Oneida votes sufficient under its governing
documents and the MGCL to approve this Agreement and the Transactions,
including by communicating to Oneida's shareholders its recommendation (and
including such recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus) that they
adopt and approve this Agreement and the Transactions contemplated herein and
taking all other action necessary or desirable to secure the vote of
shareholders to obtain such approval.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding Section 5.1(b) above, but subject to the provisions of
Section 5.12 and Article VII hereof, if the Board of Directors of Oneida,
after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that,
because of the receipt by Oneida of a Takeover Proposal that the Board of
Directors of Oneida concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal,
it would violate its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to
recommend this Agreement, then in submitting this agreement to the
shareholders of Oneida, the Board of Directors of Oneida may submit this
Agreement without recommendation (although any resolutions of the Board of
Directors of Oneida approving this Agreement as of the date hereof shall not
be rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of Directors of Oneida may
communicate the basis for its lack of recommendation in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the
extent required by law; provided that the Board of Directors of Oneida shall
not take any action under this sentence unless it has complied with the
provisions of Section 5.12(b)(ii).

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding any withdrawal, modification or change in any
recommendation of the Board of Directors of Oneida, Oneida agrees to hold the
Oneida Shareholders' Meeting within the time period specified above unless
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. Oneida shall
adjourn or postpone the Oneida Shareholders' Meeting to a date and time
mutually agreed upon by Oneida and CBSI if (i) as of the time for which the
Oneida Shareholders' Meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient
shares of Oneida Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or (ii)
if on the date of the Oneida Shareholders' Meeting Oneida has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of votes to approve this Agreement
and the Transactions, provided, that Oneida shall not be required to adjourn
or postpone the Oneida Shareholders' Meeting more than twice as a result of
(i) or (ii) above. If, between the date hereof and the Oneida Shareholders'
Meeting, Keefe Bruyette and Woods, Inc. shall amend or withdraw its fairness
opinion, Oneida shall give prompt notice thereof to CBSI.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

  

5.2. Proxy Statement; Registration Statement. As promptly as practicable after
the date hereof, CBSI shall prepare and file the Registration Statement with
the SEC, and Oneida shall cooperate in the preparation of the Registration
Statement, which shall include the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to
the shareholders of Oneida in connection with obtaining their approval of this
Agreement. CBSI will advise Oneida, promptly after it receives notice thereof,
of the time when the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment
thereto has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of
the issuance of any stop order, of the suspension of qualification of the CBSI
Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, or the initiation or threat of any proceeding for any such
purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the amendment or supplement of the
Registration Statement or for additional information. If, at any time prior to
the Effective Time, any event or circumstance relating to a party to this
Agreement, or its directors, officers or 5% or greater shareholders, shall be
discovered by such party that pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Registration
Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus included therein, such party shall
promptly notify the other party. To the extent applicable, CBSI shall take all
actions necessary to register or qualify the shares of CBSI Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger pursuant to all applicable state "blue sky" or securities
laws and shall maintain such registrations or qualifications in effect for all
purposes hereof. CBSI shall apply for, and shall use reasonable best efforts
to obtain, approval to list the shares of CBSI Common Stock to be issued in
the Merger on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the
Effective Time.

  

  

5.3. Applications. As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, and after
a reasonable opportunity for review by the other party and its counsel, CBSI
and Oneida shall submit any requisite applications for prior approval of, and
notices with respect to, the Transactions to the OCC, the Federal Reserve
Board and the New York Department of Financial Services, and each of the
parties hereto shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, submit any
applications, notices or other filings to any other state or federal
government agency, department or body, the approval of which is required or
desirable for consummation of the Merger. Oneida and CBSI each represent and
warrant to the other that all information concerning their respective
directors, officers, shareholders and Subsidiaries included (or submitted for
inclusion) in any such application and furnished by them shall be true,
correct and complete in all material respects. Each party agrees to consult
with the other party with respect to obtaining all necessary approvals and
consents and each will keep the other apprised of the status of matters
relating to such approvals and consents, including providing the other party
with copies of all material written communications to, or received from, any
regulatory authority in respect of the Transactions. The parties agree to
cooperate with each other in seeking regulatory approvals by, among other
things, providing each other with information which may be necessary or
advisable in connection with any application to, or filing with, any
regulatory authority.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  

  

5.4. Best Efforts.

  

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, CBSI and Oneida
shall each use reasonable best efforts in good faith to (i) furnish such
information as may be required or desirable in connection with the preparation
of the documents referred to in Sections 5.2 and 5.3 above, and (ii) take or
cause to be taken all action necessary or desirable on its part so as to
permit consummation of the Merger at the earliest possible date, including,
without limitation, (1) obtaining the consent or approval of Persons whose
consent or approval is required for consummation of the Transactions, provided
that Oneida shall not agree to make any payments or modifications to
agreements in connection therewith without the prior written consent of CBSI,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and (2)
requesting the delivery of appropriate opinions, consents and letters from
their respective counsel and independent auditors. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, no party hereto shall take or fail to take, or
cause or permit its Subsidiaries to take or fail to take, or to the best of
its ability permit to be taken or not to be taken by any third party, any
action that would substantially impair the prospects of completing the Merger
pursuant to this Agreement, that would materially delay such completion, or
that would adversely affect the qualification of the Merger as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. In the event
that either party has taken any action, whether before, on or after the date
hereof, that would adversely affect such qualification, each party shall take
such action as the other party may reasonably request to cure such effect to
the extent curable without a Material Adverse Effect on either of the parties.

  

  

(b) Each party hereto shall give prompt notice to the other party of (i) the
occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event which occurrence or failure
would be reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty contained
in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate at any time from the date hereof
to the Closing Date such that the condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or
6.3(a), as applicable, would not be met if such failure to be true or accurate
were to occur or be continuing on the Closing Date, and (ii) any material
failure of any party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder, and each party
shall use all reasonable best efforts in good faith to remedy such failure.

  

  

(c) From the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, to the extent
permitted by law, Oneida shall cause the Oneida Banks to provide such
assistance to Community Bank as reasonably necessary for Community Bank to
prepare for the conversion and transfer in connection with the Merger all
information concerning the loans, deposits and other assets and liabilities of
the Oneida Banks into Community Bank's own data processing system, with a view
to facilitating the integration of Community Bank's and the Oneida Banks'
systems and otherwise combining Community Bank's and the Oneida Banks'
operations upon consummation of the Merger. Such assistance shall include
providing Community Bank with computer file instructions with respect to the
information in its data processing system regarding the assets and liabilities
of the Oneida Banks, together with operational procedures designed to
implement the transfer of such information to Community Bank, provided that
the confidentiality of customer information shall be preserved and no
information shall be transferred until the Effective Time. After execution of
this Agreement, the Oneida Banks and Community Bank shall each designate an
individual to serve as liaison concerning the transfer of data processing
information and other similar operational matters. Prior to the Effective
Time, Oneida shall not enter into, extend, modify, or terminate, any agreement
with a third party vendor providing information technology or data processing
services or software to Oneida or any Oneida Subsidiary without the prior
written consent of CBSI, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Each party shall provide, and shall request its auditors to provide, the
other party with such historical financial information regarding it (and
related audit reports and consents) as the other party may reasonably request
for disclosure purposes under the Securities Laws.

  

  

(e) Each party shall take all steps, as may be necessary or appropriate, to
cause the transactions contemplated by Article II and any other dispositions
of equity securities of Oneida (including derivative securities) or
acquisitions of equity securities of CBSI in connection with the consummation
of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  

  

5.5. Investigation and Confidentiality.

  

  

(a) Oneida and CBSI each will keep the other advised of all material
developments relevant to its and its Subsidiaries' businesses and to
consummation of the Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (i) representatives of Oneida and CBSI shall confer periodically
regarding the financial condition, assets, liabilities, operations and
business of Oneida and the Oneida Banks and matters relating to the completion
of the Transactions, and (ii) as soon as reasonably available, but in no event
more than three (3) business days after filing, Oneida shall furnish to CBSI
all reports filed by it or the Oneida Banks with, and all material notices
received by it or the Oneida Banks from, any regulatory authority subsequent
to the date hereof, subject to any regulatory requirements to maintain the
confidentiality of such reports and notices.

  

  

(b) Oneida and CBSI each may make or cause to be made such investigation of
the financial and legal condition of the other as such party reasonably deems
necessary or advisable in connection with the Transactions, provided, however,
that such investigation shall be reasonably related to such transactions and
the party conducting such investigation shall use its reasonable best efforts
to minimize any disruptions to the operations of the other party. CBSI and
Oneida agree to furnish the other and the other's advisors with such financial
data and other information with respect to its business and properties as such
other party shall from time to time reasonably request, including, without
limitation, information with respect to Oneida's delinquent or problem Loans
of the nature described in Section 3.11.

  

  

(c) Promptly following the occurrence of an event or fact which, if such event
or fact had occurred prior to the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to have been Previously Disclosed, the applicable party shall update
its disclosure letter required to be delivered under the terms of this
Agreement unless such event or fact is disclosed in an SEC Document filed with
the SEC.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Oneida shall provide CBSI, no later than fifteen (15) days after the end
of each month, a written update on each of its Delinquent Loans and Loans
Previously Disclosed pursuant to Section 3.11(g).

  

  

(e) No update of a party's disclosure letter after the date hereof, and no
investigation done after the date hereof pursuant to this Section 5.5 or
otherwise shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
made by, or the conditions to the obligations to consummate the Merger of, any
party hereto.

  

  

(f) Each party hereto shall hold all information furnished by the other party
or any of such party's Subsidiaries or representatives pursuant to this
Agreement in confidence and in accordance with the confidentiality agreement
dated December 19, 2014, between Oneida and CBSI (the "Confidentiality
Agreement").

  

  

5.6. Press Releases and Other Public Disclosures. Oneida and CBSI shall agree
with each other as to the form and substance of any press release related to
this Agreement or the Transactions, and shall consult and agree with each
other as to the form and substance of other public disclosures related
thereto, including without limitation, any communications with securities
market professionals and investors, provided, however, that nothing contained
herein shall prohibit any party, following notification to the other parties,
from making any disclosure which, in the opinion of its counsel, is required
by applicable law or NYSE or NASDAQ rules.

  

  

5.7. Actions Pending the Merger.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, and except as otherwise provided for by this
Agreement or consented to or approved in writing by the other party hereto,

practice); make any capital expenditure in excess of $50,000 in the aggregate;
or establish new branches or other similar facilities, close existing branches
or similar facilities or enter into or modify any leases or other contracts
relating thereto;

  

  

(10) hire any new employee without first consulting with CBSI; increase the
rate of compensation of, pay or agree to pay any bonus to, or provide any
additional employee benefit or incentive (including without limitation, any
"change of control" or severance payment) to any of its directors, officers or
employees except as required by law or contractual obligation in effect as of
the date hereof; or become party to, adopt, terminate, amend, or commit itself

(13) take any action that could result in (i) any of its representations or
warranties in this Agreement being or becoming untrue in any material respects
at any time prior to the Effective Time, (ii) any of the conditions to the
Merger set forth in Article VI not being satisfied, except as may be required
by law or (iii) materially delaying the receipt of necessary regulatory
approvals for the Transactions except as may be required by law or regulatory
requirement; or

  

  

(14) agree to do any of the foregoing or take any other action which would in
any manner interfere with, impede, delay, or make more costly the consummation
of the Transactions.

  

  

(c) CBSI shall not, except with the prior written consent of Oneida (which
consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed) or as expressly
permitted by this Agreement, carry on its business other than in the usual,
regular and ordinary course in substantially the same manner as heretofore
conducted; provided, however, that nothing herein shall be construed to
prevent CBSI from acquiring or agreeing to acquire any Person, by merging or
consolidating with, by purchasing an equity interest in or a portion of the
assets of, or by any other manner, such Person or taking actions reasonably
related thereto, so long as such transaction would not materially delay or
prevent the consummation of the Transactions.

  

  

5.8. Certain Policies. Following receipt of all regulatory approvals required
to consummate the Merger and the Bank Mergers and approval of this Agreement
at the Oneida Shareholders' Meeting:

  

  

(a) Oneida shall, consistent with GAAP and applicable law and on a basis
mutually satisfactory to it and CBSI, modify and change its accounting,
investment, loan, litigation and real estate valuation policies and practices
(including loan classifications, content and size of investment portfolio, and
levels of reserves and accruals) so as to be applied, in all material
respects, on a basis that is consistent with that of CBSI;

  

  

(b) Oneida and CBSI shall review the adequacy of reserves for loan losses
currently established by Oneida and, if deemed warranted by both parties under
GAAP, Oneida shall make mutually acceptable changes to such reserves; and

  

  

(c) Oneida shall consult with CBSI with respect to determining the amount and
timing of recognizing, for financial accounting and income Tax reporting
purposes, Oneida's expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions and,
subject to GAAP and applicable law, Oneida shall recognize its costs and
expenses in connection with the Transactions at such time or times as are
reasonably requested by CBSI.

  

  

5.9. Employee Benefits; Directors and Management; Indemnification.

  

  

(a) The current employees of Oneida or any of its Subsidiaries who continue as
employees of CBSI or its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time ("Continuing
Employees") shall be given credit for past service with Oneida for purposes of
determining eligibility for and vesting of employee benefits (but not for
pension benefit accrual purposes) under all welfare and retirement programs
maintained by CBSI or its Subsidiaries in which such Continuing Employees
participate following the Merger and for purposes of determining length of
vacation, sick time, paid time off and severance under CBSI's applicable plan
or policy. In the event that the employment of any Continuing Employee shall
be terminated by CBSI or one of its Subsidiaries without cause within twelve
months after the Effective Time, such Continuing Employee shall be entitled
(subject to meeting applicable eligibility and vesting requirements) to
receive severance benefits no less than those provided under the terms of
CBSI's severance policy in effect as of the date of this Agreement, which has
been Previously Disclosed. In the event that the employment of any Continuing
Employee shall be terminated by CBSI or one of its Subsidiaries without cause
more than twelve months after the Effective Time, such Continuing Employee
shall be entitled (subject to meeting applicable eligibility and vesting
requirements) to receive severance benefits no less than those provided under
the terms of CBSI's severance policy in effect as of the date of termination
of employment.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Oneida shall take all actions, provided such
actions comply with applicable law or do not trigger adverse tax consequences
to any employee or independent contractor of Oneida or any Oneida Subsidiary,
that may be requested by CBSI in writing upon advance notice of not less than
30 days with respect to (i) causing one or more Oneida Plans to terminate as
of or immediately prior to the Effective Time or for benefit accrual and
entitlements to cease as of the Effective Time, (ii) causing the continuation
on and after the Effective Time of any contract, arrangement or insurance
policy relating to any Oneida Plan for such period as may be requested by
CBSI, or (iii) cooperating with CBSI to facilitate the merger of any Oneida
Plan into any CBSI Plan as of or following the Effective Time.

  

  

(c) CBSI shall honor the employment agreements and severance arrangements in
effect as of the date of this Agreement and Previously Disclosed by Oneida to
CBSI, except to the extent that any such agreements or arrangements are
superseded or terminated as of or following the Effective Time, with the
written consent of the affected parties.

  

  

(d) In the event of any termination of any Oneida or any Oneida Subsidiary
health plan or consolidation of any such plan with any CBSI or CBSI Subsidiary
health plan, CBSI shall make available to Continuing Employees and their
dependents employer-provided health coverage on the same basis as it provides
such coverage to CBSI or CBSI Subsidiary employees. Unless a Continuing
Employee causes coverage to terminate under an Oneida or Oneida Subsidiary
health plan prior to the time that a Continuing Employee becomes eligible to
participate in the CBSI or CBSI Subsidiary health plan, neither CBSI nor any
CBSI Subsidiary shall terminate the existing coverage of any of the Continuing
Employees or their dependents under any of the Oneida or Oneida Subsidiary
health plans prior to the time such Continuing Employees and their dependents
become eligible to participate in the health plans, programs and benefits
common to all employees of CBSI or CBSI Subsidiary and their dependents. In
the event of a termination or consolidation of any Oneida or Oneida Subsidiary
health plan on or after the Effective Time, former employees of Oneida or
Oneida Subsidiary and qualified beneficiaries will have the right to continued
coverage under group health plans of CBSI to the extent required by COBRA.

  

  

(e) At the Effective Time, CBSI shall, or direct Oneida to, pay each
participant in the Oneida Cash Incentive Plans a lump sum cash payment equal
to the pro-rata portion of his or her annual incentive award payable under the
Oneida Cash Incentive Plans, calculated from the first day of the plan year
beginning on January 1, 2015 (or beginning on January 1, 2016 if the Effective
Time occurs in the 2016 calendar year) until the Effective Time, as if the
company and individual performance goals are achieved at "target" performance
for such award.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, CBSI shall cause its Board of Directors and
Community Bank's Board of Directors (subject to their continuing fiduciary
duties between the date hereof and the Effective Time) to take all requisite
actions to expand the size thereof by two directors and appoint Eric E.
Stickels and Michael R. Kallet(each, a "New Director") as directors of CBSI
and Community Bank to fill the vacancies created by the expansion, effective
as of the Effective Time. Subject to the exercise of the fiduciary duties of
CBSI's Board of Directors, CBSI shall cause the Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee to nominate, and shall cause its Board to recommend for
election, each New Director at CBSI's next annual meeting of shareholders at
which they are standing for election. Nothing contained in this Section 5.9(f)
shall be construed to limit the ability of the respective Boards of Directors
of CBSI and Community Bank to further increase the size of such Boards from
time to time as they may deem appropriate.

  

  

(g) (1) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative,
including, without limitation, any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation in which any Person (the "Indemnified Party") who is now, or has
been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to
the Effective Time, a director or officer of Oneida is, or is threatened to
be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part
out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer or
employee of Oneida or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) this Agreement or any
of the Transactions, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after
the Effective Time, CBSI shall, for a period of six years after the Effective
Time, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
costs, expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses in advance
of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to
each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL upon
receipt of any undertaking required by the DGCL), judgments, fines and amounts
paid in settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and in the event of any such
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether
asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time), the Indemnified Party
may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to them after consultation with
CBSI; provided, however, that (1) CBSI shall have the right to assume the
defense thereof and upon such assumption CBSI shall not be liable to any
Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense thereof, except that if CBSI elects not to assume such defense or
counsel for the Indemnified Party reasonably advises the Indemnified Party
that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between CBSI and the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may retain counsel reasonably
satisfactory to them after notification, and CBSI shall pay the reasonable
fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Party, (2) CBSI shall be
obligated pursuant to this paragraph to pay for only one firm of counsel for
all Indemnified Parties, (3) CBSI shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent, (4) CBSI shall have no obligation
hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have
become final and nonappealable, that indemnification of such Indemnified Party
in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law, and (5)
CBSI shall no obligation hereunder to defend or indemnify an Indemnified Party
from a claim, action or suit between such Indemnified Party and CBSI or any of
its Subsidiaries. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
this Section 5.9(g), upon becoming aware of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify CBSI thereof, provided that
the failure of any Indemnified Party to so notify CBSI shall relieve it of its
obligations to indemnify hereunder to the extent that such failure materially
prejudices CBSI.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(2) The indemnification rights provided in subparagraph (1) above, are in
addition to the obligations of indemnification (including the advancement of
expenses) in favor of the directors and officers of Oneida (including former
directors and officers) under Oneida's articles of incorporation and bylaws
(and provisions of Maryland law referenced or incorporated therein) that are
assumed by CBSI by reason of the Merger.

  

  

(3) CBSI will use its reasonably best efforts to cause the Persons who served
as directors or officers of Oneida on or before the Effective Time to be
covered by Oneida's existing directors' and officers' liability insurance
policy (provided that CBSI may substitute therefor policies of at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are not less
advantageous than such policy) but in no event shall any insured Person be
entitled under this Section 5.9 to insurance coverage more favorable than that
provided to him or her in such capacities as of the date hereof with respect
to acts or omissions resulting from their service as such on or prior to the
Effective Time. Such insurance coverage shall commence at the Effective Time
and will be provided for a period of no less than six years after the
Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event shall CBSI be required to
expend more than 150% of the current amount expended by Oneida to maintain or
procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto. Prior to the Effective Time,
Oneida agrees to renew any such existing insurance or to purchase any
"discovery period" insurance provided for thereunder at CBSI's request.

  

  

5.10. Dividends; Termination of DRIP Plan. After the date of this Agreement,
CBSI and Oneida shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any
dividends in respect of CBSI Common Stock and Oneida Common Stock and the
record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the
parties hereto that holders of Oneida Common Stock shall not receive dividends
other than regular dividends thereon, subject to any regulatory limitations,
or fail to receive such regular dividends subject to any regulatory
limitations, for any calendar quarter prior to the Effective Time with respect
to their shares of Oneida Common Stock and for any calendar quarter following
the Effective Time with respect to any shares of CBSI Common Stock that such
holder receives as Merger Consideration. Oneida shall suspend its DRIP Plan
effective as of the date of this Agreement with the effect that no additional
shares of Oneida Common Stock shall be issued thereunder prior to the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement. Prompt notice of such
suspension shall be given to all Oneida shareholders. Upon the Effective Time,
the DRIP Plan shall be terminated, and Oneida and CBSI shall cooperate in
providing any required notice of such termination of such termination to the
shareholders of Oneida.

5.11. Takeover Laws. No party hereto shall take any action that would cause
the Transactions to be subject to the requirements imposed by any Takeover
Law, and each of them shall take all necessary steps within its control to
exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) all such Transactions from, or
if necessary challenge the validity or applicability of, any applicable
Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in effect.

  

  

5.12. No Solicitation.

  

  

(a) Subject to Section 5.12(b) hereof, from and after the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, neither Oneida nor any Person acting
on behalf of Oneida shall, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit, initiate or
respond to discussions or engage in negotiations with any Person (whether such
negotiations are initiated by Oneida or otherwise) or take any other action
intended or designed to facilitate the efforts of any Person, other than CBSI,
relating to the possible acquisition, recapitalization or other business
combination involving Oneida or any of its Subsidiaries (whether by way of
merger, purchase of capital stock, purchase of assets or otherwise) or twenty-
five percent (25%) or more of its capital stock or assets (with any such
efforts by any such Person, including a firm proposal to make such an
acquisition, to be referred to as "Takeover Proposal"), (b) provide non-public
information with respect to Oneida or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person,
other than CBSI and its professional advisors or Oneida's professional
advisors, or (c) enter into an agreement, or a letter of intent or term sheet,
with any Person, other than CBSI, providing for a possible Takeover Proposal.
If Oneida receives any offer or proposal relating to a Takeover Proposal,
Oneida shall immediately notify CBSI thereof, including information as to the
identity of the party making any such offer or proposal and the specific terms
of such offer or proposal, as the case may be. Oneida shall immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions, or negotiations
conducted before the date of this Agreement with any Person other than CBSI
with respect to any Takeover Proposal. Oneida will promptly (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours) advise CBSI following receipt of any
communication or inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Takeover Proposal and the substance thereof (including any terms and
conditions discussed and the identity of the party making such communication
or inquiry) and will promptly advise CBSI of any related developments,
discussions and negotiations on a current basis.

  

  

(b) (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.12(a)
prior to the Closing or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms, to the extent the Board of Directors of Oneida determines, in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that a failure to take
such actions would constitute a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law, Oneida may: participate in discussions or negotiations with,
and, subject to the requirements of Section 5.12(c), furnish non-public
information, and afford access to the properties, books or records of Oneida
or any of its Subsidiaries, to any Person after such Person has delivered to
Oneida in writing an unsolicited bona fide Takeover Proposal with respect to
Oneida or any of its Subsidiaries (which has not been withdrawn) which the
Board of Directors of Oneida in its good faith judgment determines, after
reasonable inquiry and consultation with its financial advisor (i) would be
reasonably likely to result in a transaction more favorable than that
contemplated by this Agreement to the shareholders of Oneida (which judgment
must be reasonable), and (ii) that the Person making such Takeover Proposal is
financially capable of consummating such Takeover Proposal or that the
financing necessary to consummate such Takeover Proposal, to the extent
required, is then committed or is capable of being obtained by such Person (a
"Superior Proposal"). In addition, notwithstanding the provisions of Section
5.12(a) above, in connection with a submitted, written bona fide Takeover
Proposal or potential Takeover Proposal, Oneida shall refer any third party to
this Section 5.12 or make a copy of this Section 5.12 available to such third
party.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) In the event Oneida or any of its Subsidiaries receives a Superior
Proposal, prior to taking any action with respect thereto Oneida shall (A)
provide CBSI not less than seventy-two (72) hours prior written notice of its
intent to take such action and any meeting of the Board of Directors of Oneida
at which such Board of Directors is reasonably expected to consider a Superior
Proposal, (B) not recommend to its shareholders a Superior Proposal for a
period of not less than three (3) business days after CBSI's receipt of a copy
of such Superior Proposal and the identity of the third party, and (C) not
enter into a definitive agreement relating to such Superior Proposal unless
CBSI fails to match the terms of the Superior Proposal, or provide an
alternative proposal upon terms which, after consideration by the Board of
Directors of Oneida in good faith, are not more favorable than the Superior
Proposal, within three (3) business days after CBSI's receipt of a copy of
such Superior Proposal and the identity of the third party; and provided,
further, that unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VII,
nothing contained in this Section 5.12(b) shall limit Oneida's obligation to
hold and convene the Oneida Shareholders' Meeting in accordance with Section
5.1 hereof (regardless of whether the recommendation of the Board of Directors
of Oneida shall have been withdrawn, modified or not yet made) or to provide
the shareholders of Oneida with material information relating to this
Agreement and the Oneida Shareholders' Meeting. Any material amendment to any
Superior Proposal shall be deemed to be a new Superior Proposal for purposes
of determining any time periods and obligations of Oneida pursuant to this
Section 5.12(b)(ii).

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither Oneida nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall provide any non-public information to a third party
unless: (x) Oneida provides such non-public information pursuant to a
nondisclosure agreement with terms regarding the protection of oral or written
confidential information at least as restrictive as such terms in the
Confidentiality Agreement heretofore entered into by the parties hereto; and
(y) such non-public information has been previously delivered or made
available to CBSI.

requirements as may be necessary;

  

  

(d) There shall not have been instituted, pending or threatened in writing any
action or proceeding by any governmental authority or administrative agency,

the Closing Date, substantially to the effect that, on the basis of facts,
representations and assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinions, the
Merger will be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reorganization or
part of a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and
that:

(4) Each Oneida shareholder's aggregate tax basis in any shares of CBSI Common

55

(6) Each Oneida shareholder's holding period in any shares of CBSI Common
Stock received in the Transactions will, in each instance, include the period

therefor were held, provided that such shares of Oneida Common Stock were held
as capital assets by the shareholder at the Effective Time.

additional conditions at or prior to the Closing Date unless waived by Oneida

Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date (or, in the case of
any representation and warranty which specifically relates to an earlier date,
as of such earlier date), except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement
or consented to in writing by Oneida; provided, however, that (i) in
determining whether or not the condition contained in this paragraph (a) is
satisfied, no effect shall be given to any qualifications or exceptions in
such representations and warranties relating to materiality or Material
Adverse Effect and (ii) the condition contained in this paragraph (a) shall be
deemed to be satisfied unless the failure of such representations and
warranties to be so true and correct constitute, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on CBSI;

  

  

(b) CBSI shall have in all material respects performed all obligations and
complied with all covenants required by this Agreement to be performed or
complied with at or prior to the Closing Date;

  

  

(c) CBSI shall have delivered to Oneida a certificate, dated the Closing Date
and signed by its President and Chief Executive Officer, to the effect that

of or waiver from the other party thereto as a result of the Transactions,

would not have a Material Adverse Effect on CBSI; and

ARTICLE VII

 

  

  

TERMINATION

  

  

7.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, either before or after approval by the shareholders of Oneida:

  

  

(a) by the mutual written consent duly authorized by the respective Boards of
Directors of the parties hereto;

  

  

(b) by CBSI in writing, if Oneida has, or by Oneida in writing, if CBSI has,
breached (i) any covenant or agreement contained herein or (ii) any
representation or warranty contained herein, and in either case if (x) to the
extent that such breach is curable, such breach has not been cured within 30
days after the date on which written notice thereof is given to the breaching
party and (y) such breach would entitle the non-breaching party not to
consummate the Transactions under Article VI hereof;

  

  

(c) by any party hereto in writing, if the applications for governmental
approval referred to in Section 5.3 hereof have been denied, or if any
governmental entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final
nonappealable order enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger;

  

  

(d) by any party hereto in writing, if the shareholders of Oneida do not
approve this Agreement and the Transactions at the special meeting duly called
for that purpose;

  

  

(e) by any party hereto in writing, if the Merger shall not have been
consummated by the close of business on December 31, 2015, unless the failure
to so consummate by such date shall be principally due to the failure of the
party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants
and agreements set forth herein;

  

  

(f) by CBSI, if (i) the Board of Directors of Oneida shall withdraw, modify or
change its approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the Transactions in
a manner adverse to CBSI, or Oneida shall have failed to include in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus the recommendation of its Board of Directors in favor of
the approval of this Agreement or the Transactions; (ii) following its receipt
of a Takeover Proposal or the public announcement of a Takeover Proposal,
Oneida shall fail to timely comply with the covenants contained in Section
5.2; (iii) the Board of Directors of Oneida shall have recommended to the
shareholders of Oneida a Superior Proposal, or Oneida shall have executed a
letter of intent, a definitive agreement or similar document with respect to a
Superior Proposal; (iv) a tender offer or exchange offer for 25% or more of
the outstanding shares of Oneida Common Stock is commenced and Oneida shall
not have sent to its shareholders, within 10 business days after the
commencement of such tender or exchange offer, a statement that the Board of
Directors of Oneida recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer; or
(v) a Takeover Proposal (other than a tender or exchange offer covered by
clause (iv) of this Section 7.1(f)) with respect to Oneida is publicly
announced and, upon CBSI's request, Oneida fails to issue a press release
announcing its opposition to such Takeover Proposal within three (3) business
days after such request;;

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(g) by Oneida, if the Board of Directors of Oneida shall have recommended to
the shareholders of Oneida a Superior Proposal, or Oneida shall have executed
a letter of intent, a definitive agreement or similar document with respect to
a Superior Proposal, in each case in accordance with Section 5.12, provided
that Oneida has complied with all provisions thereof.

  

  

(h) by Oneida, if the Board of Directors of Oneida so determines by a vote of
the majority of the members of the entire Board of Directors of Oneida, at any
time during the five-day period commencing with the Determination Date (as
defined below), if both of the following conditions are satisfied:

  

  


 

  

(A) The number obtained by dividing the Average Closing Price by the Starting
Price (as defined below) (the "CBSI Ratio") shall be less than 0.80; and

  


 

  

(B) (x) the CBSI Ratio shall be less than (y) the number obtained by dividing
the Final Index Price by the Index Price on the Starting Date (each as defined
below) and subtracting 0.20 from the quotient in this clause (B) (y) (such
number in this clause (B) (y) that results from dividing the Final Index Price
by the Index Price on the Starting Date being referred to herein as the "Index
Ratio");

  


 

  

subject, however, to the following three sentences. If Oneida elects to
exercise its termination right pursuant to this Section 7.1(h), it shall give
written notice to CBSI (provided that such notice of election to terminate may
be withdrawn at any time within the aforementioned five-day period). During
the five-day period commencing with its receipt of such notice, CBSI shall
have the option to increase the consideration to be received by the holders of
Oneida Common Stock hereunder, by adjusting the Exchange Ratio (calculated to
the nearest one one-thousandth) to equal the lesser of a number (rounded to
the nearest one one-thousandth) obtained by dividing (A) the product of the
Starting Price, 0.80 and the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) by (B) the
Average Closing Price and (y) a number (rounded to the nearest one one-
thousandth) obtained by dividing (A) the product of the Index Ratio and the
Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) by (B) the CBSI Ratio. If CBSI so elects
within such five-day period, it shall give prompt written notice to Oneida of
such election and the revised Exchange Ratio, whereupon no termination shall
have occurred pursuant to this Section 7.1(h) and this Agreement shall remain
in effect in accordance with its terms (except as the Exchange Ratio shall
have been so modified).

  


 

  

For purposes of this Section 7.1(h) the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:

  


 

  

"Average Closing Price" shall mean the average of the daily closing prices for
the shares of CBSI Common Stock for the 20 consecutive full trading days on
which such shares are actually traded on the NYSE (as reported by The Wall
Street Journal or, if not reported thereby, any other authoritative source)
ending at the close of trading on the Determination Date.

  


 

  

"Determination Date" shall mean the first business day after the date all
regulatory approvals (or waivers thereof) required to consummate the Merger
and the Bank Mergers have been obtained (disregarding any waiting period).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

"Final Index Price" shall mean the average of the Index Prices for the 20
consecutive full trading days ending on the trading day prior to the
Determination Date.

  


 

  

"Index Price" shall mean the closing price on the Starting Date of the SNL
Midcap U.S. Bank Index.

  


 

  

"Starting Date" shall mean the last trading day immediately preceding the date
of the first public announcement of entry into this Agreement.

7.2. Effect of Termination. In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 7.1 hereof, this Agreement shall become void and have no effect,
except that (i) the provisions of Sections 5.5, 7.3, 8.6, 8.9 and 8.10 hereof
shall survive any such termination and (ii) a termination pursuant to Section
7.1 shall not relieve the breaching party from liability for any willful
breach of such covenant or agreement or representation or warranty giving rise
to such termination.

  

  

7.3. Fee.

  

  

(a) Except as set forth in this Section 7.3, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions (including fees and
expenses of its own financial consultants, accountants and counsel) shall be
paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not such transactions
are consummated, except that CBSI and Oneida each shall bear and pay 50% of
all printing and mailing costs and filing fees associated with the
Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and any amendment or
supplement thereto.

  

  

(b) As a condition of CBSI's willingness, and in order to induce CBSI, to
enter into this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Oneida hereby agrees to pay CBSI, and CBSI shall be entitled to
payment of FOUR MILLION NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ($4,930,000)
(the "Fee"), as liquidated damages and not as a penalty. The Fee shall be paid
within three (3) business days after written demand for payment is made by
CBSI, following the occurrence of any of the events set forth below:

  

  

(i) The termination of this Agreement by Oneida pursuant to Section 7.1(g) or
by CBSI pursuant to Section 7.1(f);

  

  

(ii) The entering into a definitive agreement by Oneida relating to a Takeover
Proposal or the consummation of a Takeover Proposal involving Oneida within
nine (9) months after the occurrence of any of the following: (i) the
termination of the Agreement by CBSI pursuant to Section 7.1(b) because of a
breach by Oneida; or (ii) the failure of Oneida to hold the Oneida
Shareholders' Meeting or the failure of the shareholders of Oneida to approve
this Agreement, in each case after the public disclosure of a Takeover
Proposal.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) The right to receive payment of the Fee under Section 7.3(b) will
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of CBSI and Community Bank against
Oneida and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors with
respect to a termination listed under Section 7.3(b).

  

  

   

  

 

ARTICLE VIII

 

  

  

MISCELLANEOUS

  

  

8.1. Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. All
representations, warranties and covenants in this Agreement or in any
instrument delivered pursuant hereto shall expire on, and be terminated and
extinguished at, the Effective Time other than covenants that by their terms
are to survive or be performed after the Effective Time; provided, that no
such representations, warranties or covenants shall be deemed to be terminated
or extinguished so as to deprive CBSI or Oneida (or any director, officer or
controlling Person thereof) of any defense in law or equity which otherwise
would be available against the claims of any Person, including, without
limitation, any shareholder or former shareholder of either CBSI or Oneida,
the aforesaid representations, warranties and covenants being material
inducements to the consummation by CBSI and Oneida of the Transactions.

  

  

8.2. Amendment or Supplement. This Agreement may be amended or supplemented at
any time prior to the Effective Time only by mutual agreement of the parties
hereto or thereto. Any such amendment or supplement must be in writing and
approved by their respective Boards of Directors; provided, however, that,
after approval of this Agreement by the respective shareholders of Oneida or
CBSI, no amendment may be made which by law requires further approval by such
shareholders without obtaining such further approval.

  

  

8.3. Waiver. Except where not permitted by law, CBSI or Oneida, by written
instrument signed by an executive officer of such party, may at any time
(whether before or after approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of
Oneida) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other party, and may waive (i) any inaccuracies of such other
party in the representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or any
document delivered pursuant hereto, (ii) compliance with any of the covenants,
undertakings or agreements of such other party, or satisfaction of any of the
conditions precedent to its obligations, contained herein or (iii) the
performance by such other party of any of its obligations set out herein or
therein. No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise
of any right hereunder shall impair such right or be construed as a waiver of,
or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement
herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude
other or further exercise thereof or of any other right.

  

  

8.4. Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire agreement between
the parties with respect to the Transactions and supersede all prior
arrangements or understandings with respect thereto, written or oral, other

thereto and their respective successors. Except for the provisions of Article
II and Section 5.9(c) and (d) and as specifically set forth herein, nothing in
this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any party,
other than the parties hereto and thereto, and their respective successors,
any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities. This Agreement shall
constitute a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the
Code.

EXHIBIT A

  


 

  

VOTING AGREEMENT

  


 

  

This Voting Agreement, dated as of February 24, 2015 (this "Agreement"), is by
and between Community Bank System, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("CBSI"), and
the undersigned shareholder (the "Shareholder") of Oneida Financial Corp., a
Maryland corporation ("Oneida").

  


 

  

RECITALS

  


 

  

A. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, CBSI and Oneida entered
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") which provides
for the merger of Oneida with and into CBSI (the "Merger"). Pursuant to the
Merger, shares of capital stock of Oneida will be converted into the merger
consideration, consisting of cash and shares of common stock of CBSI, on the
basis set forth in the Merger Agreement.

  


 

  

B. The Shareholder has the legal power to vote, or to direct the voting of (by
law, contract or otherwise), the shares of the outstanding common stock of
Oneida indicated on the final page of this Agreement (the "Shares").

  


 

  

C. As a material inducement to enter into the Merger Agreement, CBSI desires
the Shareholder to agree, and the Shareholder is willing to agree, to vote or
cause to be voted, as the case may be, the Shares and any other such shares of
capital stock of Oneida subsequently acquired by the Shareholder so as to
facilitate consummation of the Merger as provided in this Agreement.

  


 

  

NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound, the parties agree as follows:

  


 

  

1. Agreement to Vote Shares; Additional Purchases.

  


 

  

1.1 Agreement to Vote Shares. At every meeting of the shareholders of Oneida
called with respect to the approval of the Merger Agreement and/or the Merger,
and at every adjournment thereof, and on every action or approval by written
consent of the shareholders of Oneida with respect to the approval of the
Merger Agreement and/or the Merger, the Shareholder shall vote, or cause to be
voted, the Shares and any New Shares (as defined below) in favor of adoption
and approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger.

  


 

  

1.2 Agreement to Retain Shares. The Shareholder shall not transfer, sell,
exchange, pledge or otherwise dispose of or encumber the Shares or any New
Shares; provided, however, that the Shareholder may transfer the Shares if the
transferee, prior to such transfer, executes a voting agreement with respect
to the Shares to be transferred, substantially in the form of this Agreement,
and provides such executed agreement to CBSI.

  


 

  

1.3 Additional Purchases. The Shareholder agrees that any shares of capital
stock of Oneida that the Shareholder purchases or with respect to which the
Shareholder otherwise acquires the power to vote, or to direct the voting
("New Shares"), after the execution of this Agreement and prior to the
Expiration Date (as defined below) shall be subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement to the same extent as if they constituted Shares.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

2. Representations and Warranties of the Shareholder. The Shareholder (i) has the legal power and authority to vote, or to direct the voting of, the Shares, which at the date hereof are (except to the extent set forth in a schedule delivered herewith) free and clear of any liens, options, security interests or other similar encumbrances; (ii) does not possess the right to vote, or to direct the voting of, as the date hereof, any shares of capital stock of Oneida other than the Shares; and (iii) has full power and authority to make, enter into and carry out the terms of this Agreement.

  


 

  

3. Proxy. The Shareholder hereby covenants and agrees to execute and deliver a proxy to be tendered at every meeting of Oneida shareholders called with respect to the approval of the Merger Agreement and/or the Merger, in the reasonable opinion of CBSI, to carry out the purpose of this Agreement.

  


 

  

4. Termination. This Agreement shall terminate and shall have no further force or effect as of the earlier to occur of (i) such date and time as the Merger shall become effective in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement, or (ii) such date and time as the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to Article VII thereof (the "Expiration Date").

  


 

  

5. Fiduciary Duties. If the Shareholder is a Director of Oneida, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent the Shareholder from exercising his/her fiduciary obligations as a Director of Oneida in the event of a Superior Proposal as set forth in the Merger Agreement, provided that the Shareholder, in his/her capacity as a shareholder of Oneida, shall remain obligated to comply with Shareholder's obligations in this Agreement.

  


 

  

6. Miscellaneous.

  


 

  

6.1 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or
unenforceable, then the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.

  


 

  

6.2 Binding Effect and Assignment. This Agreement and all of the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns, but, except as
otherwise specifically provided herein, neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations of the parties hereto may be assigned by any
of the parties without prior written consent of the other parties.

  


 

  

6.3 Amendments and Modification. This Agreement may not be modified, amended,
altered or supplemented except upon the execution and delivery of a written
agreement executed by the parties hereto.

  


 

  

6.4 Specific Performance; Injunctive Relief. The parties hereto acknowledge
that CBSI will be irreparably harmed and that there will be no adequate remedy
at law for a violation of any of the covenants or agreements of the
Shareholder set forth herein. Therefore, it is agreed that, in addition to any
other remedies that may be available to CBSI upon any such violation, CBSI
shall have the right to enforce such covenants and agreements by specific
performance, injunctive relief or by any other means available to CBSI at law
or in equity.
