**STOCK  PURCHASE AGREEMENT**

 

 

This  STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT, dated as of March 21, 2006 (this "
_Agreement_ "),  is  entered into by and among Electrical Components
International Holdings Company,  a Delaware corporation (" _Purchaser_ "), 
Viasystems Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "),  Wire 
Harness Holding Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect 
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Seller_ "),  and  Wire Harness
Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly-owned 
subsidiary of Seller (the " _Company_ ").

 

 

W  I T N E  S S E T H:

 

 

WHEREAS,  Seller owns directly 1,000 shares (the " _Shares_ ")  of  common
stock, par value $0.01 per share (" _Common  Stock_ "),  of  the Company,
which constitute all of the issued and outstanding shares of  capital stock
of the Company, and Parent owns indirectly all of the issued  and 
outstanding shares of capital stock of Seller;

 

 

WHEREAS,  Seller desires to sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser desires to
purchase from  Seller, the Shares for the purchase price and upon the terms
and conditions  hereinafter set forth;

 

 

WHEREAS,  Parent desires that the aforesaid sale be consummated on the terms
and  conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in connection therewith
Parent  acknowledges that its non-competition covenant to Purchaser, as
provided for  in  _Section 8.18_,  is an  essential element of the
aforesaid sale and but for the agreement of Parent  to  comply with such
covenant Purchaser would not have entered into this Agreement;  and

 

 

WHEREAS,  as a material inducement to Purchaser to enter into this Agreement,
David  Webster shall enter into an Employment Agreement in the form attached
as  _Exhibit  A_   hereto,  such agreement to be effective immediately
prior to the Closing.

States funds into an account or accounts designated by Seller not less than 
three (3) days prior to the Closing Date.

 

 

(b) _Adjustment  of Preliminary Purchase Price_.  The  Preliminary Purchase
Price shall be subject to adjustment as provided in this  _Section  3.1(b)_.

 

 

(i) _Determination  of Estimated Purchase Price_.  As of  the close of
business on the fifth (5th) Business Day immediately preceding  the  Closing
Date, Seller will deliver to Purchaser a statement (the " _Estimated 
Statement_ ")  setting forth:

 

 

(A) Seller's  reasonable good faith estimate of (1) the current assets of the
Company and  the Subsidiaries, including cash and cash equivalents, minus (2)
the  current liabilities of the Company, in each case, (x) calculated as of
the  Closing Date and after giving effect to the Restructuring and reflecting
an  accrual for bonuses payable to Continuing Employees for the allocable
portion  of  2006 fiscal year under Parent's Annual Incentive Compensation
Plan and the  Senior Executive MBO Plan **** and  (y)  prepared in
accordance with the accounting principles and methodologies employed  by
Seller in preparing the Balance Sheet and those set forth on _Schedule 
3.1(b)_   consistently applied (such amount generally, " _Working  Capital_
," and  such amount estimated as of the Closing Date, the " _Estimated 
Working Capital_ ");  _provided_   that  solely for the purpose of
calculating the Estimated Working Capital, cash and  cash equivalents shall
be reflected as $1,000,000, irrespective of the actual  Closing Date estimate
thereof; and

 

 

(B) the  calculation of the Estimated Purchase Price (as defined below).

 

 

The  Estimated Statement shall be signed by Seller's Chief Financial Officer
and  accompanied by reasonable supporting documentation. Purchaser shall have
the  right to review the Estimated Statement and such supporting
documentation or  data of Seller and the Company as Purchaser may reasonably
request. In the  event  that Purchaser does not agree with Seller's
estimate, Seller and Purchaser shall  negotiate in good faith to mutually
agree on an acceptable estimate of the  Estimated Working Capital, and Seller
shall consider in good faith any proposed  comments or changes that Purchaser
may reasonably suggest; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  Seller's failure
to include in the Estimated Statement any changes proposed by  Purchaser, or
the acceptance by Purchaser of the Estimated Statement, shall  not  limit or
otherwise affect Purchaser's remedies under this Agreement, including 
Purchaser's right to include such changes or other changes in the Closing
Date  Statement, or constitute an acknowledgment by Purchaser of the accuracy
of  the  Estimated Statement.

 

 

" _Estimated  Purchase Price_ " means  the sum of (x) the Preliminary
Purchase Price and (y) the Estimated Working  Capital _minus_   the  Target
Working Capital Amount; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  if:

 

 

(1) the  Estimated Purchase Price results in an increase in the Preliminary
Purchase  Price by more than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (the "
_Collar  Amount_ "),  the  Preliminary Purchase Price shall be adjusted
upward only by the amount by which  the amount of such increase exceeds the
Collar Amount (such amount, a " _Positive  Estimate Adjustment Amount_ ");

 

 

(2) the  Estimated Purchase Price does not result in an increase or decrease
in the  Preliminary Purchase Price by more than the Collar Amount, the
Estimated  Purchase Price shall be equal to the Preliminary Purchase Price;
or

 

 

(3) the  Estimated Purchase Price results in a decrease in the Preliminary
Purchase  Price  by more than the Collar Amount, the Preliminary Purchase
Price shall be adjusted  downward by the amount of such decrease exceeds the
Collar Amount (such amount,  a " _Negative  Estimate Adjustment Amount_ ").

 

 

(ii) _Closing  Date Statement_.  No  later than sixty (60) calendar days
after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall  prepare and deliver to Seller a
statement of the actual Working Capital as  of  the Closing Date (such
amount, the " _Closing  Date Working Capital_ " and  such statement, the "
_Closing  Date Statement_ "),  which  Closing Date Statement shall be
prepared in accordance with the accounting  principles and methodologies
employed by Seller in preparing the Balance Sheet  and those set forth on
_Schedule  3.1(b)_   consistently applied. The Closing Date Statement shall
be signed by Purchaser's  Chief Financial Officer and accompanied by
reasonable supporting documentation.  Seller shall and shall cause its
accountants to cooperate with Purchaser and  its  accountants to the extent
required to enable Purchaser to prepare the Closing  Date Statement in
accordance with this Agreement.

 

 

(iii) _Disputes_.

 

 

(A) Subject  to clause (B) of this _Section  3.1(b)(iii)_ ,  the  Closing
Date Statement delivered by Purchaser to Seller shall be deemed to  be  and
shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto.

 

 

(B) Seller  may dispute any amounts reflected on the Closing Date Statement,
but only on  the  basis that the amounts reflected on the Closing Date
Statement were not arrived  at in accordance with the accounting principles
and methodologies employed  by  Seller in preparing the Balance Sheet and
those set forth on _Schedule  3.1(b)_   consistently applied; ****_provided_
,  _however_ ,  that  Seller shall be deemed to have agreed to each item or
amount set forth in the  Closing Date Statement (and waived any right to
dispute the same) unless Seller  has notified Purchaser in writing of each
disputed item, specifying the amount  thereof in dispute and setting forth,
in reasonable detail, the basis for such  dispute, within thirty (30)
calendar days after Purchaser's delivery of the  Closing Date Statement to
Seller. In the event of such a dispute, Seller and  Purchaser shall attempt
to reconcile their differences, and any resolution  by  them as to any
disputed amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive on the  parties
hereto; provided that, such amounts shall not be less than the amounts  shown
in Purchaser's calculation delivered pursuant to _Section  3.1(b)(ii)_   nor
more  than the amounts shown in Seller's calculation delivered pursuant to
this  _Section  3.1(b)(iii)(B)_.  If  Seller and Purchaser are unable to
reach a resolution with such effect within  thirty (30) calendar days after
receipt by Purchaser of Seller's written notice  of dispute, Seller and
Purchaser shall submit the items remaining in dispute  for  resolution to an
independent accounting firm of international reputation  mutually acceptable
to Purchaser and Seller (such other accounting firm being  referred to herein
as the " _Independent  Accounting Firm_ "),  which  shall, within forty
five (45) calendar days after such submission, determine  and  report to
Purchaser and Seller upon such remaining disputed items, and such  report
shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto. The fees  and
disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be allocated between 
Seller and Purchaser in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of
such  remaining disputed items so submitted to the Independent Accounting
Firm that  is  unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as finally
determined by the  Independent Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of
such remaining  disputed items so submitted.

 

 

(C) In  acting  under this Agreement, Purchaser's accountants, Seller's
accountants and the  Independent Accounting Firm shall be entitled to the
privileges and immunities  of arbitrators.

 

 

(iv) _Final  Closing Date Statement_.  The  Closing Date Statement shall be
deemed final for the purposes of this  _Section  3.1(b)_   upon the 
earliest of (A) the failure of Seller to notify Purchaser of a dispute 
within thirty (30) calendar days of Purchaser's delivery of the Closing Date 
Statement to Seller, (B) the resolution of all disputes, pursuant to 
_Section  3.1(b)(iii)(B)_ ,  by  Purchaser and Seller and (C) the
resolution of all disputes, pursuant to  _Section  3.1(b)(iii)(B)_ ,  by
the  Independent Accounting Firm.

 

 

(v) _Purchase  Price Adjustment_.  Within  three (3) Business Days after
the Closing Date Statement being deemed final,  the  Estimated Purchase
Price shall be increased or decreased, if at all, as  follows:

 

 

(A) if  the  Preliminary Purchase Price was increased by a Positive Estimate
Adjustment  Amount and (1) the Closing Net Amount (as defined below) results
in a Positive  Closing Adjustment Amount (as defined below), then the
Estimated Purchase Price  shall be increased or decreased by the difference
between the Positive Estimate  Adjustment Amount and the Positive Closing
Adjustment Amount, (2) the Closing  Net Amount results in no adjustment, then
the Estimated Purchase Price shall  be  decreased by the Positive Estimate
Adjustment Amount or (3) the Closing Net  Amount results in a Negative
Closing Adjustment Amount, the Estimated Purchase  Price shall be decreased
by the sum of (a) the Positive Estimate Adjustment  Amount and (b) the
Negative Closing Adjustment Amount (expressed as positive  number);

 

 

(B) if  the  Preliminary Purchase Price was not increased by a Positive
Estimate Adjustment  Amount or decreased by a Negative Estimate Adjustment
Amount and (1) the Closing  Net Amount results in a Positive Closing
Adjustment Amount, then the Estimated  Purchase Price shall be increased by
such Positive Closing Adjustment Amount,  (2) the Closing Net Amount results
in no adjustment, then the Estimated Purchase  Price shall not be adjusted or
(3) the Closing Net Amount results in a Negative  Closing Adjustment Amount,
the Estimated Purchase Price shall be decreased  by  such Negative Closing
Adjustment Amount; or

 

 

(C) if  the  Preliminary Purchase Price was decreased by a Negative Estimate
Adjustment  Amount and (1) the Closing Net Amount results in a Positive
Closing Adjustment  Amount, the Estimated Purchase Price shall be increased
by the sum of (a) such  Positive Closing Adjustment Amount and (b) the
Negative Estimate Adjustment  Amount (expressed as positive number), (2) the
Closing Net Amount results in  no  adjustment, then the Estimated Purchase
Price shall be increased by the Negative  Estimate Adjustment Amount or (3)
the Closing Net Amount results in a Negative  Closing Adjustment Amount, then
the Estimated Purchase Price shall be increased  or decreased by the
difference between the Negative Estimate Adjustment Amount  and the Negative
Closing Adjustment Amount.

 

 

" _Closing  Net Amount_ " means  the net amount of the difference between
the Closing Date Working Capital  reflected in the Closing Date Statement and
the Target Working Capital Amount.  The amount, if any, by which the Closing
Net Amount (if positive) exceeds the  Collar Amount is referred to herein as
the " _Positive  Closing Adjustment Amount_ " and  the  amount, if any, by
which the Closing Net Amount (if negative, expressed as  a  positive number)
exceeds the Collar Amount is referred to herein as the " _Negative  Closing
Adjustment Amount_." The  Closing Net Amount will be deemed to result in "no
adjustment" if the Closing  Net Amount (expressed as a positive number) is
less than the Collar  Amount.

 

 

(vi) _Payment_.  If the  amount of any adjustment pursuant to clause (v)
above results in an increase  in  the Estimated Purchase Price, then
Purchaser shall, within three (3) Business  Days after the Closing Date
Statement being deemed final, pay to Seller the  amount of such increase by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to  the  account specified by
Seller. If the amount of any adjustment pursuant to clause  (v) above results
in a decrease in the Estimated Purchase Price, then Seller  shall, within
three (3) Business Days after the Closing Date Statement being  deemed final,
pay to Purchaser the amount of such decrease by wire transfer  of 
immediately available funds to the account specified by Purchaser. Any
payment  amount shall bear interest thereon from the Closing Date to the date
of payment  at the rate equal to one percent (1%) above the prime rate of
JPMorgan Chase  Bank, N.A. on the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt,
application of  the  foregoing adjustments is intended to put each party in
the economic position  it  would have been in if the Estimated Purchase
Price (taking into account the  Collar Amount and all cash and cash
equivalents) had exactly equaled the Closing  Date Working Capital. The
Preliminary Purchase Price as so adjusted by this  _Section  3.1(b)_ , 
is  referred to herein as the " _Purchase  Price_."

assurance regarding the  reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements  (including the Financial Statements) in
accordance with GAAP and _Schedule  6.5(a)(ii)_ ,  including policies and
procedures that (i) require the maintenance of  records that in reasonable
detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions  and dispositions of
the assets of the Wire Harness Business, (ii) provide  assurance that

accounts receivable of the Company  and the Subsidiaries existing on the
Closing Date will have arisen from, the  sale of inventory or services
rendered in the Ordinary Course of Business to  Persons not Affiliated with
Parent, Seller, the Company or the Subsidiaries.  All  such  accounts
receivable are carried on the Financial Statements at values, net  of 
allowance for doubtful accounts, determined in accordance with GAAP

Sheet  Date,  as  reflected on the books and records of the Company (which
are prepared in  accordance with GAAP consistently applied and the reserve
practices and  methodology used in preparation of the Balance Sheet), and
none of such accounts  receivable is, or at the Closing Date will be, subject
to any counterclaim  or  set-off, except for counterclaims or set-offs in
the Ordinary Course of  Business.

income and other material  Tax  Returns and reports required to be filed by
them, and all material Taxes and  estimated payments of Tax required to be
paid by them have either been paid  by  them or are reflected in accordance
with GAAP as a reserve for Taxes on the  most  recent Financial Statements,
and all such returns and reports are correct and  complete in all material

Taxes which the Company or any Subsidiary are required by Law to  withhold or
to collect for payment have been duly withheld and collected, and  have been

Subsidiary has any  liability for Taxes of another Person under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6  (or any comparable provision of state, local or

any other Person  as  a result of any indemnification provision or other
contractual obligation.  No  consent to the application of Section 341(f)(2)
of the Code (or any similar  state or local law provision) has been made or
filed by or with respect to  the  Company or any Subsidiary. No power of

relating to Taxes is currently is force. No  closing agreement pursuant to
Section 7121 of the Code or similar provision  of  any state, local or
foreign law has been entered into by or with respect to  the  Company or any
Subsidiary which could reasonably be expected to have an effect  on the
Company's or Subsidiary's liability for or reporting of Taxes in any  period

Return,  taken any position, made any election, or adopted any method that
is  inconsistent with positions taken, elections made or methods used in
preparing  or filing similar Tax Returns in prior periods (including, without
limitation,  positions, elections or methods which would have the effect of
deferring income  to periods after the Closing Date or accelerating
deductions to periods on  or  prior to the Closing Date) unless required by
Law which could reasonably be  expected to have an effect on the Company's or
Subsidiary's liability for or  reporting of Taxes in any period ending after
the Closing Date. None of the  assets or properties of the Company or any
Subsidiary is an asset or property  that is or will be required to be treated
as being (A) owned by any Person  (other than such Company or Subsidiary)

of 1954, as amended and in effect  immediately before the enactment of the
Tax Reform Act of 1986, or (B) tax  exempt use property within the meaning of

leases and  occupancy arrangements to be entered into pursuant to _Section 
8.15_ ,  constitute all material interests in real property currently used or
currently  held for use in connection with the business of the Company and
the Subsidiaries  as currently conducted. There does not exist any actual or,
to the Knowledge  of  Seller, threatened or contemplated condemnation or
eminent domain proceedings  that affect the Real Property Leases or any part
thereof, and Seller has not  received any written notice of the intention of
any Governmental Body or other  Person to take or use all or any part
thereof. Each of the Owned Properties  and  real property subject to any
Real Property Lease, and all buildings, fixtures  and improvements thereon,
are adequate in all material respects for their  intended use in the
operation of the Wire Harness Business as currently  conducted.

 

 

(c) The  zoning and land use regulation of each parcel of Owned Property and
Real  Property Lease permits the presently existing improvements located

Owned Property and Real Property  Lease is in compliance with applicable
state law and local subdivision  ordinances.

 

 

(d) There  are  no contracts or options to sell the Owned Property or any
portion of the Owned  Property which are presently in effect. Neither the
Company nor any of its  Subsidiaries have entered into any leases with
respect to the Owned Property  or  subleases of the Real Property Leases.

 

 

6.10 _Tangible  Personal Property_.  Except  as set forth on _Schedule
6.10_,  the  Company or the Subsidiaries, as applicable, have good and
marketable title  to  each of the items of tangible personal property
reflected in the Balance Sheet  (except as sold or disposed of subsequent to
the date thereof in the Ordinary  Course of Business consistent with past
practice), free and clear of any and  all  Liens other than the Permitted
Exceptions. All of such tangible personal  property is usable in the Ordinary
Course of Business and is suitable for the  uses for which they are used to
carry on the Wire Harness Business as now  conducted.

 

 

6.11 _Intellectual  Property_.

 

 

(a) Except  as  set forth on _Schedule  6.11(a)_ ,  the  Company or one
of the Subsidiaries owns, or has a valid exclusive license to  use, all
Company IP, free of all Liens (except for Permitted Exceptions). The  Company
or the Subsidiaries own or have valid licenses to use all Intellectual 
Property necessary for the conduct of the Wire Harness Business as currently 
conducted. _Schedule  6.11(a)_   sets  forth a list (as of the date of this
Agreement) of all U.S. and foreign Patents,  Marks and Copyrights registered
by or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary  with any Governmental Body,
including Internet domain name registrars  (" _Registered  IP_ ").  Except
as set forth on _Schedule  6.11(a)_ ,  all  Registered IP are subsisting
and valid, and all necessary registration,  maintenance and other filing fees
due through the date hereof in connection  with  Registered IP have been
timely paid and all necessary documents in connection  with Registered IP
have been timely filed with the relevant authorities in  the  U.S. or
foreign jurisdictions, as the case may be, for the purposes of  maintaining
Registered IP.

 

 

(b) The  Intellectual Property used by the Company and the Subsidiaries is
not the  subject of any challenge received by the Company or the Subsidiaries
in writing.  Neither the Company nor the Subsidiaries have received any
written notice of  any  default or any event that with notice or lapse of
time, or both, would  constitute a default under any Intellectual Property
license to which the  Company or the Subsidiaries are a party or by which any
of them are  bound.

 

 

(c) To  the  Knowledge of Seller, the current business practices of the
Company and the  Subsidiaries and the use of the Intellectual Property used
in the operation  of  the Wire Harness Business as currently conducted do
not infringe, violate or  constitute an unauthorized use or misappropriation
of any Intellectual Property  right of any Person and none of the Seller, the
Company or any Subsidiary has  received written notice of any claim by any
Person alleging any of the  foregoing.

 

 

(d) None  of  the Seller, the Company or any Subsidiary has brought in the
four (4) years  prior to the date hereof any actions or lawsuits alleging
infringement or  misappropriation of any of the Company IP, and, to the
Knowledge of the Seller,  no Person is infringing or misappropriating any of
the Company IP.

 

 

(e) No  present or former employee of Seller, the Company or the Subsidiaries
has any  right, title, or interest, directly or indirectly, in whole or in
part, in  any  Intellectual Property owned or used by the Company or the 
Subsidiaries.

 

 

(f) Each  of  the Company and the Subsidiaries has taken all reasonable

with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, would  be  deemed a "single
employer" within the meaning of Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o)  of the Code.

 

 

(i) Except  as  set forth in _Schedule  6.13(i)_ ,  no  Employee Benefit
Plan provides death or medical benefits, whether or not  insured, with
respect to any former or current employee, or any spouse or  dependent of any

employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries other than  coverage
mandated by Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or Section 4980B of the  Code.

 

 

(j) Except  as  set forth on _Schedule  6.13(j)_ ,  each  Employee
Benefit Plan that is maintained outside the jurisdiction of the United 
States, or covers any employee residing or working outside the United States 
(any such Employee Benefit Plan, a " _Foreign  Benefit Plan_ ")  and  that

Harness Business as presently  conducted. Neither the Company nor the
Subsidiaries are in default or violation  (and no event has occurred which,
with notice or the lapse of time or both,  would constitute a default or
violation) of any term, condition or provision  of  any Permit to which it

authority to execute and deliver this  Agreement and each other Transaction

this Agreement and the Transaction Documents  to  which Purchaser is a party
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated  hereby and thereby

legal, valid  and  binding obligation of Purchaser, enforceable against
Purchaser in accordance  with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization,  moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors'
rights and remedies generally,  and subject, as to enforceability, to general
principles of equity, including  principles of commercial reasonableness,
good faith and fair dealing (regardless  of whether enforcement is sought in
a proceeding at law or in  equity).

 

 

7.3 _Conflicts;  Consents of Third Parties_.

 

 

(a) None  of  the execution and delivery by Purchaser of this Agreement or
the Transaction  Documents to which Purchaser is a party, the consummation of
the transactions  contemplated hereby or thereby, or compliance by Purchaser
with any of the  provisions hereof or thereof will conflict with, or result
in any violation  of  or default (with or without notice or lapse of time,
or both) under, or give  rise to a right of termination or cancellation
under, any provision of  (i) the certificate of incorporation or by-laws or
other comparable  organizational documents of Purchaser; (ii) any Contract or
Permit to which  Purchaser is a party or by which any of the properties or
assets of Purchaser  are bound; (iii) any Order of any Governmental Body
applicable to Purchaser  or  by which any of the properties or assets of

would not have a material adverse effect  on  Purchaser's ability to

equity commitment letter, dated March 21, 2006, executed by Francisco 
Partners, L.P. with respect to the equity investment to be made in Purchaser 
in  order to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Equity 
Commitment_ ").  The  amount of the Financing, together with the amount of

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each such 
party  shall promptly inform the other parties hereto of any oral

All HSR Act and similar foreign filing fees shall  be  borne equally by
Purchaser and Seller.

 

 

(b) Each  of  Purchaser and Seller shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve  such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Body with  respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under the HSR Act  or  other Antitrust Laws. In connection
therewith, if any Legal Proceeding is  instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) challenging any transaction  contemplated by this Agreement as in
violation of any Antitrust Law, each of  Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate
and use its commercially reasonable efforts  to contest and resist any such
Legal Proceeding, and to have vacated, lifted,  reversed, or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order whether  temporary, preliminary
or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,  prevents, or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement, including
by pursuing all available avenues of administrative and  judicial appeal and
all available legislative action, unless, by mutual  agreement, Purchaser and
Seller decide that litigation is not in their  respective best interests.
Each of Purchaser and Seller shall use its  commercially reasonable efforts
to take such action as may be required to cause  the expiration of the notice
periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws  with respect to such
transactions as promptly as possible after the execution  of  this
Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  neither Purchaser nor Seller
shall be required to (i) hold separate (by trust  or  otherwise) or divest
any of their respective businesses or assets, (ii) agree  to  any limitation
on the operation or conduct of their respective businesses or  (iii) waive
any of the conditions set forth in _Article  IX_   of this  Agreement.

 

 

8.5 _Further  Assurances_.  Subject  to the terms of this Agreement, each
of Purchaser and Seller shall use its  commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
take all actions necessary or appropriate  to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) cause  the  fulfillment at the
earliest practicable date of all of the conditions to their  respective
obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement.

 

 

8.6 _Confidentiality_. 

 

 

(a) Purchaser  acknowledges that the information provided to it in connection
with this  Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby is subject to
the terms  of  the confidentiality agreement between Purchaser and Parent,
dated July 13,  2005  (the " _Confidentiality  Agreement_ "),  the  terms
of which are incorporated herein by reference; _provided_ ,  that  Purchaser
and its Representatives shall be permitted to disclose information  as 
necessary and consistent with customary practices in connection with the 
Financing. Effective upon, and only upon, the consummation of the Closing, 
the  Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate.

 

 

(b) Parent  and Seller recognize that by reason of their ownership of the
Company and the  Wire Harness Business, they and their respective
subsidiaries have acquired  confidential information and trade secrets
concerning the Company and the Wire  Harness Business the use or disclosure
of which could cause Purchaser or its  subsidiaries substantial loss and
damages that could not be readily calculated  and for which no remedy at law
would be adequate. Accordingly, Parent and Seller  covenant and agree with
Purchaser that neither Parent nor Seller nor any of  their respective
subsidiaries will at any time, except in performance of their  respective
obligations to Purchaser or with the prior written consent of  Purchaser,
directly or indirectly, disclose any proprietary, secret or  confidential
information relating to the Company and the Wire Harness Business  that any
such Person may learn or has learned by reason of its ownership of  the 
Company and the Wire Harness Business, unless (i) such information becomes 
known to the public generally through no fault of Parent, Seller or any of 
their  respective subsidiaries, (ii) disclosure is required by applicable
Law, or  (iii) such information was not previously known to Parent, Seller or
any of  their respective subsidiaries but becomes rightfully known to Parent,
Seller  or  such subsidiary after Closing, without restriction, from a
source (other than  Purchaser and its subsidiaries) not related to Seller's
prior ownership of the  Company and the Wire Harness Business and without any
breach of duty to  Purchaser or its subsidiaries. The parties hereto agree
that the covenant  contained in this _Section  8.6(b)_   imposes  a
reasonable restraint on Parent and Seller and their respective subsidiaries 
and employees.

 

 

8.7 _Indemnification,  Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

 

(a) From  and  after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the
Company and the  Subsidiaries to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent  permitted under applicable Law, the individuals who on or
prior to the Closing  Date were directors, officers or employees of the
Company or the Subsidiaries  (collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ")  with 
respect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such or
taken  at  the request of the Company or the Subsidiaries at any time prior
to the Closing  Date. Purchaser agrees that all rights of the Indemnitees to
indemnification  and  exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions by
them in their capacities  as such or taken at the request of the Company or
the Subsidiaries occurring  at  or prior to the Closing Date as provided in
the constituent documents of the  Company or the Subsidiaries as now in
effect and any indemnification agreements  or arrangements of any of them
shall survive the Closing Date and shall continue  in full force and effect
in accordance with their terms. Such rights shall  not  be amended or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect  the  rights of
the Indemnitees, unless such modification is required by Law. In  addition,
Purchaser shall pay any expenses of any Indemnitee incurred in  investigating
or defending any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit,  or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, arbitrative, or 
investigative, any appeal in such an action, suit, or proceeding, and any 
inquiry or investigation that could lead to such an action, suit, or
proceeding,  relating to acts or omissions by such Indemnitee in his or her
capacity as  an  officer or director of the Company or the Subsidiaries or
taken at the request  of any of them, as applicable, at any time prior to the
Closing Date, and all  other expenses of any Indemnitee under this _Section 
8.7_ ,  as  incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law;
_provided_ ,  that  the individual to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay  such advances to the extent required by applicable Law.
Notwithstanding the  foregoing, the foregoing rights shall not apply to the
extent any Indemnitee  is  the beneficiary of any insurance policy with
respect to such matters or is  subject to indemnification pursuant to the
constituent documents of Parent  or  Seller or any agreement between any
Indemnitee and Parent or  Seller.

 

 

(b) The  provisions of this _Section  8.7_ :  (i) are  intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee,  his or her
heirs and his or her representatives; and (ii) are in addition to,  and not
in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution 
that any such person may have by Contract or otherwise.

 

 

(c) In  the  event that Purchaser, the Company, the Subsidiaries or any of
their respective  successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person  and  is not the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation  or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its  properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper  provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Purchaser, the  Company or the Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall
assume all of the obligations  thereof set forth in this _Section 8.7_.

 

 

(d) The  obligations of Purchaser under this _Section  8.7_   shall  not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any 
Indemnitee to whom this _Section  8.7_   applies  without the consent of
the affected Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that  the Indemnitees to
whom this _Section  8.7_   applies  shall be third party beneficiaries of
this _Section  8.7_ ).

 

 

8.8 _Preservation  of Records_.  Parent,  Seller and Purchaser agree that
each of them shall preserve and keep the records  held by them relating to
the business of the Company and the Subsidiaries for  a  period of seven (7)
years from the Closing Date and shall make such records  and  personnel
available to the other as may be reasonably required by such party  in 
connection with, among other things, any insurance claims by or Legal 
Proceedings against or governmental investigations of Seller or Purchaser or 
any  of their Affiliates or in order to enable Seller or Purchaser to comply
with  their respective obligations under this Agreement and each other
agreement,  document or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby; _provided_
,  _however_ ,  that  nothing herein shall be deemed to alter _Section 
8.12(c)_ ,  which  shall govern the preservation of records with regard to
Taxes. In the event  Seller or Purchaser wishes to destroy such records after
that time, such party  shall first give ninety (90) days prior written notice
to the other party and  such other party shall have the right at its option
and expense, upon prior  written notice given to such party within that
ninety (90) day period, to take  possession of the records within one hundred
eighty (180) days after the date  of  such notice.

 

 

8.9 _Publicity_.

 

 

(a) Parent,  Seller, the Company and Purchaser shall not, and Seller shall
cause the Company  and the Subsidiaries not to, issue any press release or
public announcement  concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without  obtaining the prior written approval of the
other party hereto, which approval  will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, unless, in the judgment of Seller  or Purchaser, disclosure is
otherwise required by applicable Law; _provided_ ,  that,  to the extent
required by applicable Law, the party intending to make such  release shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with applicable  Law to
consult with the other party with respect to the text  thereof.

 

 

(b) Each  of  Seller and Purchaser agree that the terms of this Agreement
shall not be  disclosed or otherwise made available to the public and that
copies of this  Agreement shall not be publicly filed or otherwise made
available to the public,  except where such disclosure, availability or
filing is required by applicable  Law and only to the extent required by such
Law.

 

 

8.10 _Employee  Benefits_.

 

 

(a) For  purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not benefit accrual) under
the employee  benefit plans of Purchaser providing benefits to Continuing
Employees (the  " _Purchaser  Plans_ "),  Purchaser shall credit each
Continuing Employee with his or her years of service  with the Company or the
Subsidiaries, as applicable, and any predecessor  entities, to the same
extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled  immediately prior to the
Closing to credit for such service under any similar  Employee Benefit Plan.
The Purchaser Plans shall not deny Continuing Employees  coverage on the
basis of pre-existing conditions and shall credit such  Continuing Employees
for any deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid in  the  year of initial
participation in the Purchaser Plans.

 

 

(b) Parent  acknowledges and agrees that (i) it shall be responsible for and
shall pay  (or shall cause Viasystems to pay) at the Closing all transaction
bonuses that  become payable to employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries
in connection  with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, including
without  limitation, in the amounts and to the individuals set forth on
_Schedule 8.10(b)_  and  (ii) it shall continue to be responsible for any
and all obligations  existing as of the Closing Date to provide retiree
health, life insurance and  other welfare benefits to any former employees of
the Company or any Subsidiary  and their dependents. Parent shall have paid
all bonuses payable to the  Continuing Employees in respect of fiscal 2005
under the terms of Parent's  Annual Incentive Compensation Plan and Senior
Executive MBO Plan on or prior  to  Closing. Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that it shall (x) be responsible  for and shall pay bonuses payable to
Continuing Employees for the 2006 fiscal  year under Parent's Annual
Incentive Compensation Plan and the Senior Executive  MBO Plan, to the extent
such bonuses are reflected in Closing Date Working  Capital, and (y) agrees
that it shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent  and its Affiliates (other
than the Company and the Subsidiaries) for any Losses  resulting from claims
with respect to such bonuses by any Continuing Employee  to  the extent such
bonuses are reflected in Closing Date Working  Capital.

 

 

(c) Except  as  required by applicable Law, as of the Closing Date the
Continuing Employees  shall cease to accrue further benefits under the
employee benefit plans and  arrangements maintained by Parent, Seller and
their respective Affiliates other  than the Company or any Subsidiary (the "
_Parent  Plans_ ");  _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  Parent shall take
such actions as may be necessary to, effective immediately  prior to the
Closing Date, cause (i) all Continuing Employees who are employed  in the
United States to be fully vested in any unvested portion of their account 
balances under the Viasystems Retirement Savings Plan. From and after the 
Closing Date, Parent will retain all obligations and liabilities under the 
Parent Plans, and neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates will have any 
obligation or liability with respect thereto, except that Purchaser shall
assume  as of the Closing Date the Parent Plans set forth on _Schedule
8.10(c)_.  Except  as expressly set forth on such schedule, Purchaser will
not assume sponsorship  or any liability with respect to any of the Parent
Plans or any part thereof,  and no Parent Plan and no assets of any Parent
Plan will be transferred to  Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or to any
plan of Purchaser or any of its  Affiliates. On the Closing Date, Continuing
Employees with account balances  in  Parent's 401(k) Plan shall be entitled
to receive a lump sum distribution of  such vested balances and, if requested
by any such employee, Purchaser's or the  Company's 401(k) plan shall accept
a direct rollover contribution of such  account balances pursuant to Code
Section 401(a)(31).

 

 

(d) Prior  to  the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause the Company and
the Subsidiaries  to,  establish stand-alone welfare plans for the domestic
employees of the Company  and the Subsidiaries. Such welfare plans shall be
in form and substance  reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser.

 

 

8.11 _Transition  Services_.  Promptly after the date hereof, the parties
shall negotiate a master transition  services agreement (which may, to the
extent required by Law or more convenient  for administrative purposes have
appended thereto separate agreements for a  particular jurisdiction
consistent with this _Section  8.11_ ).  The  principles governing such
transition services agreement shall be as  follows:

 

 

(a) Parent  and it subsidiaries (other than the Company and the Subsidiaries)
shall provide  to Purchaser those services listed on _Schedule  8.11_  
hereto  or otherwise provided to the Company and/or its Subsidiaries on or
prior to  the  date hereof or otherwise reasonably requested by Purchaser in
order to allow  for  the operation of the Company and its Subsidiaries in
the Ordinary Course of  Business;

 

 

(b) Purchaser,  the Company and the Subsidiaries shall provide to Parent and
its subsidiaries  (other than the Company and the Subsidiaries) those
services listed on  _Schedule  8.11_   hereto  or otherwise provided to
the Seller and/or its subsidiaries on or prior to  the  date hereof or
otherwise reasonably requested by Parent in order to allow for  the operation
of Parent and it subsidiaries (other than the Company and the  Subsidiaries)
in the Ordinary Course of Business;

 

 

(c) All  services referred to in clause (a) and (b) are referred to as the "
_Services_." All  Services to be provided by a party shall be provided at
its direct unburdened  costs and not in excess of per hour or per unit costs
previously charged or  on a  pass-through basis with no mark-up (in the case
of third party providers),  it  being understood for certain services a flat
fee per period, usage or other  fee  may be appropriate;

 

 

(d) Services  shall be made available for a minimum of six (6) months, with
the ability of  a  party to extend such Service for a period not to exceed
twelve (12) months  from  Closing. The general principle will be for each
party to migrate away from  utilizing a particular Service as soon as
reasonably practicable and  commercially reasonable;

 

 

(e) The  receiving party shall be permitted to terminate any one or more of
the Services  upon thirty (30) days prior notice of its intention to
terminate such Services,  and such termination of such Services shall not in
and of itself, terminate  the  master transition services agreement;

 

 

(f) The  provider of Services may terminate the master transition services
agreement  with  respect to any one or more of the Services by written
notice to the recipient  in  the event that (i) the recipient shall have
failed to perform, in all material  respects, any of its material obligations
under such agreement relating to  the  Services, (ii) the provider has
notified the recipient in writing of such  failure and (iii) such failure
shall have continued for a period of thirty  (30)  days after receipt of by
recipient of notice of such failure. Generally invoices  shall be issued
monthly and be due and payable within thirty (30) days after  receipt
thereof; and

 

 

(g) Any  dispute arising under the master transition services agreement will
be resolved  by arbitration on an expedited basis and the obligations of the
parties  thereunder will not terminate prior to issuance of a final ruling in
such  arbitration.

(a) _Tax  Indemnity_

 

 

Parent  and Seller shall be jointly and severally liable for and pay, and
shall  indemnify Purchaser (and the Company and each Subsidiary) against (A)

or any  Subsidiary may otherwise be liable, as a result of having been a
member of  a  Company Group for any period prior to or including the Closing
Date (including,  without limitation, Taxes for which the Company or any
Subsidiary may be liable  pursuant to Treas. Reg. § 1.1502-6 or similar
provisions of state, local or  foreign law as a result of having been a
member of a Company Group for any  period prior to or including the Closing
Date), (B) all other Taxes imposed  on  the Company or any Subsidiary, or
for which the Company or any Subsidiary may  otherwise be liable, for any
taxable period ending on or before the Closing  Date, it being understood for
the avoidance of doubt that such Taxes for a  taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date shall include Tax for any  such period resulting from
the Section 338(h)(10) Election to be made with  respect to the sale of the
Shares pursuant hereto, (C) all Taxes imposed on  the  Company or any
Subsidiary, or for which the Company or any Subsidiary may  otherwise be

therefor under _Section  8.12(b)(iv)_ ,  and (D)  Losses arising as a
result of any breach of a representation or warranty of  Parent or Seller
under _Section  6.8(b)_ ;  _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  Parent and
Seller's liability and indemnity obligation in respect of any Tax  described
in clauses (A), (B), (C) and (D) of this _Section  8.12(a)_   shall be 
limited to the amount of such Taxes, in the aggregate, in excess of the Tax

with past practice unless  otherwise required by applicable Tax Laws, and
pay, or cause the Company or  the  Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to pay,
any and all Taxes shown due on such  Tax Returns.

Date_.  Seller  shall prepare, in a manner consistent with prior practice
unless otherwise  required by applicable Tax Laws, all foreign, state and
local Tax Returns  required to be filed by the Company and the Subsidiaries
on a separate return  basis after the Closing Date (" _Separate  Pre-Closing
Tax Returns_ ")  with  respect to taxable periods (excluding partial taxable
periods) that, to the  extent they relate to the Company and the
Subsidiaries, end on or before the  Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing 
Taxable Period_ ").  In  the case of any such Separate Pre-Closing Tax
Return that would reasonably  be  expected to have an adverse effect greater
than or equal to the Tax Threshold  on  any of the Company or the
Subsidiaries for a taxable period after the Closing  Date (the " _Post-
Closing  Taxable Period_ "),  Purchaser shall have the right to review and
approve such return and agree  to  the computation of such Taxes (which
approval may not be unreasonably withheld  or delayed) and no such Tax Return
may be amended (including any amendment  or  settlement required as a result
of or in connection with examination  adjustments) by Purchaser, the Company,
the Subsidiaries, or Seller without  the  prior written consent of Seller
and Purchaser. Each Separate Pre-Closing Tax  Return shall be filed timely by
the Company or the Subsidiaries, and the Company  or the Subsidiaries shall
pay the Tax shown due thereon. On or prior to the  due  date for payment of
Taxes with respect to any such Separate Pre-Closing Tax  Return, or, in the
event of a dispute, upon resolution thereof, Seller shall  pay  to the
Company or the Subsidiaries the amount of such Tax shown due, but only  to 
the extent in excess of the amount accrued for such Tax in the Tax  Reserve.

 

 

(iii) _Tax  Returns for Post-Closing Taxable Periods (other than Straddle 
Periods)_.  Purchaser shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and
filed, all Tax  Returns of or which include the Company or the Subsidiaries
and which are  required to be filed after the Closing Date with respect to a
Post-Closing  Taxable Period, but excluding any Straddle Period, and shall
pay or cause to  be  paid the amount of Tax shown due with respect to any
such Tax  Return.

 

 

(iv) _Tax  Returns Required to be Filed After the Closing Date for Straddle 
Periods_.  Seller  and Purchaser shall, unless prohibited by applicable Tax
Law, take or cause  to  be taken all action necessary or appropriate to
close the taxable period of  the  Company and the Subsidiaries as of the
Closing Date. None of Seller, Purchaser,  the Company or the Subsidiaries
shall take any position inconsistent with the  preceding sentence on any Tax
Return. In any case in which applicable Law does  not permit the Company or
the Subsidiaries to close its taxable year on the  Closing Date or in any
case in which a Tax is assessed with respect to a taxable  period that, to
the extent it relates to the Company or the Subsidiaries,  includes, but does
not begin or end on, the Closing Date (the " _Straddle  Period_ "),  then 
Taxes, if any, of the Company or its Subsidiary, as the case may be, 
attributable to such Straddle Period shall be allocated (A) to Seller for
the  period up to and including the Closing Date, but only to the extent in
excess  of  the amount accrued for such Taxes in the Tax Reserve, and (B)
the remainder  to  Purchaser. Any allocation of income, deductions, credits
(including Taxes paid,  on an estimated basis or otherwise) or carry-forwards
required to determine  any  Taxes attributable to any Straddle Period shall
be made by means of a closing  of  the books and records of the Company and
the Subsidiaries as of the Closing  Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that 
exemptions, charges, allowances or deductions calculated on an annual basis 
(including depreciation and amortization deductions) and any credits
(excluding  Taxes paid on an estimated basis or otherwise) arising during the
Straddle  Period shall be allocated between the period ending on the Closing
Date and  the  period after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of
days in each such  period.

 

 

In  addition, Purchaser shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and
filed,  all Tax Returns of or which include the Company or the Subsidiaries
for all  Straddle Periods, and in each such case shall pay any and all Taxes
due with  respect to such Tax Returns. To the extent any Taxes shown due on
such Tax  Returns are allocable to and payable by Seller under the preceding
paragraph,  such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
prior practice  unless otherwise required by applicable Tax Laws, Seller
shall have the right  to  review and approve such Tax Returns and agree to
the computation of Taxes  allocable to Seller (which approval may not be
unreasonably withheld or  delayed), Purchaser shall not file any such Tax
Return without Seller's written  consent (which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) and  Purchaser shall not amend any such Tax
Return (including any amendment or  settlement required as a result of or in
connection with examination  adjustments) without the prior written consent
of Seller (which consent may  not  be unreasonably withheld or delayed). On
or prior to the due date for payment  of  Taxes with respect to any such Tax
Returns, or, in the event of a dispute,  which  shall be settled in
accordance with _Section  8.12(g)_   hereof,  upon a final resolution
thereof, Seller shall pay to the Company or the  Subsidiaries the amount of
Taxes shown due on such Tax Return allocable to  and  otherwise payable by
Seller under the preceding paragraph.

 

 

(c) _Cooperation  with Respect to Tax Returns_.  Purchaser and Seller agree
to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other,  and each at its own
expense, as promptly as practicable, such information  (including access to
books and records) and assistance, including making  employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional  information and explanations
of any material provided, relating to the Company  or the Subsidiaries, as
the case may be, as is reasonably necessary for the  filing of any Tax
Return, for the preparation for any audit, and for the  prosecution or
defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any  adjustment or
proposed adjustment with respect to Taxes. Purchaser, the Company  or the
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall retain in its possession, and  shall
provide Seller reasonable access to (including the right to make copies  of),
such supporting books and records and any other materials that Seller  may 
specify with respect to Tax matters relating to any Pre-Closing Taxable
Period  or any Straddle Period until the relevant statute of limitations (or
extension  thereof) has expired. In the event Purchaser, the Company or the
Subsidiaries,  as the case may be, wishes to destroy such records after that
time, Purchaser  shall (and Purchaser shall cause the Company or the
Subsidiaries to) first  give  ninety (90) days' prior written notice to
Seller and Seller shall have the right  at its option and expense, upon prior
written notice given to Purchaser within  such ninety (90) day period, to
take possession of the records within one  hundred and eighty (180) days
after the date such notice is given to  Purchaser.

 

 

(d) _Tax  Authority_.

 

 

(i) If  any  Governmental Body or any quasi-governmental or private body
having jurisdiction  over the assessment, determination, collection or
imposition of any Tax  (" _Tax  Authority_ ")  asserts a claim, makes an
assessment or otherwise disputes or affects the Tax  reporting position of
any of the Company or the Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing  Taxable Period or a
Straddle Period or otherwise with respect to any Taxes  for  which Seller
may be responsible hereunder, Purchaser shall, promptly upon  receipt by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Company and the 
Subsidiaries) of notice thereof, notify Seller thereof.

 

 

(ii) In  the  case of any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding
relating to a  Pre-Closing Taxable Period of the Company or the Subsidiaries,
as the case  may  be, Seller shall have the sole right to represent the
interests of the Company  and the Subsidiaries, and to employ counsel of
Seller's choice at Seller's  expense to carry out such representation, and
the Company and the Subsidiaries  shall (and Purchaser shall cause the
Company and the Subsidiaries to) execute  and deliver to Seller any power of
attorney or other document reasonably  requested by Seller in connection with
the representation by Seller of the  interests of the Company or the
Subsidiaries in any proceeding described in  this  _Section  8.12(d)(ii)_
  for  which Seller would be responsible; provided, that Seller shall not
enter into  any settlement, closing agreement, or compromise of any dispute,
which would  reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect greater than or
equal to the  Tax Threshold on the Company or the Subsidiaries for a Post-
Closing Taxable  Period, without Purchaser's approval (which shall not be
unreasonably delayed or  withheld).

 

 

(iii) Purchaser  shall have the right to represent the interests of the
Company and the  Subsidiaries in any Tax audit or administrative or court
proceeding relating  exclusively to a Post-Closing Taxable Period (excluding
any Straddle Period)  of  the Company or the Subsidiaries, as the case may
be; provided, that Purchaser  shall not enter into any settlement, closing
agreement, or compromise of any  dispute, which would reasonably be expected
to have an adverse effect greater  than or equal to the Tax Threshold on
Seller or any of the Company or the  Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Taxable
Period or a Straddle Period, without  Seller's approval (which shall not be
unreasonably delayed or  withheld).

 

 

(iv) In  the  case of any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding
relating to a  Straddle Period of the Company or the Subsidiaries, as the
case may be, Seller  and Purchaser shall jointly represent the interests of
the Company and the  Subsidiaries; provided, however, that neither party can
enter into a settlement,  resolution, or closing or other agreement with
respect thereto (including any  waiver or extension of a statute of
limitations) without the other party's  consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or  delayed.

 

 

(e) _Amended  Returns; Refund Claims_.

 

 

(i) Seller  shall have the sole right to prepare and file or cause to be
prepared and filed  any amended Tax Return or claim for refund with respect
to Taxes of the Company  or the Subsidiaries, as the case may be, for any
Pre-Closing Taxable Period,  and  Purchaser shall, and shall cause the
Company or the Subsidiaries, as the case  may be, to execute such documents
(including a power of attorney) and take  such  actions in connection with
such filing as Seller shall reasonably request;  provided, however, that
Purchaser shall have the right to review and approve  any  such amended Tax
Return or claim for refund (which approval may not be  unreasonably withheld
or delayed) if such amended Tax Return or claim for refund  would reasonably
be expected to have an adverse effect greater than or equal  to  the Tax
Threshold on any of the Company or the Subsidiaries for a Post-Closing 
Taxable Period.

 

 

(ii) Seller  and Purchaser shall have joint rights to prepare and file or
cause to be  prepared and filed any amended Tax Return or claim for refund
with respect  to  Taxes of the Company or the Subsidiaries, as the case may
be, for a Straddle  Period; provided, however, that neither party shall file
or cause to be filed  such amended Tax Return or claim for refund without the
other party's consent,  which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or  delayed.

 

 

(iii) To  the  extent any determination of Tax liability of the Company or
the Subsidiaries,  as  the case may be, whether as the result of an audit or
examination, a claim  for  refund, the filing of an amended Tax Return or
otherwise, results in any refund  (except for any refund attributable to a
carry-back permitted under _Section  8.12(e)(iv)_   hereof,  which refunds
shall be for the account of and payable to Purchaser) of Taxes  paid (or a
credit against Taxes payable) (A) attributable to any  Pre-Closing Taxable
Period, (B) attributable to the portion of a Straddle Period  ending on the
Closing Date (determined using the principles of _Section  8.12(b)(iv)_ ) 
or (C)  which are otherwise the responsibility or allocable to Seller
hereunder,  Purchaser shall pay (or cause to be paid) any such refund (or the
amount of  such  credit), and the interest actually received thereon, to
Seller promptly upon  (but not later than ten (10) days after) receipt (or,
in the cause of a credit,  realization) thereof. To the extent any
determination of Tax liability of the  Company or the Subsidiaries, as the
case may be, as the result of an audit  or  examination, results in
additional Taxes due (A) attributable to any Pre-Closing  Taxable Period, (B)
attributable to the portion of a Straddle Period ending  on  the Closing
Date (determined using the principles of _Section 8.12(b)(iv)_)  or (C) 
which are otherwise the responsibility or allocable to Seller hereunder,
Seller  shall pay any such deficiency to Purchaser, but only to the extent in
excess  of  the amount accrued in the Tax Reserve, and reduced by any Tax
benefit actually  (and not potentially) realized by Purchaser or any of the
Company or the  Subsidiaries in respect of any adjustment made pursuant to
such audit or  examination.

 

 

(iv) In  respect of the U.S. consolidated federal income tax return filed by
the group  in  which Seller is a member, Purchaser shall cause the Company
and the Subsidiaries  to forgo any carry-back to a Pre-Closing Taxable Period
of any item of deduction  or credit incurred by the Company or the
Subsidiaries, as the case may be,  after  the Closing Date. In respect of
any other Tax Return, the carry-back to a  Pre-Closing Taxable Period of any
item of deduction or credit incurred by the  Company or the Subsidiaries, as
the case may be, after the Closing Date shall  be  subject to the prior
written consent of Seller, which consent may not be  unreasonably withheld.

 

 

(f) _Transfer  Taxes_.  Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller and its
Affiliates, on the other hand,  shall share equally all sales, use, stamp,
documentary, real property transfer,  real property gains, registration,
value added filing, recording, transfer  or  other similar fees or Taxes or
governmental charges, if any (" _Transfer  Tax_ ").  The  party responsible
under the applicable Transfer Tax Law for paying a Transfer  Tax (the "
_Transfer  Tax Party_ ")  shall  make due and timely payment of the
Transfer Tax to the applicable Tax Authority,  provided that the other party
pays the Transfer Tax Party, no later than two  Business Days prior to the
date such Transfer Tax is due, such other party's 50%  share of such Transfer
Tax. The Transfer Tax Party will provide the other party  a true copy of each
such Tax Return as filed and evidence of the timely filing  thereof.

 

 

(g) _Dispute  Procedures_.  Any  dispute as to any matter covered by this
_Section 8.12_  shall be  resolved by a mutually acceptable independent
nationally recognized accounting  firm. The parties will instruct the
accounting firm to reach its conclusion  regarding any such dispute within
twenty (20) days after its appointment. The  report of the accounting firm
shall be final, conclusive and binding on the  parties. The fees and expenses
of such accounting firm shall be borne equally  by  the parties hereto.

 

 

8.13 _338(h)(10)  Election_.

 

 

(a) Seller  shall join with Purchaser in making an election under Section
338(h)(10) of  the  Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder
and any corresponding  or similar elections under state, local or foreign Tax
Law (collectively, the  " _Section 338(h)(10)  Election_")  with  respect
to the purchase and sale of stock of the Company and the  Subsidiaries.

 

 

(b) Purchaser  shall be responsible, at its sole cost and expense, for the
preparation and  filing of all forms and documents required to effectuate
the  Section 338(h)(10) Election. In addition to the Internal Revenue
Service  Form 8023, Seller shall execute (or cause to be executed) and
deliver to  Purchaser such additional documents or forms as are reasonably
requested to  complete properly the Section 338(h)(10) Election at least
thirty (30) days  prior to the date such Section 338(h)(10) Election is
required to be filed.  All  forms will be agreed to by the parties prior to
the filing thereof.

 

 

(c) Purchaser  and Seller shall file all Tax Returns and statements, forms
and schedules in  connection therewith in a manner consistent with the
Section 338(h)(10)  Election and shall take no position contrary thereto
unless required to do  so by  applicable Tax Laws.

 

 

(d) _Schedule  8.13(d)_ ,  in  accordance with Section 338 of the Code and
the Treasury regulations promulgated  thereunder, sets forth a preliminary
allocation of the Purchase Price and any  other items that are treated as
additional Purchase Price for Tax purposes  among  the different items of
assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries (the " _Preliminary  Allocation
Statement_ ").  Promptly following the Closing, Seller and Purchaser agree to
adjust the  Preliminary Allocation Statement in accordance with the
principles set forth  on  _Schedule 8.13(d)_  as may  be necessary as a
result of the determination of Closing Date Working Capital  (the "
_Closing  Date Allocation Statement_ ").  Seller shall, and Purchaser shall
cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to,  allocate such Purchase Price in
accordance with the Closing Date Allocation  Statement in reporting the
deemed asset sales as a result of the Section  338(h)(10) Election, and all
Tax Returns and reports filed by Seller, the  Company and the Subsidiaries
shall be prepared consistently with such Closing  Date Allocation Statement.

 

 

8.14 _Financing_.

 

 

(a) Purchaser  shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and
effectuate the  Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter on the terms
set forth therein.  Purchaser agrees to notify Seller as soon as reasonably
practicable if, at  any  time prior to the Closing Date, (i) the Commitment
Letter shall expire or  be terminated for any reason, (ii) any financing
source that is a party to  the  Commitment Letter notifies Purchaser that
such source no longer intends to  provide financing to Purchaser or (iii) for
any reason Purchaser no longer  believes in good faith that it will be able
to obtain any of the Financing  substantially on the terms described in the
Commitment Letter. Purchaser shall  not, nor shall it permit any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, without  the  prior written consent of
Seller, take any action or enter into any transaction,  including, without
limitation, any merger, acquisition, joint venture,  disposition, lease,
contract or debt or equity financing that would reasonably  be expected to
impair, delay or prevent the Financing contemplated by the  Commitment
Letter. Purchaser shall not amend or alter, or agree to amend or  alter, the
Commitment Letter in any manner that would impair, delay or prevent  the
purchase of the Shares without the prior written consent of  Seller.

 

 

(b) If  the  Commitment Letter shall expire or terminate for any reason,
Purchaser shall  use  its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, and
will provide Seller with  a  copy of, a new financing commitment that
provides for at least the same amount  of financing as the Commitment Letter
as originally issued, funding conditions  no less favorable than those
included in the Commitment Letter as originally  issued and other terms and
conditions the aggregate effect of which is not  materially adverse to
Purchaser in comparison with those contained in the  Commitment Letter as
originally issued, which extension or new commitment shall  include a
termination date not earlier than the Outside Date. Any new financing 
commitment shall be made by some or all of the lenders that are parties to 
the  Commitment Letter as originally issued or another bona fide lender or
lenders  acceptable to Seller. Purchaser shall accept any such commitment
letter if  the  funding conditions and other terms and conditions contained
therein are not  materially adverse to Purchaser in comparison with those
contained in the  Commitment Letter as originally issued.

 

 

8.15 _Restructuring  Transactions_.  Prior  to the Closing, Parent, Seller,
the Company and the Subsidiaries shall have  completed each of the
restructuring transactions set forth on _Schedule  8.15_.  Any  costs and
expenses incurred by the Company or the Subsidiaries in connection  with
effecting the Restructuring, including any such amounts which are payable  to
consultants, attorneys, accountants or other Representatives retained by 
the  Company or any of the Subsidiaries (or any of their respective
Affiliates)  or to  any filing service or Governmental Body in connection
with the Restructuring,  shall be paid by Seller. Prior to the Closing,
Parent shall additionally cause  all capital stock of Electro Componentes de

Wirekraft Industries LLC, a Delaware  limited liability company and indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, to  be  transferred and conveyed to the
Company.

 

 

8.16 _Use  of  Name_.  Purchaser agrees that it shall cause the Company and
the Subsidiaries to  (i) as soon as practicable after the Closing Date and in
any event within  ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, cease to make
any use of the name  "Viasystems" or any other service marks, domain names,
trademarks, trade names,  identifying symbols, logos, emblems, signs or
insignia related thereto or  containing or comprising the foregoing,
including any name or mark confusingly  similar thereto (collectively, the "
_Seller  Marks_ "),  (ii)  immediately after the Closing, cease to hold
itself out as having any  affiliation with any Parent or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Company  or  the Subsidiaries) and (iii)

whose name includes the name "Viasystems", change its  corporate name to a
name that does not include the name "Viasystems" and make  any necessary
legal filings with the appropriate Governmental Body to effect  such change.
In furtherance thereof, as promptly as practicable but in no event  later
than ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause  the
Company and the Subsidiaries to remove, strike over or otherwise obliterate 
all Seller Marks from all materials owned by the Company or any Subsidiary, 
including, without limitation, any vehicles, business cards, schedules, 
stationery, packaging materials, displays, signs, promotional materials, 
manuals, forms, computer software and other materials. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, the Company and the Subsidiaries shall be entitled to use and
sell  in  the Ordinary Course of Business all inventory, packaging
materials, product  literature, brochures and promotional materials existing
on the Closing Date  until all such inventory, packaging materials, product
literature, brochures  and  promotional materials are used, sold or
otherwise disposed of. Parent agrees  that it shall, and shall cause its
subsidiaries (not including the Company  or  any Subsidiary) to, as soon as
practicable after the Closing Date and in any  event within ninety (90) days
following the Closing Date, remove the names  of  the Company and all
Subsidiaries and all references to the Wire Harness Business  from Parent's
and its subsidiaries' websites and other corporate  materials.

 

 

8.17 _Termination  of Intercompany Obligations_.  Except  as set forth on
_Schedule  8.17_ ,  on or  prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall cause to
be terminated and cancelled  all  intercompany accounts payable (i) from
Parent or its subsidiaries (other than  the Company and the Subsidiaries) to
the Company and the Subsidiaries and (ii)  from the Company and the
Subsidiaries to Parent and its subsidiaries (other  than  the Company and
the Subsidiaries). Except as expressly set forth in this  Agreement, on or
prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall cause to be terminated  and cancelled
all indemnity obligations from the Company or any Subsidiary  to  Parent or
its subsidiaries (other than the Company and the  Subsidiaries).

 

 

8.18 _Non-Competition_.

 

 

(a) In  consideration of Purchaser entering into this Agreement and in order
that  Purchaser may enjoy the full benefit of the Wire Harness Business, for
a period  of three (3) years from and after the Closing Date (the "
_Noncompetition  Period_ "),  neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries
shall, directly or indirectly,  whether as principal, agent, partner,
officer, director, stockholder, employee,  consultant or otherwise, alone or
in association with any other Person, own,  manage, operate, control,
participate in, invest in (other than an investment  that results in such
Person owning less than 2% of the outstanding voting stock  of a publicly
traded company), or carry on a business which, directly or  indirectly, is in
competition with the Company or its Subsidiaries in the  (i) provision of
white goods assembly services (excluding metal  fabrication), (ii)
manufacture, assembly and marketing of wire harnesses or  cable for sale as a
stand alone product offering, or (iii) manufacture, assembly  and marketing

subsidiaries to (w) manufacture, assemble and market printed circuit boards 
and printed circuit board assemblies, (x) manufacture, assemble and market 
wire  harnesses (including sub-components) for use in electro-mechanical
manufacturing  solution assembly services provided by the Parent or its

to customers in the telecom,  computer/data, medical and industrial
instrumentation industries, and shall  in  no event be sold to customers in
any other industries, including the white  goods, automotive, aerospace, or
defense industries.

 

 

(b) Parent  acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at law for any breach, or
threatened  breach, of any of the provisions of this _Section  8.18_   will
be  inadequate and, accordingly, Parent covenants and agrees that Purchaser
shall,  in addition to any other rights and remedies which Purchaser may have
at Law,  be  entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief, and
to the remedy  of  specific performance with respect to any breach or
threatened breach of such  covenant, as may be available from any court of
competent jurisdiction. In  addition, Parent and Purchaser agree that the
terms of the covenant in this  _Section  8.18_   are fair  and reasonable
in light of Purchaser's plans for the Wire Harness Business and  are
necessary to accomplish the full transfer of the goodwill and other 
intangible assets contemplated hereby. In the event that any of the
covenants  contained in this _Section  8.18_   shall be  determined by any
court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable for any  reason
whatsoever, then any such provision or provisions shall not be deemed  void,
and the parties hereto agree that said limits may be modified by the  court 
and that said covenant contained in this _Section  8.18_   shall be 
amended in accordance with said modification, it being specifically agreed 
by  the parties that it is their continuing desire that this covenant be
enforced  to  the full extent of its terms and conditions or if a court
finds the scope of  the  covenant unenforceable, the court should redefine
the covenant so as to comply  with applicable Law.

 

 

8.19 _Non-Solicitation_.

 

 

(a) For  two  (2) years after the Closing Date, Parent shall not, and shall
cause its  subsidiaries (other than the Company and the Subsidiaries) not to,
whether  for  their own account or for the account of any Person, solicit,
offer employment  to  or hire any individual that is employed by the Company
or the Subsidiaries  on  the Closing Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , 
that  Parent and its subsidiaries (other than the Company or the

to conduct searches  that are not targeted or focused on the Company and
the  Subsidiaries.

 

 

(b) For  two  (2) years after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not, and

Parent or its  subsidiaries (other than the Company and the Subsidiaries) on

prohibited from initiating searches for employees through the use of  general
advertisement or through the engagement of firms to conduct searches  that

Closing, all insurance coverage  provided in relation to the Companies and

Company or the Subsidiaries) and including any  captive policies or fronting
arrangements) shall cease and no further coverage  shall be available to the
Company or the Subsidiaries as an Affiliate under  any  such policies or
programs that are "claims made" based policies but (subject to  the terms of
any relevant policy, program or arrangement) without prejudice  to  any
accrued claims which the Company or the Subsidiaries or Parent or an 
Affiliate (in the latter case in relation to the Company or the
Subsidiaries)  may have at or prior to the Closing. The Company and the
Subsidiaries shall  retain the benefit of "occurrence" based policies,
programs and arrangements in  relation to events occurring prior to Closing
in respect of all claims for  which  they may have coverage thereunder; it
being understood and agreed that the  retention by the Company and the
Subsidiaries of the benefit of such "occurrence" based policies of insurance
shall, to the extent such coverage also  exists with respect to Parent or any
of its current or former Affiliates (other  than the Company or the
Subsidiaries), be without prejudice to the rights of  Parent or such other
current or former Affiliates (other than the Company or  the  Subsidiaries)
to continue to retain the benefit of such "occurrence" based  policies of
insurance at and after the Closing Date as such policies, programs  and
arrangements were in effect on the date prior to the Closing  Date.

 

 

(b) Purchaser  and Parent agree that any claims made under the insurance
policies referred  to  in _Section  8.21(a)_   in  respect of the Company
or the Subsidiaries and as to which coverage remains  available after Closing
shall be administered and collected by Parent (or by  a  claims handler
appointed by Parent) on behalf of Purchaser, the Company and  the 
Subsidiaries. Purchaser shall cooperate fully with Parent to enable Parent 
to  comply with the requirements of the relevant insurer, and Purchaser
shall  provide such information and assistance as Parent may reasonably
request in  connection with any such claim. Any monies received by Parent as
a result of  such claims shall be paid over to Purchaser, net of all
reasonable costs and  expenses of recovery (including, without limitation,
all reasonable handling  and  collection charges by any claims handler
appointed by Parent). Any claims made  under the insurance policies referred
to in _Section 8.21(a)_  in  respect of the Company or the Subsidiaries
relating to incidents arising before  the Closing Date shall be notified to
the relevant insurer before the Closing  Date.

 

 

(c) Without  limiting Purchaser's rights under _Article  X_ ,  in  respect
of all claims under the insurance policies referred to in _Section  8.21(a)_
  notified  to insurers at the Closing Date and all claims subsequently
brought under such  insurance policies and relating to the Company and the
Subsidiaries, Purchaser  acknowledges that it shall be responsible for the
deductible on each relevant  insurance policy to the extent the deductible
for any such claims are payable  after the Closing Date and will not be
entitled to seek reimbursement of such  deductible from Parent. Purchaser
shall reimburse Parent within twenty (20)  Business Days after receipt of the
invoice for any deductible paid by Parent  (including evidence of such
payment) after the Closing Date with respect to  claims made under the
insurance policies referred to in _Section  8.21(a)_   to the  extent such
deductible has been paid by Parent or any Affiliate or, if Purchaser  is
invoiced directly by the insurance company for such deductible amount, it 
shall pay or cause such invoice to be paid within twenty (20) Business  Days.

will (a) solicit, initiate, encourage or accept any other  proposals or
offers from any Person (other than Purchaser) (i) relating to  any
acquisition or purchase of all or any portion of the Company or the Wire 
Harness Business, (ii) to enter into any business combination or other 
extraordinary business transaction, except as would not have a Material
Adverse  Effect or as would not materially impair or delay the ability of
Parent, Seller  and the Company to perform their respective obligations under
this Agreement,  or  (iii) release any Person from, or waive any provision
of, any  confidentiality agreement that relates to the Company or the Wire
Harness  Business, or (b) participate in any discussions, conversations, 
negotiations or other communications regarding, or furnish to any other
Person  (other than Purchaser) any information with respect to, or otherwise
cooperate  in any way, assist or participate in, facilitate or encourage any
effort or  attempt by any other Person to seek to do any of the foregoing.

terminated all existing  discussions, conversations, negotiations and other
communications with any  Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any of
the foregoing. Parent,  Seller and the Company shall notify Purchaser
promptly if any such proposal  or  offer, or any inquiry or other contact
with any Person with respect thereto,  is  made and shall, in any such
notice to Purchaser, indicate in reasonable detail  the identity of the

dissolution or liquidation, then  in each case proper provision shall be made
so that the continuing or surviving  corporation or entity (or its successors

assume all of Parent's or Seller's obligations under  this Agreement,

sought. The failure  of any party entitled to indemnification hereunder to
give reasonably prompt  notice thereof shall not release, waive or otherwise
affect the indemnifying  party's obligations with respect thereto except to
the extent that the  indemnifying party can demonstrate actual loss and
prejudice as a result of  such  failure.

 

 

(b) In  the  event that any Legal Proceedings shall be instituted or that
any claim or demand  shall be asserted by any third Person (other than such
Legal Proceedings, claim  or demand with respect to Taxes, which shall be
governed by the provisions  of  _Section  8.12_ )  (a " _Third  Party
Claim_ ")  in  respect of which payment may be sought under _Section  10.1_
  hereof  (regardless of the Deductible or the Cap referred to above), the
indemnified  party shall reasonably and promptly cause written notice of the
assertion of  any  Third Party Claim of which it has knowledge which is
covered by this indemnity  to be forwarded to the indemnifying party. The
failure of the indemnified party  to give reasonably prompt notice of any
Third Party Claim shall not release,  waive or otherwise affect the
indemnifying party's obligations with respect  thereto except to the extent
that the indemnifying party can demonstrate actual  loss and prejudice as a
result of such failure. The indemnifying party shall  have the right, at its
sole option and expense, to be represented by counsel  of  its choice, which
must be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party,  and  to defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party  Claim
which relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder. If the 
indemnifying party elects to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise 
deal  with any Third Party Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified
against  hereunder, it shall within thirty (30) days after its receipt of
notice of  a  Third Party Claim from the indemnified party (or sooner, if
the nature of the  Third Party Claim so requires) notify the indemnified
party of its intent to  do  so. If the indemnifying party elects not to
defend against, negotiate, settle  or  otherwise deal with any Third Party
Claim which relates to any Losses  indemnified against hereunder, the
indemnified party may defend against,  negotiate or otherwise deal with such
Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the indemnified party
shall not be permitted to settle such Third Party Claim  without the prior
written consent of the indemnifying party (which shall not  be  unreasonably
withheld). If the indemnified party defends any Third Party Claim,  then the
indemnifying party shall reimburse the indemnified party for the  reasonable
and documented Expenses of defending such Third Party Claim upon  submission
of periodic bills. If the indemnifying party shall assume the defense  of any
Third Party Claim, the indemnified party may participate, at his or  its 
own expense, in the defense of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , 
_however_ ,  that  such indemnified party shall be entitled to participate
in any such defense  with  separate counsel at the expense of the
indemnifying party if (i) so requested  by  the indemnifying party to
participate or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of  counsel to the indemnified
party, a conflict or potential conflict exists  between the indemnified party
and the indemnifying party that would make such  separate representation
advisable; and _provided_ ,  _further_ ,  that  the indemnifying party
shall not be required to pay for more than one such  counsel for all
indemnified parties in connection with any Third Party Claim.  The parties
hereto agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection with  the
defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Third Party  Claim.

 

 

(c) After  any  final judgment or award shall have been rendered by a court,
arbitration board  or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction and the
expiration of the  time in which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall
have been consummated,  or the indemnified party and the indemnifying party
shall have arrived at a  mutually binding agreement with respect to a Third
Party Claim hereunder (any  such final judgment, settlement or agreement, a "
_Final  Determination_ "),  the  indemnified party shall forward to the
indemnifying party notice of any sums  due  and owing by the indemnifying
party pursuant to this Agreement with respect  to  such matter.

 

 

(d) (i)Notwithstanding  paragraphs (b) and (c) above, if a Third Party Claim
involves a claim (A)  seeking injunctive relief with respect to the operation
of the business of  the  Company and its Subsidiaries, (B) seeking to impose
criminal (other than  misdemeanors) fines, penalties or sanctions or (C) by a
current material  customer of the Company and the Subsidiaries (each such
Third Party Claim,  an " _Excluded  Claim_ "),  then  the indemnified
party shall, upon written notice to the indemnifying party  at  the time
notice of such Excluded Claim is first given to the indemnifying party,  have
the right to elect to either (x) assume the defense of such Excluded Claim, 
in which case, such Excluded Claim shall be subject to clause (ii) below, or 
(y)  submit such Excluded Claim to the indemnifying party pursuant to
paragraph  (b)  above, in which case the procedures in paragraph (b) above
shall apply to such  Excluded Claim.

 

 

(ii)  If  an indemnified party elects to assume the defense of an Excluded
Claim, such  indemnified party shall, at its own expense, be permitted to
defend against,  negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Excluded Claim
and shall not  be  obligated to seek the indemnifying party's consent to any
settlement. The  indemnifying party shall be permitted, at its own expense,
to participate in  the  defense of such Excluded Claim. Upon a Final
Determination, the indemnified  party shall be permitted to proceed directly
against the indemnifying party  for  the amount of Losses incurred by reason
of such Excluded Claim pursuant to  paragraph (a) above; _provided_ , 
_however_ ,  that it  is acknowledged and agreed by the parties hereto that
the issue of the  indemnifying party's liability for such Excluded Claim and
the amount of any  applicable Losses shall be addressed _de  novo_   and
the  indemnifying party shall not be prejudiced by any Final Determination
with  respect to such Excluded Claim.

 

 

10.4 _Sole  Remedy._   The  parties hereto agree that their respective
remedies under _Article  X_   of this  Agreement are their exclusive
remedies under this Agreement from and after  the  Closing Date, including
without limitation, any matter based on the inaccuracy,  untruth,
incompleteness or breach of any representation or warranty of any  party 
hereto contained herein or based on the failure of any covenant, agreement 
or  undertaking herein, and the parties hereto hereby waive any claims with
respect  to any other right of contribution or indemnity available against
any  indemnifying party hereunder in such capacity on the basis of common
law,  statute or otherwise beyond the express terms of this Agreement;
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  this exclusive remedy for damages does not
preclude a party from bringing an  action for fraud. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this _Section  10.4_   shall  not operate to interfere with or
impede the operation of the provisions of  (i)  _Section  8.12_  
providing for the resolution of certain disputes with respect to Tax matters 
and  indemnification for any such matters, (ii) _Section  8.18_   with 
respect to Parent's or Purchaser's right to seek equitable remedies
(including  specific performance or injunctive relief) or (iii) the Contracts
to be entered  into at Closing set forth on _Schedule  8.15_.

 

 

10.5 _Limitation  on Losses_.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the liability for  indemnification of any indemnifying party under
this Agreement shall not exceed  the actual damages of the party entitled to
indemnification and shall not  otherwise include incidental, consequential,
indirect, special, punitive,  exemplary or other similar damages, other than
compensatory  damages.

 

 

10.6 _Adjustments  for Insurance and Tax Benefits_.  Any  indemnification
payable in accordance with this _Article  X_   shall be  net of any (i)
amounts actually recovered (after deducting related costs and  expenses) by
the indemnified party for the Losses for which such indemnification  payment
is made under any insurance policy, warranty or indemnity from any  Person
other than a party hereto and (ii) Tax benefits actually (and not 
potentially) realized by the indemnified party in respect of any Losses for 
which such indemnification payment is made.

 

 

10.7 _Tax  Treatment of Indemnity Payments._   Seller  and Purchaser agree
to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this  _Article  X_   as
an  adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal, state, local and foreign
income  Tax purposes.

action. Each of the parties  hereto agrees that a judgment in any such action
may be enforced in other  jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by  Law.

only by written  instrument making specific reference to this Agreement
signed by the party  against whom enforcement of any such amendment,
supplement, modification or  waiver is sought. No action or nonaction taken
pursuant to this Agreement,  including without limitation, any investigation
by or on behalf of any party,  shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the
party taking such action or  nonaction of compliance with any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement  contained herein. The waiver by any party
hereto of a breach of any provision  of  this Agreement shall not operate or
be construed as a further or continuing  waiver of such breach or as a waiver

exercise, and no delay in exercising, any  right, power or remedy hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall  any single or partial exercise
of such right, power or remedy by such party  preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other  right, power or remedy.

in accordance with the laws of  the  State of New York applicable to

11.7 _Severability_.  If any  term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable  of  being enforced by any law or public
policy, all other terms or provisions of  this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as  the  economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not  affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination  that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being  enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this  Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as  possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated  hereby are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent  possible.

 

 

11.8 _Binding  Effect; Assignment_.  This  Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties and  their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement  shall create or be deemed to
create any third party beneficiary rights in any  Person not a party to this
Agreement except as contemplated by _Section  8.7_.  No  assignment of this
Agreement or of any rights or obligations hereunder may  be  made by Seller
or Purchaser, directly or indirectly (by operation of law or  otherwise),
without the prior written consent of the other party hereto and  any 
attempted assignment without the required consents shall be void. No
assignment  of any obligations hereunder shall relieve the parties hereto of
any such  obligations; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  Purchaser may
assign its rights and interests without Parent's, Seller's or the  Company's
consent (i) to any of its Affiliates or (ii) for collateral  security
purposes, to any lender providing the Financing to Purchaser or any  of  its
Affiliates; _provided_ ,  _further_ ,  _however_ ,  in each  case of
clauses (i) and (ii), any such assignment shall not relieve Purchaser  of 
its obligations hereunder.

 

 

11.9 _Counterparts_.  This  Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which will be  deemed to be an original copy of this
Agreement and all of which, when taken  together, will be deemed to
constitute one and the same agreement.

 

 

11.10 _Guarantee_.  Parent  hereby unconditionally, irrevocably and
absolutely guarantees to Purchaser  the  due and punctual performance and
discharge of all of Seller's and the Company's  pre-closing obligations under
this Agreement existing on the date hereof or  hereafter of any kind or
nature whatsoever, including, without limitation,  the  due and punctual
payment of any amount that Seller is or may become obligated  to  pay
pursuant to this Agreement. The guarantee under this _Section  11.10_   is
a  guarantee of timely payment and performance and not merely of 
collection.

 

 

11.11 _Non-Recourse_.  No  past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member,  partner, stockholder or subsidiary of Parent
(other than Seller, the Company  and  the Subsidiaries) or Seller (other
than Parent, the Company and the  Subsidiaries) shall have any liability for
any obligations or liabilities of  Parent, Seller or the Company under this
Agreement of or for any claim based  upon, in respect of, or by reason of,
the transactions contemplated  hereby.

 

 

11.12 _Further  Assurances_.  Each  party covenants that at any time, and

instruments and take such actions as may be  reasonably requested by the
other parties to confirm or perfect or otherwise  to  carry out the intent
and purposes of this Agreement.
