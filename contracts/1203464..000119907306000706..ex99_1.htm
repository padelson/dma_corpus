Subject  to the terms hereof, commencing at the Effective Time, and as more
fully  set  forth in the Arrangement By-Law:

 

 

         |  

2.1.1

    |  

the  Target Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time  held
by  each holder thereof shall be transferred by the holder thereof  to,
and  acquired

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-12-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

by,  Purchaser without any act or formality on the part of such holder or
Purchaser,  free and clear of any Liens, in exchange for such number of duly
authorized,  fully-paid and non-assessable Purchaser Shares equal to the
product of the  number of such Target Shares held by such holder multiplied
by the Exchange  Ratio;

 

 

         |  

2.1.2

    |  

with  respect to each Target Share transferred to Purchaser pursuant  to
Section  2.1.1;

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

2.1.2.1

    |  

the  holder of each such Target Share shall cease to be the holder of 
such  Target Share and such holder's name shall be removed from the register
of  Target Shares with respect to such Target Shares;  and

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

2.1.2.2

    |  

Purchaser  shall be deemed to be the transferee of such Target Share (free 
and clear  of any Liens) and shall be entered in the register of Target
Shares  as the  registered holder thereof; and

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

2.1.2.3

    |  

no  fractional Purchaser Shares will be issued under the Arrangement,  and
any  resulting fractional Purchaser Shares shall be rounded down or  up,
as  appropriate, to the closest whole number, it being understood for 
greater  certainty that 0.5 Purchaser Shares shall be rounded down to the 
closest  whole number;

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

with  respect to each Purchaser Share issued to a former holder of Target
Shares  pursuant to Section 2.1.1,  the  name of such holder shall be
entered in the register of holders of Purchaser  Shares as the registered
holder thereof;

 

 

         |  

2.1.3

    |  

each  outstanding Target Option that is not exercised prior to the
Effective  Time (" **Unexercised  Options** ")  shall, without any further
action or formality on the part of any  holder  of such Unexercised Option,
be transferred by the holder thereof  to Target  in exchange for an option
(a " **Replacement  Option** ")  to purchase that number of Purchaser Shares
equal to the number  of Target  Shares subject to such Unexercised Option
multiplied by the Exchange  Ratio. Such Replacement Option shall provide for
an exercise price  per  Purchaser Share equal to the exercise price per
Target Share of  such  Unexercised Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time divided  by the  Exchange Ratio; provided, however, that in no
circumstance shall  the  exercise price per Purchaser Share be less than
$.01 and if the  calculation results in an exercise price of less than $.01,
the  exercise  price shall be deemed to be $.01 per Purchaser Share. If the
foregoing  calculation results in a Replacement Option (A) being
exercisable  for a  fraction of a Purchaser Share, then the number of
Purchaser Shares  subject  to such Replacement Option shall be rounded down
to the next whole  number  of Purchaser Shares, or (B) having an exercise
price per Purchaser  Share  that is a fraction of a cent, then the exercise
price per Purchaser  Share  under such Replacement Option shall be rounded
up to the next whole  cent.  In addition, if required, the exercise price of
each Replacement  Option  will be increased such that the excess, if any, of
the aggregate  fair  market value of the Purchaser Shares subject to such
Replacement  Option  immediately after the exchange over the aggregate
exercise price  under the  Replacement Option does not exceed the excess, if
any, of the aggregate  fair market value of the Target Shares subject to the
Target Stock  Option  Plan immediately before the exchange over the
aggregate exercise  price  under such Target Stock Option Plan where all
amounts are computed  on the  Effective Date. The term to expiry, conditions
to and manner of  exercising, vesting schedule and all other terms and
conditions  of such  Replacement Option will be the same as the terms and
conditions  of such  Unexercised Option. Any document or agreement
previously evidencing  such  Unexercised Option shall thereafter evidence
and be deemed to evidence  such Replacement Options;

outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective time shall, in accordance
with  the  Target Warrant Indenture, entitle the holder thereof, at any
time  until  the time of expiry and upon payment of the exercise price
thereof,  to  purchase such number of duly authorized fully paid and non-
assessable  Purchaser Shares equal to the Exchange Ratio. The term to
expiry,  conditions to and manner of exercising, vesting schedule and all 
other  terms and conditions of such Target Warrant will continue to be 
governed  by terms and conditions set forth in the Target Warrant
Indenture;  and

The  Parties acknowledge that Target is in the process of selling part or
all  of its  equity interest in OMAI Bauxite Mining Inc. and OMAI Services
Inc. (the " **Bauxite  Sale Process** ")  and  agree that the Exchange
Ratio shall in no event be adjusted due to the outcome  of the Bauxite Sale
Process. Purchaser agrees to support the Bauxite Sale  Process, provided that

such other documents as Purchaser reasonably requests  in connection
therewith and that Purchaser consents to the terms thereof,  acting  in a
commercially reasonable manner. From and after the date hereof, Purchaser

3  with the  disclosures in any section or subsection of such schedule
qualifying the  corresponding section or subsection in this Article  3 
supplied  by Target to Purchaser dated as of the date hereof (the "

after  consultation with its financial and legal advisors, has determined 
unanimously that the Arrangement is fair to the Target Shareholders  (other 
than Purchaser) and is in the best interests of Target and has  resolved 
unanimously to recommend to the Target Shareholders that they vote  their 
Target Shares in favour of the Arrangement. The Board of Directors  of 
Target has unanimously approved the Arrangement and the execution  and 
performance of this Agreement. The Board of Directors of Target  has

subsidiaries or the  holders of Target Shares and (ii) cooperate with

consummation of the Arrangement (including by giving  rise to litigation by
third parties) or (B) not be considered in determining  whether a
representation or warranty of Target hereunder has been breached,  it  being
acknowledged by Purchaser that these actions could require the consent  of 
third parties under applicable Contracts. Purchaser shall provide written 
notice  to Target of any proposed Pre-Acquisition Reorganization at least
thirty  days  prior to the Effective Time. Upon receipt of such notice,
Purchaser and Target  shall, at the expense of Purchaser, work cooperatively
and use commercially  reasonable efforts to prepare prior to the Effective
Time all documentation  necessary and do such other acts and things as are
necessary to give effect  to  such Pre-Acquisition Reorganizations. The
parties shall seek to have any  such  Pre-Acquisition Reorganization made
effective as of the last moment of the  day  ending immediately prior to the
Closing Date (but after Purchaser shall have  waived or confirmed that all
conditions to Closing have been satisfied),  in any  event, shall not be a
condition to completion of the Arrangement. If the  Arrangement is not
consummated, for any reason whatsoever, Purchaser will  indemnify Target and
its subsidiaries for any and all losses, costs and expenses  (including legal
fees and disbursements) incurred in respect of any proposed  Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization (including in respect of any reversal,  modification or

however, that prior to the date the Required Vote is  obtained,  nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent (subject to compliance  with the
other provisions of this Article  7)  the Board of Directors of Target from
(i) engaging in discussions  or  negotiations or furnishing information (ii)
making a Change in  Target  Recommendation (iii) approving, endorsing or
recommending or proposing  publicly to approve, endorse or recommend an
Acquisition Proposal  or (iv)  entering into an agreement in connection with

---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

7.2.1.2

    |  

in  respect of which the Board of Directors of Target determines in  good
faith  after consultation with the Financial Advisor and Target's outside
counsel  that the Acquisition Proposal would be reasonably likely to lead 
to a  Superior Proposal;

" **Superior  Proposal** " shall  mean any unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal which the Board of Directors  of Target determines, in its good
faith judgment, after receiving the advice  of  Financial Advisors and after
taking into account all the terms and conditions  of  the Acquisition
Proposal, is on terms and conditions more favourable to the  Target
Shareholders than those contemplated by this Agreement (including  any 
alterations to this Agreement agreed to in writing by Purchaser in response 
thereto in accordance with Section 7.3).

 

 

         |  

7.2.2

Target  shall, and shall cause the officers, directors, employees,
representatives  and agents of Target and its subsidiaries to, immediately
terminate  any  existing solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any
person  (other  than Purchaser) that has made, indicated any interest to
make an  Acquisition Proposal. Target shall promptly request the return 
or  destruction of all information provided to any third party which,  at
any  time since January 1, 2005, has entered into a confidentiality 
agreement with Target relating to a potential Acquisition Proposal  to the 
extent that such information has not previously been returned or  destroyed,
and shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to  ensure  that such
requests are honoured in accordance with the terms of  such  agreement.

         |  

7.2.3

    |  

Target  shall promptly notify Purchaser, at first orally and thereafter 
in  writing, of any Acquisition Proposal or inquiry received after  the
date  hereof (whether or not relating to any Acquisition Proposal or 
inquiry  received prior to the date hereof) that could reasonably be
expected  to  lead to an Acquisition Proposal, in each case received after
the  date  hereof, of which any of its directors or, officers are or
become  aware, or  any amendments to the foregoing, or any request for non-
public  information  relating to Target or any of its subsidiaries in
connection with  an  Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties,
books or  records of  Target or any of its subsidiaries by any person that
informs Target  or  such subsidiary that it is considering making, or has
made, an  Acquisition  Proposal and any amendment thereto and a description
of the material  terms  and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry. Target  shall  keep Purchaser informed of any change to the
material terms of  any such  Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

7.2.4

    |  

If  Target receives a request for material non-public information from  a 
person who proposes an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal where Target  is 
not in breach of paragraph 7.2.1  and the Board of Directors of Target
determines in good faith after  consultation with Financial Advisors and its
outside counsel that  such  proposal would be reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal,  then,  and only in such case, the Board of Directors of
Target may, subject  to  the execution by such person of a confidentiality
agreement having  terms  not less favourable to Target than the
Confidentiality Agreement,  provide  such person with access in accordance
with paragraph 7.2.1  to  information regarding Target, provided that
Purchaser is promptly  provided  with a list and copies of all information
provided to such person  not  previously provided to Purchaser and is
promptly provided with  access to  information similar to that which was
provided to such  person.

7.2.5

    |  

Nothing  contained in this Section 7.2  shall prohibit the Board of
Directors of Target from making any  disclosure  to Target's Shareholders
prior to the Effective Time if, in the good faith  judgment of the Board of
Directors of Target, after consultation  with  outside counsel, such
disclosure is necessary for the Board of  Directors  to act in a manner
consistent with its fiduciary duties or is otherwise  required under
applicable Law, including its obligations under  Rule 14e-2  under the
Exchange Act or from responding through a director's circular or  otherwise
as required by applicable Securities Laws to an Acquisition  Proposal or from
calling and holding a meeting of the Target Shareholders  requisitioned by
such shareholders pursuant to the QCA or ordered  to be  held by a court
under the QCA.

Subject  to paragraph 7.3.2,  Target covenants that it will not accept,
approve, recommend or  enter into  any agreement, understanding, arrangement
or Contract in respect  of a  Superior Proposal (other than a

---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |

    |  

Target  has complied with its obligations under Section 7.2  and the other

7.3.1.2

    |  

a  period (the " **Response  Period** ")  of three business days shall have
elapsed from the date on which  Purchaser  received written notice from the
Board of Directors of Target that  the  Board of Directors of Target
determined, subject only to compliance  with  this Section 7.3,  to accept,
approve, recommend or enter into a binding agreement  to proceed  with the
Superior Proposal. In the event that Target provides Purchaser  with the
notice contemplated in this Section on a date that is  less than  three
business days prior to the Target Meeting, Target shall be  entitled  to
adjourn the Target Meeting to a date that is not more than three  business
days after the date of such  notice.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

7.3.2

    |  

During  the Response Period, Purchaser will have the right, but not the 
obligation, to offer to amend the terms of this Agreement. The  Board of 
Directors of Target will review any such proposal by Purchaser  to amend 
the terms of this Agreement, including an increase in, or modification  of,

determine whether the Acquisition Proposal to which Purchaser is  responding

Directors of Target  will promptly publicly reaffirm its recommendation of
the Arrangement. If  the  Board of Directors of Target determines that the

consideration) to be received by the holders of Target Shares shall 
constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for the purposes of this  Section 
7.3  and Purchaser shall be afforded a new Response Period in respect  of
each  such Acquisition Proposal.

The  Parties agree that irreparable harm would occur in the event that any
of  the  provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their  specific terms or were otherwise breached for which money damages
would not  be  an adequate remedy at law. It is accordingly agreed that the
Parties shall  be  entitled to an injunction or injunctions and other
equitable relief to prevent  breaches of this Agreement, any requirement for

the benefit of the Parties  and  their respective successors and permitted
assigns.
