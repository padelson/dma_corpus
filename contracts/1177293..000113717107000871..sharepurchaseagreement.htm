Post Closing Adjustment to the Net Working Capital Amount, Etc.

setting forth Sellers good faith determination of the Net Working Capital
Amount, together with a calculation of the amounts payable by Purchaser
pursuant to Section 2.3.

 

The Net Working Capital Amount provided in the Closing Statement shall be
included in calculating the Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.2.

 

(b)

 

Revised Closing Statement: Within 120 days after the Closing Date Sellers
will provide a revised Closing Statement providing recalculations of relevant

of the Net Working Capital Amount, as set forth in the revised Closing

30 day period, in writing (the "Purchasers Objection"). That notice will set
forth a specific description of the basis of Purchasers Objection and the
adjustments to the applicable amounts in the revised Closing Statement that
Purchaser believes should be made. If Purchaser does not deliver a

Amount in the revised Closing Statement shall be conclusive and binding on the
Parties.

 

(d)

 

Dispute Resolution: Sellers will have 30 days ("Sellers Review Period") from
their receipt of Purchasers Objection to review and respond to it, and the
Parties will thereafter attempt in good faith to reach an agreement with
respect to any matters in dispute. If Sellers and Purchaser are unable to
resolve their disagreement within 15 days following Sellers Review Period,
and if (but only if) the net aggregate of the amounts in dispute is in excess
of $1,000,000, they will refer that disagreement to the Accounting Firm, who
will, acting as experts and not as arbitrators, determine, only with respect
to the remaining differences so submitted, whether and to what extent, if any,
the disputed amounts in the revised Closing Statement requires adjustment.

 

Sellers and Purchaser will direct the Accounting Firm to use its best efforts
to render its determination within 20 Business Days. The Accounting Firms
determination will be conclusive and binding on Sellers and Purchaser. In
resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Firm must not assign a value to
that item greater than the greatest value for that item claimed by either
Sellers or Purchaser or less than the smallest value for that item claimed by
either Sellers or Purchaser. Sellers will pay one half and Purchaser will pay
one half of the fees and disbursements incurred by the Accounting Firm.

 

(e)

 

Adjustment Payment: The amounts as set forth in the revised Closing Statement
shall be further revised to reflect any revisions agreed to by the Parties or
determined by the

Accounting Firm. The amounts payable by Purchaser at the Closing Date pursuant
to Section 2.3 shall be recalculated using those revised amounts. If the
amounts paid by Purchaser at the Closing are greater than the amounts payable
by Purchaser using those revised amounts, Sellers shall pay to Purchaser that
difference. If the amounts paid by Purchaser at the Closing are less than the
amounts payable by Purchaser using those revised amounts, Purchaser shall
promptly pay to Sellers that difference. The limitations in Section 5.1 shall
not apply to such adjustments.

 

Any payment required pursuant to this Section 2.6(e) is to be made within five
Business Days following the final determination of the amounts in the revised
Closing Statement rendered by the Accounting Firm or as agreed to by the
Parties. Any payments required pursuant to the foregoing shall be made
together with interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to the Additional
Amount Calculation Rate calculated for the period from the Working Capital
Date to the date of payment, net of applicable withholding Tax. Any such
payment (excluding the part thereof that is interest) shall be treated by
Sellers and Purchaser as an adjustment to the Adjusted Purchase Price. No
further adjustments shall be made to the Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to
this Section 2.6.

 

(f)

 

Cooperation: During the period of time from and after the Closing Date
through to the time of final determination of the amounts in the Closing
Statement as agreed to by the Parties or, if applicable, as determined by the
Accounting Firm, Purchaser shall afford, and shall cause the Corporation to
afford, to the Accounting Firm, Sellers, or counsel or financial advisors
retained by Sellers in connection with any adjustment to the Net Working

whatsoever against Sellers with respect to those representations and
warranties, or its indemnity relating thereto in Section 14.1(a); provided
that notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.1(a):

Share Purchase Agreement

  

 



 

any single incorrect or inaccurate representation or warranty and the
aggregate amount of all of those Material Claims incurred by Purchaser as a
result of all incorrect or inaccurate representations and warranties of
Sellers contained in this Agreement (including any Material Claims for
indemnity under Section 14.1(a) arising out of those incorrect or inaccurate
representations or warranties) is equal to or greater than 5% of the Purchase
Price, in which case Purchaser will be entitled (subject to Section 5.1(c)) to
recover all Losses of Purchaser in excess thereof related to those Material
Claims. 

 

The foregoing dollar minimums in this Section 5.1(b) shall not apply to any
Claims in respect of inaccurate or incorrect representations and warranties in
Sections 3.2 or 3.3.

 

(c)

 

Maximum Liability. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the
maximum cumulative Liability of Sellers in the aggregate in respect of all
Claims regarding:

 

(i)

 

incorrect or inaccurate representations and warranties in Sections 3.2 or 3.3
(including on indemnities arising therefrom) and Sellers indemnity in Section
14.1(c)(ii) will be limited to an amount not greater than the amount equal to
the difference between the Purchase Price minus the amount of all Liabilities
of Sellers incurred and paid to Purchaser pursuant to Section 5.1(c)(ii); and

 

(ii)

 

incorrect or inaccurate representations and warranties (other than those
contained in Sections 3.2 or 3.3) and breaches of covenants in this Agreement

to advance, make or bring any Claims whatsoever against Purchaser with respect
to those representations and warranties, or any other indemnities relating
thereto.

 

(b)

 

Maximum Liability: If Closing does not occur due to a default of Purchaser of
the terms and conditions of this Agreement:

 

(i)

 

if the default was attributable to the Guarantors financing referred to in
Section 4.6 not being funded due to a Market Out, the Deposit together with
interest thereon while held by Sellers will be forfeited to and retained by
Sellers pursuant to Section 2.4(b) as a genuine pre-estimate by the Parties of
Sellers damages resulting from the Closing not occurring and as Sellers sole
remedy in respect of Purchasers default; and

 


  

 

\- 42 -

 

Share Purchase Agreement

  

 



 

(ii)

 

in all other cases, forfeiture of the Deposit and interest thereon while held
by Sellers shall be forfeited to and retained by Sellers pursuant to Section
2.4(b) as partial consideration for Sellers liquidated damages as a result of
Closing not occurring and in addition to any other rights or remedies Sellers
have under or in respect of this Agreement as a result of Purchasers default
provided that:

 

(A)

 

the maximum Liability of Purchaser for or in respect of that default shall not
exceed 35% of the Purchase Price (with the Deposit and any interest accrued
thereon prior to forfeiture being applied to that maximum Liability); and

 

(B)

 

if Purchasers default was attributable to one but not both Guarantors failing
to provide Purchaser with that Guarantors share of the amounts required to be
paid by Purchaser under this Agreement on Closing, then Sellers will only have
a Claim against Purchaser and the defaulting Guarantor for the amount in
Section 5.2(b)(ii)(A); and the Liability of the non-defaulting Guarantor shall
be limited to the forfeiture of the Deposit and any interest accrued thereon.

 

5.3

Neither Party will, in any circumstances whatsoever, be liable under this
Agreement to the other Party for indirect, incidental, consequential,
exemplary or punitive damages, suffered, sustained, paid, incurred or claimed

Environmental Concerns

 

Purchaser may at its option notify Sellers in writing on or before five
Business Days prior to the Closing Date of:

 

(a)

 

any matter disclosed by a Phase I Investigation conducted by Purchaser
pursuant to Section 9.6 which Purchaser in good faith believes may constitute
an Adverse Environmental Condition (an "Environmental Concern"); or

 

(b)

 

if the existence of any Adverse Environmental Condition is suspected to exist
in connection with the Phase I Investigation but that can only be determined
through further investigation or testing of soil, groundwater, or other
materials or information (a "Potential Adverse Environmental Condition"). 

 

Subject to Section 12.5 and Section 12.6, Purchaser may conduct a Phase II
environmental assessment with respect to any such Potential Adverse
Environmental Conditions within the timeframe provided below and notify
Sellers in writing in accordance with the procedure described below of any
item or information resulting from that Phase II environmental assessment that
Purchaser believes in good faith constitutes an Adverse Environmental
Condition. Purchaser agrees that it is not permitted to conduct a Phase II
environmental assessment prior to Closing.

 

12.2

 

Excess Environmental Liabilities

 

If Purchaser delivers timely notice of an Environmental Concern as described
above or of an alleged Adverse Environmental Condition confirmed through a
Phase II environmental assessment in accordance with Section 12.1 and Sellers
confirm to their reasonable satisfaction that such Environmental Concern or
alleged Adverse Environmental Condition may constitute an Adverse
Environmental Condition or it is determined by the Environmental Evaluator
(defined below) that such Environmental Concern or alleged Adverse
Environmental Condition may constitute an Adverse Environmental Condition (an
"Agreed Environmental Concern"), Sellers shall provide Purchasers
indemnification in respect of that Agreed Environmental Concern pursuant to
Section 14.1 as if that Agreed Environmental Concern was a breach by Sellers
of a representation and warranty in this Agreement, that indemnity

being subject to the applicable limitations in Sections 5.1(b)and (c); and
being limited to the Excess Environmental Liabilities that arise from or
relate to that Agreed Environmental Concern. 

 

12.3

 

Notices

 

Any notice referred to above shall include a reasonably detailed description
of the Environmental Concern or the alleged Adverse Environmental Condition,
including the relevant excerpt from the Phase I Investigation or Phase II
environmental assessment, as applicable.

 

12.4

 

Confidentiality

 

Except for such disclosure to Sellers pursuant to Section 12.3 or Section
12.5, Purchaser and Sellers shall maintain the results of any environmental
assessment and all findings in connection therewith strictly confidential,
subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreements.

 

12.5

 

Phase II Environmental Assessment

 

Purchaser, within 90 days after the Closing Date may conduct a Phase II
environmental assessment with respect to Potential Adverse Environmental
Conditions. Purchaser must notify Sellers on or before 180 days after the

If Purchaser and Sellers do not agree on the existence of an Environmental
Concern, a Potential Adverse Environmental Condition or an Adverse
Environmental Condition within 15 Business Days after Purchasers delivery of

matter shall be submitted to the Environmental Evaluator for review and final
determination. The Environmental Evaluator shall conduct the review
proceedings in Calgary, Alberta in accordance with the _Arbitration Act_
(Alberta) except as otherwise provided herein. Each Party within 15 days
shall submit to the Environmental Evaluator and the other Party:

 

(a)

 

a statement of its position with respect to each dispute; and

 

(b)

 

any information or documentation supporting its position with respect to each
dispute;

 

(collectively, its "Supporting Statement").

 

If only one Party timely submits a Supporting Statement in respect of a
dispute, then the Environmental Evaluator shall select as the resolution of
that dispute the submission set forth in that Supporting Statement.

 

The Environmental Evaluators determination shall be made on the basis of the
Supporting Statements and any arguments made during a hearing, if there is a
hearing.

 

The Environmental Evaluators determination shall be made within 30 days after
submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding on the
Parties, without right of appeal. In determining whether an Environmental
Concern or Adverse Environmental Condition exists, the Environmental Evaluator
shall be bound by the terms of this Section and the defined terms contained in
this Agreement. The Environmental Evaluator shall act as an expert for the
limited purpose of determining whether an Environmental Concern or Adverse
Environmental Condition exists. Sellers and Purchaser shall each bear its own
legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Sellers shall bear one-
half and Purchaser shall bear onehalf of the costs and expenses of the
Environmental Evaluator.

Remediation Operations

 

Purchaser shall not conduct (or have conducted on its behalf) any material
remediation operations with respect to any claimed damages relating to a
breach of Sellers representation or warranty pursuant to Section 3.24, any
Claim relating to the subject matter of those representations or warranty or
under any Claim related to this Section without first giving Sellers notice of
the remediation with reasonable detail at least 30 days prior thereto (or such
shorter period of time as shall be required by any Government Authority or
required to respond to an emergency situation). Sellers shall have the option
(in their sole discretion) to conduct (or have conducted on its behalf) such
remediation operations. If Sellers shall not have notified Purchaser of their
agreement to conduct those remediation operations within that specified
period, then Purchaser may conduct (or have conducted on their behalf) those
operations. Purchaser and Sellers agree that any remediation activities
undertaken with respect to the Assets, whether conducted by Purchaser or
Sellers, for which Sellers may have responsibility shall be reasonable in
extent and cost effective and shall be designed or implemented in such a
manner as to achieve the least stringent risk-based closure or remediation
standard applicable to the property in question under Environmental Laws,
subject to the approval of any Government Authority with jurisdiction over
such remediation activities, and as necessary to permit the continued use of
the property in the same manner and for the same purposes for which it was
being used at the Closing Date. All remediation activities conducted by
Sellers under this Agreement shall be conducted to the extent reasonably
possible so as not to substantially interfere with Purchasers operation of
the Assets.

Third Party Sales

 

If Purchaser dispose of any of the Assets or causes any of the Assets to be

any such disposition.

 

13.3

 

Maintenance of Information

 

All of the information, materials and other records delivered to Purchaser
pursuant to the terms hereof shall be maintained in good order and good

Mutual Indemnification: From and after the Closing, Sellers covenant and
agree with Purchaser, and Purchaser covenants and agrees with Sellers (the

Indemnified Liabilities are attributable to, occurred, arose or accrued on,
before or subsequent to the Closing Date.

 

Purchaser shall have no rights to recovery, indemnification or contribution
against Seller Indemnified Persons for Indemnified Liabilities or Indemnified
Obligations under this Agreement, under Applicable Laws, in equity or
otherwise, and all rights and remedies which Purchaser may have at or under
Applicable Law (including any past, present or future Environmental Law) or in

Persons from any and all Losses, including all claims for contribution and
indemnity under Applicable Laws or in equity, which may be asserted now or in
the future (or both) and that in any way relate to or arise out of Indemnified

(iii)

 

the DECL Shares, the Corporation, the Assets or the Business, except for any

representations and warranties, Section 5.1(c) and Section 5.2(b), which
limitations shall, to the extent applicable, apply to any Claims under or in
respect of the applicable indemnities provided in this Agreement;

 

(ii)

the limitation that, for Claims made in connection with any inaccuracy or
incorrectness of any representation or warranty contained herein or breach of
any covenant contained herein, the Indemnifying Party shall not be required to
pay any such amount until the aggregate amount is finally adjudicated or
agreed as being payable by that Indemnified Party and, if applicable, that
final amount exceeds the thresholds set out in Article 5, and then subject to
the limits set forth in Article 5; and 

 

(v)

 

the limitation that, for any Claim in respect of which Purchaser is the
Indemnified Party, if specific provision or reserve was made for that Claim in
the Closing Statement and by virtue thereof the amount of that provision or
reserve was deducted in determining the Adjusted Purchase Price, then the
amount of that provision or reserve shall also be deducted from that Claim
before determining the amount of that Claim which may be subject to
indemnification under this Agreement.

 

14.2

 

Procedures Relating to Indemnification Between Sellers and Purchaser

 

Following the discovery of any facts or conditions which could reasonably be
expected to give rise to a Claim for which indemnification is provided under
this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall, as promptly as reasonably
possible thereafter, provide written notice to the Indemnifying Party, setting
forth the specific facts and circumstances, in reasonable detail, relating to
that Claim and the amount of that Claim (or a reasonable, good-faith estimate
thereof if the actual amount is not known or not capable of reasonable
calculation) ("Indemnification Notice"); provided, however, that failure to
give that Indemnification Notice on a timely basis shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except

 


  

 

\- 67 -

 

Share Purchase Agreement

  

 



 

to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually and materially
prejudiced as a result of that failure.

 

14.3

 

Indemnification Procedures for Third Party Claims

 

In the case of Claims made by a Third Party with respect to which
indemnification is sought hereunder:

 

(a)

 

the Indemnified Party shall give prompt written notice, and in any event
within twenty days after it receives notice of that Claim, to the Indemnifying
Party of any such Claim made on it stating the nature and basis for that
Claim. A failure to give that notice within that period shall not preclude
the Indemnified Party from obtaining that indemnification but its right to
indemnification shall be reduced to the extent that any such delay materially
prejudiced the defense of the Claim or materially increased the amount of
liability or cost of defense;

 

(b)

 

the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, by notice to the Indemnified
Party given not later than thirty days after its receipt of the notice
described in Section 14.3(a), to assume the control of the defence, compromise
or settlement of that Claim, provided that such assumption shall, by its
terms, be without cost to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the control of the defence, compromise or settlement of such Claim, as
against the Indemnified Party, it will be conclusively established for the
purposes of this Agreement that those Claims are within the scope of the
indemnification set out in this Article 14 and the Indemnifying Party shall be
responsible for reimbursing the Indemnified Party for all prior reasonable
legal fees and expenses on a solicitor and client basis in connection
therewith. The Indemnifying Party shall thereafter keep each Indemnified
Party reasonably informed with respect to the status of that Claim;

 

(c)

 

on the assumption of control of any Claim by the Indemnifying Party pursuant
to Section 14.3(b), the Indemnifying Party shall diligently proceed with the
defence, compromise or settlement of that Claim at its sole expense,
including, if necessary, employment of counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party (acting reasonably) and, in connection therewith, the Indemnified Party
shall cooperate fully, but at the expense of the Indemnifying Party with
respect to any out-of-pocket expenses incurred, to make available to the
Indemnifying Party all pertinent information and witnesses under the
Indemnified Partys control and take such other steps as in the opinion of
counsel for the Indemnifying Party are reasonably necessary to enable the
Indemnifying Party to conduct that defence. The Indemnifying Party shall not
settle that Claim unless that settlement includes, as an unconditional term
thereof, the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff of a full and complete
release of the Indemnified Party from any and all liability with respect to
that Claim. As long as the Indemnifying Party is contesting any such Claim in
good faith and on a timely basis, the Indemnified Party shall not pay or
settle any such Claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, acting
reasonably. Notwithstanding the assumption by the Indemnifying Party of the
defence of that Claim as provided in Section 14.3(b), the Indemnified Party
shall also have the right to participate in the negotiation, settlement or
defence of any Claim at its own expense; provided, however, that if the
defendants in any such Claim shall include both an Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded
that counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party has a conflict of interest
because of the availability of different or additional defences to that
Indemnified Party, that Indemnified Party shall have the right to select
separate counsel to participate in the defence of that Claim on its behalf, at
the expense of the Indemnifying Party; and

 


  

 

\- 68 -

 

Share Purchase Agreement

  

 



 

provided further that the Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to pay the
expenses of more than one separate counsel for all Indemnified Parties;

 

(d)

 

where the Indemnifying Party has assumed control of the defence, compromise or
settlement of a Claim, if the Indemnified Party does not consent to a
settlement of that Claim following a request from the Indemnifying Party to do
so, the obligation of the Indemnifying Party to indemnify the Indemnified
Party for that Claim shall be limited to the amount that the Indemnifying
Party would have been required to pay in respect of the Claim if the
settlement had been accepted and the Indemnifying Party shall forthwith
transfer carriage of the contestation of the Claim to the Indemnified Party or
its nominee;

 

(e)

 

if the Indemnifying Party shall fail to notify the Indemnified Party of its
desire to assume the defence of any Claim within the period of time prescribed
in Section 14.3(b), or shall notify the Indemnified Party that it will not
assume the defense of any such Claim, then the Indemnified Party may assume
the defense of any such Claim, in which event it may do so in such manner as
it may deem appropriate, and the Indemnifying Party shall be bound by any
determination made in that Claim or any settlement thereof effected by the
Indemnified Party; provided that any such determination or settlement shall
not affect the right of the Indemnifying Party to dispute the Indemnified
Partys claim for indemnification. The Indemnifying Party shall be permitted
to join in the defense of that Claim and to employ counsel at its own expense;

 

(f)

 

the final determination of any Claim pursuant to this Section 14.3, including
all related costs and expenses, will be binding and conclusive on the Parties
as to the validity or invalidity, as the case may be, of that Claim against
the Indemnifying Party; and

 

(g)

 

notwithstanding Section 14.1(d)(iv) amounts payable by the Indemnifying Party
to the Indemnified Party in respect of any Claims for which the Indemnified
Party is entitled to indemnification under this Section 14.3 shall be payable
by the Indemnifying Party as incurred by the Indemnified Party.

 

14.4

 

Holding of Indemnities

 

Sellers and Purchaser shall hold the indemnities contained in Section 14.1 in
trust on behalf of Seller Indemnified Persons or Purchaser Indemnified
Persons, as applicable, and may enforce those indemnities on its and their
respective behalf. In furtherance of the foregoing sentence the term
"Indemnified Party" as used herein shall mean or include, as applicable, any
Seller Indemnified Person or Purchaser Indemnified Person that the Indemnified
Party may represent in the circumstances.

 

14.5

 

Claims Net of Insurance

 

The amount of any and all Claims under this Article 14 and elsewhere under
this Agreement shall be determined net of any amounts recovered by the
Indemnified Party under insurance policies, indemnities or other reimbursement
arrangements with respect to those Claims. Each Party hereby waives, or will
procure the waiver of, any subrogation rights that its insurer may have with
respect to any indemnifiable Claims.

 

14.6

 

Mitigation

 

Each Party shall take all reasonable steps and use all commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate any and all Claims which may be the subject of an
indemnity under this Article 14.

Adjustment to Adjusted Purchase Price

 

Any indemnity payment under this Agreement, including for greater certainty,
any payment pursuant to Article 15, shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Adjusted Purchase Price.

 

14.8

 

Subrogation

 

Each Party shall assign to the other Party and subrogate the other Party to
all its rights and remedies against any Person (other than, with respect to
rights and remedies of Sellers and Purchaser, those against its Related
Parties) in respect of any payment made by the other Party in respect of any
indemnification or liability assumed by the other Party pursuant to this
Agreement or as a result of this Agreement (including legal fees and other
costs of litigation). Each Party shall provide all reasonable cooperation and
assistance required by the other Party in making and prosecuting any Claim for
recovery against that Person to the extent that payment is made by the other
Party. Neither Party shall knowingly take any action to impair any such right
or remedy of the other Party to recover any such payment.

After Closing and subject to the terms of this Article 15, Sellers shall be
liable for and shall pay and shall indemnify, defend and save and hold
harmless Purchaser, the Corporation and the Subsidiaries from and against:

 

(i)

 

all income Taxes of the Corporation and each Corporate Subsidiary:

 

(A)

 

for taxation years of the Corporation and each Corporate Subsidiary ending on
or before the Working Capital Date; or

 

(B)

 

attributable to income earned or realized by the Partnership Subsidiary for
fiscal years of the Partnership Subsidiary ending on or before the Working
Capital Date;

 

(ii)

 

all notional income Taxes of the Corporation and each Corporate Subsidiary for
taxation years of the Corporation or Corporate Subsidiary, as the case may be,
ending after the Working Capital Date, to the extent such income Taxes are
attributable (x) to income earned or realized by the Partnership Subsidiary
during the period in a Straddle Period of the Partnership Subsidiary that
notionally ended on or before the Working Capital Date; or (y) to income
earned or realized by the Corporation or Corporate Subsidiary, as the case may
be, otherwise than as a partner of the Partnership Subsidiary, during the
period in a Straddle Period of the Corporation or Corporate Subsidiary, as the
case may be, that notionally ended on or before the Working Capital Date, all
as calculated on the basis and using the assumptions set forth in Section
15.1(c); and

 

(iii)

 

all other Taxes attributable to periods ending (or portions thereof notionally
ending) on or before the Working Capital Date;

 

in all such cases to the extent that such Taxes are not reflected in the Net
Working Capital Amount. All Taxes referred to in Section 15.1(a)(i)(B) shall
be calculated without regard to subsection 66(13.1) of the Tax Act.

Sellers shall be entitled to any refund of (or credit for) Taxes allocable to
any period with respect to which Sellers are liable for Taxes in accordance
with the foregoing and, to the extent applicable, shall also be entitled to
any amount not reflected in the Net Working Capital Amount by which any pre-
paid or estimated Tax payments remitted before the Closing Date with respect
to any such taxation year or any such part of any Straddle Period exceeds the
Tax due and payable therefor.

 

(b)

 

After Closing and subject to the terms of this Article 15, Purchaser shall be
liable for and shall pay or shall cause the Corporation and the Subsidiaries
to pay and shall indemnify, defend and save and hold harmless Sellers from and
against:

 

(i)

 

all income Taxes of the Corporation and each Corporate Subsidiary for taxation
years ending after the Working Capital Date to the extent such income Taxes
are not income Taxes for which Sellers are liable under Section 15.1(a);

 

(ii)

 

all other Taxes attributable to periods beginning (or portions thereof
notionally beginning) after the Working Capital Date; and

 

(iii)

 

any Taxes that are reflected in the Net Working Capital Amount.

 

(c)

 

For purposes of Section 15.1(a) and Section 15.1(b), whenever it is necessary
to determine the liability for Taxes of the Corporation or any Subsidiary for
a part of any Straddle Period, the Taxes for the part of the Straddle Period
ending on or before, and the part of the Straddle Period beginning after the
Working Capital Date shall be determined by assuming that:

 

(i)

 

the Straddle Period consists of two taxation years (or in the case of the
Partnership Subsidiary, two fiscal periods), one which ended at the close of
the Working Capital Date and the other of which began at the beginning of the
day immediately after the Working Capital Date;

 

(ii)

 

items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of the Corporation or any
Subsidiary for the Straddle Period shall be allocated between those two
assumed taxation years based on a closing of the books; and

 

(iii)

 

Taxes other than income Taxes will be allocated to each of the taxation years
or fiscal periods, as the case may be, in proportion to the number days in
each such taxation year relative to the number of days in the entire Straddle
Period.

 

(d)

 

For purposes of Section 15.1(a), Section 15.1(b), and Section 15.1(c),
Sellers shall cause to be prepared notional Tax Returns for the Corporation
and each Subsidiary for, in the case of the Partnership Subsidiary, the fiscal
period of the Partnership Subsidiary that is deemed under Section 15.1(c) to
have ended at the close of the Working Capital Date and, for the Corporation
and each Corporate Subsidiary, the taxation year of the Corporation or
Corporate Subsidiary, as the case may be, that is deemed under Section
Section 15.1(c) to have ended at the close of the Working Capital Date, for
the purpose of determining the notional income Taxes for which Sellers are
liable under Section 15.1(a). Sellers shall be entitled, in preparing such
notional Tax Returns, to claim the maximum allowable amounts (taking into
account any limitations applicable to short periods) in respect of
discretionary deductions, including resource pools. Purchaser shall have an
opportunity to review and comment on those Tax Returns, acting reasonably, and
Sellers shall reasonably consider and address any comments of Purchaser in

Taxes reported on the notional Tax Returns shall then be included in the
revised Closing Statement referred to in Section 2.6(b); provided, however,
that any failure of the Parties to agree on the amount of Taxes that should be
reflected on any notional Tax Return shall be resolved pursuant to Section
2.6(d). If a determination by any Government Authority with respect to the
actual Tax Return to which such notional Tax Return relates is inconsistent
with such notional Tax Return, the Taxes reported on the notional Tax Return
shall be recomputed consistent with such determination, and the Parties shall
reimburse each other, as appropriate, within 30 days after such
redetermination.

 

(e)

 

The indemnities provided in this Section 15.1 are in addition to any other
indemnity in this Agreement but are subject to the limitation set forth in
Section 5.1(c).

 

(f)

 

The Parties acknowledge and agree that their mutual intention is to allocate
the Taxes payable by the Corporation and the Subsidiaries between Sellers and
Purchasers such that those Taxes as may reasonably be considered to relate to
income earned and applicable deductions claimed or claimable in or for a
period or periods ending on or before the Working Capital Date calculated on a
notional basis as if the taxation years of the Corporation and the Corporate
Subsidiaries and the fiscal period of the Partnership Subsidiary ended on the
Working Capital Date shall be the responsibility of Sellers and those Taxes as
may reasonably be considered to relate to income earned and applicable
deductions claimed or claimable in or for a period or periods beginning after
the Working Capital Date calculated on a notional basis as if the taxation
years of the Corporation and the Corporate Subsidiaries and the fiscal period
of the Partnership Subsidiary began on the Working Capital Date shall be the
responsibility of Purchaser, notwithstanding that neither the Corporation nor
any Subsidiary will have a taxation year (or in the case of the Partnership
Subsidiary, a fiscal period) ending on that date, and it is intended that the
foregoing provisions of this Article 15, together with the calculation of the
Net Working Capital Amount be interpreted and applied to give effect to that
mutual intention. If the Parties, acting reasonably, should determine that
any such provision, if applied strictly, would produce a result that is
inconsistent with that mutual intention, the Parties shall apply those
provisions in a manner that would give effect to that mutual intention.

 

15.2

 

Tax Returns

 

(a)

 

Sellers shall cause to be prepared and filed on a timely basis all Tax Returns
(if any) for the Corporation and the Subsidiaries for any taxation year or
period which ends before the Closing Date and for which Tax Returns have not
been filed as of that date. Purchaser shall have an opportunity to review and
comment on those Tax Returns, acting reasonably, before the filing of those
Tax Returns and Sellers shall reasonably consider and address any comments of
Purchaser in that regard. Sellers shall be entitled, in preparing such Tax
Returns, to claim the maximum allowable amounts in respect of discretionary
deductions, including resource pools. Those Tax Returns shall be prepared
without making any elections not to have the provisions of subsection 256(9)
of the Tax Act apply.

 

(b)

 

Purchaser shall cause to be prepared and filed on a timely basis all Tax
Returns for the Corporation and the Subsidiaries for any taxation year or
period which ends on or after the Closing Date and for which Tax Returns have
not been filed as of that date. Sellers shall have an opportunity to review
and comment on any of those Tax Returns to the extent they relate to any
period before the Closing Date, and to approve them, acting reasonably, before
the filing of those Tax Returns. Those Tax Returns shall be prepared

Share Purchase Agreement

  

 



 

without making any elections not to have the provisions of subsection 256(9)
of the Tax Act apply.

 

(c)

 

Sellers shall pay and remit any Taxes due in respect of Tax Returns referred
to in Section 15.2(a). Purchaser shall or shall cause the Corporation or any
of the Subsidiaries to pay and remit any Taxes due in respect of the Tax
Returns referred to in Section 15.2(b). Sellers or Purchaser shall reimburse
the other Party for any Taxes for which Sellers or Purchaser is liable
pursuant to Section 15.1(a) or Section 15.1(b), as applicable, but which are
payable with Tax Returns to be filed by the other Party pursuant to Section
15.2(a) and Section 15.2(b), as applicable, on the written request of the
Party entitled to reimbursement, setting forth in detail the computation of
the amount owed by Sellers or Purchaser, as applicable, but in no event
earlier than ten days before the due date for the filing of any applicable Tax
Returns, except to the extent such amounts have already been paid as
adjustments to the Adjusted Purchase Price.

 

(d)

 

Before Closing Sellers shall, and after Closing Purchaser shall, cause the
Corporation and the Subsidiaries to cooperate fully with each other and make
available to each other in a timely fashion such data and other information as
may reasonably be required for the preparation of any of those Tax Returns
referred to in this Section 15.2 and shall preserve that data and other
information until the expiration of any applicable limitation period under any
Applicable Laws with respect to Taxes.

 

(e)

 

Any Tax Return to be prepared pursuant to the provisions of this Section 15.2
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with practices followed in prior
years with respect to similar Tax Returns of the Corporation and the
Subsidiaries provided such historical practices are proper.

 

(f)

 

Purchaser shall not and shall not allow the Corporation or any Subsidiary to
amend, refile or otherwise modify or grant an extension of any statute of
limitations with respect to any Tax Return for the Corporation or the
Subsidiaries for any taxation year ending on or before the Working Capital
Date or that includes any Straddle Period and shall not request an audit or
assessment of any such Tax Return, in each case without prior written consent
of Sellers. Sellers shall not file an amended Tax Return for the Corporation
or the Subsidiaries for any taxable period ending before the Closing Date and
shall not request an audit or assessment of any such Tax Return, in each case
without written consent of Purchaser.

 

15.3

 

Tax Claims

 

(a)

 

Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party in writing on receipt by that
Party or any of their respective Affiliates (including for Purchaser, the
Corporation and the Subsidiaries) or Representatives of notice of any pending
or threatened federal, provincial, state, local or foreign Tax audits,
examinations, claims or assessments (a "Tax Claim") for which that Party is
entitled to seek, or is seeking or intends to seek, indemnification pursuant
to the applicable part of Section 15.1.

 

(b)

 

Purchaser shall represent the interests of the Corporation and the
Subsidiaries in and with respect to any Tax Claim relating to taxation years
ending on or before the Working Capital Date and employ counsel of its own
choice for that purpose. Sellers shall be entitled to participate in or with
respect to that Tax Claim relating (in whole or in part) to Taxes attributable
to taxation years ending on or before the Working Capital Date and, with the
written consent of Purchaser, and at Sellers sole expense, may assume the
entire control of that Tax Claim. Purchaser, with the written consent of
Sellers, shall have the

right to settle, either administratively or after the commencement of
litigation, any proceeding relating to Taxes of the Corporation and any of the
Subsidiaries for any taxation year ending on or before the Working Capital
Date. In the case of any Straddle Period, Sellers shall be entitled to
participate at their expense in or with respect to any Tax Claim relating (in
whole or in part) to Taxes attributable to the part of that Straddle Period
ending on or before the Working Capital Date, and with the written consent of
Purchaser, and at Sellers sole expense, may assume the entire control of that
Tax Claim. From and after the Closing, neither Purchaser, the Corporation,
any Subsidiary nor any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives shall

prior written consent of Sellers.

period, and promptly notify the other Party prior to destruction of any of
those Tax records or that information and provide the other Party a reasonable
opportunity to make and retain copies of any of those Tax records or that
information; and
