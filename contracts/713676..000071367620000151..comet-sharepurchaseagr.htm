Company SEC Reports required to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC
pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act since December 31, 2018
(the "Applicable Date"). Each of the Company SEC Reports, at the time of its
filing or being furnished complied or, if not yet filed or furnished, will
comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and any rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder applicable to the Company SEC Reports. As of their respective dates
(or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of such
amendment), the Company SEC Reports did not, and any Company SEC Reports filed
with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement will
not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were

consolidated financial statements for the nine month period ended September
30, 2020 (collectively, the "Financial Statements"). The Financial Statements

Subsidiaries, (ii) have been prepared in conformity with GAAP applied on a

fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of

operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (except that the
unaudited statements may not contain footnotes and are subject to normal year-
end audit adjustments).

(c) Except (i) as reflected or reserved against in the Financial Statements
(or disclosed in the notes thereto, if applicable), (ii) for Permitted Liens,
(iii) for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business since the

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(d) The Company and its Subsidiaries have established and maintained since
January 1, 2017, and continue to maintain, a system of internal controls over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Such
internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of the Company's financial reporting and the preparation of the
Company's consolidated financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP. The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation of its internal accounting controls by its chief executive officer
and chief financial officer prior to the date hereof, to the Company's
auditors and audit committee (i) all significant deficiencies and



-24-





material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls which

report financial information for inclusion in the applicable combined
financial statements and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Company's internal controls over financial reporting. Since January 1, 2017,

regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters have
been received by the Company and no written complaints from Company employees
regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters have been received by
the Company.

(e) The allowances for loan losses and for credit losses contained in the
Financial Statements and the allowance for loan losses and for credit losses
shown on any interim balance sheet since the date of such Financial
Statements, as the case may be, were and will be established in accordance
with the practices and experiences of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and
were and will be adequate under and in accordance with the requirements of
GAAP, and the applicable Governmental Authorities to provide for possible
losses on loans (including accrued interest receivable) and credit commitments
(including stand-by letters of credit) outstanding as of the date of such
balance sheet. The Company adopted and fully implemented CECL effective as of
January 1, 2020, other than for regulatory capital purposes.

ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and none of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action that, if taken on or
after the date hereof, would require the consent of the Purchaser pursuant to

action of Purchaser (and, if applicable, any such Affiliate) prior to the date
of this Agreement. This Agreement is a valid and legally binding obligation of
Purchaser, and the other Transaction Documents to which Purchaser is or will
be a party have been, or at Closing will be, duly executed and delivered by
Purchaser and assuming due authorization, execution, and delivery of the
Transaction Documents by the other parties thereto, constitute, or at Closing
will constitute, legal, valid and binding agreements of Purchaser, enforceable
against Purchaser in accordance with their respective terms (except as
enforceability may be limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception).

Section 4.3 Regulatory Filings; No Defaults.

(a) No consents or approvals of, or filings or registrations with, any
Governmental Authority or other third party are required to be made or
obtained by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in connection with the
execution, delivery or performance by Purchaser or its Affiliates of the
Transaction Documents to which they are a party, or to effect the
Transactions, except for (i) the filing of the applications, filings or
notices to or with the Government Authorities listed in Annex A, as applicable
to the Purchaser or its Affiliates, and approval of or non-objection to such
applications, filings and notices; and (ii) such other consents, approvals,
filings or registrations the failure of which to be obtained would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, Purchaser (1) has no reason to
believe that the Requisite Regulatory Approvals will not be obtained in the
ordinary course and without material delay with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Purchaser and the performance by the Purchaser of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
(2) is compliant in all material respects with all Laws applicable to the
conduct of its businesses that could reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay receipt of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals.

(b) Subject to the receipt of the approvals and consents referred to in Annex
A and the expiration or early termination of applicable waiting periods, the
execution, delivery and performance by Purchaser of the Transaction Documents
to which it is a party and the consummation by it of the Transactions do not
(i) conflict with, contravene, constitute a violation or breach of or default
under or give rise to (or give rise after the giving of notice, the passage of
time or both) a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any
obligation of Purchaser or to a loss of any benefits to which Purchaser is
entitled under any provision of (i) Purchaser's Constituent Documents or (ii)
assuming compliance with the requirements referred to in Section



-41-





4.3(a), any Law or Government Order binding upon Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than violations which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.4 No Brokers. Except for any fees which may be due and owing to BofA
Securities, Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., and Evercore Group L.L.C.,
which will be paid by Purchaser, there is no investment banker, broker, finder
or other intermediary that has been retained by or is authorized to act on
behalf of Purchaser or its Affiliates who might be entitled to any fee or
commission from Purchaser or its Affiliates in connection with the
Transactions.

Section 4.5 Litigation. Except as (i) disclosed in the Purchaser SEC Reports,
(ii) otherwise set forth in Section 4.6 of the Purchaser's Disclosure Schedule
and (iii) would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, (A) there is no Action before any
Governmental Authority against Purchaser or its Affiliates, and, to
Purchaser's Knowledge, no such Action has been threatened, and (B) to
Purchaser's Knowledge, no such Action has been threatened or commenced that is
reasonably likely to impair the ability of Purchaser to perform its
obligations under the Transaction Documents or otherwise impede or delay the
consummation of Transactions.

Section 4.6 Availability of Funds. As of the date of this Agreement, Purchaser
has sufficient funds, and will at the Closing have immediately available funds
in cash, to pay when due all amounts payable by it hereunder.

Section 4.7 Investment. Purchaser is acquiring the Shares for its own account
as an investment without the present intent to sell, transfer or otherwise
distribute the same to any other Person. Purchaser has made, independently and
without reliance on Seller (except to the extent that Purchaser has relied on
the representations and warranties of Seller in this Agreement), its own
analysis of the Shares for the purpose of acquiring the Shares. Purchaser
acknowledges that the Shares are not registered pursuant to any Securities
Laws and that none of the Shares may be transferred, except pursuant to a
registration statement or an applicable exemption under the Securities Act.
Purchaser is an "accredited investor" as defined under Rule 501 promulgated
under the Securities Act.

Section 4.8 No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement (including any
certificate or other instrument delivered in connection therewith), neither
Purchaser nor any other Person makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty on behalf of Purchaser relating to Purchaser, and
Seller acknowledges the same.

(a) To the extent permitted by applicable Law and as may be reasonable in
light of Contagion Event Measures, from the date hereof until the earlier of
the Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement, Seller shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, provide to Purchaser and to Purchaser's
Representatives reasonable access upon reasonable prior notice and request,
during the Company and the Bank's normal business hours, to the officers,
employees, properties, books, contracts and records relating exclusively to
the Company, the Bank and the Company's other Subsidiaries. Purchaser shall,
and shall cause its Representatives to, conduct its inspections and
investigations under this Section 5.1 in a manner that will not unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company, the Bank or the
Company's other Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
Seller, the Company, the Bank or any other Company Subsidiary shall be
required to disclose any information where disclosure could result in the loss
of any legal privilege or contravene any Law or fiduciary obligations,
including those related to confidential supervisory information; provided that
the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make other
arrangements (including redacting information or making substitute disclosure
arrangements) that would enable such access or furnishing of information to
Purchaser to occur without contravening such privilege or applicable Law. All
information received pursuant to this Section 5.1 shall be governed by the
terms of Section 5.5.

(b) Following the Closing, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
Seller may retain copies of books and records of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries that will be transferred in connection with the Transactions and,
with respect to any books and records for which the Seller does not retain
copies, the Purchaser agrees to provide (or cause its Affiliates to provide)
the Seller with reasonable access to such books and records and other
documents that the Purchaser acquires pursuant to this Agreement and, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law and as may be reasonable in light of
Contagion Event Measures, reasonable access upon reasonable prior notice and
request, during normal business hours, to its assets, properties and
employees, in each case, to the extent that such access is reasonably required
by Seller or any of its Affiliates to (w) defend, prosecute, appeal or
cooperate with any judicial, arbitral or regulatory proceeding, audit or
investigation to which the Seller or any of its Affiliates member is a party
and which relates to the Company, the Bank or any Company Subsidiary or
otherwise to the business and affairs thereof prior to the Closing, (x)
prepare financial statements or regulatory filings of the Seller in respect of
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date, or (y) comply with the terms
of this Agreement, any other Transaction Document, any applicable Law or
request of any Government Authority; provided that all books, records,
information and materials of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
including customer lists (collectively, and together with any reports,
analyses, compilations, memoranda, notes and any other writings that contain,
reflect or are based upon such information, "Confidential Information"), shall
be subject to the confidentiality provisions of Section 5.5 and no
Confidential Information may be made available to Seller's Representatives or
to any of Seller's Affiliates or their respective Representatives unless such
Person agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information
pursuant to Section 5.5 (and, in any event, the Seller shall be liable for any
failure of such Affiliates or Representatives to act in accordance with
Section 5.5); provided, further, that neither the Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates shall be required to provide such access to the extent that doing
so would result in the loss of any legal privilege or contravene any Law or
fiduciary obligations; provided that the parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to make



-43-





other arrangements (including redacting information or making substitute
disclosure arrangements) that would enable such access or furnishing of
information to the Seller to occur without contravening such privilege or
applicable Law. The Purchaser agrees to (or to cause its relevant Affiliates
(including the Company and the Bank after the Closing) to) retain and preserve
all books and records and all other documents that it or they acquire pursuant
to this Agreement, in compliance with all applicable Law.

(c) At or prior to Closing, to the extent that any books and records of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in the possession of Seller or any of
its Affiliates (other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) and not
also in the possession of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, Seller
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to
effect the physical and/or electronic transfer of such books and records to
the Company; provided that if any such books and records are not transferred
to the Company on or prior to the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates shall
continue to use reasonable best efforts to transfer such books and records to
the Company following the Closing; and provided, further, that to the extent
any such books and records contain material that does not pertain or relate to
the assets, liabilities, properties, business, conduct, personnel and/or
operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries, such material may be redacted
from such books and records.

and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the Transactions and
to cooperate with the other party in connection with the foregoing, including,
without limitation, to prepare as promptly as practicable all documentation,

and state banking authorities relating to the Transactions as promptly as
practicable, but in any event within forty-five (45) days of the date of this

Requisite Regulatory Approvals as promptly as practicable. In furtherance of
the foregoing, the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall take or commit to take
any and all actions and agree to any conditions or restrictions imposed by any
Governmental Authority as may be reasonably necessary in order to obtain the
foregoing Requisite Regulatory Approvals; provided, however, that
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement that may be to the
contrary, Purchaser shall not be required to take any action, or commit to
take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, that would,
individually or in the aggregate, result in a Purchaser Material Adverse
Effect (measured on a pro forma combined basis giving effect to the

(b) Each party shall, subject to applicable Law, (i) permit counsel for the
other party to review in advance any proposed filing, application,
correspondence or other written communication to any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transactions, (ii) consider in good faith the views of the

Governmental Authority or received from such a Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transactions, in each case in such a manner as may be
reasonable under the



-49-





circumstances during a Contagion Event; provided, however, that materials may
be excluded or redacted as necessary (A) to comply with applicable Law, or (B)
to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns. Each party agrees
that it will use reasonable best efforts to (1) keep the other party fully
informed with respect to all applications and change in control notices to
Governmental Authorities and developments related thereto, and (2) give the
other party reasonable advance notice of, and except as may be impermissible
due to the anticipated discussion of a party's confidential supervisory
information, invite the other party to participate in, any meetings or
discussions held with any Governmental Authority (other than routine or local
supervisory team meetings or discussions) concerning such applications or
change in control notices (and give due consideration in good faith to any
reasonable request of the other party with respect to any such participation);
provided that such participation is not objected to by such Governmental
Authority. The parties covenant and agree not to extend any waiting period
associated with any Requisite Regulatory Approval or enter into any agreement
with any Governmental Authority not to consummate the Transactions, except
with the prior written consent of the other party hereto.

(c) The parties further covenant and agree that (i) with respect to any
threatened or pending preliminary or permanent Government Order that would
adversely affect the ability of the parties hereto to consummate the
Transactions, to use their respective reasonable best efforts to prevent the
entry, enactment or promulgation thereof, as the case may be, and (ii) in the
event that any Action is commenced after the date hereof challenging any of
the parties' rights to consummate the Transactions, the parties shall use
their reasonable best efforts, and take all reasonable actions necessary and
appropriate, to contest such Action.

Consents as soon as practicable.

relating to the consummation of the Transactions, including promptly
furnishing the other with copies of any material notices or other
communications received by such party or, to the Knowledge of such party, its
Representatives from any third party or any Governmental Authority with
respect to the consummation of the Transactions. Each party shall give prompt
notice to the other party of any development or combination of developments
that, individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to (i) cause it
to fail to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement under this Agreement or (ii) prevent, materially delay
or materially impair its ability to consummate the Transactions; provided,
however, that no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties, the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement or any remedies for any breach
of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements herein. Each party
shall give prompt notice



-50-





to the other party of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that is
reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts, events
and circumstances known to it, (x) with respect to Seller, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, (A) to result in any Material Adverse Effect, (B) to
result in a breach of any of Seller's representations or warranties herein
either on such date or on the Closing Date or any of their covenants
hereunder; (C) result in the failure of the satisfaction of the conditions to
Closing or make the satisfaction of any of the foregoing impossible or
unlikely; or (D) to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability
of Seller, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to consummate the
Transactions; and (y) with respect to Purchaser, (A) to prevent, materially
delay or materially impair the ability of Purchaser to consummate the
Transactions; (B) to result in a breach of any of Purchaser's representations
or warranties herein either on such date or on the Closing Date or any of its
covenants hereunder; or (C) result in the failure of the satisfaction of the
conditions to Closing or make the satisfaction of any of the foregoing
impossible or unlikely.

Section 5.5 Confidentiality. Each of Seller and Purchaser acknowledges that
the information provided to it, its Affiliates or their Representatives (the
"Receiving Party") by the other party, such party's Affiliates or their
Representatives (the "Disclosing Party") prior to the Effective Time in
connection with this Agreement is subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. As
of the Effective Time, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate.
Following the Effective Time, all confidential information relating to the
Disclosing Party and its Affiliates which was provided or conveyed to or
obtained by Receiving Party in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement
and any other information that the Disclosing Party furnished or furnish to
the Receiving Party, or that the Bank, the Company and its Subsidiaries have
maintained after the Closing or that the Seller or any of its Affiliates
retains or receives pursuant to Section 5.1, including any technical,
scientific, trade secret or other proprietary information of a Disclosing
Party (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) with which the Receiving
Party came or comes into contact in the course of the negotiation and
consummation of the Transactions or retains or receives pursuant to Section
5.1, whether before or after the date of the Confidentiality Agreement,
together with any reports, analyses, compilations, memoranda, notes and any
other writings prepared by a Disclosing Party that contain, reflect or are
based upon such information, shall be and continue to be kept confidential by
the Receiving Party for a period of two (2) years following the Closing Date,
except (i) pursuant to a Government Order, as required in any Action, or as
otherwise required by applicable Law or administrative process (in which case
the Receiving Party shall provide the Disclosing Party prompt notice thereof
to the extent legally permissible and practical and shall cooperate with the
Disclosing Party so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or
other appropriate remedy); (ii) for information that is or becomes generally
available to the public other than as a result of a breach of this Section 5.5
or the Confidentiality Agreement; and (iii) to the extent that such
information is or has become known to the Person receiving such information on
a non-confidential basis from a source who to the Knowledge of such Receiving
Party is not breaching any contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation by
making such disclosure (in the case of information relating to the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries, this clause (iii) shall apply only to the extent
that the Seller comes to know such information after the Closing Date), and
such Receiving Party shall not use, and shall cause its Affiliates not to use,
the information described in this Section 5.5 in connection with the conduct
of its or its Affiliates' businesses or for any other purpose, except as



-51-





required for financial or tax reporting or by applicable Law or as necessary
to enforce the Receiving Party's or the Bank's, the Company's and its other
Subsidiaries' (following the Closing) rights and remedies under this Agreement
or the other Transaction Documents; provided, however, that following the
Closing, the Purchaser shall be deemed to be the Disclosing Party, and the
Seller shall be deemed to be the Receiving Party, for purposes of all
information of or relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries.

Section 5.6 Publicity. During the period from the date of this Agreement
continuing through the Closing, Purchaser and Seller shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to, consult with each other before issuing any
press release or public statement or making any other public disclosure
(including any broad-based employee communication) related to this Agreement
and the Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or public
statement or make any other such public disclosure without the prior written
consent of Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that nothing in this Section 5.6
shall be deemed to prohibit Purchaser or Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates from making any disclosure necessary in order to satisfy its
disclosure obligations imposed by applicable Law or any stock exchange or
self-regulatory organization so long as it makes a good faith attempt to
provide the other party with prior notice of any such disclosure and address
any comments or concerns raised by the other party in good faith. In addition
to the foregoing, Purchaser and Seller shall not, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates not to, issue any press release or otherwise make any
public statement or disclosure concerning Seller and its Affiliates or
Purchaser and its Affiliates, as the case may be, or their respective
business, financial condition or results of operations without the consent of
Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

Section 5.7 Non-Compete; Non-Solicitation.

(a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the second
(2nd) anniversary thereof (the "Non-Compete Term"), Seller and its controlled
Affiliates shall not, directly or indirectly, own an equity interest in, or
manage, operate or control, any Person engaged in the Retail Banking Business
in the Restricted Territory (a "Competing Retail Banking Business").

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in Section 5.7(a) shall prohibit or
in any way limit:

(i) the provision of services or products by any Person other than Seller or
any of its controlled Affiliates;

(ii) the provision of services or products by Seller or any of its Affiliates,
directly or through trading platforms, to (1) Non-U.S. Clients; (2) Large
Corporate Entities; (3) Institutional Entities; (4) Project Finance Clients
and (5) JV Clients (each of the foregoing being referred to herein as the
"Excluded Customers");

(iii) the participation by Seller or any of its Affiliates in transactional
banking services with Excluded Customers (which for avoidance of doubt, shall
include financing



-52-





to any Excluded Customer's U.S. Person suppliers or clients to the extent that
such financing is granted under the terms of the program entered into with
Excluded Customers);

(iv) PV (or any successor entity thereto or future Subsidiary thereof) from
making investments in the types of companies in which PV is invested on the
date hereof, consistent with the nature and size of such investments;

(v) Seller or any of its Affiliates from acquiring, owning or holding up to
five percent (5%) of the outstanding securities of an entity whose securities
are listed and traded on a nationally recognized securities exchange or
market, whether or not in the U.S. or holding or exercising rights of
ownership with respect to a security in a fiduciary, custodial or agency
capacity or otherwise for the benefit of or on behalf of clients or other
unaffiliated beneficiaries; or

(vi) Seller or any of its Affiliates from, directly or indirectly, (1) owning
up to five percent (5%) of the outstanding voting stock of any Person that
engages in a Competing Retail Banking Business, (2) acquiring (whether by
merger, consolidation or otherwise) a Person that operates a Competing Retail
Banking Business in the Restricted Territory if such Competing Retail Banking
Business represents no more than ten (10%) of such Person's business
(measured, for purposes of this clause (v)(2), based on the percentage of
total assets by the Competing Retail Banking Business in the Restricted
Territory relative to the overall consolidated total assets of the Person
acquired for the twelve (12) month period preceding the most recent fiscal
quarter prior to the date of entering into the agreement providing for the
applicable acquisition), or (3) being acquired by an unaffiliated Person that
engages in a Competing Retail Banking Business (whether by merger,
consolidation or otherwise, but where, for the avoidance of doubt, the equity
owners (as of immediately prior to the acquisition) of the Person acquiring
the Seller or any of its Affiliates, will own a majority of the outstanding
equity securities of the combined or resulting Person or its ultimate parent
company (as of immediately after the acquisition)).

(c) During the Non-Compete Term, Seller and its controlled Affiliates shall
not, directly or indirectly, solicit any Person for financial products or
services in the Restricted Territory or enter into any agreement to provide,
or provide, any such products or services to any such Person in the Restricted
Territory; provided, however, nothing in this Section 5.7(c) shall in any way
prohibit or limit solicitation activities in connection with the permissible
activities or products of Seller or any of its Affiliates set forth in Section
5.7(b).

(d) Following the Closing, Seller shall not, and Seller shall cause its
controlled Affiliates not to, use any customer lists or other proprietary
customer information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with the operation of their businesses (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
any proprietary customer information relating to the Excluded Customers).



-53-





(e) For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the restrictions imposed by
applicable subsections of Section 5.7(b), this Section 5.7 shall not apply to
any controlled Affiliate if the Seller ceases to control, directly or
indirectly, such Affiliate or if such Affiliate sells all or substantially all
of its assets to an unaffiliated third party.

(f) If any provision contained in this Section 5.7 shall for any reason be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this
Section 5.7, but Section 5.7 shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. It is the intention
of the parties that if any of the restrictions or covenants contained in this
Section 5.7 are held to cover a geographic area or to be for a length of time
which is not permitted by applicable Law, or in any way construed to be too
broad or to any extent invalid, such provision shall not be construed to be
null, void and of no effect, but to the extent such provision would be valid
or enforceable under applicable Law, a court of competent jurisdiction shall
construe and interpret or reform this Section 5.7 to provide for a covenant
having the maximum enforceable geographical area, time period and other
provisions (not greater than those contained herein) as shall be valid and
enforceable under such applicable Law.

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall require any party or any of its
Subsidiaries to terminate any instruments, accounts or agreements of or with
any customer or client in effect as of the date hereof, or prohibit or
otherwise limit any of them from either accepting or making deposits and
withdrawals to and from such accounts or performing their respective binding
obligations in effect on the date hereof and as of the Closing Date under such
instruments or agreements.

Section 5.8 Employee Non-Solicitation. During the period beginning on the
Closing Date and ending on the date that is twelve (12) months after the
Closing Date:

(a) neither Seller nor any of its controlled Affiliates shall, directly or
indirectly, solicit for employment or employ any Current Employee; provided,
however, that nothing herein shall prohibit Seller or any of its Affiliates
from repatriating or otherwise relocating any employees of Seller or any of
its Affiliates located in the U.S., including any Current Employee who is an
expatriate and, in his or her sole discretion, exercises the right under his
or her employment agreement to be repatriated or relocated by Seller in the
event of a change of control at the Company, Bank or other Company Subsidiary,
as applicable; and provided, further, that nothing herein shall be deemed to
prohibit any of Seller or its controlled Affiliates (or any of their
controlled Affiliates) from conducting any general solicitation or general
recruitment effort conducted by a third party and not targeted at any such
Current Employees or prohibit the solicitation or employment of any Current
Employee that (1) was terminated by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including, after Closing, the Company, the Bank and Company's other
Subsidiaries), or (2) voluntarily resigned from the employ of Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates after the Closing (including, after Closing, the Company,
the Bank and Company's other Subsidiaries) and has not been employed by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates for at least three (3) months prior to the
date of such employment; and



-54-





(b) neither Purchaser nor any of its controlled Affiliates (including, after
Closing, the Company, the Bank and Company's other Subsidiaries)) shall,
directly or indirectly, solicit for employment any employee of Seller or any
of its controlled Affiliates (including the Carve-Out Employees) with which
Purchaser or any of its controlled Affiliates was made aware of, or came into
contact with, in connection with the Transactions; provided, however, that
nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit any of Purchaser or any of its
controlled Affiliates from conducting any general solicitation or general
recruitment effort conducted by a third party and not specifically targeted at
any such employee of Seller or its controlled Affiliates (including the Carve-
Out Employees) or prohibit the solicitation or employment of any such employee
that (1) was terminated by Seller or any of its Affiliates, or (2) voluntarily
resigned from the employ of Seller or any of its Affiliates and has not been
employed by Seller or any of its Affiliates for at least three (3) months
prior to the date of such employment.

Section 5.9 Taxes.

(a) Indemnification. From and after the Closing,

(i) Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries)
shall pay or cause to be paid and hereby agree to indemnify and hold the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties harmless from and against any Excluded Taxes.

(ii) Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid and hereby agrees to indemnify
and hold Seller and its Affiliates harmless from and against any Purchaser
Indemnified Taxes. Seller shall be entitled to any refunds of Taxes (whether
in the form of cash received or a credit against Taxes otherwise payable)
received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of the Seller
Tax Period, except to the extent the entitlement to such refund (A) was
reflected as an asset in the Company's Quarterly Report filed on Form 10-Q
with the SEC for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 or (B) arises as a
result of a carryback to any Seller Tax Period of any net operating loss,
capital loss or other Tax attribute arising in a Purchaser Tax Period (or, in
the event of a Straddle Period, the netting of such Tax attributes arising in
a Purchaser Tax Period against income or gain arising in a Seller Tax Period).

(iii) In the case of any Taxes that are payable for a Straddle Period, the
portion of such Tax that relates to the portion of such taxable period ending
on the date hereof shall (A) in the case of any Taxes not based on net income
or on receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle
Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days
in the Straddle Period ending on the date hereof and the denominator of which
is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period and (B) in the case of any
Taxes based on net income or on receipts (e.g., sales and use Taxes), be
deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant taxable
period ended on the date hereof. To the extent any income of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is attributable to an interest in an entity or
arrangement classified as a partnership or other "flow-through" entity for Tax
purposes, such



-55-





entity or arrangement shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as if
its taxable year ended on the date hereof and Taxes attributable to the income
and gain of each such entity through the date hereof shall be considered to be
attributable to the portion of the taxable period ending on the date hereof.

(iv) No later than two (2) days prior to the due date (taking into account
extensions) for filing the consolidated U.S. federal income Tax Return of
Purchaser for the taxable period that includes the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the Company Transaction Expenses Tax
Benefit. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.9, Purchaser
shall not be required to claim (or cause the Company to claim) any deduction
in respect of any particular Company Transaction Expense unless Purchaser
reasonably determines that the deductibility of such Company Transaction
Expense is at least "more likely than not" to be sustained on the merits. In
the event that, as a result of the resolution of any audit or Tax Proceeding,
any deduction claimed by Purchaser or the Company in respect of Company
Transaction Expenses for which Purchaser made a payment pursuant to this
clause (iv) is subsequently required to be capitalized or otherwise
disallowed, Seller shall promptly repay to Purchaser the portion of the
Company Transaction Expenses Tax Benefits attributable to such disallowed
deduction, together with any interest, penalties, or additional amounts
imposed by a Taxing Authority on Purchaser or the Company.

(v) No later than two (2) Business Days prior to the due date (taking into
account extensions) for filing the consolidated U.S. federal income Tax Return
of the Company for the taxable period that ends on the Closing Date, Seller
shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to the Purchaser Tax Period Carve-Out
Entity Taxes. In the event that, as a result of the resolution of any audit or
Tax Proceeding, the amount of Purchaser Tax Period Carve-Out Entity Taxes
would be increased or decreased, Seller or Purchaser shall promptly make
adjusting payments, together with any interest, penalties, or additional
amounts imposed by a Taxing Authority on Purchaser or the Company in respect
of such audit or Tax Proceeding attributable to the Carve-Out Entities.

(vi) For the avoidance of doubt, no Person shall be entitled to recover more
than once with respect to the same amount (i.e. no double-counting).

(b) Tax Returns. Seller shall, at its own expense, be responsible for
preparing and filing (i) all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(including, for this purpose, the Carve-Out Entities) for all periods ending
on or prior to the Closing Date that are required to be filed on or prior to
the Closing Date (taking into account any applicable extensions) ("Company Tax
Returns") and (ii) all Tax Returns that include the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates other than
the Company and its Subsidiaries or the Carve-Out Entities, on the other hand
("Combined Tax Returns" and, together with the Company Tax Returns, "Seller
Tax



-56-





Returns"). All Seller Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with
the past practices of Seller or its applicable Affiliate except to the extent
(i) failure to do so would not adversely affect Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) or (ii) otherwise
required by a change in Law. Seller shall deliver, or cause to be delivered,
to Purchaser each Seller Tax Return (or in the case of any Combined Tax
Returns, the relevant portions thereof) at least thirty (30) calendar days
prior to the due date thereof (taking into account any extensions thereof) and
shall reflect on the filed return any reasonable comments received from
Purchaser in writing within twenty (20) calendar days following the date such
Tax Returns are delivered by Seller to Purchaser. Seller shall file or cause
to be filed all Seller Tax Returns and shall pay or cause to be paid any Taxes
shown as due on such Seller Tax Returns. Purchaser shall prepare and file all
Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are not Seller Tax
Returns ("Purchaser Tax Returns"), including, any consolidated federal income
Tax Return of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including, for this purpose,
the Carve-Out Entities) for periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date
that are required to be filed after the Closing Date (taking into account any
applicable extensions) and pay or cause to be paid any Taxes shown as due on
such Tax Returns (subject to Purchaser's right to indemnification for Excluded
Taxes and payment for Purchaser Tax Period Carve-Out Entity Taxes).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Purchaser shall have no
obligation to prepare or file any Tax Return for any Carve-Out Entities for
any taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the date of the Carve-
Out Transaction of such Carve-Out Entity. Purchaser Tax Returns for any Seller
Tax Period or Straddle Period shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
the past practices of the relevant entity except to the extent (i) failure to
do so would not adversely affect Seller or any of its Affiliates (including
the Company and its Subsidiaries), (ii) otherwise required by a change in Law,
or (iii) Purchaser reasonably determines that there is not at least
"substantial authority" for a material position reflected on such Tax Return,
provided, that Purchaser shall provide Seller at least twenty (20) days to
provide a written tax opinion, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Seller, of a nationally recognized law firm or accounting firm experienced in
Tax matters, concluding that there is at least "substantial authority" (as
defined under Section 6662 of the Code (or successor provisions thereof)) for
such position, and Purchaser agrees notwithstanding the provisions of Section
5.9(c) to file such Tax Return in a manner consistent with such written tax
opinion. No later than two (2) Business Days prior to the due date (taking
into account extensions) for Purchaser filing any Tax Return pursuant to this
Section 5.9(b), Seller shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, pay to
Purchaser an amount equal to any Excluded Taxes shown as due and payable with
respect to such Tax Return. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to the resolution of any
audit or Tax proceeding, neither Purchaser nor Seller shall take any Tax
reporting position inconsistent with the fair market value of each Carve-Out
Entity as used for purposes of calculating the payment pursuant to Section
2.2(c)(i)(A).

(c) Seller Review of Tax Returns. With respect to any Purchaser Tax Return
reflecting more than a de minimis amount of Excluded Taxes, Purchaser shall



-57-





provide Seller with copies of such Tax Return promptly after Purchaser has
prepared such Tax Return but in no event later than thirty (30) calendar days
prior to the due date (taking into account extensions) for filing such Tax
Return, provided, that in the case of any Tax Return required to be filed on a
monthly basis, Purchaser shall provide Seller with copies of such Tax Return
reasonably in advance of the due date therefor. If Seller disputes any items
shown on any such Tax Return affecting Excluded Taxes, Seller shall notify
Purchaser within twenty (20) calendar days after receiving such Tax Return.
Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good faith and use commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve any disputed items prior to the due date (taking
into account extensions) for filing such Tax Return. In the event that
Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve any disputed items prior to the due
date for filing such Tax Return, (i) Purchaser shall be permitted to file such
Tax Return reflecting Purchaser's position with respect to any disputed items,
(ii) as promptly as practicable following the filing of such Tax Return,
Seller and Purchaser shall cause a mutually selected independent accounting
firm to resolve such dispute (the costs and expenses of which shall be borne
equally by the parties), and (iii) to the extent necessary, Purchaser shall
file an amended Tax Return to reflect the resolution of such disputed items by
the independent accounting firm. No later than two (2) Business Days prior to
the due date (taking into account extensions) for Purchaser filing any Tax
Return pursuant to this Section 5.9(c), Seller shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, pay to Purchaser an amount equal to any Excluded Taxes shown as
due and payable with respect to such Tax Return.

(d) Transfer Taxes. All Transfer Taxes shall be borne and paid fifty percent
(50%) by Purchaser, on the one hand, and fifty percent (50%) by Seller, on the
other hand. The party responsible under applicable Law for filing the Tax
Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes shall prepare and timely file such
Tax Returns and promptly provide a copy of such Tax Returns to the other
party. Purchaser and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, reasonably cooperate to timely prepare and file any Tax Returns or other
filings relating to such Transfer Taxes, including any claim for exemption or
exclusion from the application or imposition of any Transfer Taxes.

(e) Tax Sharing Agreements. Effective as of no later than the Closing, any and
all Tax sharing or allocation agreements or arrangements to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (other than any customary Tax
indemnification provisions contained in commercial Contracts not primarily
related to Taxes (such as financing Contracts with Tax gross-up obligations or
leases with Tax escalation provisions)) shall be terminated, such that none of
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company
and its Subsidiaries) shall have any further liability thereunder; provided,
that, as promptly as practicable following the Closing, Seller shall cause any
amounts owing by BBVA (as defined in the Tax Sharing Agreement, dated August
1, 2014 to which it is a party) for taxable periods (or portions thereof)
ending on or prior to the Closing Date to be paid in full.



-58-





(f) Timing of Indemnity Payments. Except as otherwise provided in Section
5.9(a), Section 5.9(b) or Section 5.9(c), any payment required to be made
pursuant to this Section 5.9 shall be made within ten (10) days after
Purchaser makes written demand upon Seller (but, in the case of any payment
required to be made to a Taxing Authority, shall not be required to be made
sooner than two (2) Business Days prior to the due date thereof).

(g) Cooperation in Tax Proceedings.

(i) Purchaser and Seller will cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns of,
and any Tax Proceeding relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(including, for this purpose, the Carve-Out Entities). Cooperation includes
(A) the retention and (at the other party's request) the provision of records
and information in such party's possession that are reasonably relevant to the
filing of any such Tax Returns or Tax Proceeding and (B) making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided under this Section 5.9(g).

(ii) Each of Seller and Purchaser agree (A) to retain all books and records of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (including, for this purpose, the Carve-Out
Entities) with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including, for this purpose, the Carve-Out Entities) relating to
any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of
the statute of limitations (and any extensions thereof) of the respective
taxable periods, (B) to abide by all record retention agreements entered into
with any Governmental Authority and (C) to give the other party reasonable
written notice before transferring, destroying or discarding any books and
records and, if the other party so requests, allow such other party to take
possession of the books and records.

(iii) Purchaser and Seller further agree, and agree to cause their respective
Affiliates, to, upon request, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
any certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or customer
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person as may be
reasonably necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be
imposed with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.

(iv) Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.9(g), if any
claim or demand for Taxes that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a
claim for indemnification under Section 5.9(a) is asserted by any Governmental
Authority, the party first receiving notice of such claim or demand shall
notify the other party of such claim or demand promptly; provided, however,
that the failure of Purchaser to give such prompt notice shall not relieve
Seller of any of its indemnification obligations, except to the extent that
Seller is actually prejudiced by such failure. The Controlling Party shall, at
its own expense,



-59-





control any such Tax Proceeding of or with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (including, for this purpose, the Carve-Out Entities) for any
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date (other than a Tax
Proceeding described in Section 5.9(g)(v)) for which Seller may be obligated
to indemnify Purchaser under Section 5.9(a); provided that, (A) the
Controlling Party shall provide the Non-Controlling Party with a timely and
reasonably detailed account of each stage of such Tax Proceeding, (B) the
Controlling Party shall allow the Non-Controlling Party to consult in good
faith at the Non-Controlling Party's expense on the positions taken in such
Tax Proceeding, (C) the Controlling Party shall defend such Tax Proceeding
diligently and in good faith as if it were the only Person affected by such
Tax Proceeding, (D) the Non-Controlling Party and its representatives shall
have the right to participate in such Tax Proceeding, assist in the
preparation of any written materials in such Tax Proceeding and attend any
meetings or telephone conversations with the applicable Governmental
Authority, in each case, at the Non-Controlling Party's expense, and (E) the
Controlling Party shall not settle or compromise any such Tax Proceeding, if
such settlement or compromise could increase the liability for Taxes
(including under this Agreement) by more than a de minimis amount or reduce
any Tax attributes of the Non-Controlling Party or any of its Subsidiaries by
more than a de minimis amount, without obtaining the prior written consent of
the Non-Controlling Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). For purposes of this Section 5.9(g)(iv), the
"Controlling Party" with respect to a Tax Proceeding shall mean Purchaser
unless Seller is reasonably expected to bear a greater liability under Section
5.9(a) as a result of such Tax Proceeding and provides prompt written notice
to Purchaser of its intent to control such Tax Proceeding, and the "Non-
Controlling Party" shall mean whichever of Seller or Purchaser is not the
Controlling Party. Whether or not Seller chooses to defend or prosecute any
claim it is entitled to defend or prosecute hereunder, all of the parties
shall reasonably cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof.

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (A) Seller
shall have the exclusive right to control in all respects, and neither
Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall be entitled to participate in, any
Tax Proceeding with respect to (I) any Tax Return of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) and (II) any Tax
Return of an affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary or similar group that
includes Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) and (B) Purchaser shall have the exclusive right to control in
all respects, and neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be entitled
to participate in, any Tax Proceedings with respect to (I) any Tax Return of
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) and (II) any Tax Return of an affiliated, consolidated,
combined, unitary or similar group that includes Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries.



-60-





(vi) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.9(g), Purchaser shall have
the exclusive right to control all Tax Proceedings with respect to the Company
and its Subsidiaries, provided that in no event may Purchaser settle or
compromise any Tax Proceeding to the extent such resolution would reasonably
be expected to increase Seller's liability for Excluded Taxes under Section
5.9(a) by more than a de minimis amount without the prior written consent of
Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

(h) Purchase Price Adjustment. Any amounts paid pursuant to this Section 5.9
or Section 8.1 shall be treated as an adjustment to the Closing Purchase Price
for all income Tax purposes to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

(i) Survival and Coordination. Anything to the contrary in this Agreement
notwithstanding, (i) indemnification with respect to Taxes and the procedures
relating thereto shall be governed exclusively by this Section 5.9, and the
provisions of Article VIII shall not apply, and (ii) the covenants and
agreements contained in this Section 5.9 and the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.15 shall survive until thirty (30) days
following the expiration of the full period of all statutes of limitations
(giving effect to any extensions thereof), provided that any right to
indemnification for breach of covenant, agreement, representation or warranty
in respect of which indemnification may be sought under this Section 5.9 shall
survive the time at which it would otherwise terminate pursuant to Section
5.9(i) if notice of the right to indemnification or of the breach or
inaccuracy giving rise to such right of indemnification shall have been given
prior to such time.

Section 5.10 Employee Matters.

(a) Purchaser agrees that Purchaser shall provide, or shall cause to be
provided, with respect to each employee of the Bank, the Company and its other
Subsidiaries who is employed as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(each, a "Current Employee"), (i) during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date,
base salary or base wage, as applicable, which are no less favorable than
those provided by the Bank, the Company and its other Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time to each such Current Employee, and (ii) during the
period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2021, (x)
annual cash bonus opportunities which are no less favorable than the annual
cash bonus opportunities (including any portion thereof treated as deferred
compensation) provided by the Bank, the Company and its other Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time to each such Current Employee, (y)
pension and welfare benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate to
those provided by the Bank, the Company and its other Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time to each such Current Employee, and (z) subject to
the applicable Current Employee's execution and non-revocation of a release of
claims, cash severance benefits that are no less favorable than the cash
severance benefits provided by the Bank, the Company and its other
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time as set forth on Section
5.10(a) of the Seller's Disclosure Schedule.



-61-





(b) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, for purposes of vesting,
benefit accrual, vacation and sick time credit and eligibility to participate
under the employee benefit plans, programs and policies of Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries which may provide benefits to any Current Employee after the
Effective Time (including the Company Benefit Plans) (the "New Plans"), each
Current Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the
Seller, the Bank, the Company and its other Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Current
Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service
under any similar Benefit Plan in which such Current Employee participated or
was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided
that the foregoing shall not apply (i) to the extent that its application
would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service, or (ii) with respect to (A) benefit accrual, including level of pay
credits, under any employee pension benefit plan, (B) any benefit plan that is
a frozen benefit plan or provides grandfathered benefits, (C) any retiree
medical plans or arrangements or (D) any equity incentive awards granted by
Purchaser. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) each Current
Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time,
in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is
replacing comparable coverage under a Benefit Plan in which such Current
Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time, and (ii) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Current Employee, any evidence of insurability
requirements, all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Current Employee and his
or her covered dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or
waived under the comparable Benefit Plan. Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by any Current
Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of the Benefit Plan ending on the date such Current Employee's participation
in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New
Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket requirements applicable to such Current Employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year.

(c) Purchaser hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" or "change of
control" or term or concept of similar import for the Company Benefit Plans
identified in Section 5.10(c) of the Seller's Disclosure Schedule will occur
upon the Effective Time.

(d) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, if requested in
writing by Purchaser at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall terminate any and all 401(k) plans maintained by the
Bank, the Company and its other Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company
401(k) Plan"). In the event that Purchaser requests that the Company 401(k)
Plan be terminated, Seller shall provide Purchaser with evidence that the
Company 401(k) Plan has been so terminated, provided that prior to amending or
terminating the Company 401(k) Plan, Seller shall provide Purchaser with the
form and substance of any applicable resolutions or amendments for review and
approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). In connection with the termination of such plan, Purchaser shall
permit each Current Employee to make rollover contributions of "eligible
rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code,
including all



-62-





participant loans) in cash or notes (in the case of participant loans) in an
amount equal to the eligible rollover distribution portion of the account
balance distributed to each such Current Employee from such plan to an
"eligible retirement plan" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the
Code) of Purchaser or one of its Affiliates. If the Company 401(k) Plan is
terminated as described herein, the Current Employees shall be eligible to
commence participation in a 401(k) plan maintained by Purchaser or one of its
Affiliates as soon as administratively practicable following the Closing Date.

(e) Seller or the applicable Affiliate shall take all actions necessary to
cause all benefits under a Seller Benefit Plan (including, but not limited to,
any equity or equity-based awards and deferred compensation benefits) held by
or with respect to each employee, officer, director and independent contractor
of the Bank, the Company and its other Subsidiaries (other than the Carve-Out
Employees or Other U.S. Employees) to become vested in full no later than five
(5) Business Days prior to the Closing (subject to any applicable bank
regulatory Laws and regulations), and to be paid within thirty (30) days
following vesting or, if later, at the earliest time that would not result in
the application of a penalty under Section 409A of the Code; provided, that
any retention bonus amounts under the Retention Letters (as defined in the
Seller's Disclosure Schedule) will vest and be paid in accordance with their
terms.

(f) Seller shall take all actions necessary to cause all Carve-Out Employees
and all Other U.S. Employees to cease employment with the Bank, the Company
and its other Subsidiaries and to cause all Carve-Out Employees and all Other
U.S. Employees (and their eligible dependents) to cease participating in the
Company Benefit Plans prior to the Effective Time and for the liabilities and
obligations with respect to the Carve-Out Employees and Other U.S. Employees
under a Company Benefit Plan to be assumed by a Seller Benefit Plan, such that
from and after the Effective Time, Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the
Company and its Subsidiaries) and the Company Benefit Plans shall have no
liabilities or obligations to the Carve-Out Employees or the Other U.S.
Employees (and their eligible dependents). In addition, Seller shall take all
actions necessary to transfer the sponsorship of any Company Benefit Plans
which are sponsored by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries but primarily
maintained for the benefit of current or former employees, officers, directors
or independent contractors of the Seller or its Affiliates (other than the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries) to Seller or one of its Affiliates (other
than the Company and any of its Subsidiaries), which plans shall be considered
Seller Benefit Plans.

(g) The provisions of this Section 5.10 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Agreement, whether express or
implied, is intended to, or shall, (i) constitute the establishment or
adoption of or an amendment to any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA
or otherwise be treated as an amendment or modification of any Benefit Plan,
New Plan or other benefit plan, agreement or arrangement, (ii) limit the right
of Seller, the Bank, the Company, Purchaser or their respective Subsidiaries
or Affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Benefit Plan, New
Plan or other benefit plan, agreement or arrangement following the Effective
Time, (iii) interfere or restrict in any way the rights of Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates to discharge or terminate the services of any Current Employee
or other Person for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, or (iv)
create any third-party



-63-





beneficiary or other right (A) in any Person, including any current or former
employee of the Company, the Bank or any other Subsidiary of the Company, any
participant in any Benefit Plan, New Plan or other benefit plan, agreement or
arrangement (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof) or (B) to continued
employment with Seller, the Bank, the Company, any other Subsidiary of the
Company or Purchaser or any of its Affiliates.

(a) Except as expressly provided in this Section 5.11 or pursuant to the

Subsidiaries has any such rights, such rights shall be, and hereby are,
assigned to Seller effective as of the Closing. After the Closing, Purchaser

and all uses of any of the Seller Marks in accordance with the terms of the
Transitional Trademark License, (ii) to execute and deliver to Seller at such
time a written disclaimer of any rights to the Seller Marks and an
acknowledgment that the Seller Marks and the goodwill associated therewith are

the sole owners of all trademark and other rights, titles and interests in and
to the Seller Marks, and (iii) execute such other documents reasonably
requested by Seller from time-to-time to effectuate or evidence the foregoing.

-64-





adaptation thereof, or any Internet domain name, social media handle, Mark,
word or name confusingly similar thereto or embodying any of the foregoing,
whether alone or in combination with any other words, name or Marks, and
whether registered or unregistered (collectively, the "Company Marks"), and
that to the extent Seller or any of its Affiliates has any such rights, such
rights shall be, and hereby are, assigned to the Company effective as of the
Closing. After the Closing, Seller shall and shall cause their Affiliates (i)
to terminate any and all uses of any of the Company Marks promptly following
the Closing, (ii) to execute and deliver to Purchaser at such time a written
disclaimer of any rights to the Company Marks and an acknowledgment that the
Company Marks and the goodwill associated therewith are proprietary rights
belonging to the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company and that such entities
are the sole owners of all trademark and other rights, titles and interests in
and to the Company Marks, and (iii) execute such other documents reasonably
requested by Purchaser from time-to-time to effectuate or evidence the
foregoing. Seller acknowledges and agrees that neither Seller nor any of their
Affiliates shall after the Closing, use, seek to use, adopt, register or apply
for registration of any Company Mark.

(c) Prior to Closing, the Bank, the Company and the other Subsidiaries shall
transfer to Seller (or an Affiliate of Seller designated by Seller) (i) any
Seller Marks owned by the Bank, the Company and the other Subsidiaries and
(ii) any Intellectual Property that is owned by the Bank, the Company or the
other Subsidiaries and exclusively used in, or exclusively related to, the
businesses of the Carve-Out Entities. For the avoidance of doubt, no
Intellectual Property owned by the Carve-Out Entities as of the date hereof,
or developed by or on behalf of the Carve-Out Entities after the date hereof
and prior to Closing, shall be transferred from the Carve-Out Entities to the
Bank, the Company or the other Subsidiaries as part of the Carve-Out
Transactions.

Section 5.12 Intercompany Items. Except as set forth in Section 5.12 of the
Seller's Disclosure Schedule, prior to the Closing, Seller shall take, or

Contracts are terminated (except as necessary to effectuate the delivery of
services under the Transitional Services Agreement, Reverse Transitional

Intercompany Receivables or Intercompany Payables shall have been settled or
paid (except for any Intercompany Payables or Intercompany Receivables solely

Transactions pursuant to Section 5.14); provided that the parties hereby agree
to work in good faith to agree upon mutually acceptable procedures for the

as well as Seller's other non-U.S. banks that act as receiving banks and
paying agents for money transmissions with BBVATransfer Services, Inc., to

the distribution agreements between BBVA Transfer Services, Inc. and such
Persons, such that the agreements and arrangements continue for an initial
one-year period following the Closing (notwithstanding any change-of-control

ultimate beneficial owner of BSI's U.S. retail brokerage accounts, and, as
promptly as practicable following the date hereof, the Seller and the
Purchaser shall engage with their respective clearing brokers and FINRA with

changes in respect of such proposed structuring as may be required or deemed
advisable by such clearing brokers or FINRA. Seller, Company and the Purchaser
shall undertake the matters contemplated by this Section 5.14 in a manner that

(including the directors of the Company) from any and all liabilities to the

exercising rights under Section 8.1), and (b) Seller shall execute releases

in the future from events or occurrences taking place prior to or as of the
Closing Date and from any obligations under Contracts to which Seller or any
of its Affiliates (other than the Company, the Bank and Company's other
Subsidiaries) is a party (x) under which the Company, the Bank and Company's
other Subsidiaries are provided with services, property or other assets that
are used in the conduct of their respective businesses, (y) that contain any
exclusive dealing or third party referral arrangements imposed on the Company,
the Bank or Company's other Subsidiaries, or any non-competition or non-
solicitation covenants that purport to limit the freedom from and after the
Closing of the Company, the Bank and Company's other Subsidiaries to compete
in any line of business or with any Person or in any area, or (z) for which
there are any costs or



-66-





expenses that would be incurred by the Company, the Bank and Company's other

such Contracts.

another to prepare and file all documents and forms and amendments thereto as
may be required by applicable Law with respect to the Transactions.

solely the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries) from his or her
position as director and/or officer of the Company and/or each applicable
Company Subsidiary, effective as of the Effective Time.

Section 5.18 DandO Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) Except with respect to any case involving fraud, from and after the
Effective Time, in the event of any threatened or actual Action in the U.S.,
whether civil, criminal or administrative, in which any Person who is now, or
has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior
to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or who is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as a director or officer or agent of another Person, is, or
is threatened to be, made a party or witness based in whole or in part on, or
arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining in whole or in part to, (i)
the fact that such Person is serving or did serve in any such capacity, (ii)
this Agreement or the Transactions, whether asserted or arising before or
after the Effective Time, (iii) any liability or obligation of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any action or failure to take action by any
such director, officer or agent in his or her capacity as such occurring in
whole or in part prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and Purchaser
shall cause the Company to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, as and to the
fullest extent permitted or required by applicable Law, each such Person
against any Losses (including reimbursement for legal and other fees and
expenses incurred in advance of the final disposition of any such matter or
investigation to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, provided that
the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any such threatened or actual Action in the U.S. Such Persons
shall reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser, the Company and their
Subsidiaries in the defense of any such threatened or actual Action and none
of the Purchaser, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries shall have any
liability hereunder in respect of any compromise or settlement of any action
or claim effected without the prior written consent of the Purchaser (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).



-67-

5.18(a), all rights to indemnification and all limitations on Losses existing
in favor of the directors, officers and employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as provided in their respective Constituent Documents as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement or in any indemnification agreement in
existence on the date of this Agreement with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall continue in full force and effect to the fullest extent
permitted by Law and shall be honored by the Company and its Subsidiaries or
their respective successors as if they were the indemnifying party thereunder,
without any amendment thereto. To the extent not already in effect at Closing,
as soon as practicable after Closing, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause the
Company or the Bank, as applicable, to use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain a "tail" insurance policy with respect to directors' and officers'
liability insurance that covers for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time the individuals serving as directors and officers of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time for
acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, with coverage and
amounts appropriate for the size and scope of the Company and its Subsidiaries
in amounts consistent with the coverage existing as of the Closing, with
respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing that were
committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as such; provided,
however, that in no event shall the Purchaser, Company or Bank be required to
expend for such insurance policy an annual premium amount in excess of two-
hundred fifty percent (250%) of the annual premiums currently paid by the
Company for such insurance.

other Subsidiary of the Company shall, directly or indirectly, through any
representative or otherwise, solicit or entertain offers from, negotiate with
or in any manner encourage, discuss, accept or consider any proposal of any
other person relating to the acquisition of the Shares or shares, or
substantially all the assets, of the Company or the Bank (an "Acquisition
Proposal") (other than acquisition of OREO property held by the Bank or
certain Subsidiaries of the Company in the ordinary course of their business

Section 8.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties; Indemnification.

(a) The representations and warranties of the parties shall survive until the
date that is eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date, provided that
the Seller's Fundamental Representations and the Purchaser's Fundamental
Representations shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute
of limitations, and provided, further, that survival of the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 3.15 shall be governed by Section 5.9(i).
Except as provided in Section 5.9(i), the covenants and agreements contained
in this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time until fully performed in
accordance with their respective terms, provided that the covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement that by their terms apply or are to be
performed entirely prior to the Effective Time shall only survive until the
period specified in the immediately preceding sentence. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentences, any breach of representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Agreement
shall survive the time at which it would otherwise terminate if (and to the
extent) prior to such time notice of the breach giving rise to such right of
indemnity shall have been given in accordance with this Section 8.1 to the
party against whom indemnity is sought, in which case such breach shall
survive until final resolution of such claim (or, if earlier, the latest date
permitted by applicable Law).

(b) Effective at and after the Closing and subject to the other provisions of
this Section 8.1, Seller hereby agrees to indemnify Purchaser and its
Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) and their respective
Representatives (collectively, the "Purchaser Indemnified Parties") against
and agrees to hold each of them harmless from, and reimburse any Purchaser
Indemnified Party for, any and all Losses suffered by a Purchaser Indemnified
Party as a result of or relating to:

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any Seller Fundamental Representation or the
certificate delivered at Closing in respect thereof determined without giving
effect to any limitations as to materiality or "Material Adverse Effect" set
forth therein;

(ii) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation and warranty made by
Seller set forth in this Agreement or the certificate delivered at Closing in
respect thereof (other than the Seller Fundamental Representations and the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.15 (which matters are
addressed in Section 5.9) without giving effect to any limitations as to
materiality or "Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein (other than in
Section 3.6(g));

(iii) any breach, failure, nonfulfillment or default by Seller in the
performance of or compliance with any of the covenants or agreements made or
to be performed by Seller pursuant to this Agreement;

(iv) any Company Transaction Expenses that were not (A) paid in full at or
prior to the Closing, (B) borne entirely by Seller or any of its Affiliates
(other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), or (C) deducted from the
Purchase Price paid pursuant to Section 2.2(c)(i);



-72-





(v) (x) the Seller Benefit Plans and any (y) liabilities with respect to
current or former employees of Seller (other than the Current Employees and
former employees whose final service within Seller's controlled group (as
defined in Sections 414(b) and (c) of the Code) was with the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries); and

(vi) any Carve-Out Entity, the Carve-Out Employees, the Other U.S. Employees
and the Carve-Out Transactions.

Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, Seller shall not be
required to indemnify or hold harmless any Purchaser Indemnified Party
against, or reimburse any Purchaser Indemnified Party for, any Losses pursuant
to Section 8.1(b)(ii) (A) with respect to any claim (or series of claims
arising from similar or related underlying facts, events or circumstances,
including as more specifically described in Section 8.1(b) of the Seller's
Disclosure Schedule) unless such claim (or series of claims arising from
similar or related underlying facts, events or circumstances, including as
more specifically described in Section 8.1(b) of the Seller's Disclosure
Schedule) involves Losses in excess of $200,000 (nor shall any such claim (or
series of claims arising from similar or related underlying facts, events or
circumstances, including as more specifically described in Section 8.1(b) of
the Seller's Disclosure Schedule) that does not meet such $200,000 threshold
be applied to or considered for purposes of calculating the aggregate amount
of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties' Losses for which Seller has
responsibility under Section 8.1(b)(ii)), in which event all such Losses for
such claim (or series of claims) shall be considered for purposes of
calculating the aggregate amount of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties' Losses
for which Seller has responsibility under Section 8.1(b)(ii), and (B) until
the aggregate amount of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties' Losses exceeds
$100,000,000 (such amount, the "Basket"), after which Seller shall be
obligated for all such Losses of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in excess
of the amount of the Basket.

Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, the cumulative aggregate
indemnification obligation of Seller under Section 8.1(b)(ii) shall not exceed
$1,200,000,000 (the "Cap"), and the cumulative aggregate indemnification
obligation of Seller under Sections 8.1(b)(i)-(ii) shall not exceed the
Closing Purchase Price (as adjusted hereunder), other than in respect of
Losses arising as a result of fraud.

(c) Effective at and after the Closing and subject to the other provisions of
this Section 8.1, Purchaser hereby indemnifies Seller and its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified
Parties") against and agrees to hold each of them harmless from, and reimburse
any Seller Indemnified Party for, any and all Losses suffered by a Seller
Indemnified Party as a result of or relating to:

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any Purchaser Fundamental Representation or
the certificate delivered at Closing in respect thereof determined without
giving effect to any limitations as to materiality or "Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect" set forth therein;



-73-





(ii) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation and warranty made by
Purchaser set forth in this Agreement or the certificate delivered at Closing
in respect thereof (other than the Purchaser Fundamental Representations)
determined without giving effect to any limitations as to materiality or
"Purchaser Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein; or

(iii) any breach, failure, nonfulfillment or default by Purchaser in the
performance of or compliance with any of the covenants or agreements made or
to be performed by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, Purchaser shall not be
required to indemnify or hold harmless any Seller Indemnified Party against,
or reimburse any Seller Indemnified Party for, any Losses pursuant to Section
8.1(c)(ii) (A) with respect to any claim (or series of related claims arising
from similar or related underlying facts, events or circumstances) unless such
claim (or series of related claims arising from similar or related underlying
facts, events or circumstances) involves Losses in excess of $200,000 (nor,
subject to the foregoing, shall any such item that does not meet such $200,000
threshold be applied to or considered for purposes of calculating the
aggregate amount of the Seller Indemnified Parties' Losses for which Purchaser
has responsibility under Section 8.1(c)(ii)), in which event all such Losses
for such claim (or series of claims) shall be considered for purposes of
calculating the aggregate amount of the Seller Indemnified Parties' Losses for
which Purchaser has responsibility under Section 8.1(c)(ii), and (B) until the
aggregate amount of the Seller Indemnified Parties' Losses exceeds the Basket,
after which Purchaser shall be obligated for all such Losses of the Seller
Indemnified Parties in excess of the amount of the Basket.

Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, the cumulative aggregate
indemnification obligation of Purchaser under Section 8.1(c)(ii) shall not
exceed the Cap, and the cumulative aggregate indemnification obligation of
Purchaser under Section 8.1(c)(i)-(ii) shall not exceed the Closing Purchase
Price (as adjusted hereunder), other than in respect of Losses arising as a
result of fraud.

(d) If an Indemnified Purchaser Party or an Indemnified Seller Party (each, an
"Indemnified Party") believes that a claim, demand or other circumstance
exists that has given or may reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of
indemnification under this Section 8.1, such Indemnified Party shall assert
its claim for indemnification by giving written notice thereof (a "Claim
Notice") to the Seller (if indemnification is sought from the Seller) or
Purchaser (if indemnification is sought from Purchaser) (in either such case,
the "Indemnifying Party") (i) if the event or occurrence giving rise to such
claim for indemnification is, or relates to, a claim, suit, action or
proceeding brought by a Person not a party to this Agreement or affiliated
with any such party (a "Third Party"), promptly following receipt of notice of
such claim, suit, action or proceeding by such Indemnified Party, or (ii) if
the event or occurrence giving rise to such claim for indemnification is not,
or does not relate to, a claim, suit, action or proceeding brought by a Third
Party, promptly after the discovery by the Indemnified Party of the
circumstances giving rise to such claim for indemnity; provided, however, that
any failure or delay in providing such notice shall not release the
Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Section 8.1



-74-





except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure or
delay. Each Claim Notice shall describe the claim in reasonable detail
including (i) the legal and factual basis of the claim, (ii) an estimate of
the amount of Losses which are, or are to be, the subject of the claim and
(iii) such other information as is reasonably necessary to enable the
Indemnifying Party to assess the merits of the claim (in each case in
(i)-(iii), to the extent then known or reasonably ascertainable).

(e) If any claim or demand by an Indemnified Party under this Section 8.1
relates to an action or claim filed or made against an Indemnified Party by a
Third Party, the Indemnifying Party may, at its option, assume and control the
defense of such action or claim (including, subject to the remainder of this
Section 8.1(e), any negotiation relating thereto and the settlement or
compromise thereof) at its sole cost and expense and with its own counsel
(which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party), if
the Indemnifying Party elects to assume such defense within thirty (30) days
of the Claim Notice; provided, however, that an Indemnifying Party shall not
have the right to assume and control the defense of any criminal or regulatory
action or claim, any claim seeking non-monetary remedies, or any claim where
the portion of the claim for which the Indemnified Party would not be
indemnified is reasonably likely to exceed the portion of the claim for which
it would be indemnified. The parties shall cooperate in the defense of such
action or claim, and, unless and until the Indemnifying Party shall have so
assumed the defense of such action or claim, the reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense, settlement or compromise of
such claim or action shall be a Loss subject to indemnification hereunder to
the extent provided herein. Any Indemnified Party shall have the right to
employ separate counsel in any such action or claim and to participate in the
defense thereof, and the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred
by the Indemnified Party's separate counsel in connection with the defense,
settlement or compromise of such claim or action shall be a Loss subject to
indemnification hereunder provided (i) the Indemnifying Party is not entitled
to assume and control the defense of such action or claim pursuant to this
Section 8.1(e) or shall have failed within thirty (30) days after receipt of a
Claim Notice in respect of such action or claim to assume the defense of such
action or claim or to notify the Indemnified Party in writing that it will
assume the defense of such action or claim; (ii) the employment of such
counsel has been specifically authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party
at the Indemnifying Party's expense; (iii) the Indemnified Party's counsel
shall have concluded that there is or may be a conflict of interest or one or
more legal defenses or counterclaims available to such Indemnified Party or to
other Indemnified Parties which are different from or additional to those
available to the Indemnifying Party such that it would be inappropriate or
inadvisable in the reasonable judgment of Indemnified Party's counsel for the
same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party; or (iv) the Indemnifying Party ceases to diligently defend such Claims.

(f) No Indemnifying Party shall be liable to indemnify any Indemnified Party
for any compromise or settlement of any action or claim effected without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), but if settled with the consent of the
Indemnifying Party, or if there be final judgment for the plaintiff in any
such action that the Indemnified Party is required to pay by the court at the



-75-





time paid, the Indemnifying Party shall indemnify and hold harmless each
Indemnified Party from and against any Loss by reason of such settlement or
judgment, subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 8.1. If the
Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense of any claim in accordance with
the provisions of this Section 8.1, the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) before entering into any settlement of such
claim unless (i) the relief consists solely of monetary damages to be paid
entirely by the Indemnifying Party (or a liability insurer thereof) (other
than the Deductible, if any, to be paid by the Indemnified Party), (ii) the
settlement includes no admission or finding of any violation of Law or
admission of wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party, and (iii) the settlement
includes a provision whereby the plaintiff or claimant releases the
Indemnified Parties from all liability with respect thereto. Each Indemnified
Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party all information
reasonably available to such Indemnified Party relating to such action or
claim the provision of which would not, in the reasonable judgment of the
Indemnified Party, violate or jeopardize any applicable attorney-client or
other privilege. In addition, the parties shall render to each other such
assistance as may reasonably be requested in order to help ensure the proper
and adequate defense of any such action or claim. The party in charge of the
defense shall keep the other parties reasonably apprised at all times as to
the status of the defense or any settlement negotiations with respect thereto.

(g) Purchaser and, after the Closing, the Company shall take and shall cause
its Affiliates to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Loss for
which any of them could be entitled to indemnification under this Section 8.1
upon becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to, or
does actually, give rise thereto, including incurring costs to the extent
necessary to remedy the breach which gives rise to such Loss (which costs, for
the avoidance of doubt, shall be considered Loss).

(h) The amount which the Indemnifying Party is or may be required to pay to
any Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 8.1 shall be reduced
(retroactively, if necessary) by any insurance proceeds or other amounts
actually recovered by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party in reduction of
the related Loss, net of any deductibles or other expenses incurred in
connection therewith. If an Indemnified Party shall have received the payment
required by this Agreement from the Indemnifying Party in respect of Loss and
shall subsequently receive insurance proceeds or other amounts in respect of
such Loss, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly repay to the
Indemnifying Party a sum equal to the amount of such net insurance proceeds or
other net amounts actually received. In calculating the amount of any Loss,
there shall be deducted an amount equal to any net Tax benefit actually
realized (including, without limitation, the utilization of a Tax loss or Tax
credit carried forward) as a result of such Loss by the Indemnified Party
claiming such Loss in the taxable year in which such Loss occurred (determined
on a "with and without" basis).

(i) With respect to the indemnification obligation set forth in this Section
8.1, in no event shall (i) the Indemnifying Party have any liability to the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates for any consequential, indirect,
speculative, incidental, special or punitive damages, except to the extent
awarded to Third Party by a court of competent jurisdiction, (ii) the



-76-





Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates be entitled to recover from the
Indemnifying Party under this Section 8.1 more than once in respect of the
same Loss; or (iii) the Indemnifying Party be liable for any Loss which is
contingent unless and until such contingent Loss becomes an actual liability
and is due and payable.

(j) The indemnification provided in this Section 8.1 shall be the exclusive
remedy available to any party hereto with respect to any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or
otherwise in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
claims relating to this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant
hereto, except (i) in the case of fraud or willful misconduct, or with respect
to matters for which the remedy of specific performance, injunctive relief or
other non-monetary equitable remedies are available in accordance with Section
8.5, (ii) with respect to Taxes (the indemnification for which shall be
governed exclusively by Section 5.9), or (iii) as otherwise expressly provided
in this Agreement.

Section 8.2 Waiver; Amendment. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended
or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed,
in the case of an amendment, by the parties hereto, or in the case of a
waiver, by the party or parties against whom the waiver is to be effective. No
failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

Section 8.3 Entire Agreement. The Transaction Documents and the
Confidentiality Agreement represent the entire understanding of the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede any
and all other oral or written agreements heretofore made.

Section 8.4 Assignment. No party to this Agreement may assign any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement (whether by operation of law or
otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. Any
attempted or purported assignment in contravention of this provision shall be
null and void.

Section 8.5 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not to be performed as required by their
specific terms or were to be otherwise breached, including, for the avoidance
of doubt, a breach of Section 5.5, irreparable damage will occur, no adequate
remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and
that such parties shall be entitled, without the necessity of posting a bond
or other security, to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches, and to
specific performance of the terms, of this Agreement, in addition to any other
remedy at law or equity.

Section 8.6 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts (including by facsimile, email or other electronic means such as
".pdf" or ".tiff" files), each of which shall be deemed to constitute an
original, but all of which together shall be deemed to constitute one and the
same instrument.

Section 8.8 Provisions Separable.

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the
invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity
or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or entity or any
circumstance, is found by a court or other Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons, entities or circumstances
shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such
invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability, of such
provision, or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

(b) Without limiting generality of the foregoing, the parties acknowledge and
agree that (i) the covenants and agreements set forth in Section 5.7 and
Section 5.8 were a material inducement to the parties to enter into this
Agreement and to perform their respective



-79-





obligations hereunder, and (ii) if any portion of any provisions in Section
5.7 or Section 5.8 is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions
of Section 5.7 and Section 5.8 will remain in full force and effect to the
maximum extent permitted by Law.

Section 8.9 Parties in Interest. This Agreement will be binding upon, inure to
the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Except as set forth in Section 5.18, nothing
in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer any rights or
remedies under or by reason of this Agreement upon any Person other than the
parties hereto and their successors or permitted assigns.

Section 8.10 Expenses. Except as otherwise specifically provided in the
Transaction Documents, each party hereto will bear all expenses incurred by it
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (it
being understood and agreed that all such expenses incurred by or on behalf of
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Carve-Out Entities shall be
the responsibility of the Seller).

Section 8.11 Deadlines. If the last day of the time period for the giving of
any notice or the taking of any action required under this Agreement falls on
a day that is not a Business Day, the time period for giving such notice or
taking such action shall be extended through the Business Day immediately
following the original expiration date of such action.

Section 8.12 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY OF THEM AGAINST
THE OTHER ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR ANY
OTHER AGREEMENTS EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, OR THE ADMINISTRATION
THEREOF OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN OR THEREIN. NO PARTY TO
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL SEEK A JURY TRIAL IN ANY LAWSUIT, PROCEEDING,
COUNTERCLAIM, OR ANY OTHER ACTION PROCEDURE BASED UPON, OR ARISING OUT OF,
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY RELATED INSTRUMENTS OR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE
PARTIES. NO PARTY WILL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH ACTION, IN WHICH A JURY
TRIAL HAS BEEN WAIVED, WITH ANY OTHER ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE
OR HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION HAVE BEEN FULLY
DISCUSSED BY THE PARTIES HERETO, AND THESE PROVISIONS SHALL BE SUBJECT TO NO
EXCEPTIONS. NO PARTY HAS IN ANY WAY AGREED WITH OR REPRESENTED TO ANY OTHER
PARTY THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION WILL NOT BE FULLY ENFORCED IN ALL
INSTANCES.

Section 8.13 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction. The execution,
interpretation, and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the
laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any conflict of laws
provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of the law of any other jurisdiction other
than the State of New York. EACH PARTY HERETO, TO THE EXTENT IT MAY LAWFULLY
DO SO, HEREBY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY COURT OF THE STATE
OF NEW YORK LOCATED IN THE BOROUGH OF

HAVE AS TO VENUE IN ANY OF SUCH COURTS. The parties hereby consent to and
grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and, to the
extent permitted by Law, over the subject matter of such dispute and agree
that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or
proceeding in the manner provided in Section 8.7 or in such other manner as

in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to
serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

majeure, impossibility, impracticability, frustration of purpose or similar
