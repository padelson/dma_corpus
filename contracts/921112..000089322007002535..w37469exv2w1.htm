 _Section 2.2 __Exchange Procedures_  

   

 _Section 2.2.1 __Exchange Agent_ _._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate Wells Fargo Shareowner Services, or another bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), to act as agent for the Purchaser Parties for purposes of, among other things, mailing and receiving letters of transmittal, and distributing the Merger Consideration and the Partnership Merger Consideration to the Company Shareholders and the Partnership Unitholders. Parent will enter into an exchange agent agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company prior to the Effective Time. All of the fees and expenses of the Exchange Agent shall be borne by Parent.

Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall make, payments of the Merger Consideration and the Partnership Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement, the Articles of Merger and the Partnership Certificates of Merger, and the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. 

   ##### 

  

  

 _Section 2.2.2 __Exchange Procedures for Common Share Certificates_. No later than two Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Common Share Certificate, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, which evidenced Company Common Shares that were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1_ (a) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Common Share Certificate shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Common Share Certificate to the Exchange Agent and shall be in customary form) and (b) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Common Share Certificate in exchange for the Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement. Upon surrender of a Common Share Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and upon surrender of such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Common Share Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Company Common Shares formerly evidenced by such Common Share Certificate, and the Common Share Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration. In the event of a permitted transfer of ownership of Company Common Shares which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a transferee if the Common Share Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2.2_, each Common Share Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration. 

  

 _Section 2.2.3 __Exchange Procedures for Partnership Units_ _._ No later than two Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Partnership Unit registered on the transfer books of the Operating Partnership, as of immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, which were converted into the right to receive the Partnership Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1_ (a) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify the number of Partnership Units held by such holder and shall be in customary form) and (b) instructions for use in effecting the delivery thereof in exchange for the Partnership Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement. Upon delivery of such letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and upon surrender of such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the Partnership Unitholder identified in such letter of transmittal shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Partnership Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Partnership Units held by such holder immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Partnership Merger Consideration. In the event of a permitted transfer of ownership of any Partnership Unit which is not registered in the transfer records of the Operating Partnership, the Partnership Merger Consideration may be paid to a transferee if the letter of transmittal is delivered in accordance with this _Section 2.2.3_ and is accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable transfer taxes have been paid. 

  

 _Section 2.2.4 __No Further Ownership Rights_. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Common Share Certificates evidencing Company Common Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article 2_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights and privileges pertaining to the Company Common Shares exchanged theretofore and evidenced by such Common Share Certificates, and at and after the Effective Time, holders of Company Common Shares shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of the Company other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with this  _Article 2_. The Partnership Merger Consideration paid with respect to Partnership Units that are exchanged therefor in accordance with the terms of this _Article 2_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights and privileges pertaining to Partnership Units exchanged therefor, and at and after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the holder of any such Partnership Unit shall have no further rights with respect to any such Partnership Unit, other than the right to receive the Partnership Merger Consideration provided under this _Article 2_.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Purchaser, the Company, the Operating Partnership, Parent LP, the Surviving Company or the Surviving Partnership shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Shares or Partnership Units for any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

To secure the Companys obligation to pay these amounts, at the time the Company is obligated to pay Parent the Termination Fee pursuant to  _Section 7.2.2_, the Company shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the Termination Fee with an escrow agent selected by the Company and on such customary terms (subject to _Section 7.3.2_) as shall be reasonably acceptable to each of the Company, Parent and the escrow agent. For the avoidance of doubt, the payment or deposit into escrow by the Company of the amount equal to the Termination Fee in accordance with this _Section 7.3.1 _shall discharge and satisfy in full the Companys obligations to pay such Termination Fee to Parent pursuant to  _Section 7.2.2_. 

  

 _Section 7.3.2 _The Escrow Agreement shall provide that the Termination Fee in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to Parent unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i) a letter from Parents independent certified public accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to Parent without causing Parent to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income or a subsequent letter from Parents accountants revising that amount, in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount to Parent, or (ii) a letter from Parents counsel indicating that Parent received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by Parent of the Termination Fee would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (or alternatively, Parents outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by Parent of the Termination Fee would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code), in which case the Escrow Agreement shall provide that the escrow agent shall release to Parent the lesser of such maximum amount stated in the accountants letter referred to in clause (i) and the remainder of the Termination Fee. The Company and the Operating Partnership agree to amend this  _Section 7.3_ at the reasonable request of Parent in order to ( _x_ ) maximize the portion of the Termination Fee that may be distributed to Parent hereunder without causing Parent to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (y) improve Parents chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this _Section 7.3.2_ or (z) assist Parent in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its outside counsel as described in this _Section 7.3.2_. The Escrow Agreement shall also provide that any portion of the Termination Fee held in escrow for five years shall be released by the escrow agent to the Company. Neither the Company nor the Operating Partnership shall bear any cost of or have liability resulting from the Escrow Agreement.

 _Section 8.12.2 _Each of the parties irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Maryland, and any appellate court thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (a) agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding except in such courts, (b) agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any federal or state court in Maryland, (c) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in any federal or state court in Maryland, and (d) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any federal or state court in Maryland. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in _Section 8.3_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

 _Section 8.12.3 _EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS  _SECTION 8.12.3_. 

  

 _Section 8.13 __Disclosure_. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in a disclosure schedule to this Agreement shall not be construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement. Such information and the dollar thresholds set forth herein shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the terms "material" or "Material Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in this Agreement. Nothing disclosed in any disclosure schedule is intended to or shall be deemed to broaden the scope of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement. 

   

 _Section 8.14 __Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 

   

 _Section 8.15 __Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to any valid termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section 7.1_, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any federal or state court in Maryland having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
