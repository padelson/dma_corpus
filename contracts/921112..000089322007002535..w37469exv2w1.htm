deliver to Parent at the Closing evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the resignation from
their corporate or entity offices only (as opposed to any employment position), effective as of the
Company Merger Effective Time, of those directors, trustees, managers and officers of the Company,
the Operating Partnership or any Company Subsidiary designated by Parent to the Company in writing
at least five calendar days prior to the Closing; provided, however, that such resignation shall
not be deemed to constitute voluntary termination of employment, or termination of employment
without good reason, by such directors, trustees, managers or officers for purposes of any Company
Benefit Plan or other severance or employment agreements or programs, or other plans, programs or
agreements which contain change in control provisions, of the Company, the Operating Partnership or
any Company Subsidiary, and such resignation shall not be deemed to deprive any such directors,
trustees, managers or officers of any severance, change in control or other benefit to which such
person would otherwise be eligible to receive upon a termination of employment with the Company,
the Operating Partnership or any Company Subsidiary. The Company and Parent further acknowledge
and agree that any such resignation, or other removal from corporate or entity office of such
director, trustee, manager or officer by operation of Law
or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement, shall be deemed to constitute a material reduction in
duties, authority and responsibility for purposes of the definition of &#147;Constructive Termination&#148;
or &#147;Good Reason&#148;, as applicable, pursuant to the severance and employment agreements set forth on

indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to Parent without causing Parent
to fail to meet the requirements of Sections&nbsp;856(c)(2) and (3)&nbsp;of the Code determined as if the
payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income or a subsequent letter from Parent&#146;s
accountants revising that amount, in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount to
Parent, or (ii)&nbsp;a letter from Parent&#146;s counsel indicating that Parent received a ruling from the
IRS holding that the receipt by Parent of the Termination Fee would either constitute Qualifying
Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections&nbsp;856(c)(2) and (3)&nbsp;of
the Code (or alternatively, Parent&#146;s outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect
that the receipt by Parent of the Termination Fee would either constitute Qualifying Income or
would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections&nbsp;856(c)(2) and (3)&nbsp;of the Code),
in which case the Escrow Agreement shall provide that the escrow agent shall release to Parent the
lesser of such maximum amount stated in the accountant&#146;s letter referred to in clause (i)&nbsp;and the
remainder of the Termination Fee. The Company and the Operating Partnership agree to amend this
<U>Section&nbsp;7.3</U> at the reasonable request of Parent in order to (<U>x</U>) maximize the
portion of the Termination Fee that may be distributed to Parent hereunder without causing Parent
to fail to meet the requirements of Sections&nbsp;856(c)(2) and (3)&nbsp;of the Code, (y)&nbsp;improve Parent&#146;s
chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this <U>Section&nbsp;7.3.2</U> or (z)&nbsp;assist Parent
in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its outside counsel as described in this <U>Section
7.3.2</U>. The Escrow Agreement shall also provide that any portion of the Termination Fee held in
escrow for five years shall be released by the escrow agent to the Company. Neither the Company nor
the Operating Partnership shall bear any cost of or have liability resulting from the Escrow
Agreement.
