Inventory Count. In connection with such Physical Inventory Count, the Company

operation of the business of the Company and, with respect to third party

agree to work together in good faith in order to develop procedures to permit
the conduct of such Physical Inventory Count, subject to the limitations of
the Company's legal and contractual rights with respect to third parties in

be permitted reasonable access, during normal business hours, in such manner
as to not interfere with the normal operation of the business of the Company,
to review the Company's books and records and any work papers (subject to
Buyer and its representatives entering into any reasonable and customary
undertakings required by the Company's accountants in connection therewith)
related to the preparation of the Estimated Closing Statement. Buyer and its accountants and other representatives may
make reasonable inquiries of the Company and its accountants and employees
regarding questions concerning or disagreements with the Estimated Closing
Statement arising in the course of their review thereof, and the Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such accountants and
employees to cooperate with and respond to such inquiries. The Company shall
consider in good faith Buyer's comments regarding the contents of the
Estimated Closing Statement that are received no later than two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date. Seller shall issue an updated Estimated
Closing Statement reflecting such of Buyer's comments as Seller does not

Estimated Closing Statement (it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt,
that any failure of Buyer to dispute any item or aspect of the Estimated
Closing Statement pursuant to this paragraph shall not preclude Buyer from
exercising any other rights under this Agreement).

Date, and in any event within ninety (90) calendar days thereof, Buyer shall

Calculation Time ("Closing Date Funded Debt"), (iii) a calculation of the
Company Transaction Expenses as of immediately prior to the Closing ("Closing
Date Company Transaction Expenses"), (iv) a calculation of Cash as of the
Calculation Time ("Closing Date Cash"), and (v) the Adjustment Amount (if
any), in each case, calculated in accordance with the Accounting Principles.

(c)Each of the Estimated Closing Statement and the Closing Statement shall be
prepared, and each determination set forth on each such statement shall be
determined, in accordance with the Accounting Principles; provided, however,
that each of the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital and the Closing
Date Net Working Capital shall be calculated in accordance with the accounting
principles, practices, procedures, policies and methods that are used in the
sample calculation of Net Working Capital set forth on Annex A.

(d)For purposes of complying with this Section 2.6, Buyer, on the one hand,
and the Company and the Joint Holder Representatives, on the other hand, shall
(and the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries to) cooperate with and make
available to the other and their respective representatives reasonable access
to the records, properties, personnel and (subject to the execution of
customary work paper access letters if requested) auditors of the Company and
its Subsidiaries relating to the preparation of the Closing Statement and the
resolution of any disputes thereunder.

(e)If the Joint Holder Representatives shall disagree in good faith with the
calculation of the Adjustment Amount (or any component thereof), they shall
notify Buyer of such disagreement in writing, setting forth in reasonable
detail the particulars of such disagreement, including the basis therefor,
within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the Closing Statement, and any
item or amount not specifically so disputed shall be deemed accepted as set
forth in the Closing Statement. In the event that the Joint Holder
Representatives do not provide a notice of disagreement within such forty-five (45)-day period, the Joint
Holder Representatives and Buyer shall be deemed to have agreed to the Closing
Statement and the calculation of the Adjustment Amount (and each component
thereof) delivered by Buyer, which shall be final, binding and conclusive for
all purposes hereunder. In the event any notice of disagreement is timely
provided, Buyer and the Joint Holder Representatives shall use reasonable best
efforts for a period of fifteen (15) days (or such longer period as they may
mutually agree) to resolve any disagreements with respect to the calculation
of the Adjustment Amount (and each component thereof). If such disputed
matters are resolved within such fifteen (15)-day period, then the Closing
Statement, with such changes as may have been previously agreed in writing by
the Joint Holder Representatives and Buyer, shall be deemed final, conclusive
and binding on the parties for all purposes. If, at the end of such period,
the Joint Holder Representatives and Buyer are unable to resolve any disputed
item in the notice of disagreement, then any such remaining disagreements
shall be resolved by KPMG US LLP or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to
serve in such capacity, such other nationally recognized independent
accounting or financial consulting firm of recognized national standing to be
mutually agreed in writing by Buyer and the Joint Holder Representatives (such
firm, subject to the following proviso, the "Auditor"); provided, that if the
Joint Holder Representatives and Buyer cannot agree on such alternative
Auditor, the Joint Holder Representatives and Buyer shall each select a
nationally recognized independent accounting or financial consulting firm, and
such accounting or consulting firms shall jointly select a third nationally
recognized independent accounting or financial consulting firm to serve as the
Auditor. Each of Buyer and the Joint Holder Representatives shall promptly
(and in any event, within fifteen (15) days after the engagement of the
Auditor) provide their respective assertions (and any supporting documentary
evidence) regarding the Adjustment Amount (or any component thereof) and, to
the extent relevant thereto, the Closing Statement in writing to the Auditor
and to each other; provided, that no party shall disclose to the Auditor any
settlement discussions (or the contents thereof) between the parties without
the prior written consent of the other party. The Auditor shall be instructed
to render its determination with respect to such disagreements as soon as
reasonably practicable (which the parties hereto agree should not be later
than thirty (30) days following the day on which the disagreement is referred
to the Auditor). The Auditor shall act as a neutral arbitrator and shall
resolve only the disputed items that have been referred to it pursuant to this
Section 2.6(e) and solely in accordance with the procedures (including the
definitions of the defined terms used in Section 2.6) set forth in this
Agreement. The Auditor shall base its determination solely on the written
submissions of the parties and shall not conduct an independent investigation,
and shall solely determine the extent (if any) to which the Adjustment Amount
(and any component thereof) require adjustment (only with respect to the
remaining disagreements submitted to the Auditor) in order to be determined in
accordance with Section 2.6(b) (including the definitions of the defined terms
used in Section 2.6) as specified in this Agreement, and may not resolve any
disputed matter of Law or fact, except to correct plain error. There will be
no ex parte communications between the Joint Holder Representatives or Buyer
and the Auditor, other than written answers by the Joint Holder
Representatives or Buyer to written questions of the Auditor (copies of which
shall be provided simultaneously to Buyer or the Joint Holder Representatives,
as applicable), but each of the Joint Holder Representatives and Buyer shall
have the right to reply in writing to the written presentation of the other
within five (5) days after its receipt of the other's written presentation.
The Auditor shall, and the parties shall instruct the Auditor to, make all
determinations in accordance with the Accounting Principles (notwithstanding the availability of
other accounting methods, policies, practices and/or procedures under GAAP or
otherwise). The Auditor, in resolving any disputed items, shall not assign to
any disputed item a value greater than the greatest value for such disputed
item assigned by Buyer or the Joint Holder Representatives, or less than the
smallest value for such disputed item assigned by Buyer or the Joint Holder
Representatives. The determination of the Auditor shall be final, conclusive
and binding on the parties, absent fraud or manifest error or failure to
comply with instructions required to be issued under this Section 2.6(e). The
date on which the Adjustment Amount (and each component thereof) is finally
determined in accordance with this Section 2.6(e) is hereinafter referred to
as the "Determination Date." All fees and expenses of the Auditor relating to
the work, if any, to be performed by the Auditor hereunder shall be borne
equally between Buyer, on the one hand, and the Joint Holder Representatives
as a Holder Representative Expense, on the other hand.

(f)The "Adjustment Amount," which may be positive or negative, shall mean (i)
Closing Date Net Working Capital (as finally determined in accordance with
Section 2.6(e)) minus Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital; plus (ii)
Estimated Closing Date Funded Debt minus Closing Date Funded Debt (as finally
determined in accordance with Section 2.6(e)); plus (iii) Estimated Closing
Date Company Transaction Expenses minus Closing Date Company Transaction
Expenses (as finally determined in accordance with Section 2.6(e)); and plus
(iv) Closing Date Cash (as finally determined in accordance with Section
2.6(e)) minus Estimated Closing Date Cash.

(g)If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then, promptly following the
Determination Date, and in any event within three (3) Business Days of the
Determination Date, (i) Buyer shall pay such Adjustment Amount to the Joint
Holder Representatives (for further distribution to the Sellers in accordance
with such Sellers' Applicable Percentages, it being understood that Buyer
shall have no obligation to pay any such Adjustment Amount directly to the
Sellers) and (ii) Buyer and the Joint Holder Representatives shall deliver
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
release the Escrow Amount to the Sellers in accordance with each Seller's
Applicable Percentage.

(h)If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number (the absolute value of such
amount, the "Deficit Amount"), then, promptly following the Determination
Date, and in any event within three (3) Business Days of the Determination
Date: (i) if the Deficit Amount is less than the amount of the Escrow Funds,
the Escrow Agent shall pay from the Escrow Funds to (x) Buyer an amount equal
to the Deficit Amount and (y) the Sellers (each in accordance with such
Seller's Applicable Percentage) the difference between the Escrow Funds and
the Deficit Amount, or (ii) if the Deficit Amount is greater than the amount
of the Escrow Funds (the excess of the Deficit Amount over the amount of the
Escrow Funds being the "Escrow Shortfall"), (x) the Escrow Agent shall pay the
Escrow Funds to Buyer, and (y) each Seller shall pay to Buyer, pro rata based
on their Applicable Percentage, the Escrow Shortfall. Upon a determination
that there exists a Deficit Amount, each of Buyer and the Joint Holder
Representatives shall execute joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse the Escrow Funds in accordance with
this Section 2.6(h). (i)If the Adjustment Amount is zero, Buyer and the Joint Holder
Representatives shall, within three (3) Business Days following the
Determination Date, deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to release the Escrow Amount to the Sellers in
accordance with each Seller's Applicable Percentage.

(j)The payment of any Adjustment Amount pursuant to this Section 2.6 shall be
treated as an adjustment to the purchase price for all Tax purposes and shall
be reported in a manner consistent therewith by Buyer, the Company, the Joint
Holder Representatives and the Sellers (including, without limitation, in any
Tax Proceeding), unless otherwise required by applicable Law or pursuant to a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Allocation shall apply to any Adjustment Amount.

(k)Buyer agrees that the adjustments to the Estimated Closing Date Net Working
Capital and the dispute resolution provisions provided for in this Section 2.6
shall be the exclusive remedies for the matters addressed by this Section 2.6,
provided that this provision shall not prohibit Buyer or Joint Holder
Representatives from instituting litigation to enforce any final determination
of the Adjustment Amount by the Auditor in any court of competent jurisdiction
in accordance with Section 13.13.



2.7 Withholding. Each of Buyer, the Company, the Joint Holder Representatives,
and the Escrow Agent (and their respective Affiliates) shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any payment under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement such amounts as it is required by applicable Law to deduct or
withhold with respect to the making of such payment. Except with respect to
any withholding or deduction required as a result of the failure to deliver
any certificate described in Section 2.3(a)(iii), before making any such
deduction or withholding, Buyer shall promptly provide the Joint Holder
Representatives notice of its intention to make such deduction or withholding
and, in reasonable detail, the authority, basis and method of calculation for
the proposed deduction or withholding (and Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide such notice at least ten (10) days prior to
making such deduction or withholding). Buyer shall provide the Joint Holder
Representatives and the applicable Sellers with a reasonable opportunity to
obtain reduction of or relief from such deduction or withholding from the
applicable Taxing Authority and/or execute and deliver to or file with such
Taxing Authority and/or Buyer such affidavits, certificates and other
documents as may reasonably be expected to afford the applicable Seller
reduction of or relief from such deduction or withholding. Buyer and the
Company shall cooperate with the Joint Holder Representatives and the
applicable Seller to obtain such reduction of or relief from such deduction or
withholding, provided that Buyer shall not be required to incur any
unreimbursed expense. To the extent that any such amounts are so deducted or
withheld by any Person under this Section 2.7, such Person shall timely and
properly remit such amounts to the applicable Taxing Authority and such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such amounts were deducted and
withheld. As of the date hereof, Buyer has no plan or intention of deducting
or withholding, or causing to be deducted or withheld, any amounts with
respect to any payments to be made under this Agreement.

into any settlement agreement related to allegations or threatened allegations
of sexual harassment or sexual misconduct by any current or former director,

from disclosure (provided that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall
(and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to) use their commercially
reasonable efforts to, as applicable, (x) obtain any required consent to
provide such access or disclosure or, if unable to do so, use commercially reasonable efforts to
make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable access or
disclosure not in violation of such contract or applicable Law or (y) enter
into such joint defense agreements or other arrangements, as appropriate, so
as to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in
the loss of such privilege), the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
afford to Buyer and its accountants, counsel and other representatives access,
during normal business hours, in such manner as to not unreasonably interfere
with the normal operation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, to their
respective properties, personnel, books, contracts, commitments, Tax Returns,
and records and the Company shall, and shall cause any of its Subsidiaries to,
furnish as promptly as practicable to Buyer all information (financial or
otherwise) concerning its business, properties, offices, contracts and

arrangements to permit reasonable access not in violation of such Law). All
information obtained by Buyer and its respective representatives shall be
treated as confidential information pursuant to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, the provisions of which are by this reference
hereby incorporated herein. All requests for access to the properties, books
and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be made to the Joint
Holder Representatives or such representatives of the Company as the Joint
Holder Representatives shall designate. The parties agree that notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall survive from the date hereof, and only if the
Closing shall occur, the Confidentiality Agreement will terminate at the
Closing.

6.3 Exclusivity. From the date of this Agreement to the earlier of (a)
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 10.1 and (b) the
Closing, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the
representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries not to, and each Seller
shall not, and shall direct its representatives not to, (x) solicit,
encourage, initiate, continue or participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding any proposal or offer relating to an acquisition
(whether by merger, reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise) of all or
any part of the equity interests or any substantial portion of the assets
(other than inventory to be sold in the ordinary course of business) of the
Company or its Subsidiaries with any other Person other than Buyer or its
Affiliates or representatives (an "Acquisition Proposal"), (y) furnish or
disclose to any Person any information in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal or (z) enter into any letter of
intent, binding term sheet, purchase agreement, merger agreement or other
similar agreement with any Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, in
the case of (y) and (z) other than Buyer and its representatives. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the representatives of the Company
and its Subsidiaries to, cease and cause to be terminated any and all
discussions, communications, access to confidential information (including

each of its Subsidiaries (to the extent requested by Buyer) to become
guarantors and pledgors (effective as of the Closing) in respect of
indebtedness of Buyer or its Affiliates outstanding as of the Closing Date
(the causing of such Persons to so become guarantors and pledgors, the "Buyer
Debt Joinders"), and the reasonable requests of lenders in respect thereof,
including by:

(i)if requested in writing by Buyer at least nine (9) days prior to the
Closing Date, furnishing to Buyer all information regarding the Company and
its Subsidiaries that is requested by Buyer and required in connection with

regulations, including the Patriot Act, at least three (3) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date;

(ii)executing and delivering financing documents in connection with the Buyer
Debt Joinders, including any pledge and security documents, any guarantees,
and any joinder documents, and in each case assisting in the preparation of
applicable schedules and providing other information necessary in connection
therewith, it being understood that such documents will not be recorded or
take effect until the Closing Date; and

(iii)facilitating the pledging of collateral, it being understood that such
pledges will not take effect until the Closing Date.

(b)Nothing in the foregoing Section 6.4(a) will require the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective representatives to:

Buyer Debt Joinders prior to the Closing Date for which it has not received
prior reimbursement or is not otherwise indemnified by or on behalf of Buyer;

(ii)take any action or provide any information that will conflict with or
violate its organizational documents or any applicable material Laws or (in
the case of the disclosure of information) would result in the waiver of any
legal privilege (provided, however, that the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to provide an alternative means of disclosing
or providing such information to the maximum extent permitted by Law or to the
maximum extent that does not result in a loss of such legal privilege, as
applicable, and in the event that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries does
not provide access or information in reliance on this clause, the Company
shall provide notice to Buyer that information is being withheld); (iii)take any action that would unreasonably interfere with the business of
the Company or its Subsidiaries;

(iv)give indemnities that are effective prior to the Closing Date for which it
is not simultaneously indemnified by Buyer;

(v)pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the execution of any
documentation in connection with the Buyer Debt Joinders or any definitive

Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective representatives shall
cooperate with Buyer to replace any officers and directors of the Company and
its Subsidiaries who will not be employed thereby immediately after the
Closing with Persons designated by Buyer and to add any officers and directors
designated by Buyer, such replacements and additions to become effective at
the Closing);

(vi)cause the execution of any certificates or other documents by any employee
whose employment by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will terminate
prior to or upon Closing; or

expected to result in personal liability to a director or officer.



In addition, in no event shall any liability or obligation of the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective representatives pursuant to any
certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or instrument relating to the
Buyer Debt Joinders be required to be effective prior to the Closing Date.

(c)Buyer shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective representatives in connection with the
cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
representatives contemplated by Section 6.4(a), and shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective representatives
from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses
suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with any cooperation
pursuant to Section 6.4(a) and any information used in connection therewith,
except with respect to any fraud, intentional misrepresentation, gross
negligence or willful misconduct by any such persons or material breach by any
such Persons of their obligations under this Agreement.

(d)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, it is understood and
agreed that the condition precedent set forth in Section 9.2(b), as applied to
the Company's and each Seller's respective obligations under this Section 6.4
(other than in respect of the Company's and each Seller's obligations
expressly set forth in Sections 6.4(a)(i), (ii) or (iii), subject to the
provisions of Section 6.4(b)), shall be deemed to be satisfied unless the
Buyer Debt Joinders are not consummated as of the Closing as a result of the
Company's willful and material breach of its obligations under this Section
6.4.



6.5 Certain Assignments. Prior to Closing, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain a confirmatory assignment agreement from
each Person identified on Schedule 6.5. 

6.6 Inventory Aging Schedule; Physical Inventory Count.

(a) Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall
commence the preparation of, and shall deliver to Buyer no later than the
close of business August 18, 2020, an inventory aging schedule of the finished
goods and raw materials of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of June 30,
2020, in a form consistent with the inventory aging schedule (including the
inventory aging categories) set forth on Schedule 6.6(a). To the extent
necessary, the Company shall subsequently prepare and deliver to Buyer one or
more updated inventory aging schedules, each in a form consistent with the
inventory aging schedule (including the inventory aging categories) set forth
on Schedule 6.6(a), such that a schedule as of a date no earlier than seventy-
five (75) days prior to the Closing has been delivered to the Buyer no later
than four (4) Business Days prior to the Closing.



(b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all actions as
are required to permit a Physical Inventory Count to be conducted prior to the
Closing. In furtherance of the foregoing, promptly following public
announcement of this Agreement, the Company shall contact all third party
counterparties who would be involved in the conduct of a Physical Inventory
Count in order to inform them of the Company's anticipated need to cause a
Physical Inventory Count to be conducted in connection with this Agreement,
including the potential timing of such count. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts, in consultation with Buyer, to agree on arrangements
and procedures with each such third party in order to permit a Physical
Inventory Count to be conducted on the shortest practicable notice period. The
Company agrees that in the event that, despite its compliance with this
Agreement, a Physical Inventory Count is not conducted prior to Closing, the
Company's obligations under this covenant shall include using its commercially
reasonable efforts to allow Buyer to conduct a Physical Inventory Count as
soon as practicable following Closing.



ARTICLE VII

COVENANTS OF BUYER



7.1 Indemnification and Insurance.

(a)From and after the Closing Date, Buyer agrees that all rights to
indemnification and exoneration (including provisions relating to expense
advancement) by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company existing as of the
date of this Agreement in favor of each of the Company's and such Subsidiary's
former and current officers, directors and employees (the "Indemnified
Persons"), as provided in the certificate of formation or other organizational
documents of the Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable, in each case,
shall survive the Closing and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their respective terms, and, following the Closing, Buyer
shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to comply with all such
provisions. (b)The Company shall obtain, effective as of the Closing Date, a prepaid six-
year "tail" policy containing terms not less favorable than the terms of such
current insurance coverage with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Closing Date. The costs associated with obtaining the "tail"
insurance policy described in the immediately preceding sentence (the "DandO
Tail Insurance Costs") shall be borne by the Company and shall constitute a
Company Transaction Expense.

(c)The rights of indemnification and to receive advancement of expenses as
provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights
to which any Indemnified Person may at any time be entitled.

(d)Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this
Section 7.1 shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and
assigns of Buyer and the Company. In the event that Buyer or the Company or
any of their respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing entity of such consolidation
or merger, or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer or the Company, as the
case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 7.1.

7.2 Employment Matters.

(a)From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) to, assume, honor,
pay, perform and satisfy any and all liabilities, obligations and
responsibilities to or in respect of each of the employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (including those employees who are full-time, part-time,
temporary, on vacation or on a medical leave or disability or any other paid
or unpaid leave of absence) as of the Closing Date (collectively, the
"Continuing Employees") arising under the terms of any Company Benefit Plan or
other agreement or arrangement between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
identified on Schedule 4.13(a) and any Continuing Employee, as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date, for as long as such Company Benefit
Plan or other agreement or arrangement is in effect, including with respect to
any payments, benefits or rights arising as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other
event); provided that Buyer may amend or terminate any such Company Benefit
Plan in accordance with its terms.

(b)Without limiting the foregoing, for a period of not less than one year
following the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries) to, provide to each of the
Continuing Employees (i) at least the same base salary or wage rate and cash
incentive opportunities provided to such Continuing Employees immediately
prior to the Closing, and (ii) other compensation and benefits (including,
without limitation, severance, retirement, health and welfare benefits) that
are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing. This Section 7.2 shall
not limit the obligation of Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
maintain any compensation arrangement or benefit plan that, pursuant to an
existing contract or applicable Law, must be maintained for a period longer than one year. No
provision of this Agreement shall be construed as a guarantee of continued
employment of any Continuing Employee and this Agreement shall not be
construed so as to prohibit Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries from having the
right to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee, provided that
any such termination is effected in accordance with applicable Law.

(c)From and after the Closing, each Continuing Employee shall be credited for
all purposes (including for purposes of eligibility to participate or receive
benefits, level of benefits, vesting, benefit accrual and any other purposes
as may be required under applicable Law) under any employee benefit plans,
arrangements, policies, programs and employment-related entitlements
(including for purposes of accruals and usage of vacation and leave
entitlements and for purposes of severance or separation pay plans) provided,
sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, "Buyer Benefit Plans") for such Continuing Employee's service
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and with any predecessor
employer, to the same extent such service was (or would have been) recognized
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing; provided, that
the foregoing shall not apply for purposes of benefit accrual under any
defined benefit pension plan or employer-subsidy under a retiree medical plan
or to the extent such credit would result in the duplication of benefits for
the same period of service.

(d)Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) waive for each
Continuing Employee and his or her dependents, any waiting period or payment
in lieu of waiting period provisions, pre-existing condition limitations,
actively-at-work requirements and any other restriction that would prevent
immediate or full participation and coverage under the Buyer Benefit Plans (if
applicable, and to the extent permitted by the terms of the applicable Buyer
Benefit Plan) (except to the extent such provision, limitation, requirement or
other restriction applied to such Continuing Employee under the terms of
comparable Company Benefit Plans prior to Closing), and (ii) reimburse each
Continuing Employee for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket
expenses incurred under the Buyer Benefit Plans in the same plan year as the
Closing, to the extent such out-of-pocket expenses would not have been
incurred had the Continuing Employee remained under the terms of the
comparable Company Benefit Plan prior to Closing for the remainder of the plan
year.



(e)The parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this
Section 7.2 are included for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. This
Agreement is not intended by the parties to, and nothing in this Section 7.2
or otherwise in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall, (i)
constitute or be treated as an establishment, amendment or other modification
to any Company Benefit Plan, Buyer Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit
plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement, (ii) create any obligation of
the parties hereto to any Person (other than the other parties hereto) with
respect to any Buyer Benefit Plan or any employee benefit plan, program,
policy, agreement or arrangement of the Company or its Affiliates or (iii)
create any third party beneficiary or other rights in any other Person,
including any Continuing Employee.

 7.3 Retention of Books and Records. Buyer shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to retain all material books, ledgers, files, reports, plans,
operating records and any other material documents pertaining to the Company
and its Subsidiaries in existence at the Closing that are required to be
retained under current retention policies for a period of seven (7) years from
the Closing Date, and to make the same available after the Closing, to the
extent it does not unreasonably interfere with the operations of Buyer and the
Company (and its Subsidiaries), and subject to entering into a customary
confidentiality agreement, for inspection and copying by the Joint Holder
Representatives or their representatives at the Joint Holder Representatives'
expense, for any reasonable and non-competitive business purpose, during
regular business hours and upon reasonable request and upon reasonable advance
notice.



7.4 Contact with Customers and Suppliers. Prior to the Closing Date, (x) Buyer
and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall
coordinate with each other with respect to communications to customers,
potential customers, suppliers, distributors or licensors of the Company or
any of the Company's Subsidiaries, or any other Persons having a business
relationship with the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries, in each
case concerning the transactions contemplated hereby, (y) neither Buyer nor
the Company will make any written communications to any such Persons relating
to the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of
the other party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and
(z) neither Buyer nor the Company will arrange or attend any meeting with any
such Persons that is specifically intended to discuss the transactions
contemplated hereby without having given the other party the reasonable
opportunity to attend such meeting.

7.5 RWI Policy. To the extent Buyer obtains a representations and warranty
insurance policy (an "RWI Policy"), Buyer shall be solely responsible for
payment of the premium and all other costs of the RWI Policy. Any such RWI
Policy shall include: (a) a provision whereby the insurer expressly waives,
and agrees not to pursue, directly or indirectly, any subrogation rights
against the Company or its Affiliates, or any former or current general or
limited partners, shareholders, managers, members, directors, officers, or
employees of any of the foregoing with respect to any claim made by any
insured thereunder (except in the case of Fraud), and (b) a provision that
provides that Buyer is not obligated to bring a claim against the Company
prior to bringing a claim under the RWI Policy. Following the Closing, Buyer
will not agree to the provisions of the RWI Policy addressing the requirements
of the previous sentence being amended or modified in a manner adverse to the
Company or the Sellers.

7.6 PPP Loan. If, following the Closing, the PPP Loan (or any portion thereof)
is forgiven by Mission Valley Bank in accordance with its terms, Buyer shall,
within five (5) Business Days following receipt of written notice by Buyer
from Mission Valley Bank of such forgiveness, cause the Company to pay to the
Joint Holder Representatives, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the account designated by the Joint Holder Representatives in writing to
Buyer, the principal amount of the PPP Loan that was forgiven. The Joint
Holder Representatives hereby agree that any such amounts received by the
Joint Holder Representatives shall be distributed to the Sellers in accordance
with such Seller's Applicable Percentages (it being understood that Buyer and
the Company shall have no obligation to pay any such amount directly to
Sellers). The parties agree that Buyer and the Company shall have no
obligation to (a) file any forgiveness application with respect to the PPP
Loan or participate or cooperate in any way with the Company's application for such
forgiveness or (b) pay any amounts pursuant to this paragraph except to the
extent that such amounts were included in the definition of "Funded Debt" at
the Closing.

ARTICLE VIII

JOINT COVENANTS

8.1 Support of Transaction. Without limiting any covenant contained in Article
VI or Article VII, Buyer, the Company and each Seller shall each, and shall
each cause their respective Subsidiaries to: (a) use reasonable best efforts
to assemble, prepare and file any information (and, as needed, to supplement
such information) as may be reasonably necessary to obtain as promptly as
practicable all governmental and regulatory consents required to be obtained
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) use reasonable
best efforts to obtain all material consents and approvals of third parties
that any of Buyer, the Sellers, the Company or their respective Affiliates are
required to obtain in order to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (c) take such other action as may reasonably be necessary or as
another party may reasonably request to satisfy the conditions of Article IX
or otherwise to comply with this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby as soon as practicable (but in any event prior to the
Termination Date). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Buyer, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries be obligated to bear any expense or pay any
fee (other than the payment of nominal administrative, processing or similar
fees or charges) or grant any concession in connection with obtaining any
consents, authorizations or approvals required in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the terms of any Contract to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party. This Section 8.1 does
not apply to filings, submissions of information, consents, approvals or other
actions under or relating to antitrust or competition Laws, which are the
subject of Section 8.6.

8.2 Escrow Agreement. Each of the Company, the Joint Holder Representatives
and Buyer agree to cooperate and use their respective reasonable efforts to
negotiate and, concurrently with the Closing, enter into a definitive escrow
agreement on customary terms and conditions (the "Escrow Agreement").

8.3 Further Assurances. Each party hereto agrees that, from time to time after
the Closing Date, it will execute and deliver, or cause its Affiliates to
execute and deliver, such further instruments, and take (or cause its
Affiliates to take) such other action, as may be reasonably necessary to carry
out the purposes and intents of this Agreement, including cooperating with the
other parties hereto, to the extent reasonably requested by such other parties
and at such other parties' sole expense, to enforce rights and obligations
provided herein against any third party.

8.4 Tax Matters.

(a)Tax Treatment of Transactions. For U.S. federal income tax purposes (and
any applicable corresponding state or local tax purposes), the sale of the
Company Units by the Sellers to Buyer, and the purchase thereof by Buyer,
shall be treated in accordance with IRS Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432
(Situation 2), (i) with respect to Buyer, as a deemed purchase of all of the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) with respect to the
Sellers, as a sale of one-hundred percent (100%) of the interests in a
partnership. As a result of the sale and purchase of the Company Units, the Company shall terminate for
U.S. federal income Tax purposes under Section 708(b)(1) of the Code as of the
end of the Closing Date. None of the Sellers, the Company, the Joint Holder
Representatives, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates shall take any
position inconsistent with such treatment in notices to or filings with Taxing
Authorities, in any Tax Proceeding, or in other documents or notices relating
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except to the extent
otherwise required to do so by a "determination" as defined in Section 1313(a)
of the Code (or any similar provision of state or local law).

(b)Purchase Price Allocation. The Purchase Price (along with any other items
that are treated as additional consideration for U.S. federal and applicable
state and local income Tax purposes (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
any liabilities that, for U.S. federal and applicable state and local income
Tax purposes, are treated as assumed by Buyer)) shall be allocated among the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (and any assets that, for U.S.
federal and applicable state and local income Tax purposes, are treated as
assets purchased by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement) in a manner consistent
with (i) Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder (and any corresponding provisions of state or local Tax Law) and
(ii) the methodology set forth on Annex B (the "Allocation Methodology" and
such allocation, the "Allocation"). A proposed Allocation shall be prepared by
the Joint Holder Representatives and delivered to Buyer within ninety (90)
days after the Closing Date. Buyer shall review the draft Allocation and
provide any comments with respect thereto within thirty (30) days after
receiving such draft Allocation ("Buyer Allocation Comments"). The Joint
Holder Representatives and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any
disputes relating to the Allocation; provided, however, that no position shall
be taken with respect to the Allocation that is inconsistent with the
Allocation Methodology. If the Joint Holder Representatives and Buyer fail to
resolve any such disputes within twenty (20) days from the receipt of any
Buyer Allocation Comments, they shall promptly thereafter engage an
independent accounting firm of recognized national standing mutually selected
by the Joint Holder Representatives and Buyer (the "Accounting Firm"), to
resolve any remaining disputes. The determination of the Accounting Firm shall
be final, conclusive and binding on the parties hereto and their respective
Affiliates. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm relating to the work,
if any, to be performed by the Accounting Firm hereunder shall be borne
equally between Buyer, on the one hand, and the Joint Holder Representatives
as a Holder Representative Expense, on the other hand. Any Allocation
determined pursuant to the decision of the Accounting Firm shall incorporate,
reflect and be consistent with this Section 8.4 and the Allocation
Methodology. The Allocation, as prepared by the Joint Holder Representatives
if no Buyer Allocation Comments have been provided, as adjusted pursuant to
any agreement between the Joint Holder Representatives and Buyer, or as
finally determined by the Accounting Firm in accordance with this Section
8.4(b) (the "Final Allocation"), shall be binding on Buyer, the Company, the
Joint Holder Representatives and the Sellers absent manifest error and shall,
in all events, be consistent with the Allocation Methodology. The Final
Allocation shall be adjusted, as necessary, to reflect any subsequent
adjustments to the Purchase Price and any other items that are treated as
additional consideration for U.S. federal and applicable state and local Tax
purposes. Except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code, each of Buyer,
the Company and the Sellers shall prepare and file its Tax Returns (including, the Company's IRS Form 1065 for the
taxable year ending on the Closing Date) in a manner consistent with the Final
Allocation and, subject to the following sentence, shall take no position
contrary thereto or inconsistent therewith. In the event that the Final
Allocation is disputed by any Taxing Authority, the party receiving notice of
such dispute shall (i) promptly notify the other party in writing of such
notice, (ii) upon reasonable request of the other party, promptly provide
information concerning the progress of the dispute solely to the extent
relating to the Final Allocation, (iii) conduct such dispute diligently and
defend the Final Allocation in good faith, and (iv) promptly notify the other
party in writing of the resolution of such dispute.

(c)Tax Returns. The Joint Holder Representatives, at the expense of the
Sellers, shall prepare and timely file, or shall cause to be prepared and
timely filed, all Pass-Through Tax Returns in respect of the Company and its
Subsidiaries that relate to any taxable period ending on or before the Closing
Date (including the Company's final IRS Form 1065 and corresponding state,
local or foreign Tax Returns). All such Pass-Through Tax Returns shall (i) be
prepared in a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement and past
practice of the Company and (ii) to the extent permitted under applicable Law
and not inconsistent with clause (i), reflect all Transaction Tax Deductions.
The Joint Holder Representatives shall provide a substantially final draft of
each such Pass-Through Tax Return that is due after the Closing to Buyer at
least twenty (20) days prior to the due date for filing such Pass-Through Tax
Return (taking into account any applicable extensions) and shall in good faith
consider any revisions or comments to such Pass-Through Tax Return as may be
reasonably requested by Buyer and provided to the Joint Holder Representatives
at least five (5) days prior to the due date for such Pass-Through Tax Return
(taking into account any applicable extensions). Each applicable Seller shall
be solely responsible for and shall pay, or cause to be paid (x) all Taxes
imposed on such applicable Seller in respect of such Pass-Through Tax Returns
for any Pre-Closing Tax Periods and (y) except as provided in Section 8.4(h),
all Taxes (whether imposed by withholding or otherwise) imposed on or with
respect to the applicable Seller as a result of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, no Seller shall be responsible
for any Taxes described under the previous sentence that are properly imposed
on a different Seller. The preparation and filing of any other Tax Return of
the Company or its Subsidiaries that is due after the Closing shall be
exclusively within the control of Buyer.

(d)Certain Tax Returns and Tax Elections. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, in connection with any imputed underpayment as determined under
Section 6225 of the Code resulting from any adjustment by any Taxing Authority
to any Company-related items with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period:

(i)The Company shall make the election under Section 6226 of the Code (and any
similar election under state, local or other Tax Law) with respect to the
alternative to payment of imputed underpayment by the Company, the Sellers
shall pay such Taxes as may be due with respect to any adjustment to a
partnership-related item described in Section 6226 of the Code, and the
parties shall take any other action necessary to effectuate such election and
prevent any such adjustment from adversely affecting Buyer and its Affiliates
(including the Company after the Closing); and (ii)Unless the Company has made a timely election under Section 6226 of the
Code with respect to such Pre-Closing Tax Period, at the request of Buyer, the
Sellers shall prepare and file, at their expense, such amended Tax Return(s)
described in Section 6225(c)(2) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder with respect to such taxable period, and pay such Taxes
as may be due with each such Tax Return, in each case in accordance with the
requirements of Section 6225(c)(2) of the Code and any applicable Treasury
Regulations, such that Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Company after
the Closing) are not adversely affected by any such adjustment, and the
parties shall take any other action necessary to prevent any such adjustment
from adversely affecting Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Company after
the Closing).



(e)Tax Contests. Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and
the Joint Holder Representatives and the Sellers, on the other hand, shall
promptly notify each other upon receipt by such party of written notice of any
Tax Proceeding with respect to Pass-Through Tax Returns of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for a taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date (and
such Tax Proceeding, a "Pass-Through Tax Contest"). Subject to compliance with
Sections 8.4(c), 8.4(d) and 8.4(f), the Joint Holder Representatives shall
control the conduct of any Pass-Through Tax Contest; provided that, to the
extent such Pass-Through Tax Contest would or would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Company) after the
Closing, (i) Buyer shall have the right to participate in the defense of any
such Pass-Through Tax Contest at Buyer's own expense, and (ii) the Joint
Holder Representatives shall keep Buyer reasonably informed concerning the
progress of the Pass-Through Tax Contest and may not settle any such Pass-
Through Tax Contest without the prior written consent of Buyer, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

(f)Cooperation. Buyer and the Joint Holder Representatives and each of their
respective Affiliates (including the Company) shall cooperate to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns and any Tax Proceeding regarding Taxes of, or with respect to, the
Company or its Subsidiaries.

(g)Post-Closing Actions. Without the prior written consent of the Joint Holder
Representatives, except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, neither
Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company and
its Subsidiaries) shall (i) make any Tax election after the Closing outside
the ordinary course of business with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, which election is effective on or before the Closing Date, or
(ii) amend any income Tax Return of the Company in respect of any taxable
period ending on or before the Closing Date, which amendment is filed after
the Closing (other than any such amendment required to be filed after the
Closing in connection with the resolution of any Tax Proceeding), in each
case, to the extent such Tax election or amendment could impose any Tax
liability on any Seller.

(h)Transfer Taxes. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, all
transfer, stamp, documentary, sales, use, registration, value-added and other
similar Taxes (including any applicable real estate transfer Taxes) incurred
in connection with this Agreement and imposed as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby ("Transfer Taxes") shall be
borne 50% by the Sellers and 50% by Buyer; provided, that any Transfer Taxes
for which the Sellers are responsible pursuant to this Section 8.4(h) shall
constitute Company Transaction Expenses and the Sellers shall not be required
to make separate payment of any kind in respect of any Transfer Taxes. Unless
otherwise required by applicable Law, Buyer shall prepare and file in a timely
manner all necessary documents (including, but not limited to, all Tax
Returns) with respect to all Transfer Taxes and shall timely pay all Transfer
Taxes. Sellers and the Joint Holder Representatives shall cooperate in the
timely completion and filing of all such Tax Returns. Upon request, Buyer
shall provide the Joint Holder Representatives with evidence satisfactory to
the Joint Holder Representatives that all Transfer Taxes have been paid. The
parties shall cooperate in good faith to minimize the amount of any Transfer
Taxes.

(i)Tax Sharing Agreements. The rights and obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries pursuant to all tax sharing agreements or arrangements (other
than this Agreement) to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and Sellers or any of their Affiliates (other than the Company and
its Subsidiaries), on the other hand, are parties shall be terminated at or
prior to Closing, and neither Sellers nor any of their Affiliates nor the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have any rights or obligations
thereunder in respect of such agreements or arrangements for any past or
future period. From and after the Closing, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to any of the Sellers pursuant to the
Company LLC Agreement.

(j)Use of Founder Names. Buyer may continue for a period of up to two (2)
years following the Closing (the "Transition Period") to use and display the
names of Mike Boone and Kyle Schroeder (the "Founder Names"), but only in
substantially the same manner as used by the Company prior to Closing. Without
limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall be permitted to sell off any products
bearing the Founder Names that exist prior to the end of the Transition
Period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Buyer shall not be
prevented from using the Founder Names in a manner that constitutes "nominal
fair use" under applicable Law.

8.6 HSR Act Approvals.

(a)In connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
parties hereto shall (and, to the extent required, shall cause its Affiliates
to) (i) comply promptly, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days
after the date hereof, with the notification and reporting requirements of the
HSR Act and (ii) use their reasonable best efforts to obtain early termination
of the waiting period under the HSR Act. The parties hereto shall use
reasonable best efforts to substantially comply with any Antitrust Information

any application or other filing to be made pursuant to any Law in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) comply with any
Antitrust Information or Document Requests, and (iv) otherwise cooperate with
each other in connection with any filing and in connection with resolving any
investigation or other inquiry of any Governmental Authority. Should any Antitrust Authority threaten to institute
or institute any Proceeding under any antitrust or competition law that would
challenge or affect this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (an "Antitrust Proceeding"), the parties shall exercise
their reasonable best efforts to (x) defend or oppose such Antitrust
Proceedings, and (y) seek to have lifted or rescinded any injunction or
restraining order issued in connection with such Antitrust Proceedings which
may adversely affect the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in each case until the issuance of a final,
non-appealable Governmental Order with respect thereto.

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Buyer's obligations shall
not include (i) proffering nor consenting nor agreeing to a Governmental Order
or other agreement providing for the sale, licensing or other disposition, or
the holding separate of, or other limitations or restrictions on, particular
assets, categories of assets or lines of business of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Buyer or any of its Affiliates, (ii) offering to terminate any
existing relationships and contractual rights and obligations, and (iii)
otherwise offering to take or offering to commit to take any action that
limits their freedom of action with respect to any of the assets or business
of Buyer or any of its Affiliates or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
or their ability to retain any of their assets or lines of business.

(d)Each party hereto shall promptly furnish to the other parties hereto copies
of any notices or written communications received or given by a party hereto
or any of its Affiliates from or to any Governmental Authority with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each party hereto shall
permit counsel to the other parties hereto an opportunity to review in
advance, and each party hereto shall consider in good faith the views of such
counsel in connection with, any proposed written communications by a party
hereto and its Affiliates to any Governmental Authority concerning the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party hereto agrees to
provide the other parties hereto and their counsel the opportunity, on
reasonable advance notice, to participate in any substantive meetings or
discussions, either in person or by telephone, between a party hereto and any
of its Affiliates, agents or advisors, on the one hand, and any Governmental
Authority, on the other hand, concerning or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(e)Buyer shall be solely responsible for and pay all fees payable to the
Antitrust Authorities in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

10.2 Effect of Termination.

(a)Generally. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Section 10.2, in

prior to such termination. The provisions of Sections 6.4(c) and this Section
10.2, Articles XII and XIII, and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive
any termination of this Agreement.

(b)Early Termination Fee. If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.1(c)(ii), within two (2) business days after such termination, the

Fee"). If Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(ii),
within two (2) Business Days after any such termination, Buyer shall pay to

(c)Buyer Termination Fee. If Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to

Section 9.1(b) have not been satisfied or waived, all of the other conditions
set forth in Section 9.1, Section 9.2, and Section 9.3 have been satisfied or
waived (other than any such conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing (if such conditions would be satisfied were the
Closing to occur at such time)) and no material breach by the Company, any
Seller or the Joint Holder Representatives (or any combination of them) of
this Agreement has been the principal cause of the failure to be satisfied of
all or any of the conditions listed in Sections 9.1(a) and 9.1(b), within two
(2) Business Days after such termination, Buyer shall pay to the Company a
non-refundable termination fee, without offset or reduction of any kind, in
cash in U.S. dollars by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in an
amount equal to $10,000,000 (the "Termination Fee"). (d)Each of the parties to this Agreement expressly acknowledges and agrees
that if the Early Termination Fee or the Termination Fee becomes payable by,
and is actually paid by, Buyer, then such Early Termination Fee or Termination
Fee, as applicable, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company, the
Sellers and the Joint Holder Representatives (and each of their Affiliates)
for damages against Buyer and its Affiliates and its and their representatives
in connection with this Agreement, and in no event will the Company, any
Seller or any Joint Holder Representative (or any of their Affiliates) seek to
recover any other money damages or seek any other remedy based on a claim in
law or equity for any reason in connection with this Agreement. In no event
shall Buyer be required to pay both the Early Termination Fee and the
Termination Fee, or to pay the Early Termination Fee or the Termination Fee on
more than one occasion. If Buyer fails to pay the Early Termination Fee or the
Termination Fee when due, Buyer will reimburse the Company for all costs and
expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred in connection
with the collection of such amounts and the enforcement by the Company of its
rights under this Section 10.2 within two (2) Business Days after the Company
provides Buyer with a notice of such fees and expenses. If Buyer fails to pay
any amount when due pursuant to this Section 10.2, then Buyer shall pay or
cause to be paid to the Company the amount due, together with interest
accruing daily on such amount from the date on which such payment was due at
an annual rate equal to the prime rate set forth in The Wall Street Journal in
effect on the date such payment was due, plus two percent (2%).

(e)Each of the parties to this Agreement expressly acknowledges and agrees
that if the Early Termination Fee becomes payable by, and is actually paid by,
the Company, then such Early Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of Buyer and its Affiliates for damages against the Company, the
Sellers and the Joint Holder Representatives and each of their Affiliates and
representatives in connection with this Agreement, and in no event will Buyer
and its Affiliates seek to recover any other money damages or seek any other
remedy based on a claim in law or equity for any reason in connection with
this Agreement. In no event shall the Company be required to pay the Early
Termination Fee on more than one occasion. If the Company fails to pay the
Early Termination Fee when due, the Company will reimburse Buyer for all costs
and expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred in
connection with the collection of such amounts and the enforcement by Buyer of
its rights under this Section 10.2 within two (2) Business Days after Buyer
provides the Company with a notice of such fees and expenses. If the Company
fails to pay any amount when due pursuant to this Section 10.2, then the
Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Buyer the amount due, together with
interest accruing daily on such amount from the date on which such payment was
due at an annual rate equal to the prime rate set forth in The Wall Street
Journal in effect on the date such payment was due, plus two percent (2%).

(f)The parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this
Section 10.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, none of Buyer, the Sellers, the
Company or the Joint Holder Representatives would enter into this Agreement.
The parties acknowledge and agree that the Termination Fee or the Early
Termination Fee, if and when required to be paid pursuant to this Section
10.2, shall not constitute a penalty but will be liquidated damages, in a
reasonable amount that will compensate the recipient for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the occurrence of the Closing, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision.

ARTICLE XI

JOINT HOLDER REPRESENTATIVES



11.1 Designation and Replacement of Joint Holder Representatives. The parties
have agreed that it is desirable to designate representatives to act on behalf
of holders of the Company Units for all purposes under this Agreement (the
"Joint Holder Representatives"). The Sellers hereby designate Mike Boone and
Kyle Schroeder as the initial Joint Holder Representatives, and appoint each
of them as agent and attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of the other Sellers
for all purposes under this Agreement. Either or both of the Joint Holder
Representatives may resign at any time by five days' prior written notice to
Buyer, and either or both of the Joint Holder Representatives may be removed
by the vote of Sellers which collectively owned a majority of the Company
Units as of the date of this Agreement (the "Majority Holders"). In the event
that a Joint Holder Representative has resigned or been removed, a new Joint
Holder Representative shall concurrently be appointed by a vote of the
Majority Holders, such appointment to become effective upon the written
acceptance thereof by the new Joint Holder Representative (and if such
acceptance does not occur promptly, a new Joint Holder Representative shall
promptly be appointed). If one Joint Holder Representative has resigned or
been removed, the other Joint Holder Representative may act alone in such role
until the appointment of a second Joint Holder Representative has become
effective. All power, authority, rights and privileges conferred in this
Agreement to the initial Joint Holder Representatives will apply to any
successor Joint Holder Representative. The designation of any Person as a
Joint Holder Representative is and shall be coupled with an interest, and,
except as set forth in this Article XI, such designation is irrevocable and
shall not be affected by the death, incapacity, illness, bankruptcy,
dissolution or other inability to act of any of the holders of Company Units.

11.2 Authority and Rights of the Joint Holder Representatives; Limitations on
Liability. The Joint Holder Representatives shall (acting jointly but not
separately) have such powers and authority as are necessary to carry out the
functions assigned to it under this Agreement; provided, however, that the
Joint Holder Representatives shall have no obligation to act, except as
expressly provided herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
each Seller agrees that the Joint Holder Representatives have full power,
authority and discretion, on behalf of each Seller and his, her or its
successors and assigns, to (i) interpret the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and the documents to be executed and delivered by the Sellers in
connection herewith, (ii) execute and deliver and receive deliveries of all
agreements, certificates, statements, notices, approvals, extensions, waivers,
undertakings, amendments and other documents required or permitted to be given
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iii) receive service of process in connection with any claims
under this Agreement or any document or agreement contemplated to be executed
or delivered in connection with this Agreement, (iv) agree to, negotiate and
enter into settlements and compromises of, and assume the defense of, claims,
and demand arbitration and comply with Governmental Orders and awards of
arbitrators with respect to such claims, and take all actions necessary or
appropriate in the judgement of the Joint Holder Representatives for the
accomplishment of the foregoing, (v) give and receive notices and communications, (vi) take all actions necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of the Joint Holder Representatives on behalf of
the Sellers in connection with this Agreement, (vii) make any determinations
and settle any matters in connection with the Adjustment Amount, (viii)
authorize delivery to Buyer of the Escrow Funds or any portion thereof
pursuant to this Agreement, (ix) distribute the Escrow Funds and (x) deduct,
hold back or redirect any funds which may be payable to any Seller pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement or any document or agreement contemplated to be
executed or delivered in connection with this Agreement, (x) estimate and
determine the amounts of Holder Representative Expenses and pay such Holder
Representative Expenses and (xi) after the Closing, negotiate and enter into
any amendments to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement for and on behalf of
the Sellers. All actions taken by the Joint Holder Representatives under this
Agreement shall be binding upon the Sellers and their successors as if
expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by each of them. The Joint Holder
Representatives shall, in their capacity as such, have no liability to Buyer,
the Company or any holder of Company Units with respect to actions taken or
omitted to be taken in their capacity as the Joint Holder Representatives,
except that the Joint Holder Representatives will be liable for their willful
misconduct or actual fraud, as finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction from which no further appeal may be taken. The Joint Holder
Representatives shall at all times be entitled to rely on any directions
received from the Majority Holders; provided, however, that the Joint Holder
Representatives shall not be required to follow any such direction, and shall
be under no obligation to take any action in their capacity as the Joint
Holder Representatives, unless the Joint Holder Representatives are holding
the Holder Representative Fund delivered to them under Section 2.5 and have
been provided with other funds, security or indemnities which, in the sole
determination of the Joint Holder Representatives, are sufficient to protect
the Joint Holder Representatives against the costs, expenses and liabilities
which may be incurred by the Joint Holder Representatives in responding to
such direction or taking such action. The Joint Holder Representatives shall
be entitled to engage such counsel, experts and other agents and consultants
as they shall deem necessary in connection with exercising their powers and
performing their function hereunder and (in the absence of bad faith on the
part of the Joint Holder Representatives) shall be entitled to conclusively
rely on the opinions and advice of such Persons. The Joint Holder
Representatives shall be entitled to reimbursement from (i) the Holder
Representative Fund, (ii) amounts released from the Escrow Funds for the
benefit of Sellers and (iii) amounts otherwise received by them in their
capacity as the Joint Holder Representatives for the benefit of the Sellers
pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement, for all reasonable expenses,
disbursements and advances (including fees and disbursements of their counsel,
experts and other agents and consultants) incurred by the Joint Holder
Representatives in such capacity, and shall be entitled to indemnification
against any loss, liability or expenses arising out of actions taken or
omitted to be taken in their capacity as the Joint Holder Representatives
(except for those arising out of the Joint Holder Representatives' gross
negligence or willful misconduct), including the costs and expenses of
investigation and defense of claims. In the event that the Joint Holder
Representatives determine, in their sole and absolute discretion, that the
Holder Representative Fund paid to the Joint Holder Representatives pursuant
to Section 2.5 exceeds the Holder Representative Expenses, the Joint Holder
Representatives shall pay such excess amount (the "Holder Representative
Excess Amount") to the Sellers in accordance with their Applicable
Percentages. Buyer and the Company shall be able to rely conclusively (without
liability) on any instructions given and actions taken by the Joint Holder
Representatives as the instruction and decision of each Seller and each holder
of Company Units in all matters referred to herein, including instructions
with respect to the payment and distribution of any amounts payable pursuant
to or in relation to this Agreement. No party hereto or holder of Company Units shall have any cause of action against Buyer or the Company for any
action taken by Buyer or the Company in reliance upon the written instructions
or decisions of the Joint Holder Representatives, or otherwise on account of
payments or distributions made by or on behalf of Buyer in accordance with the
instructions of the Joint Holder Representatives.

Parties shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever with respect to any
such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation or otherwise relating to

contemplated by this Agreement (including with respect to any environmental,
health or safety matters). Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the avoidance of
doubt, any adjustments made to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.6(b)
shall not be considered "remedies" for purposes of this Section 12.2 and shall
not be limited by the terms of this Section 12.2. The provisions of and the
limited remedies provided in this Article XII were specifically bargained for
among the parties and were taken into account by the parties in arriving at

omissions existing, occurring or arising on or prior to the Closing relating
to the Company and its Subsidiaries and/or arising out of or relating to such

upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to principles or

convenience only and shall not be considered a part of or affect the
construction or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. This
Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the

schedules to which the relevance of such disclosure is reasonably apparent on
the face of such disclosure. Certain information set forth in the Schedules is
included solely for informational purposes and may not be required to be
disclosed pursuant to this Agreement. The disclosure of any information shall
not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment that such information is

to this Agreement), the Escrow Agreement (to be entered into at Closing), the
other ancillary agreements entered into in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby and that certain Confidentiality
Agreement, dated as of April 29, 2020, by and between Parent and Cremo

constitute the entire agreement among the parties relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby and supersede any prior agreements, whether written or
oral, that may have been made or entered into by or among any of the parties
hereto or any of their respective Subsidiaries relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby. No representations, warranties, covenants, understandings
or agreements, oral or otherwise, relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement exist between the parties, except as expressly set forth in

13.11 Publicity. Buyer and the Company have agreed to the text of a press
release announcing the execution of this Agreement (the "Execution
Announcement"). Except as may be required to comply with the requirements of
any applicable Law or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange or
national market system upon which the securities of Parent are listed,
including the filing of any Current Report on Form 8-K or other appropriate
filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, no party hereto will
issue any press release or other public announcement relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the
prior written consent of (x) the Joint Holder Representative, in the case of
Buyer, or, following the Closing, the Company or (y) Buyer, in the case of all
other parties hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without such prior
written consent, (a) the parties and Parent shall be permitted to issue a
press release or other public announcement containing information relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby that is substantially
consistent with information included in the Execution Announcement and (b)
Parent shall be entitled, without the written consent of the Joint Holder
Representatives, to answer questions from analysts and investors of Parent
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby provided,
that Parent's answers are not substantively inconsistent with information
included in a press release or other public announcement previously approved
pursuant to this Section 13.11; provided, further, that such answers do not
include non-public details regarding any Seller's ownership interest in the
Company as such. 13.12 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The parties further
agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any extent, held invalid
or unenforceable in any respect under the Laws governing this Agreement, they
shall take any actions necessary to render the remaining provisions of this
Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by Law and, to
the extent necessary, shall amend or otherwise modify this Agreement to
replace any provision contained herein that is held invalid or unenforceable
with a valid and enforceable provision giving effect to the intent of the
parties.

13.13 Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

(a)Any Action based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby may be brought in the Delaware Court of
Chancery (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable or shall
decline to accept jurisdiction, any other court of the State of Delaware or,
in the case of claims to which the federal courts have exclusive subject
matter jurisdiction, any federal court of the United States of America sitting
in the State of Delaware), and, in each case, appellate courts therefrom, and
each of the parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of each
such court in any such Action, waives any objection it may now or hereafter
have to personal jurisdiction, venue or to convenience of forum, agrees that
all claims in respect of such Action shall be heard and determined only in any
such court, and agrees not to bring any Action arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any other court.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to affect the right of any party to
serve process in any manner permitted by Law or to commence legal proceedings
or otherwise proceed against any other party in any other jurisdiction, in
each case, to enforce judgments obtained in any Action brought pursuant to
this Section 13.13(a).

(b)Each party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any
Action arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
Each party hereto (i) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of
any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would
not, in the event of any Action, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (ii)
acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter
into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waiver and
certifications in this Section 13.13(b).



13.14 Enforcement.

(a)The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur, and that the
parties would not have any adequate remedy at law, in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, without proof of actual damages or otherwise, in addition to any
other remedy to which any party is entitled at law or in equity. Each party
agrees to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with such remedy. The parties further agree not to assert that a
remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages
would provide an adequate remedy. To the extent any party hereto brings an
Action to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of
this Agreement (other than an Action to enforce specifically any provision
that by its terms requires performance after the Closing or expressly survives
termination of this Agreement), the Termination Date shall automatically be
extended to (i) the tenth (10th) Business Day following the resolution of such
Action or (ii) such other time period established by the court presiding over
such Action.

(b)The remedies available to the parties pursuant to this Section 13.14 shall
be in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity, and the election to pursue an injunction or specific performance shall
not restrict, impair or otherwise limit such party from, in the alternative,
seeking to terminate this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, the
parties hereby further acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing, any
party hereto shall be entitled to specific performance to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of, and to prevent or cure breaches of, this
Agreement by any other party hereto.



13.15 Non-Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim
or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby may only be brought against, the entities
that are expressly named as parties hereto and then only with respect to the
specific obligations set forth herein, as applicable, with respect to such
party. Except to the extent a named party to this Agreement (and then only to
the extent of the specific obligations undertaken by such named party in this
Agreement and not otherwise), no past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, debt financing source,
Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or representative or Affiliate of any of
the foregoing shall have any liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or
otherwise) for any one or more of the representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements or other obligations or liabilities of any one or more of the
Company, Buyer or the Sellers under this Agreement (whether for
indemnification or otherwise) or of or for any claim based on, arising out of,
or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

13.16 Waiver of Conflicts; Non-Assertion of Attorney-Client Privilege.

(a)Conflicts of Interest. Buyer acknowledges that Latham and Watkins LLP and
other legal counsel ("Prior Company Counsel") have, on or prior to the Closing
Date, represented one or more of the Joint Holder Representatives, one or more
Sellers, the Company, and its Subsidiaries and other Affiliates, and their
respective officers, employees and directors (each such Person, other than the
Company and its Subsidiaries, a "Designated Person") in one or more matters
relating to this Agreement or any other agreements or transactions
contemplated hereby (including any matter that may be related to a litigation,
claim or dispute arising under or related to this Agreement or such other
agreements or in connection with such transactions) (each, an "Existing
Representation"), and that, in the event of any post-Closing matters (x)
relating to this Agreement or any other agreements or transactions
contemplated hereby (including any matter that may be related to a litigation,
claim or dispute arising under or related to this Agreement or such other
agreements or in connection with such transactions) and (y) in which Buyer or
any of its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries), on the one
hand, and one or more Designated Persons, on the other hand, are or may be
adverse to each other (each, a "Post- Closing Matter"), the Designated Persons have informed Buyer that they
anticipate that Prior Company Counsel will represent them in connection with
such matters. Accordingly, each of Buyer and the Company hereby agrees (i)
waives and shall not assert, and agrees after the Closing to cause its
Affiliates to waive and to not assert, any conflict of interest arising out of
or relating to the representation by one or more Prior Company Counsel of one
or more Designated Persons in connection with one or more Post-Closing Matters
(each, a "Post-Closing Representation"), and (ii) agrees that, in the event
that a Post-Closing Matter arises, Prior Company Counsel may represent one or
more Designated Persons in a Post-Closing Matter even though the interests of
such Person(s) may be directly adverse to Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries), and even though Prior Company
Counsel may have represented the Company or its Subsidiaries in a matter
substantially related to such dispute. Without limiting the foregoing, each of
Buyer and the Company (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) consents to the
disclosure by Prior Company Counsel, in connection with one or more Post-
Closing Representations, to the Designated Persons of any information learned
by Prior Company Counsel in the course of one or more Existing
Representations, whether or not such information is subject to the attorney-
client privilege of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Prior Company
Counsel's duty of confidentiality as to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and whether or not such disclosure is made before or after the Closing.

(b)Attorney-Client Privilege. Each of Buyer and the Company (on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates) waives and shall not assert, and agrees after the
Closing to cause its Affiliates to waive and to not assert, any attorney-
client privilege, attorney work-product protection or expectation of client
confidence with respect to any communication between any Prior Company
Counsel, on the one hand, and any Designated Person or the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Pre-Closing Designated Persons"), or any
advice given to any Pre-Closing Designated Person by any Prior Company
Counsel, occurring during one or more Existing Representations (collectively,
"Pre-Closing Privileges") in connection with any Post-Closing Representation,
including in connection with a dispute between any Designated Person and one
or more of Buyer, the Company and their respective Affiliates, it being the
intention of the parties hereto that all rights to such Pre-Closing
Privileges, and all rights to waiver or otherwise control such Pre-Closing
Privilege, shall be retained by such Designated Persons and asserted by the
Joint Holder Representatives on their behalf, and shall not pass to or be
claimed or used by Buyer or the Company, except as provided in the last
sentence of this Section 13.16(b). Furthermore, each of Buyer and the Company
(on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) acknowledges and agrees that any
advice given to or communication with any of the Designated Persons shall not
be subject to any joint privilege (whether or not the Company or one more of
its Subsidiaries also received such advice or communication) and shall be
owned solely by such Designated Persons. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in
the event that a dispute arises between Buyer or the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and a third party other than a Designated
Person, on the other hand, the Company may assert the Pre-Closing Privileges
on behalf of the Designated Persons to prevent disclosure to such third party,
provided, however, that such privilege may be waived only with the prior
written consent of the Joint Holder Representatives, acting on behalf of the
applicable Designated Persons (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) and (ii) the foregoing provisions of this Section
13.16(b) shall not extend to any communication or materials not involving the
negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any claims brought in connection with such transactions or this
Agreement.



13.17 Limited Guarantee. As a material inducement to Sellers to enter into
this Agreement and to consummate the transactions hereunder, Parent hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to the Sellers the due and punctual
payment in full of Buyer's payment obligations under this Agreement (the
"Buyer's Obligations"), as a principal and not as a surety. Parent agrees that
such guarantee shall be a guarantee of payment and not of collection and that
Sellers shall not be required to pursue any right or remedy they may have
against Buyer under this Agreement or otherwise or to first commence any
proceeding or obtain any judgment against Buyer in order to enforce this
Section 13.17. This Section shall not be deemed to enlarge any obligations of
Buyer under this Agreement, and all obligations of Parent under this Section
13.17 shall be limited in time and scope and in any other manner as Buyer's
obligations under this Agreement are limited, except that Parent hereby
expressly waives any notice of acceptance; presentment and protest of any
instrument, and notice thereof; notice of default; and all other notices to
which Parent might otherwise be entitled and all rights and defenses arising
by reason of election of remedies and by reason of the bankruptcy or
insolvency of Buyer. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, Sellers hereby agree that Parent may assert, as a defense to
payment or performance by Parent under this Section 13.17, or as an
affirmative claim against Sellers or their respective Affiliates, or any
Person claiming by, through or on behalf of any of them, any rights, remedies,
set-offs and defenses that Buyer could assert pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement (other than any such rights, remedies, set-offs and defenses arising
out of, due to, or as a result of, the insolvency or bankruptcy of Buyer or
any of its Affiliates, including Parent, or a lack of corporate power or
authority of Buyer). Parent hereby represents and warrants to the Company and
Sellers as follows: (i) Parent is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Missouri; (ii)
Parent has full power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to
perform its obligations hereunder; (iii) the execution and delivery by Parent
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of
Parent; (iv) this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and
(assuming this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
the other parties hereto), constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation
of Parent, enforceable against Parent in accordance with its terms, subject to
the Remedies Exception; and (v) the execution and delivery of this Agreement
by Parent and the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby
do not and will not, as of the Closing, (a) violate any provision of, or
result in the breach of, any applicable Law to which Parent is subject or by
which any property or asset of Parent is bound, or (b) conflict with the
constitutional documentation of Parent.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF the parties have hereunto caused this Agreement to be duly
executed as of the date first above written.
