Purchase Price, as so adjusted "Preliminary Purchase Price"), the resulting
Preliminary Purchase Price and the Closing Amount, in each case, using the
best information reasonably available to Seller at the Closing Date, along
with such data in Seller's possession as is reasonably necessary to support
such calculations. The Preliminary Settlement Statement also shall set forth
Seller's designated account for purposes of Buyer's payment of the Closing
Amount. The Parties shall attempt to agree upon the Preliminary Purchase
Price prior to Closing, and in the event the Parties cannot agree upon the
Preliminary Purchase Price prior to Closing, Seller's calculation of the
Preliminary Purchase Price and the Closing Amount as set forth in the
Preliminary Settlement Statement shall be used by the Parties for purposes of
Closing.  \t\t

RESPECT TO THE PROPERTIES AND OTHER ASSETS (OTHER THAN FOR BREACHES OF Section
7.1(a)(1), Section 7.1(a)(2), Section 7.1(a)(3), Section 7.1(a)(4) or
Section 7.1(a)(6), respectively or under ARTICLE 13 for breaches of Seller's
representations and warranties in Section 5.12, Section 5.13 or Section
5.14), INCLUDING ANY TITLE DEFECT, SHALL BE AS PROVIDED FOR IN SECTION 4.1,
SECTION 4.2, SECTION 4.3, ARTICLE 13 (for breaches of Seller's
representations and warranties in Section 5.12, Section 5.13 or Section 5.14)
AND THE "SPECIAL WARRANTY" CONTAINED IN THE ASSIGNMENT. Buyer will not be
entitled to make a claim for an amount which, with respect to an individual
Lease, exceeds the Allocated Value of such Lease. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Defensible Title. The term "Defensible Title" means such title of
Seller to the Properties immediately prior to the Effective Time that, subject
to and except for Permitted Encumbrances:  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(1)in the case of any Lease, entitles Seller to receive a Net Revenue
Interest with respect to the Target Formation of not less than the Net Revenue
Interest shown on Exhibit A with respect to the complete Target Formation for
such Lease, except (A) as otherwise specifically set forth in such Exhibit,
(B) for decreases in connection with those operations from and after the
Execution Date in which Seller may (if consented to by Buyer) be a non-
consenting co-owner, and (C) for decreases resulting from the establishment or
amendment of pools or units from and after the Execution Date; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(2)in the case of any Lease, entitles Seller to receive the Net
Mineral Acres with respect to the Target Formation of not less than the Net
Mineral Acres shown on Exhibit A with respect to the complete Target Formation
for such Lease, except as otherwise specifically set forth in such
Exhibit; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(3)with respect to any Lease that is in its primary term, such primary
term does not expire on or before the date set forth on Exhibit A as the
expiration date of the primary term for such Lease; and  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(4)is free and clear of Liens.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tIn evaluating the significance of any fact, circumstance or condition
for the purpose of determining Defensible Title or a Title Defect, due
consideration shall be given to whether such fact, circumstance or condition
is of the type expected to be encountered in the area involved and is usual
and customarily acceptable to reasonable and prudent operators, interest
owners, and/or purchasers engaged in the business of ownership, operation and
development of oil and gas properties with knowledge of such facts and
appreciation of their legal significance.  \t\t

any and all of the following: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(1)lessors' royalties, overriding royalties, net profits interests,
production payments, reversionary interests and similar burdens on or measured

reduce the Net Revenue Interest or Net Mineral Acres with respect to any of
the Target Formation for any Lease below the Net Revenue Interest or Net
Mineral Acres set forth on Exhibit A with respect to such Lease with respect
to the Target Formation for such Lease; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(2)Preferential Rights set forth on Schedule 5.6; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(3)Liens for Taxes that are not yet due and payable or that are being

Asset;  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(7)the terms and conditions of the Leases or of any compulsory pooling
or other order of the Texas Railroad Commission or any other Governmental
Entity; provided, however, that the net cumulative effect of such items does
not operate to reduce the Net Revenue Interest or Net Mineral Acres with
respect to any of the Target Formation for any Lease below the Net Revenue
Interest or Net Mineral Acres set forth on Exhibit A with respect to such
Lease with respect to the Target Formation for such Lease; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(8)materialmen's, mechanics', operators' or other similar Liens
arising (A) in the ordinary course of business or (B) incident to the
construction or improvement of any property in the ordinary course of
business, in each case for amounts not yet due and payable (including any
amounts being withheld as provided by Law) or that are being contested in good
faith in the normal course of business; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(9)such Title Defects and/or breaches of the "special warranty"
contained in the Assignment that Buyer has waived in writing; \t\t

materially impair or have a material adverse effect on the ownership or use of
such Lease; and \t\t

which Buyer failed to deliver a Notice of Defective Interests in accordance
with such Section prior to the Defect Notice Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(17)All outstanding Bonus Payments set forth on Schedule 5.14. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.2Title Defects and Title Benefits. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Title Defect. The term "Title Defect" means any Lien, obligation,
defect, or other matter that causes Seller not to have Defensible Title to any
Property, provided, however, that none of the following shall be considered
Title Defects: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(1)defects in the chain of title consisting of the failure to recite
marital status in a document unless Buyer provides affirmative evidence that
such failure has resulted in another party's actual and superior claim of
title; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(2)defects arising out of lack of survey or lack of metes and bounds
description unless Buyer provides affirmative evidence that the same has
resulted in another party's actual and superior claim of title; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(3)defects asserting a change in Net Revenue Interest based on a
change in drilling and spacing units, tract allocation or other changes in
pool or unit participation occurring after the Effective Time by a Person

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(4)defects arising out of lack of corporate or other entity
authorization unless Buyer provides affirmative evidence that such lack of
authorization has resulted in another party's actual and superior claim of
title;  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(5)defects that have been cured by applicable Laws of limitations,
prescription, laches or otherwise; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(6)defects based on a gap in Seller's chain of title in the State of
Texas' records as to any applicable Leases where the State of Texas or its
agent is the lessor thereunder, or in the applicable county records in the
State of Texas as to the other Leases, unless (a) such gap is affirmatively
shown to exist in such records by an abstract of title, title opinion or
landman's title chain or runsheet, which documents shall be provided with
delivery of a Notice of Defective Interest with respect to such defects, and
(b) Buyer provides affirmative evidence that such gap in title results in
another Person's superior claim of title to the relevant Assets, which
evidence shall be included with such Notice of Defective Interest; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(7)defects or irregularities resulting from or related to probate
proceedings or lack thereof unless Buyer provides affirmative evidence that
such probate proceedings or lack thereof has resulted in another party's
actual and superior claim of title; \t\t

 \t\t\t(8)defects arising from prior oil and gas leases relating to the Lands
that are terminated, expired or invalid but not surrendered of record;  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(9)any defect that affects only which Person has the right to receive
royalty payments (rather than the amount of such royalty) and that does not
affect the validity of the underlying Lease;  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(10)any Lien, defect, irregularity or other matter that (i) does not
operate to reduce the Net Revenue Interest or Net Mineral Acres with respect
to any of the Target Formation for any Lease below the Net Revenue Interest or
Net Mineral Acres set forth on Exhibit A with respect to such Lease with
respect to the Target Formation for such Lease and (ii) would customarily be
waived by a reasonably prudent owner of oil and gas properties; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(11)defects based on references to lack of information (unless such
information (A) is not reflected in the records of the applicable county and
(B) is not in the Records made available to Buyer).  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Title Benefit. The term "Title Benefit" means any right,
circumstance or condition that operates to increase the Net Revenue Interest
or Net Mineral Acres of Seller with respect to the Target Formation in any
Lease above that shown on Exhibit A with respect to the Target Formation for
such Lease. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)Notice of Defective Interest. In order to assert a Title Defect,
on or before the Defect Notice Date, Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of
any matters that, in Buyer's reasonable opinion, constitute a Title Defect
(such notice, a "Notice of Defective Interests"). To be effective, each
Notice of Defective Interests shall be in writing and contain the following:
(1) a clear

description of the alleged Title Defect, (2) each Property (and the applicable
intervals therein) affected by the alleged Title Defect (each such Property, a
"Title Defect Property"), (3) the Allocated Value of each Title Defect
Property, (4) supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller (as well as
any title attorney or examiner hired by Seller) to identify the basis of the
alleged Title Defect, and (5) the amount which Buyer reasonably believes to be
the Title Defect Amount as provided for in Section 4.2(e), and the
computations and information upon which Buyer's beliefs are based. To give
Seller an opportunity to commence reviewing and curing Title Defects, prior to
the Defect Notice Date, Buyer agrees to use its reasonable efforts to give
Seller weekly notices of all Title Defects discovered by Buyer during the
preceding week; provided that any such notice may be preliminary in nature
and supplemented prior to the Defect Notice Date. Other than Buyer's remedies
for breaches of Section 7.1(a)(1), Section 7.1(a)(2), Section 7.1(a)(3),
Section 7.1(a)(4) or Section 7.1(a)(6), respectively or under ARTICLE 13 for
breaches of Seller's representations and warranties in Section 5.12, Section
5.13, or Section 5.14, any matters that may otherwise constitute a Title
Defect, but of which Seller has not been notified by Buyer in a Notice of
Defective Interests delivered in accordance with this Section 4.2(c) prior to
the Defect Notice Date, shall be deemed to have been waived by Buyer for all
purposes, except that Buyer's rights under the "special warranty" contained in
the Assignment shall only be deemed waived by Buyer to the extent Buyer had
Knowledge of such matter as of the Defect Notice Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)Notice of Title Benefits. On or prior to the Defect Notice Date,
Buyer will promptly furnish Seller with written notice (in accordance with the
requirements for a Title Benefit Notice below) of any matters that, in Buyer's
reasonable opinion, could constitute a Title Benefit, and that is discovered
by any of Buyer's or any of its Representatives (for the avoidance of doubt,
including any title attorneys, landmen or other title examiners) while
conducting Buyer's Due Diligence Review. On or before the Defect Notice Date,
in order to assert a Title Benefit, Seller shall advise Buyer in writing of
any matters that, in Seller's reasonable opinion, constitute a Title Benefit
(each such notice, a "Title Benefit Notice"). Each Title Benefit Notice shall
be in writing and contain the following: (1) a clear description of the Title
Benefit, (2) each Property (and the applicable intervals therein) affected by
the Title Benefit (each such Property, a "Title Benefit Property"), (3)
supporting documents reasonably necessary for Buyer (as well as any title
attorney or examiner hired by Buyer) to identify the basis of the Title
Benefit, and (4) the amount which Seller reasonably believes to be the Title
Benefit Amount for each Title Benefit Property and the computations and
information upon which Seller's belief is based. Subject to Seller's remedy
for a breach of this Section 4.2(d) by Buyer, Seller shall be deemed to have
waived all Title Benefits of which it has not given, or received, notice on or
before the Defect Notice Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e)Title Defect Amount. "Title Defect Amount" means the amount by
which the Allocated Value of a Title Defect Property affected by a Title
Defect is reduced as a result of the existence of such Title Defect, which
amount shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology, terms
and conditions: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(1)if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(2)if the Title Defect is a Lien that is undisputed and liquidated in
amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount of the payment
necessary to remove such Title Defect from the Title Defect Property;  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(3)in the event that the Title Defect for any Lease is the actual
failure of Seller to own the represented Net Revenue Interest with respect to
the Target Formation for such Lease set forth on Exhibit A, then the Title
Defect Amount shall be equal to the Allocated Value of the Title Defect
Property multiplied by a fraction, (A) the numerator of which is the
difference between (i) the actual Net Revenue Interest with respect to Target
Formation for the Title Defect Property, and (ii) the Net Revenue Interest
with respect to the Target Formation for such Title Defect Property as set
forth on Exhibit A, and (B) the denominator of which is the Net Revenue
Interest with respect to the Target Formation for such Title Defect Property
as set forth on Exhibit A;  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(4)in the event that the Title Defect for any Lease is the actual
failure of Seller to own the represented Net Mineral Acres with respect to the
Target Formation for such Lease set forth on Exhibit A, then the Title Defect
Amount shall be equal to (i) the Net Mineral Acres with respect to the Target
Formation for such Title Defect Property as set forth on Exhibit A, less the
actual Net Mineral Acres with respect to the Target Formation for the Title
Defect Property, multiplied by (ii) $1,500;  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(5)if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden
or charge upon or other defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type
not described in subsections (1), (2), (3) or (4) above, the Title Defect
Amount shall be determined by taking into account the following factors: (A)
any potential discrepancy between (i) the Net Revenue Interest or Net Mineral
Acres with respect to the Target Formation, as applicable, for such Title
Defect Property and (ii) the Net Revenue Interest or Net Mineral Acres, as
applicable, with respect to the Target Formation as stated on Exhibit A for
such Title Defect Property; (B) the Allocated Value of the Title Defect
Property; (C) the portion of the Title Defect Property affected by the Title
Defect; (D) the legal effect of the Title Defect; (E) the values placed upon
the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller; and (F) such other reasonable factors as
are necessary to make a proper evaluation; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(6)the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder, or for which Buyer otherwise receives credit in
the calculation of the adjusted Purchase Price hereunder.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f)Title Benefit Amount. The "Title Benefit Amount" means the amount
by which the Allocated Value of a Title Benefit Property affected by a Title
Benefit is increased as a result of the existence of such Title Benefit. Each
Title Benefit Amount shall be determined in accordance with the same
methodology, terms and conditions for determining each Title Defect Amount.
With respect to any Title Benefits reported under Section 4.2(d), the Title
Benefit Amount attributable to such Title Benefits shall be used first to
reduce the amount of the aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to Title
Defects properly and timely raised by Buyer and thereafter to increase the
Purchase Price by the amount, if any, of any remaining Title Benefit Amount
after offsetting all Title Defect Amounts as determined pursuant to this
Agreement. If the Parties cannot reach an agreement on alleged Title Benefits
or Title Benefit Amounts by the scheduled Closing, then (1) the average of
Seller's and Buyer's good faith estimate of such disputed Title Benefit Amount
shall be used in calculating the reduction to the Title Defect

provisions of Section 4.3 shall apply. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g)Title Adjustment Amount. The amount by which the Purchase Price is
to be adjusted in accordance with this ARTICLE 4 for Title Defect Amounts
(after, for the avoidance of doubt, taking into account any offsetting Title
Benefit Amounts) shall be referred to as the "Title Adjustment Amount". \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h)Seller's Right to Cure. Continuing until two (2) Business Days
prior to Closing (such period of time, the "Cure Period"), Seller shall have
the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to cure or
remove any Title Defects timely asserted by Buyer pursuant to Section 4.2(c).
If Seller believes that it has cured any applicable Title Defect, Seller shall
deliver written notice thereof to Buyer, together with supporting documents
available to Seller and reasonably necessary for Buyer (as well as any title
attorney or examiner hired by Buyer) to verify the cure of such Title Defect.
Buyer shall, within five (5) Business Days following Buyer's receipt of
written notice from Seller that it has cured the applicable Title Defect, but
in any event, no later than Closing, notify Seller in writing (including by
email) whether it agrees or disputes that any such Title Defect has been so
cured; provided that Buyer's failure to timely respond to Seller's notice of
cure shall be deemed Buyer's agreement that such Title Defect has been cured
and Buyer's waiver of its Claim with respect to such Title Defect. If Buyer
timely notifies Seller of a Dispute as to Seller's attempted cure of any Title
Defect, then (subject to Section 4.2(i)), the provisions of Section 4.3 shall
apply to such Title Defect.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i)Remedies for Title Defects. Subject to Seller's continuing right
to dispute the existence of a Title Defect and/or the Title Defect Amount
asserted with respect thereto, in the event that any Title Defect timely
asserted by Buyer in accordance with Section 4.2(c) is not waived in writing
by Buyer or cured by Seller prior to the end of the Cure Period, then Seller
shall elect (subject to Buyer's agreement as to clause (3)) one of the
following remedies with respect to such Title Defect shall apply: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(1)reduce the Purchase Price by the Title Defect Amount applicable to
such Title Defect; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(2)if the Title Defect Amount asserted by Buyer exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the Allocated Value of a Title Defect Property, Seller retains the
entirety of such Title Defect Property that is subject to such Title Defect
(together with all related Assets) and reduces the Purchase Price by an amount
equal to the Allocated Value of the Assets so retained; or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(3)subject to the mutual agreement of the Parties, Seller indemnifies
Buyer against all Losses (up to the Allocated Value of the applicable Title
Defect Property) resulting from such Title Defect with respect to the
applicable Title Defect Property based on the current use of such Title Defect
Property pursuant to an indemnity agreement mutually acceptable to the
Parties.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tAs to any Title Defect timely asserted by Buyer in accordance with
Section 4.2(c) which is not waived in writing by Buyer or cured by Seller at
Closing, and for which a corresponding Title

Defect Amount is included in the Title Adjustment Amount at Closing
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Title Defect which Seller has
chosen to dispute pursuant to Section 4.3), Seller also shall retain the
right, but not the obligation, to attempt to cure each such Title Defect
after Closing at Seller's sole cost and expense; provided that Seller shall
furnish notice to Buyer of Seller's belief that it has cured any such Title
Defect (together with supporting documents available to Seller and reasonably
necessary for Buyer, as well as any title attorney or examiner hired by it, to
verify the cure of any such Title Defect), by no later than the first Business
Day following the date that is ten (10) days prior to the Final Settlement
Statement Due Date. If Buyer disagrees that the Title Defect has been cured,
it shall so advise Seller in writing within five (5) Business Days after
receipt of Seller's notice as provided above, following which the provisions
of Section 4.3 will apply to resolve such Dispute, and the Final Settlement
Statement Due Date shall be extended to the extent necessary to complete the
Dispute resolution procedure as provided for in Section 4.3. Should Buyer
(A) fail to respond to Seller's notice of cure in such five (5) Business Day
period, then Buyer shall be deemed to have (i) agreed that the Title Defect
has been cured and (ii) waived its Claim with respect to such Title Defect, or
(B) agree that the Title Defect has been cured, then, in each case, the Title
Defect Amount attributable thereto and included in the Title Adjustment Amount
used to adjust the Purchase Price at Closing shall be credited to Seller in
the Final Settlement Statement and, in the event Seller, subject to Section
4.2(i)(2), retained any Assets attributable to such Title Defect at Closing,
Seller shall assign to Buyer such Assets that were so retained by Seller at
Closing pursuant to an instrument in substantially the same form as the
Assignment in exchange for Seller being credited (without duplication) the
entire Allocated Value of such Assets retained at Closing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.3Title Dispute Resolution. If prior to the Closing or, with respect
to the adequacy of Seller's Title Defect curative actions after Closing, after
the Closing, the Parties are unable to resolve any Title Disputed Matter, then
either Party shall have the right, upon the delivery of written notice to the
other Party (each, a "Title Dispute Notice"), to Dispute such Title Disputed
Matter and to invoke the Dispute resolution provisions below in this Section
4.3 in order to resolve any such Dispute. As used herein, the term "Title
Disputed Matter" means a Dispute regarding any of the following: (w) the
existence and scope of a Title Defect or Title Benefit; (x) any Title Defect
Amount or Title Benefit Amount, as the case may be; (y) the Title Adjustment
Amount, if any; and (z) the adequacy of Seller's Title Defect curative
actions. As to any Dispute regarding the adequacy of Seller's Title Defect
curative actions after Closing as provided for in Section 4.2(i), the Final
Settlement Statement Due Date shall be extended to the extent necessary to
complete the Dispute resolution procedure as provided for below in this
Section 4.3. Any Title Dispute Notice relating to any of Seller's Title
Defect curative actions taken during the Cure Period must be delivered within
five (5) Business Days following Buyer's receipt of notice from Seller that it
has cured the applicable Title Defect, but in any event, no later than
Closing. Any Title Dispute Notice relating to any of Seller's Title Defect
curative actions conducted post-Closing must be delivered within five (5)
Business Days following Buyer's receipt of notice from Seller that it has
cured the applicable Title Defect. In no event will Closing be delayed on
account of any Title Disputed Matter and, if the Title Defect Property
affected thereby is transferred to Buyer at Closing, the average of the
Parties' respective good faith estimates of the Title Defect Amounts
attributable to such Title Defect Property shall be used in the calculation
and determination of the Title Adjustment Amount to be used at Closing
(subject to subsequent corrective adjustment pursuant to this Section
4.3). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)The Parties shall attempt to resolve all Title Disputed Matters
through good faith negotiations for a period of twenty (20) days after the
delivery of a Title Dispute Notice by either Party. Following such
negotiation period, if the Title Disputed Matter at issue should remain in
Dispute, such Title Disputed Matter shall be resolved pursuant to this Section
4.3 and the Parties shall mutually appoint an independent expert within five
(5) Business Days after such negotiation period having the qualifications
specified below (the "Title Defect Expert"). If the Parties are unable to
mutually agree upon the Title Defect Expert, then the Parties shall, within
ten (10) days after the expiration of such negotiation period, request (and
either Party may so request alone if the other Party refuses to jointly act in
good faith to do so during such ten (10) day period) that the AAA, acting
through its offices in Houston, Texas, appoint the Title Defect Expert. The
Title Defect Expert shall be a licensed title attorney having a minimum of ten
(10) years' experience with regard to the types of title defects affecting the
Properties involved in the Title Disputed Matter, shall be without any
conflicts of interest as to the Parties, and shall not have been employed by
or undertaken more than $50,000 of work, in the aggregate, for any Party or
its Affiliates within the five year period preceding the submission of the
Dispute. For the avoidance of doubt, the Title Defect Expert will function as
an expert in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 4.3, not
as an arbitrator. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Within thirty (30) days following the appointment of the Title
Defect Expert, Seller and/or Buyer shall provide the Title Defect Expert with
a copy of this Agreement, and each Party shall provide, both to the Title
Defect Expert and each other, a summary of its position with regard to each
such outstanding Title Disputed Matter in a written document of five pages or
less per Title Disputed Matter. The Parties shall instruct the Title Defect
Expert that, within thirty (30) days after receiving the Parties' respective
submissions, the Title Defect Expert shall render a written decision. In
rendering its decision, the Title Defect Expert shall not award (1) a higher
Title Defect Amount than the lower of (A) the Allocated Value of the
applicable Property or (B) the amount claimed by Buyer in its summary, (2) a
higher Title Benefit Amount than the amount claimed by Seller in its summary,
(3) a lower Title Benefit Amount than the amount claimed by Buyer in its
summary or (4) a lower Title Defect Amount than that amount claimed by Seller
in its summary, as applicable. The Title Defect Expert shall determine the
specific disputed Title Defect, Title Benefit, Title Defect Amount, Title
Benefit Amount or the adequacy of Seller's Title Defect curative actions, as
the case may be, submitted by either Party and may not award damages, interest
or penalties to either Party with respect to any other matter. Any decision
rendered by the Title Defect Expert pursuant hereto shall be final,
conclusive, and binding on Seller and Buyer, and will be enforceable against
each Party in any court having jurisdiction hereof or jurisdiction of either
or both Parties, but is not reviewable by, or appealable to, any court except
in the event of fraud. The Parties shall each bear one-half of the costs of
the Title Defect Expert and of any associated dispute resolution process and
proceedings, except the Parties shall each bear its own legal fees with
respect to any Dispute.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)If the Title Defect Expert determines that a Title Defect did not
exist or that a Title Defect existed but was cured by Seller, then any Title
Defect Amount attributable thereto that was included in the Title Adjustment
Amount used at Closing, if any, shall be credited to Seller in the Final
Settlement Statement.  \t\t

but that the Title Defect Amount attributable thereto is a lesser amount than
any Title Defect Amount with respect

thereto that was included in the Title Adjustment Amount used at Closing, if
any, then the difference thereof shall be credited to Seller in the Final
Settlement Statement.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e)If the Title Defect Expert determines that a Title Defect exists,
such Title Defect has not been cured by Seller and the Title Defect Amount
attributable thereto is a greater amount than any Title Defect Amount with
respect thereto that was included in the Title Adjustment Amount used at
Closing, if any, then the difference thereof shall be credited to Buyer in
the Final Settlement Statement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f)Any such adjustments to the amount of the Purchase Price will be
reflected in the Final Settlement Statement as applicable. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.4Preferential Rights and Consents. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Preferential Purchase Rights. Promptly following the Execution
Date, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days following the Execution
Date, Seller shall send notices to the holder of each Preferential Right
listed on Schedule 5.6 (if applicable) in accordance with the terms of the
instruments giving rise to such Preferential Rights. Seller shall provide a
copy of each such notice to Buyer following the delivery thereof by Seller.
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause waivers of such
Preferential Rights to be obtained and delivered prior to Closing; provided
that Seller shall not be required to make payments or undertake other
obligations to or for the benefit of the holders of such Preferential Rights
in order to obtain the required waivers. Buyer shall cooperate with Seller in
seeking to obtain such waivers of Preferential Rights; provided that Buyer
shall not be required to make payments or undertake other obligations to or
for the benefit of the holders of such Preferential Rights in order to obtain
the required waivers. Any Preferential Rights must be exercised subject to
all terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement (including all
thresholds, deductibles and other amounts except for the cash consideration,
which shall equal the Allocated Value for such Asset), including the
successful Closing of this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE 11 as to those Assets
for which Preferential Rights have not been exercised. The consideration
payable under this Agreement for any particular Asset for purposes of
Preferential Rights notices shall be the Allocated Value for such Asset,
subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 2.4 and Section 12.1. If, prior to
the Closing Date, any Party discovers any required Preferential Right for
which notices have not been delivered pursuant to the first sentence of this
Section 4.4(a), then (x) the Party making such discovery shall provide the
other Party with written notification of such Preferential Right, (y) Seller,
following delivery or receipt of such written notification, as applicable,
will promptly send notices to the holders of such Preferential Rights in
accordance with the terms of the instrument giving rise to such Preferential
Right, and (z) the terms and conditions of this Section 4.4(a) shall apply to
the Assets subject to such Preferential Right. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(1)If, prior to Closing, any holder of a Preferential Right notifies
Seller that it intends to consummate the purchase of the Assets to which its
Preferential Right applies or if the time for exercising such Preferential
Right has not expired, then the Assets subject to such Preferential Right
(together with all related Assets) shall be excluded from the Assets to be
assigned to Buyer at Closing, and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
sum of the Allocated Values of such Assets so excluded.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(2)Seller shall be entitled to all proceeds paid by any Person
exercising a Preferential Right prior to Closing. If such holder of such
Preferential Right thereafter fails to consummate the purchase of the Assets
subject to such Preferential Right (together with all related Assets) on or
before the end of the time period for closing such sale or the time for
exercising such Preferential Right expires without exercise by the holder
thereof, then (A) Seller shall so notify Buyer, (B) Seller shall assign to
Buyer, on the tenth (10th) Business Day following the end of such time period
or termination of such right without exercise, such Assets that were so
excluded at Closing pursuant to an instrument in substantially the same form
as the Assignment, and (C) Buyer shall pay to Seller, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the amount by which the Purchase Price was
reduced at Closing with respect to such excluded Assets, as adjusted pursuant
to Section 2.4 and Section 12.1.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(3)All Assets for which any applicable Preferential Right has been
waived, or as to which the time for exercising the applicable Preferential
Right has expired, in each case, prior to Closing, shall be transferred to
Buyer at Closing, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Consents. Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, and
in any event within three (3) Business Days following the Execution Date,
Seller shall send notices to the holder of each Consent listed on Schedule 5.5
requesting such holder's applicable Consent to the transactions contemplated
hereby. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
Consents to be obtained and delivered prior to Closing; provided that Seller
shall not be required to make payments or undertake other obligations to or
for the benefit of the holders of such Consents in order to obtain the
required Consents. Buyer shall cooperate with Seller in seeking to obtain
such Consents to assignment; provided that Buyer shall not be required to make
payments or undertake other obligations to or for the benefit of the holders
of such Consents in order to obtain the required Consents. If, prior to the
Closing Date, any Party discovers any Consents for which notices have not been
delivered pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 4.4(b), then (x) the
Party making such discovery shall provide the other Party with written
notification of such Consents, (y) Seller, following delivery or receipt of
such written notification, as applicable, will promptly send notices to the
holders of Consents requesting such Consents, and (z) the terms and conditions
of this Section 4.4(b) shall apply to the Assets subject to such
Consents. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(1)If (A) Seller fails to obtain any Consent prior to Closing and the
failure to obtain such Consent would (i) cause the assignment of the Assets
affected thereby to Buyer to be void or voidable or (ii) give the holder of
such Consent the right to terminate the applicable underlying Lease under the
express terms thereof or (B) Seller fails to obtain a Consent (i) identified
as a "Required Consent" on Schedule 5.5 or (ii) held by a Governmental Entity
prior to Closing, then, in each case, the Assets affected by such un-obtained
Consent (each, a "Required Consent") (together with all related Assets, the
"Affected Assets") shall be excluded from the Assets to be assigned to Buyer
at Closing, and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the sum of the
Allocated Value of such Affected Assets.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(2)If any such Required Consent relating to Affected Assets that was
not obtained prior to Closing is obtained within ninety (90) days following
the Closing, then

 \t\t

  \t\t

(A) on the fifteenth (15th) Business Day after such Required Consent is
obtained, Seller shall assign such Affected Assets to Buyer pursuant to an
instrument in substantially the same form as the Assignment, and (B) Buyer
shall pay to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the
amount by which the Purchase Price was reduced at Closing with respect to such
Affected Assets, as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.4 and Section 12.1, and as
would be further adjusted for such Affected Asset pursuant to Section 2.4 and
Section 12.1 as if the Closing had occurred on the date of such assignment
such that Buyer shall receive the benefit of such transferred asset and bear
the burden of such transferred asset from the Effective Time. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(3)If Seller fails to obtain any Consent that is not a Required
Consent prior to Closing, then (A) the Assets subject to such un-obtained
Consent shall nevertheless be assigned by Seller to Buyer at Closing as part
of the Assets and Seller (for a period of sixty (60) days following Closing)
and Buyer shall each use their commercially reasonable efforts following
Closing to obtain such Consent, (B) Buyer shall have no claim against Seller,
and Seller shall have no liability for, the failure to obtain any such Consent
and (C) Buyer shall be responsible from and after the Closing for any and all
Losses arising from the failure to obtain such Consent. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Disclaimer. Buyer acknowledges that Seller may own interests in
Assets along with other working interest owners and which Seller does not have
the contractual right to control and no action required by a vote of working
interest owners in and of itself shall constitute a breach of this Section 7.1

provisions of this Section 7.1.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t7.2Covenants and Agreements of Buyer. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Buyer covenants and agrees with Seller that Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to assure that, as of the Closing Date, it
will not be under any material legal, contractual or other restriction that
would prohibit or delay the timely consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided that for the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall not
be obligated to incur any out of pocket expenses or make any other
commitment. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Governmental Bonds. Buyer acknowledges that none of the bonds,
letters of credit and guarantees, if any, posted by Seller or its Affiliates
with Governmental Entities and relating to the Assets are transferable to
Buyer. On or before the Closing Date, Buyer shall obtain, or cause to be

In addition, at or prior to Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Seller evidence of
the posting of bonds or other security with all applicable Governmental
Entities meeting the requirements of such authorities to own and, where
appropriate, operate, the Assets.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)Confidentiality. As used herein, the term "Confidential
Information" means all proprietary information of whatever nature, in whatever
form (including written, graphic, digital, electronic or otherwise), which may
be disclosed by Seller or its Representatives to Buyer or its Representatives,
or otherwise obtained by Buyer or its Representatives, regarding the Assets
(whether pursuant to Buyer's Due Diligence Review or otherwise), including the
following types of information, documents and other materials: (w) geological,

materials, in whatever form, which may be generated by Buyer from any

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(1)Subject to Section 7.2(c)(2) and Section 7.2(c)(3), Buyer agrees

shall not be sold, traded,

published, transferred or otherwise disclosed to any other Person in any
manner whatsoever, including electronically or by any other means of
reproduction or transmittal, without Seller's specific prior written consent.
Without limiting the scope of Buyer's obligations under the immediately
preceding sentence, Buyer shall take protective measures for the Confidential
Information which are at least as stringent as for its own confidential and
proprietary information. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(2)Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Buyer may disclose
Confidential Information without Seller's specific prior written consent only
to the extent that such disclosed Confidential Information: (A) at the time
disclosed, is part of the public domain other than through the act or omission
of Buyer or its Representatives in violation of the provisions of this Section
7.2(c); (B) was, prior to the Effective Time, acquired independently by Buyer
from a Third Party who (i) lawfully obtained such Confidential Information,
(ii) did not derive such Confidential Information directly or indirectly from
Seller or its Representatives and Confidential Information and (iii)
represented that it had the right to disseminate such information to Buyer;
(C) is developed by Buyer or any of its Affiliates independently, and without
the use of or reference to, any of the Confidential Information; or (D) is
required to be disclosed by Buyer under applicable Law, including any
recognized securities exchange on which the shares of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates are actively traded; provided that Buyer will make all reasonable
efforts to give Seller prior written notice of any such required disclosure
and the opportunity to seek a protective order if Seller wishes, all to the
extent permitted by applicable Law; provided further, if Seller wishes, but is
unable, to obtain such protective order, then (I) Buyer may disclose to the
appropriate Governmental Entity or other authority only that portion of the
Confidential Information which Buyer is legally required to disclose and Buyer
shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that confidential
treatment will be accorded to the Confidential Information and (II) Buyer
shall not be liable to Seller for such disclosure to the extent made in
accordance with this Section. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(3)Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may disclose Confidential
Information to any of its Affiliates and other Representatives without
Seller's prior written consent, provided that Buyer shall remain liable
hereunder for any failure of such Affiliate or other Representative to
maintain such Confidential Information as strictly confidential in accordance
with the terms of this Section 7.2(c). Buyer shall ensure that each such
Affiliate and other Representative is aware of Buyer's obligations under this
Section 7.2(c) and shall ensure compliance by each such Affiliate and other
Representative with all such obligations. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t7.3Covenants and Agreements of the Parties. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Communication Between the Parties Regarding Breach. If Buyer or
Seller obtains Knowledge prior to Closing that leads either Party to believe
that the other Party has breached a representation or warranty or failed to
perform a covenant or agreement under this Agreement, the non-breaching Party
shall inform the alleged breaching Party in writing of such potential breach
as soon as reasonably practicable so that the breaching Party may attempt to
remedy or cure such breach prior to the Closing. If such breach or failure is
thereafter cured to the reasonable satisfaction of the non-breaching Party by
the Closing (or, if the Closing does not occur, by the

not to have occurred for all purposes of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Government Reviews. In a timely manner and at least thirty (30)
days prior to Closing, the Parties shall (1) make all required filings,
prepare all required applications and conduct negotiations with each
Governmental Entity as to which such filings, applications or negotiations are
necessary or appropriate in the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and (2) provide such information as each may reasonably request to make
such filings, prepare such applications and conduct such negotiations. Each
Party shall reasonably cooperate with and use all commercially reasonable
efforts to assist the other with respect to such filings, applications, and
negotiations. Without limiting the foregoing, if the Parties determine that a
filing under the HSR Act is required, then, within ten (10) Business Days
following the Execution Date, the Parties will prepare and file with the DOJ
and the FTC the notification and report form required by the HSR Act for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and request early termination of
the waiting period thereunder. Each of the Parties agree to respond promptly
to any inquiries from the DOJ or the FTC concerning such filings and to comply
in all material respects with the filing requirements of the HSR Act. The
Parties shall cooperate with each other and shall promptly furnish all
information to the other Parties that is necessary in connection with Buyer's
compliance with the HSR Act. The Parties shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to take all actions reasonably necessary and appropriate in
connection with any HSR Act filing to consummate the transactions consummated
hereby. All filing fees incurred in connection with the HSR Act filings made
pursuant to this Section 7.3(b) shall be borne by Buyer. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)Amendment of Schedules. Buyer agrees that Seller shall have the
continuing right until Closing to add, supplement or amend the Schedules and
Exhibits with respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if existing as of
the Execution Date or thereafter, would have been required to be set forth or
described in such Schedules and Exhibits. For purposes of determining whether
the conditions set forth in ARTICLE 9 have been fulfilled, the Schedules and
Exhibits to Seller's representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement shall be deemed to include only that information contained therein
on the Execution Date and shall be deemed to exclude all information contained
in any addition, supplement or amendment thereto; provided, however, that if
Closing shall occur, then all matters disclosed pursuant to any such addition,
supplement or amendment at or prior to Closing shall be waived and deemed part
of the Schedules and Exhibits for all purposes and Buyer shall not be entitled
to make any Claim with respect thereto pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
or otherwise. \t\t

period shall be allocated to Seller based on the percentage of the assessment
period occurring before the Effective Time and to Buyer based on the
percentage of the assessment period occurring on or after the Effective Time.
Each Party shall promptly furnish to the other Party copies of any Asset Tax
assessments and statements (or invoices therefor from any applicable Third
Party operator of the Assets) received by it, to the extent such assessment,
statement, or invoice relates to an Asset Tax allocable to the other Party
under this Section 8.1. Seller shall estimate all Asset Taxes asserted
against it that are attributable to the ownership or operation of the Assets
to the extent relating to the period on and after the Effective Time and
through the Closing Date, together with all Subject Transfer Taxes, and
incorporate such estimates into the Preliminary Settlement Statement. The
actual amounts (to the extent the actual amounts differ from the estimates
included in the Preliminary Settlement Statement and are known at the time of
the Final Settlement Statement) shall be accounted for in the Final Settlement
Statement. If the actual amounts are not known at the time of the Final
Settlement Statement, the amounts shall be re-estimated, as necessary, based

Statement.  \t\t

 \t\t

real estate transfer Taxes but excluding Taxes on gross income, net income or
gross receipts), duties, levies, recording fees or other governmental charges
incurred by or imposed with respect to the property transfers undertaken
pursuant to this Agreement ("Subject Transfer Taxes") shall be the
responsibility of, and shall be paid by, Buyer. The Parties shall reasonably
cooperate in taking steps that would minimize or eliminate any Subject
Transfer Taxes. Buyer agrees to file all Subject Transfer Tax Returns
relating to such Subject Transfer Taxes and to reasonably consult with Seller
regarding any such filing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t8.3Asset Tax Returns. Seller shall provide Buyer with any information
Seller has that is reasonably necessary for Buyer to file any required Tax
Return with respect to Asset Taxes that are due after the Closing Date. All
such Tax Returns shall be prepared by Buyer in a manner consistent with the
prior practice of Seller, to the extent permitted by Law and in a manner
consistent with the allocation described in Section 2.3(a), Section 2.3(b)
and, if applicable, the final Section 1060 allocation schedule. Buyer shall
provide Seller with copies of completed drafts of such Tax Returns at least
twenty (20) days prior to the due date for filing thereof, to the extent
reasonably practicable, along with supporting work papers, for Seller's
review. Buyer shall consider in good faith any comment that Seller submits to
Buyer no less than ten (10) days prior to the due date of such Tax Returns.
Buyer shall file all such Tax Returns and, subject to the provisions of
Section 8.1, pay all Asset Taxes due and payable with respect to such Tax
Returns. To the extent Buyer makes any payment of Asset Taxes pursuant to
this Section 8.3 for which Seller is liable pursuant to Section 8.1 and which
exceeds the amount taken into account in the Final Settlement Statement,
Seller shall reimburse Buyer for such excess amount no later than ten (10)
days after Buyer delivers a statement to Seller setting forth the amount of
reimbursement to which Buyer is entitled along with such supporting evidence
as is reasonably necessary to calculate the amount of reimbursement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t8.4Tax Cooperation. Buyer and Seller shall each cooperate fully as
and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with
the filing of any Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding
(each, a "Tax Proceeding") with respect to Taxes relating to or in connection
with the Assets. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the

Assets); and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e)Seller shall have delivered, or be ready, willing and able to
deliver, to Buyer the deliverables set forth in Section 11.3. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tprovided, however, that neither Buyer nor Seller shall have the right

such Party is at such time in material breach of any provision of this
Agreement.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)If Seller has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)If this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than as set
forth in Section 10.2(a), then Seller shall return the Performance Deposit to
Buyer, without interest, free and clear of any claims thereon by Seller or its
Affiliates. If Buyer has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to

 \t\t\t11.1Date of Closing. Subject to the conditions stated in this
Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(the "Closing") shall occur on (a) September 19, 2017, provided that if the

Seller at 10:00 a.m. Houston, Texas time or at such other time and place as
Buyer and Seller may agree in writing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.3Closing Obligations. At Closing, the following events shall

have occurred simultaneously with the others: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Seller and Buyer shall each execute, acknowledge and deliver

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Final Settlement Statement. As soon as practicable after the
Closing, but in no event later than one hundred twenty (120) days after
Closing except as may be otherwise expressly provided herein, (the "Final
Settlement Statement Due Date"), Seller will cause to be prepared and
delivered to Buyer, in accordance with GAAP and customary industry accounting
practices, a settlement statement setting forth each adjustment to the
Purchase Price in accordance with Section 2.4 and showing the calculation of
such adjustments and the resulting final purchase price (the "Final Purchase
Price" and such statement, the "Final Settlement Statement"). Within thirty
(30) days after its receipt of the Final Settlement Statement, Buyer shall
deliver to Seller a written report containing any changes that Buyer proposes
to make to the Final Settlement Statement. Buyer's failure to deliver to
Seller a written report detailing proposed changes to the Final Settlement
Statement by such date shall be deemed to be an acceptance by Buyer of the
Final Settlement Statement delivered by Seller. The Parties shall endeavor to
agree with respect to the changes proposed by Buyer, if any, by no later than
sixty (60) days after Buyer's receipt of Seller's proposed Final Settlement
Statement. Should the Parties fail to agree on the Final Settlement Statement
and Final Purchase Price by such date, either Party may invoke the Dispute
resolution procedures provided for in Section 12.1(b). The date upon which
such agreement is reached or upon which the Final Purchase Price is determined
pursuant to Section 12.1(b) shall be herein called the "Final Settlement
Date." If such agreed or determined Final Purchase Price is more than the
Preliminary Purchase Price, Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount of such
difference by wire transfer in immediately available funds no later than five
(5) Business Days after the Final Settlement Date. If such agreed or
determined Final Purchase Price is less than the Preliminary Purchase Price,
Seller shall pay the amount of such difference to Buyer by wire transfer in
immediately available funds no later than five (5) Business Days after the
Final Settlement Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Dispute Resolution. Within ten (10) days after either Party
invokes the Dispute resolution procedures of this Section 12.1(b) pursuant to
Section 12.1(a), the Parties shall mutually appoint (and either Party may on
its own appoint such expert if the other Party refuses to act in good faith to
jointly appoint such expert during such ten day period) an independent expert
having the qualifications specified below (the "Accounting Expert"). If the
Parties are unable to mutually agree upon the Accounting Expert within such
ten (10) day period, then the Parties shall, within ten (10) days after the
expiration of such foregoing ten (10) day period, request that the AAA, acting
through its offices in Houston, Texas, appoint the Accounting Expert. The
Accounting Expert shall be a certified public accountant having a minimum of
ten (10) years' experience with regard to the types of matters involved in the
Dispute, shall be without any conflicts of interest as to the Parties, and
shall not have been employed by or undertaken more than $50,000 of work, in
the aggregate, for any Party or its Affiliates within the five year period
preceding the submission of the Dispute. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Accounting Expert will function as an expert in accordance with the foregoing
procedure, not as an arbitrator. Within fifteen (15) days following the
appointment of the Accounting Expert, Seller and/or Buyer shall provide the
Accounting Expert with a copy of this Agreement, and each Party shall provide,
both to the Accounting Expert and to each other, a summary of its position
with regard to each such outstanding matter involving the Final Settlement
Statement in a written document of five pages or less per outstanding Disputed
matter. The Parties shall instruct the Accounting Expert that, within thirty
(30) days after receiving the last of the Parties' respective submissions or
the expiration of such fifteen (15) day period if either Party fails to make a
submission, the Accounting Expert shall render a decision, choosing only
either Buyer's position or Seller's position with respect to each Disputed
matter. Any decision rendered by the Accounting Expert pursuant hereto shall
be final, conclusive and binding

on Seller and Buyer, and will be enforceable against each Party in any court
having jurisdiction hereof or jurisdiction of either or both Parties, but is
not reviewable by, or appealable to, any court except in the event of fraud.
The Parties shall each bear one-half of the costs of the Accounting Expert and
of any associated Dispute resolution proceedings, except the Parties shall
each bear its own legal fees with respect to any Dispute. The Final
Settlement Statement shall be re-issued by Seller if and as necessary to
conform to the Accounting Expert's decision.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t12.2Records. Seller shall make the Records available for pick up by
Buyer within ten (10) days following the Closing Date. Seller may retain
copies of the Records, and Seller shall have the right to review and copy, at
Seller's cost, the original Records during standard business hours and upon
reasonable notice to Buyer for so long as Buyer retains the Records, which
shall be a minimum of six (6) years after the Closing Date. Buyer agrees that
the Records will be maintained in compliance with all applicable Laws
governing document retention.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t12.3Further Assurances. From time to time after Closing, Seller and
Buyer shall each execute, acknowledge and deliver to the other such further
instruments and take such other action as may be reasonably requested by the
other Party, at such requesting Party's cost, and as are commercially
reasonable to be performed in order to accomplish more effectively the
purposes of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including those
post-Closing actions contemplated by Section 4.4(a) and Section 4.4(b).
Promptly after Closing, Buyer shall: (a) record the Assignments of the Assets
and all state and federal assignments executed at the Closing in all
applicable real property records and/or, if applicable, all state and federal
Governmental Entities and Buyer shall provide to Seller copies of such
recorded documents; (b) actively pursue the approval of all Customary Post-
Closing Consents from the applicable Governmental Entities; and (c) subject to
the preceding sentence and Section 4.4(a) and Section 4.4(b) actively pursue
all other consents and approvals that may be required in connection with the
assignment of the Assets to Buyer and the assumption of the rights, interests,
obligations and liabilities assumed by Buyer hereunder that have not been
obtained prior to Closing, provided that Seller shall reasonably cooperate
with Buyer in obtaining such other consents and approvals, at Buyer's
cost. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t12.4Tax Claims. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)If notice of any action, suit, investigation, audit or other Claim
is received by Buyer with respect to Taxes for which Seller may reasonably be
expected to be liable under this Agreement or applicable Law (a "Tax Claim"),
Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of such Tax Claim within ten (10) days
after it is received by Buyer. Such notice shall contain factual information
describing the asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail and shall include
copies of any notice or other document received from any Governmental
Authority in respect of any such asserted Tax liability. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Buyer shall have the right (but not the obligation), at its sole
cost and liability and subject to releasing Seller from all obligations and to
defending, indemnifying and holding Seller harmless from all liabilities under
and with respect to any such Tax Claim, to elect to represent the interests of
Seller in defending, settling, compromising, admitting, or acknowledging any
Tax Claim received by Buyer as described in Section 12.4(a); provided, that
Buyer shall keep Seller fully and currently apprised of all developments
relating to such Tax Claim, and that Buyer shall not settle such Tax Claim
without the consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably

withheld, conditioned, or delayed; and also provided that if Buyer so elects
to represent the interests of Seller in any such Tax Claim, at the further
election of Seller (in the event Buyer elects to so represent the interests of
Seller as to any such Tax Claim), Buyer and Seller shall jointly control (and
shall share the costs and liabilities on a 50/50 several basis) any defense,
settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment of any Tax Claim, in
which event no Tax Claim shall be settled or compromised without the prior
written approval of each of Buyer and Seller, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed by either Party. In the event Buyer does not
so elect to represent the interests of Seller in any Tax Claim, the provisions
of Section 13.3(b) shall govern the conduct of any such Tax Claim. Buyer and
Seller shall each provide the other with all information reasonably necessary
to conduct a Tax Claim with respect to Taxes or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)Buyer shall not file an amended Tax Return relating to or in
connection with the Assets with respect to any period or partial period ended
on or before the Closing Date without the prior written consent of Seller, if
such amendment would have, or would reasonably be expected to have, an adverse
effect on Seller under this Agreement or under applicable Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tARTICLE 13 
ASSUMPTION AND RETENTION OF OBLIGATIONS AND INDEMNIFICATION; DISCLAIMERS \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t13.1Buyer's Assumption of Liabilities and Obligations. Upon Closing,

pursuant to Section 13.2(a) and (ii) without limiting the amounts or benefits
to Buyer with respect to the downward adjustments to the Purchase Price
contemplated by Section 2.4(c) to which Buyer is entitled, Buyer shall assume

shall Seller's aggregate liability under the aforementioned provisions,
together with all other liabilities of Seller under this Agreement and any
other agreement, contract or instrument contemplated herein (including with
respect to the "special warranty" contained in the Assignment), exceed 100% of
the Purchase Price. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(4)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no
event shall Seller have any obligation to provide indemnification for any
matters to the extent accounted for in the Preliminary Settlement Statement or
the Final Settlement Statement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Buyer acknowledges that it has had the opportunity to conduct
due diligence and investigation with respect to the Assets and the Companies,
and in no event shall Seller have any liability to Buyer with respect to any
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant under this Agreement to the
extent that Buyer was aware of such breach as of the Execution Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)Sole Remedy. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary or in any other agreement, contract or instrument contemplated
herein, from and after Closing, Seller's and Buyer's sole and exclusive
remedies against each other with respect to any and all Claims for breaches of
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement or under any other agreement, contract or instrument contemplated
herein (including the affirmations of the representations and warranties
contained in the certificates delivered by each Party at Closing pursuant to
Section 9.2(c) and Section 9.3(c), as applicable) or otherwise in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, are exclusively set forth in
Section 8.3, this Section 13.2 and the "special warranty" contained in the
Assignment, and if no such right of defense or indemnification or to be held
harmless is expressly provided in Section 8.3, this Section 13.2 or the
"special warranty" contained in the Assignment, then such Claims are hereby
waived by the Parties to the fullest extent permitted by Law. Except for the
remedies contained in Section 8.3, this Section 13.2 and the "special
warranty" contained in the Assignment, each Party (including as to its
respective Indemnified Parties) releases, remises, and forever discharges the
other Party (including as to its respective Indemnified Parties) from any and
all suits, legal or administrative proceedings, Claims, demands, damages,
Losses, costs, liabilities, interest, causes of action and other obligations
whatsoever, in Law or in equity, known or unknown, which such Parties might
now or subsequently may have, based on, relating to, or arising out of this
Agreement or any other agreement, contract or instrument contemplated herein,
Seller's ownership, use, or operation of the Assets, or the condition,
quality, status, or nature of the Assets, INCLUDING RIGHTS TO CONTRIBUTION OR
COST RECOVERY UNDER THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND
LIABILITY ACT OF 1980, AS AMENDED, BREACHES OF STATUTORY AND IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, NUISANCE OR OTHER TORT ACTIONS, RIGHTS TO PUNITIVE DAMAGES, COMMON
LAW RIGHTS OF CONTRIBUTION, ANY RIGHTS UNDER INSURANCE POLICIES ISSUED OR
UNDERWRITTEN BY THE OTHER PARTY OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES (IN EACH CASE) EVEN
IF CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER ACTIVE, PASSIVE,
SIMPLE, SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF

 \t\t\t(e)Waiver of Non-Compensatory Damages. None of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover from
Seller, Buyer, or their respective Affiliates or other Representatives, any
special, indirect, consequential, punitive, exemplary, remote or speculative
damages, including damages for lost profits of any kind, arising under or in
connection with this Agreement, any other agreement, contract or instrument
contemplated herein or the transactions contemplated hereby, except to the
extent any such Party suffers such damages (including costs of defense and
reasonable attorney's fees incurred in connection with defending of such
damages) to a Third Party, which damages (including costs of defense and
reasonable attorney's fees incurred in connection with defending against such
damages) shall not be excluded by this provision as to recovery hereunder.
Subject to the preceding sentence, Buyer, on behalf of each of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties, and Seller, on behalf of each of Seller Indemnified
Parties, waive any right to recover any special, indirect, consequential,
punitive, exemplary, remote or speculative damages, including damages for lost
profits of any kind, arising in connection with or with respect to this
Agreement, any other agreement, contract or instrument contemplated herein or
the transactions contemplated hereby. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t13.3Claims Procedure. The defense, indemnification and hold harmless
obligations contained in Section 13.2 and the "special warranty" contained in
the Assignment shall be implemented as follows: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Claim Notice. The Party seeking defense and indemnification under
the terms of this Agreement ("Indemnified Party") shall submit a written
"Claim Notice" to the other Party ("Indemnifying Party") which, to be
effective, must be delivered prior to the end of the survival period
applicable under Section 13.4 to the particular Loss that is the subject of
such Claim Notice and must state, to the extent of the information reasonably
available to the Indemnified Party: (1) the amount of each payment or other
obligation claimed by an Indemnified Party to be owing or other Loss for which
the Indemnified Party is seeking defense, indemnification and to be held
harmless, (2) the basis for such Claim, with supporting documentation if
available, and (3) a list identifying, to the extent reasonably possible, each
separate item of Loss for which payment or any other obligation is so claimed.
Within thirty (30) days of receipt of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party
may provide written notice to the Indemnified Party that it accepts, contests
or rejects the Losses identified in such Claim Notice or its responsibility
for same. Any failure of the Indemnifying Party to provide such notice within
such time period shall be deemed to be a rejection by such Indemnifying Party
of such Losses and its responsibility for same. If the Indemnifying Party
objects to a Claim Notice on the basis that it lacks sufficient information,
it shall promptly request from the Indemnified Party any specific additional
information reasonably necessary for it to assess such indemnification Claim,
and the Indemnified Party shall provide the additional information reasonably
requested to the extent reasonably available to it. Upon receipt of such
additional information, the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified
Party of any withdrawal or modification of the objection. All disputed
defense, indemnification and hold harmless Claims shall be resolved by Buyer
and Seller in accordance with either (A) a mutual agreement between Buyer and
Seller, which shall be memorialized in writing, or (B) Section 14.8(b), which
may be invoked by either Party at any time when it reasonably believes that
the Parties are unable to reach mutual agreement as to any defense,
indemnification and hold harmless Claim arising under this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Information. Promptly after the Indemnified Party receives notice
of a Claim or legal action by a Third Party that may result in a Loss for
which defense, indemnification and the right to be held harmless may be sought
under this ARTICLE 13 (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall
give written notice of such Third Party Claim to the Indemnifying Party;
provided that the Indemnified Party shall not be liable for any failure to
notify except to the extent such failure actually prevents the Indemnifying
Party from being able to effectively defend the Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party or its counsel so requests, the Indemnified Party shall
furnish the Indemnifying Party with copies of all pleadings and other material
information reasonably available to the Indemnified Party with respect to such
Third Party Claim. Except as otherwise provided in Section 12.4(b), at the
election of the Indemnifying Party, made within thirty (30) days after receipt
of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall permit the Indemnifying Party to
assume sole management and control of such Third Party Claim (to the extent
only that such Third Party Claim relates to a Loss for which the Indemnifying
Party is liable), including the determination of all appropriate actions, the
negotiation of settlements on behalf of the Indemnified Party, and the conduct
of litigation through attorneys of the Indemnifying Party's choice; provided,
however, that no such settlement can result in any cost or other liability to
the Indemnified Party for which it is entitled to be defended, indemnified or
held harmless hereunder, without its consent. If the Indemnifying Party
elects to assume such control, (i) any and all expense incurred by the
Indemnified Party thereafter for investigation, defense or other handling of
the matter shall be borne by the Indemnified Party, except as to those
reasonable expenses incurred in responding to any request or instruction by
the Indemnifying Party and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall give all
reasonable information and assistance, other than pecuniary, that the
Indemnifying Party shall reasonably request as necessary for the proper
defense of such Third Party Claim. In the absence of such an election, the
Indemnified Party will reasonably endeavor to defend, at the Indemnifying
Party's expense, any Third Party Claim to which such Indemnifying Party's
defense, indemnification and hold harmless obligation under this ARTICLE 13
applies until the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, and, if the
Indemnifying Party fails to assume such defense within the time period
provided above, the Indemnified Party may settle or otherwise resolve the same
in the Indemnified Party's reasonable discretion at the Indemnifying Party's
expense and liability, subject to the Indemnifying Party's consent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided,
further, that if the Indemnifying Party fails to grant such consent, it shall
immediately assume such defense, indemnification and hold harmless obligation
from the Indemnified Party and reimburse the Indemnified Party for all
expenses and other obligations and liabilities incurred by it prior to such
point in time. If any such Third Party Claim requires immediate action, both
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party will cooperate in good faith
to take appropriate action so as not to jeopardize the defense of such Third
Party Claim or either Party's position with respect to such Third Party Claim.
If the Indemnifying Party is entitled to, and does, assume the defense of any
such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
separate counsel at its own expense and to participate in the defense thereof,
subject to the Indemnifying Party's sole management and control of the defense
of any such Third Party Claim in its sole good faith judgment; provided,
however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall pay
the reasonable attorneys' fees of the Indemnified Party if the Indemnified
Party's counsel shall have advised the Indemnified Party in writing that there
is a conflict of interest that could make it inappropriate under applicable
standards of professional conduct to have common counsel for the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party (provided that the Indemnifying Party shall
not be responsible for paying for

more than one separate firm of attorneys and one local counsel to represent
all of the Indemnified Parties subject to such Third Party Claim). In the
event that the Indemnifying Party has any Dispute regarding whether it is
obligated to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Party as to
any Third Party Claim or other Claim or any Dispute as to the scope of any
such defense, indemnity and hold harmless obligation as to a Third Party Claim
or other Claim, such Dispute shall be resolved in accordance with either (A) a
mutual agreement between Buyer and Seller, which shall be memorialized in
writing, or (B) Section 14.8(b), which may be invoked by either Party at any
time when it reasonably believes that the Parties are unable to reach mutual
agreement as to any defense, indemnification and hold harmless Claim arising
under this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t13.4Survival of Warranties, Representations and Covenants. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Subject to Section 13.4(c), (1) the representations and warranties
of the Parties in ARTICLE 5 and ARTICLE 6 (other than the Fundamental
Representations), the affirmations of such representations and warranties
contained in the certificates to be delivered at Closing pursuant to Section
9.2(c) and Section 9.3(c), as applicable) shall, in each case, survive the
Closing for a period of twelve (12) months, (2) the Fundamental
Representations (and the affirmations of such representations and warranties
contained in the certificate to be delivered at Closing pursuant to Section
9.2(c)) shall survive the Closing until thirty (30) days after the expiration
of the statute of limitations applicable thereto, (3) the covenants of Buyer
contained in Section 7.2(c) shall terminate at Closing, (4) the covenants of
Buyer contained in Section 13.1 shall survive without time limit, (5) the
covenants of the Parties contained in Section 13.2 shall survive as specified
in Section 13.4(c) and (6) the remainder of this Agreement, including the
other covenants and agreements of the Parties contained herein, shall survive
until the first anniversary of the Closing Date or such shorter time as
expressed in such covenant or agreement. It is the intent of the Parties to
shorten the application of statute of limitations as set forth in this Section
13.4(a). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Representations, warranties, covenants and agreements (and any
certificate related thereto) shall be of no further force and effect after the
date of their expiration; provided that there shall be no termination of any
bona fide Claim asserted through a Claim Notice delivered pursuant to Section
13.3 with respect to such a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
prior to its expiration date.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)The indemnities in (1) Section 13.2(a)(1), Section 13.2(a)(2),
Section 13.2(b)(2) and Section 13.2(b)(3) shall terminate as of the
termination date of each respective representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement that is subject to indemnification, except in each case as to
matters for which a Claim Notice has been delivered to the Indemnifying Party
on or before such termination date, (2) Section 13.2(a)(3) and Section
13.2(b)(4) shall survive the Closing until ninety (90) days after the
expiration of the statute of limitations applicable thereto, and (3) Section
13.2(b)(1) shall survive the Closing without time limit. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t13.5Reservation as to Non-Parties. Nothing herein is intended to
limit or otherwise waive any recourse Buyer or Seller may have against any
Third Party for any obligations or liabilities that may be incurred with
respect to the Assets. \t\t

Except for waivers specifically provided for in this Agreement, no waiver by
either Party of any breach of any provision of this Agreement shall be binding

Agreement shall be deemed, or shall constitute, a waiver of any other
provision hereof (regardless of whether similar), and no such waiver shall
constitute a continuing waiver unless expressly so provided. Delay in the
exercise, or non-exercise, of any such right is not a waiver of that
right. \t\t

neither Party shall assign all or any portion of its respective rights or
delegate all or any portion of its respective duties and obligations hereunder

assignment which does not comply with the foregoing provisions shall be deemed
null and void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller may assign any or all of
its rights or obligations hereunder to any of its Affiliate at any time,
subject to the provision of prior written notice thereof to Buyer and to the
undertaking by such Affiliate to assume all of Seller's rights, duties and
obligations hereunder. \t\t
