         Target Net Worth Amount      =                     (  X - (X1 + V)    )
                                          $18,931,978   -                  + V
                                                               -----------
                                                                    2
         Where:                    X  =   the Net Worth Amount (as defined
                                          below) as determined in accordance
                                          with the accounting policies,
                                          practices, procedures, policies and
                                          methods that were employed in the
                                          preparation of the Most Recent Balance
                                          Sheet (the "Seller Historical
                                          Accounting Policies") (such Net Worth
                                          Amount to be referred to herein as the
                                          "Seller Closing Net Worth Amount");

                                   X1 =   the Net Worth Amount as determined in
                                          accordance with the Seller Historical
                                          Accounting Policies, as adjusted by
                                          the accounting policies set forth on
                                          Schedule 1.4(b) attached hereto under
                                          the column heading "Policies For
                                          Determining Kellwood Closing Net Worth
                                          Amount" and, to the extent not
                                          inconsistent therewith, in accordance
                                          with GAAP (such Net Worth Amount to be
                                          referred to herein as "Kellwood
                                          Closing Net Worth Amount");

                                   V  =   the amount for vacation and sick pay
                                          earned by employees of the Business
                                          for the year ending December 31, 2003
                                          not yet paid ("Vacation Accrual").

             (b) Within 75 days after the Closing Date, the employees employed
by the Seller prior to the Closing who are responsible for the preparation of

<PAGE>

the Seller's financial statements shall prepare and deliver to the Buyer a
statement (the "Closing Statement") calculating the Seller Closing Net Worth
Amount, the Kellwood Closing Net Worth Amount and the Vacation Accrual. The
Buyer will enable such employees (who will then be employed by the Buyer) to
take directions from the Seller and permit such employees to spend such time as
may be necessary to prepare the Closing Statement. For purposes of this
Agreement, the "Net Worth Amount" shall mean the total assets of the Seller
(other than the Excluded Assets) as of 11:59 p.m. on the day prior to the
Closing Date less the total liabilities of the Seller (other than the Excluded
Liabilities) as of such time. In determining the Seller Closing Net Worth Amount
and the Kellwood Closing Net Worth Amount, all year-end adjustments historically
reflected on the Financial Statements (as defined in Section 2.5) shall be
included and the day prior to the Closing Date will be treated as the end of a
fiscal year.

             (c) The Buyer shall deliver to the Seller, within 60 days after
delivery by the Seller to the Buyer of the Closing Statement, either a notice
indicating that the Buyer accepts the Closing Statement or a statement
describing the Buyer's objections to the Closing Statement, which statement of
objections shall describe in detail the specific nature and amount of each
objection and shall state in detail all bases upon which the Buyer believes the
Closing Statement is not in conformity with the requirements set forth in this
Section 1.4. If the Buyer delivers to the Seller a notice accepting the Closing
Statement, or the Buyer does not deliver a written objection to the Closing
Statement within such 30-day period, then, effective as of either the date of
delivery of such notice of acceptance or as of the close of business on such
60th day, the Closing Statement shall be deemed to be accepted by the Buyer.

             (d) If the Buyer timely objects to the Closing Statement, such
objections shall be resolved as follows:

                 (i) The Buyer and the Seller shall first use reasonable efforts
to resolve such objections.

                 (ii) If the Buyer and the Seller are able to resolve such
objections within 30 days after delivery to the Seller of such statement of
objections, the Buyer and the Seller shall, within 45 days after delivery of
such statement of objections, jointly prepare and sign a statement setting forth
the Seller Closing Net Worth Amount, the Kellwood Closing Net Worth Amount and
the Vacation Accrual, which amounts shall reflect the resolution of objections
agreed to by the Buyer and the Seller.

                 (iii) If the Buyer and the Seller do not reach a resolution of
all objections set forth on the Buyer's statement of objections within 30 days
after delivery of such statement of objections, the Buyer and the Seller shall,
within 30 days after the expiration of such 30-day period, (A) jointly prepare
and sign a statement setting forth (1) those objections (if any) that the Buyer
and the Seller have resolved and the resolution of such objections and (2) those
objections that the Buyer and the Seller did not resolve (the "Unresolved
Objections") and (B) engage a mutually agreeable accounting firm, with Grant
Thornton LLP as the first choice (provided it is available and the Parties agree
that it has reasonable rates) (the "Neutral Accountant") to resolve the
Unresolved Objections.

<PAGE>

                 (iv) The Buyer and the Seller shall jointly submit to the
Neutral Accountant, within 10 days after the date of the engagement of the
Neutral Accountant (as evidenced by the date of the engagement agreement), a
copy of the Closing Statement, a copy of the statement of objections delivered
by the Buyer to the Seller, and the joint statement referred to in Section
1.4(d)(iii)(A) above. Each of the Buyer and the Seller shall submit to the
Neutral Accountant (with a copy delivered to the other Party on the same day),
within 30 days after the date of the engagement of the Neutral Accountant, a
memorandum (which may include supporting exhibits) setting forth their
respective positions on the Unresolved Objections. Each of the Buyer and the
Seller may (but shall not be required to) submit to the Neutral Accountant (with
a copy delivered to the other Party on the same day), within 60 days after the
date of the engagement of the Neutral Accountant, a memorandum responding to the
initial memorandum submitted to the Neutral Accountant by the other Party.
Unless requested by the Neutral Accountant in writing, neither the Buyer nor the
Seller may present any additional information or arguments to the Neutral
Accountant, either orally or in writing.

                 (v) The Buyer and the Seller shall instruct the Neutral
Accountant that (A) the scope of its review and authority shall be limited to
resolving the Unresolved Objections, and (B) issue a ruling which sets forth the
resolution of each Unresolved Objection (in which case its resolution of each
Unresolved Objection shall consist of the determination of an appropriate value
for each Closing Statement item that is the subject of an Unresolved Objection,
which value shall be equal to one of, or between, the values proposed by the
Seller in the Closing Statement and by the Buyer in its statement of objections)
and includes a statement setting forth the Seller Closing Net Worth Amount, the
Kellwood Closing Net Amount and the Vacation Accrual, reflecting the Neutral
Accountant's resolution of the Unresolved Objections. The "Final Closing
Statement" shall be the statement accepted (or deemed accepted) by the Buyer
pursuant to Section 1.4(c), prepared and signed pursuant to Section 1.4(d)(ii)
or delivered by the Neutral Accountant pursuant to this Section 1.4(d)(v), as
the case may be.

                 (vi) The resolution by the Neutral Accountant of the Unresolved
Objections shall be conclusive and binding upon the Buyer and the Seller. The
Buyer and the Seller agree that the procedure set forth in this Section 1.4(d)
for resolving disputes with respect to the Closing Statement shall be the sole
and exclusive method for resolving any such disputes; provided that this
provision shall not prohibit any Party from instituting litigation to enforce
the ruling of the Neutral Accountant.

                 (vii) The Buyer and the Seller shall share equally the fees and
expenses of the Neutral Accountant for its services under this Section 1.4(d).

             (e) If the Kellwood Closing Net Worth Amount as shown on the Final
Closing Statement is less than the Target Net Worth Amount, the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by such deficiency and the Seller shall pay to the Buyer, by
wire transfer or other delivery of immediately available funds, within three
Business Days after the date on which the Final Closing Statement is finally
determined pursuant to this Section 1.4, an amount equal to such deficiency
(plus interest thereon at the rate of 8% per annum, compounded monthly, from the
Closing Date). Should the Seller fail to make such payment, the Buyer shall have
the option to recover such amount from the Escrow Account. If the Kellwood
Closing Net Worth Amount as shown on the Final Closing Statement exceeds the
Target Net Worth Amount, the Purchase Price shall be increased by such excess

<PAGE>

amount and the Buyer shall pay to the Seller, by wire transfer or other delivery
of immediately available funds, within three Business Days after the date on
which the Final Closing Statement is finally determined pursuant to this Section
1.4, an amount equal to such excess (plus interest thereon at the rate of 8% per
annum, compounded monthly, from the Closing Date).

             (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i)
in determining the Kellwood Closing Net Worth Amount and the Seller Closing Net
Worth Amount, there shall be no reserves for any Excluded Liabilities, (ii) in
determining the Kellwood Closing Net Worth Amount and the Seller Closing Net
Worth Amount, to the extent any amounts are reserved (specifically or generally)
relating to any Damages for which the Buyer is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Article VI hereof, the Buyer shall only be entitled to
indemnification for those Damages in excess of such reserve amount (subject to
all other limitations set forth in Section 6.5), and (iii) the Buyer agrees to
pay any and all liabilities taken into account in determining the Kellwood
Closing Net Worth Amount and any and all liabilities for which a reserve (either
specifically or generally) has been taken into account in determining the
Kellwood Closing Net Worth Amount.

         1.5 Consents to Assignment. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign or
transfer any contract, lease, authorization, license or permit, or any claim,
right or benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom, if an attempted
assignment or transfer thereof, without the consent of a third party thereto or
of the issuing Governmental Entity, as the case may be, would constitute a
breach thereof. If such consent (a "Deferred Consent") is not obtained, or if an
attempted assignment or transfer thereof would be ineffective or would affect
the rights thereunder so that the Buyer would not receive all such rights, then,
in each such case, (a) the contract, lease, authorization, license or permit to
which such Deferred Consent relates (a "Deferred Item") shall be withheld from
sale pursuant to this Agreement without any reduction in the Purchase Price, (b)
from and after the Closing, the Seller and the Buyer will cooperate, in all
reasonable respects, to obtain such Deferred Consent as soon as practicable
after the Closing, provided that the Seller shall not be required to make any
payments or agree to any material undertakings in connection therewith, and (c)
until such Deferred Consent is obtained, the Seller and the Buyer will
cooperate, in all reasonable respects, to provide to the Buyer the benefits
under the Deferred Item to which such Deferred Consent relates (with the Buyer
entitled to all the gains and responsible for all the losses, Taxes, liabilities
and/or obligations thereunder). In particular, in the event that any such
Deferred Consent is not obtained prior to the Closing, then the Buyer and the
Seller shall enter into such arrangements (including subleasing or
subcontracting if permitted) to provide to the Parties the economic and
operational equivalent of obtaining such Deferred Consent and assigning or
transferring such contract, lease, authorization, license or permit, including
enforcement for the benefit of the Buyer of all claims or rights arising
thereunder, and the performance by the Buyer of the obligations thereunder on a
prompt and punctual basis.

         1.6 Further Assurances. At any time and from time to time after the
Closing Date, as and when requested by any Party hereto and at such Party's
expense, the other Party or Parties shall promptly execute and deliver, or cause
to be executed and delivered, all such documents, instruments and certificates
and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other actions as are
necessary to evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

         1.7 Allocation of Purchase Price.

             (a) The Adjusted Purchase Price will be allocated among the
Acquired Assets and the covenant not to compete contained in Article IX for Tax
purposes in accordance with the guidelines specified in Schedule 1.7 which the
Buyer and the Seller acknowledge are in compliance with Section 1060 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "Code") and any comparable provisions
of state, local or other Tax law and in accordance with GAAP (to the extent, if
any, that GAAP is applicable to allocations under Section 1060 of the Code). As
soon as practicable after the Closing Date, the Seller shall prepare and deliver
to the Buyer a final allocation schedule (the "Allocation Schedule"), prepared
in accordance with Schedule 1.7, allocating the Adjusted Purchase Price. The
Buyer and the Seller acknowledge that the Allocation Schedule will reflect the
fair market value of the Acquired Assets and the covenant not to compete
contained in Article IX as of the Closing Date.

             (b) The Parties agree to act in accordance with the allocations
contained in the Allocation Schedule in any Tax Returns or filings (including
any forms or reports required to be filed pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code
or any provisions of local, state, foreign or other Tax law ("1060 Forms")) or
during the course of any Tax audit or litigation proceedings, and to cooperate
in the preparation of any 1060 Forms and to file such 1060 Forms in the manner
required by applicable law.

         1.8 Contingent Purchase Price. The Contingent Purchase Price Amount
shall be determined in accordance with the provisions set forth in Exhibit B
attached hereto, which provisions are incorporated by reference into this
Agreement in their entirety. References to any covenants or agreements in this
Agreement shall include any covenants or agreements set forth in Exhibit B. The
Buyer and the Seller each agree to their respective obligations set forth in
Exhibit B. The Buyer and the Seller agree that, to the maximum extent permitted
by law, the Contingent Purchase Price Amount and any payments to the Seller from
the Escrow Account, including any interest or other income earned on the Escrow
Account, shall be treated for all Tax purposes as contingent payments reportable
under the installment sale method, subject to an interest component determined
under applicable provisions of the Code, and will be allocable solely to Class
VII assets in accordance with Schedule 1.7.

                                   ARTICLE II
                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLER

         The Seller represents and warrants to the Buyer that the statements
contained in this Article II are true and correct as of the date hereof, except
as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule provided by the Seller to the Buyer on
the date hereof (the "Disclosure Schedule"). The Disclosure Schedule shall be
arranged in sections and subsections corresponding to the numbered and lettered
sections and subsections contained in this Article II. The disclosures in any
section or subsection of the Disclosure Schedule shall qualify other sections
and subsections in this Article II to the extent it is clear from a reading of
the disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other sections and
subsections. The inclusion of any information in the Disclosure Schedule (or any
update thereto) shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment, in and
of itself, that such information is required by the terms hereof to be

<PAGE>

disclosed, is material to the Seller, has resulted in or would result in a
Seller Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 2.1), or is outside the
ordinary course of business. For purposes of this Agreement, the phrase "to the

is not material to the Seller. The Seller has all requisite corporate power and
authority to carry on the business in which it is now engaged and to own and use
the properties now owned and used by it. For purposes of this Agreement, "Seller

the Seller competes), or (ii) materially impairs the ability of the Seller to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however,
that a "Seller Material Adverse Effect" shall not include any adverse change,
effect or circumstance (I) arising out of or resulting primarily from actions
contemplated by the Parties in connection with this Agreement, or (II) that is
attributable to the announcement or performance of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

             (b) The Seller has made available to the Buyer correct and complete
copies of its corporate charter and bylaws (each as amended to date). The minute

directors) and the stock record books of the Seller are correct and complete in
all material respects. The Seller is not in default under or in violation of any
provision of its corporate charter or bylaws.

         2.2 Capitalization.

acquisition of any shares of capital stock of the Seller. There are no
outstanding or authorized stock appreciation, phantom stock or similar rights
with respect to the Seller. There are no agreements, voting trusts or proxies
with respect to the voting, or registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act"), of the Seller.

             (c) The sole shareholder of the Seller is indirectly beneficially
owned by three individuals (one-third each) listed in Section 2.2(c) of the

         2.3 Authority. The Seller has all requisite corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to
which it will be a party and to perform its obligations hereunder and

similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally and by
equitable principles, including those limiting the availability of specific
performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies and those providing
for equitable defenses.

         2.4 Noncontravention. Subject to compliance with the applicable
requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended (the "Hart-Scott-Rodino Act"), and applicable foreign antitrust or trade
regulation laws, neither the execution and delivery by the Seller of this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements to which the Seller will be a party, nor
the consummation by the Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby or

             (a) conflict with or violate any provision of the charter or bylaws
of the Seller;

             (b) require on the part of the Seller any filing with, or any

contract or by operation of law), other than (i) mechanic's, materialmen's,
landlord's and similar liens, (ii) liens arising under worker's compensation,

part of a consolidated, combined or unitary group) and all such Tax Returns were
correct and complete in all material respects. The Seller has paid (or had paid
on its behalf) all Taxes (as defined below) that are shown to be due and payable
on any such Tax Returns. The unpaid Taxes (other than any Taxes that constitute
Excluded Liabilities) of the Seller for Tax periods through the Closing Date

Governmental Entity is currently in progress. Neither the Seller (nor the
members of any consolidated, combined or unitary group with which the Seller has
filed group Tax Returns) has been notified in writing by any jurisdiction that
the jurisdiction believes that the Seller was required to file any Tax Return
(or the consolidated, combined or unity group with respect to which the Seller
filed Tax Returns for any period was required to file any Tax Return for such
period) that was not filed.

             (c) None of the Acquired Assets is subject to any lien for Taxes

             (b) neither the Seller nor, to the knowledge of the Seller, any

50,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Kellwood
Common Stock"), and 500,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.01 per share
(the "Preferred Stock"). As of January 21, 2003, there were (i) 25,575,144

(iii) 6,666,697 shares of Kellwood Common Stock are held in treasury. As of the
date hereof, no shares of Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding. The
Guarantor owns directly all of the authorized and outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Buyer and there are no options, warrants, convertible securities,
subscriptions, stock appreciation rights, phantom stock plans or stock
equivalents or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments (contingent
or otherwise) of any character issued or authorized by the Buyer relating to the
issued or unissued capital stock of the Buyer.

             (b) The shares of Kellwood Common Stock to be issued to the Seller
pursuant to Section 1.2 (the "Consideration Shares") will, when issued in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, be validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable and will have been issued in compliance with all applicable
securities laws and regulations and applicable contracts.

             (c) When issued in accordance with this Agreement, (i) all of the
Consideration Shares shall be free from any restriction on transfer other than
restrictions arising under the Securities Act and any similar state securities
laws, (ii) none of the certificates representing ownership of the Consideration
Shares shall bear any restrictive legends, and (iii) neither the Guarantor nor
the Buyer shall issue instructions to the transfer agent for the Kellwood Common
Stock contrary to the foregoing, subject, in the case of the preceding clauses
(ii) and (iii), to any legends required pursuant to Rule 145 under the
Securities Act.

         3.4 Noncontravention. Subject to compliance with the applicable
requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and applicable foreign antitrust or
trade regulation laws, neither the execution and delivery by the Buyer of this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements to which the Buyer will be a party, nor

<PAGE>

the consummation by the Buyer of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, will:

             (a) conflict with or violate any provision of the charter or bylaws
of the Buyer;

             (b) require on the part of the Buyer or the Guarantor any filing
with, or permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Entity,
except for any filing, permit, authorization, consent or approval which if not
obtained or made would not reasonably be expected to result in a Buyer Material
Adverse Effect (as defined below);

             (c) conflict with, result in a breach of, constitute (with or
without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default under, result in the
acceleration of obligations under, create in any party any right to terminate or
modify, or require any notice, consent or waiver under, any contract or
agreement to which the Buyer is a party or by which the Buyer is bound, except
for (i) any conflict, breach, default, acceleration or right to terminate or
modify that would not reasonably be expected to result in a Buyer Material
Adverse Effect, (ii) any notice, consent or waiver the absence of which would
not reasonably be expected to result in a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, or
(iii) the Buyer's Credit Facility, which approval thereunder has been obtained
and delivered to the Seller; or

             (d) violate any order, writ, injunction or decree specifically
naming, or statute, rule or regulation applicable to, the Buyer or any of its
properties or assets, except for any violation that would not reasonably be
expected to result in a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

For purposes of this Agreement, "Buyer Material Adverse Effect" means any
change, effect or circumstance that (i) is materially adverse to the financial
condition or results of operations of the Guarantor as a whole (other than
changes, effects or circumstances that are the result of economic factors
affecting the economy as a whole or that are the result of factors generally
affecting the industry or specific markets in which the Guarantor competes) or
(ii) materially impairs the ability of the Buyer or the Guarantor to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that a
"Buyer Material Adverse Effect" shall not include any adverse change, effect or
circumstance (I) arising out of or resulting primarily from actions contemplated
by the Parties in connection with this Agreement, or (II) that is attributable
to the announcement or performance of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

         3.5 Compliance. Except as set forth in the SEC Reports (as defined in
Section 3.6), each of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries (i) is in compliance
with all laws applicable to the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries or by which
any property or asset of the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries is bound or
affected, and (ii) is not in default or violation of any notes, bonds,
mortgages, indentures, contracts, agreements, leases, licenses, permits,
franchises, or other instruments or obligations to which the Guarantor or any of
its subsidiaries is a party or by which the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries
or any property or asset of the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries is bound or
affected, except for any such noncompliance, conflicts, defaults or violations
pursuant to (i) or (ii) above that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

         3.6 SEC Reports and Financial Statements.

             (a) The Guarantor has filed all forms, reports and documents
required to be filed by it with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC") since January 30, 2002 (collectively, together with all financial
statements included or incorporated by reference therein, the "SEC Reports").
All SEC Reports (other than the "Statements Under Oath of Principal Executive
Officer and Principal Financial Officer Regarding Facts and Circumstances
Relating to Exchange Act Filings" filed with the SEC on August 29, 2002) have
been filed electronically via the SEC's EDGAR filing system. The SEC Reports (i)
were prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act"), as the case may be, and the rules and regulations thereunder
and (ii) did not at the time they were filed contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of the
Guarantor's subsidiaries is required to file any form, report or other document
with the SEC.

             (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in
each case, any notes thereto) contained in the SEC Reports complies as to form
in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto and was prepared
in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of
unaudited statements, as permitted by Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X promulgated
by the SEC) and each fairly presented in all material respects (subject to, in
the case of the unaudited statements, to normal, recurring audit adjustments,
none of which are material) the consolidated financial position, results of
operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows of the Guarantor and its
subsidiaries at the respective dates thereof and for the respective periods
indicated therein.

             (c) At the date of the most recent audited financial statements of
the Guarantor included in the SEC Reports, neither the Guarantor nor any of its
subsidiaries had, and since such date neither the Guarantor nor any of its
subsidiaries has incurred, any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent, determinable or otherwise) which, individually or
in the aggregate, would be required to be disclosed in a balance sheet (or the
footnotes thereto) of the Guarantor prepared in accordance with GAAP except
liabilities expressly incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and liabilities that have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Buyer Material Adverse
Effect. Except as set forth in the SEC Reports, since January 30, 2002, there
has not been any material change in accounting methods, principles or practices
(or any disagreement with the Company's independent public accountants with
respect to such methods, principles or practices) employed by the Guarantor
(except insofar as such change may be required by a change in GAAP).

             (d) The Guarantor's registration statement on Form S-4 filed with
the SEC on October 3, 2002 (Commission File No. 333-100297) (the "Form S-4") has
been declared effective by the SEC and no stop order suspending the
effectiveness of the Form S-4 has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose
has been initiated or threatened in writing by the SEC or its staff.

<PAGE>

             (e) Since January 1, 2003, the Guarantor has not announced publicly
or declared any dividends payable with respect to the Kellwood Common Stock or
set any record dates with respect to any such dividends.

             (f) Neither the Buyer nor any affiliates of the Buyer has provided
to the Seller or any affiliates of the Seller any material, non-public
information relating to the Buyer and/or any of its affiliates.

         3.7 Information Supplied. None of the information supplied by or on
behalf of the Guarantor or the Buyer specifically for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Form S-4 or the prospectus included in the Form S-4 (the
"Base Prospectus") contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

         3.8 Litigation. Except in each case as disclosed in the SEC Reports,
there are no investigations, actions, suits, claims or legal, administrative or
arbitratorial proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Buyer, threatened
against the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries and there are no judgments,
orders, injunctions, decrees, stipulations or awards (whether entered by a
court, administrative agency, or by arbitration), against or relating to the
Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries, which, if adversely determined, would
reasonably be expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

         3.9 Financing. The Buyer has, and at the Closing will have, sufficient
sources of financing in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
Agreement and to fulfill its obligations hereunder, including without limitation
payment to the Seller of the Purchase Price at the Closing.

         3.10 Solvency. Immediately after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the closing of any financing to be obtained
by the Guarantor or the Buyer or any of their Affiliates in order to effect the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Guarantor and the Buyer
shall be able to pay its debts as they become due and shall own property having
a fair saleable value greater than the amounts required to pay its debts
(including a reasonable estimate of the amount of all contingent liabilities).
Immediately after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the closing of any financing to be obtained by the Guarantor or
the Buyer or any of their Affiliates in order to effect the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Guarantor and the Buyer shall have
adequate capital to carry on its business. No transfer of property is being made
and no obligation is being incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the closing of any financing to be obtained
by the Guarantor or the Buyer or any of their Affiliates in order to effect the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or
defraud either present or future creditors of the Buyer.

         3.11 Measurement Period. At all times from the period covering five (5)
trading days prior to the first day of the Measurement Period through the
Closing Date, all of the representations and warranties of the Buyer set forth
in Sections 3.3 through 3.10 hereof shall be true and correct without taking
into account any SEC Reports filed during the Measurement Period, the 5-day

<PAGE>

period preceding the Measurement Period and the period after the Measurement
Period through the Closing Date.

         3.12 Due Diligence by the Buyer. The Buyer acknowledges that it has
conducted to its satisfaction an independent investigation of the financial
condition, results of operations, assets, liabilities, properties and projected
operations of the Seller and, in making its determination to proceed with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Buyer has relied solely on the
results of its own independent investigation and the representations and
warranties of the Seller set forth in Article II, including the Disclosure
Schedule and other Schedules hereto (and any updates thereto). Such
representations and warranties by the Seller constitute the sole and exclusive
representations and warranties of the Seller to the Buyer in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, and the Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the
Seller is not making any representation or warranty whatsoever, express or
implied, beyond those expressly given in this Agreement, including any implied
warranty as to condition, merchantability, or suitability as to any of the
Acquired Assets and it is understood that the Buyer takes the Acquired Assets as
is and where is (subject to the benefit of the representations warranties set
forth in this Agreement). The Buyer further acknowledges and agrees that, except
as expressly set forth in Article II hereof, any cost estimates, projections or
other predictions that may have been provided to the Buyer or any of its
employees, agents or representatives are not representations or warranties of
the Seller or any of its Affiliates. The Buyer has no knowledge that any of the
representations and warranties of the Seller in this Agreement is not true and
correct, and the Buyer has no knowledge of any errors in, or omissions from, the
Disclosure Schedule or other Schedules.

The permitted dividends and distributions in the prior two sentences may not

adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of
the Seller or the ability of the Seller to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

             (h) the Buyer shall have obtained (or caused to be obtained) all of

                                   ARTICLE VI
                                 INDEMNIFICATION

         6.1 Indemnification by the Seller. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Article VI, from and after the Closing, the Seller shall indemnify the
Buyer in respect of, and hold the Buyer harmless against, any and all
liabilities, monetary damages, fines, fees, penalties, costs and expenses
(including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses)
(collectively, "Damages") incurred or suffered by the Buyer or any Affiliate
thereof resulting from or constituting:

             (a) any breach of a representation or warranty of the Seller
contained in this Agreement;

             (b) any failure by the Seller to perform any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement; or

             (c) any Excluded Liabilities;

provided that, to the extent a breach of a representation or warranty resulting
in Damages involves a payment of money by an Indemnified Person to an unrelated
third party, such amount shall bear interest at a rate of 8% per annum
commencing as of the date of such payment.

         6.2 Indemnification by the Buyer. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Article VI, from and after the Closing, the Buyer shall indemnify the
Seller in respect of, and hold the Seller harmless against, any and all Damages
incurred or suffered by the Seller or any Affiliate thereof resulting from or
constituting:

<PAGE>

             (a) any breach of a representation or warranty of the Buyer
contained in this Agreement;

             (b) any failure by the Buyer to perform any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement;

             (c) any breach of any obligations of the Buyer under the New
Leases; or

             (d) any Assumed Liabilities.

         6.3 Claims for Indemnification.

             (a) Third-Party Claims. All claims for indemnification made under
this Agreement resulting from, related to or arising out of a third-party claim
against an Indemnified Party (as defined below) shall be made in accordance with
the following procedures. A person entitled to indemnification under this
Article VI (an "Indemnified Party") shall give prompt written notification to
the person from whom indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of the
commencement of any action, suit or proceeding relating to a third-party claim
for which indemnification may be sought or, if earlier, upon the written
assertion of any such claim by a third party. Such notification shall include a
description in reasonable detail (to the extent known by the Indemnified Party)
of the facts constituting the basis for such third-party claim and the amount of
the Damages claimed. Within 30 days after delivery of such notification, the
Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party,
assume control of the defense of such action, suit, proceeding or claim with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying
Party does not assume control of such defense, the Indemnified Party shall
control such defense. The Party not controlling such defense may participate
therein at its own expense; provided that if the Indemnifying Party assumes
control of such defense and the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes, based on
advice from counsel, that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have
conflicting interests with respect to such action, suit, proceeding or claim,
the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party solely in
connection therewith shall be considered "Damages" for purposes of this
Agreement; provided, however, that in no event shall the Indemnifying Party be
responsible for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all
Indemnified Parties. The Party controlling such defense shall keep the other
Party advised of the status of such action, suit, proceeding or claim and the
defense thereof and shall consider recommendations made by the other Party with
respect thereto. The Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of such
action, suit, proceeding or claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The
Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement of such action, suit,
proceeding or claim that does not include a complete release of the Indemnified
Party from all liability with respect thereto or that imposes any liability or
obligation on the Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party.

             (b) Procedure for Other Claims. An Indemnified Party wishing to
assert a claim for indemnification under this Article VI which is not subject to
Section 6.3(a) shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party a written notice (a
"Claim Notice") which contains (i) a description and the amount (the "Claimed
Amount") of any Damages incurred by the Indemnified Party, (ii) a statement that
the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this Article VI and a

<PAGE>

reasonable explanation of the basis therefor, and (iii) a demand for payment in
the amount of such Damages. Within 30 days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the
Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a written response in
which the Indemnifying Party shall: (I) agree that the Indemnified Party is
entitled to receive all of the Claimed Amount (in which case such response shall
be accompanied by a payment by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party
of the Claimed Amount, by check or by wire transfer), (II) agree that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to receive part, but not all, of the Claimed
Amount (the "Agreed Amount") (in which case such response shall be accompanied
by a payment by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of the Agreed
Amount, by check or by wire transfer), or (III) contest that the Indemnified
Party is entitled to receive any of the Claimed Amount. If the Indemnifying
Party in such response contests the payment of all or part of the Claimed
Amount, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall use good faith
efforts to resolve such dispute. If such dispute is not resolved within 60 days
following the delivery by the Indemnifying Party of such response, the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall each have the right to submit
such dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the
provisions of Section 10.12.

         6.4 Survival.

             (a) The representations and warranties of the Seller and the Buyer
set forth in this Agreement, the Seller Certificate and the Buyer Certificate
shall survive the Closing and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and continue until the date which is eighteen (18) months after the
Closing Date, at which time they shall expire; provided, however, the
representations and warranties of the Seller contained in Sections 2.1, 2.2 and
2.3 and of the Buyer contained in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 shall survive the Closing
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby indefinitely;
provided further, however, the representations and warranties of the Seller
contained in Sections 2.8 and 2.18 shall survive the Closing and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and continue until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.

             (b) If an indemnification claim is properly asserted in writing
pursuant to Section 6.3 prior to the expiration as provided in Section 6.4(a) of
the representation or warranty that is the basis for such claim, then such
representation or warranty shall survive until, but only for the purpose of, the
resolution of such claim.

         6.5 Limitations.

             (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the following limitations shall apply to indemnification claims under
this Agreement:

                 (i) the Seller shall be liable with respect to claims under
Section 6.1(a) for only that portion of the aggregate Damages related to such
claims, considered together, which exceeds $1,000,000;

                 (ii) the aggregate liability of the Seller for all Damages
under this Article VI shall not exceed an amount equal to $28,000,000; and


<PAGE>

                 (iii) the Buyer shall not be entitled to make any claim for
indemnification with respect to any matter to the extent the Purchase Price has
been adjusted to reflect such matter pursuant to Section 1.4, and the amount of
any Damages for which a Party is entitled to indemnification as provided under
this Article VI, shall be calculated net of any accruals, reserves or provisions
therefor reflected in the determination of the Kellwood Closing Net Worth Amount
shown in the Final Closing Statement.

             (b) In no event shall any Indemnifying Party be responsible or
liable for any Damages or other amounts under this Article VI that are
consequential, in the nature of lost profits, diminution in the value of
property, special or punitive or otherwise not actual damages. Each Party shall
(and shall cause its Affiliates to) use reasonable commercial efforts to pursue
all legal rights and remedies available in order to minimize the Damages for
which indemnification is provided to it under this Article VI.

             (c) The amount of Damages recoverable by an Indemnified Party under
this Article VI with respect to an indemnity claim shall be reduced by (i) the
amount of any payment received by such Indemnified Party (or an Affiliate
thereof), with respect to the Damages to which such indemnity claim relates,
from an insurance carrier, and (ii) the amount of any Tax benefit realized or
realizable by such Indemnified Party (or an Affiliate thereof) which is
attributable to the Damages to which such indemnity claim relates. For purposes
of this Section 6.5(c), the Tax benefit realized by any Indemnified Party (or an
Affiliate thereof) shall be determined as of the date of the receipt of payment
from the Indemnifying Party by calculating the present value of all expected
reductions in Tax payments attributable to any expected deductions or decreases
in income associated with the Damages to which such indemnity claim relates,
assuming that the Indemnified Party is always subject to a total combined Tax
rate of 45% and using a discount rate of 8% (compounded monthly). An Indemnified
Party shall use reasonable commercial efforts to pursue, and to cause its
Affiliates to pursue, all insurance claims and Tax benefits to which it may be
entitled in connection with any Damages it incurs, and the Parties shall
cooperate with each other in pursuing insurance claims with respect to any
Damages or any indemnification obligations with respect to Damages. If an
Indemnified Party (or an Affiliate) receives any insurance payment in connection
with any claim for Damages for which it has already received an indemnification
payment from the Indemnifying Party, it shall pay to the Indemnifying Party,
within 30 days of receiving such insurance payment, an amount equal to the
excess of (A) the amount previously received by the Indemnified Party under this
Article VI with respect to such claim plus the amount of the insurance payments
received, over (B) the amount of Damages with respect to such claim which the
Indemnified Party has become entitled to receive under this Article VI.

             (d) To the extent any representation or warranty of the Seller in
Article II is, to the knowledge of the Buyer on or prior to the Closing Date,
untrue or incorrect, the Buyer shall have no rights to indemnification under
this Article VI by reason of such untruth or inaccuracy.

             (e) Except with respect to claims for equitable relief, including
specific performance, made with respect to breaches of any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement, the rights of the Indemnified Parties under this
Article VI shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Indemnified Parties
and their respective Affiliates with respect to claims covered by Section 6.1 or

<PAGE>

Section 6.2 or otherwise relating to the transactions that are the subject of
this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in no event
shall any Party, its successors or permitted assigns be entitled to claim or
seek rescission of the transactions consummated by this Agreement.

             (f) The Buyer shall be entitled to recover any Damages due it
hereunder (x) by recovering from the Escrow Account and/or (y) by setting off
any such amount that is (i) agreed to by the Seller or (ii) set forth in a
final, non-appealable judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction,
against any amount otherwise due from the Buyer to the Seller under this
Agreement, including the Contingent Purchase Price Amount. The Buyer agrees not
to set off any amounts other than as provided in this Section 6.5(f).

         6.6 Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification payments
made under this Agreement shall be treated by the Parties as an adjustment to
the Adjusted Purchase Price to the maximum extent allowable under applicable
law.

                                   ARTICLE VII
                                   TERMINATION

         7.1 Termination of Agreement. The Parties may terminate this Agreement
prior to the Closing as provided below:

             (a) the Parties may terminate this Agreement by mutual written
consent;

             (b) the Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice
to the Seller in the event the Seller is in material breach, and such breach,
individually or in combination with any other such breach, (i) would cause the
conditions set forth in Section 5.1(a) or Section 5.1(b) not to be satisfied and
(ii) is not cured within 30 days following delivery by the Buyer to the Seller
of written notice of such breach;

             (c) the Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice
to the Seller in the event the Seller provides an update to the Disclosure
Schedule or other Schedule hereto pursuant to Section 4.5 which contains
information that, absent such disclosure and the provisions of Section 4.5
permitting the update of representations and warranties, would have the effect
of causing the condition set forth in Section 5.1(a) not to be satisfied, and
the Seller fails to cure the event or condition causing the failure of such
condition within 30 days following delivery by the Buyer to the Seller of
written notice under this Section 7.1(c);

             (d) the Seller may terminate this Agreement by giving written
notice to the Buyer in the event the Buyer is in breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, and such breach,
individually or in combination with any other such breach, (i) would cause the
conditions set forth in Section 5.2(a) or Section 5.2(b) not to be satisfied and
(ii) is not cured within 30 days following delivery by the Seller to the Buyer
of written notice of such breach;

             (e) the Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice
to the Seller if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before February 5,
2003 by reason of the failure of any condition precedent under Section 5.1
(unless the failure results exclusively or primarily from a breach by the Buyer

<PAGE>

of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement); and

             (f) the Seller may terminate this Agreement by giving written
notice to the Buyer if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before February
5, 2003 by reason of the failure of any condition precedent under Section 5.2
(unless the failure results exclusively or primarily from a breach by the Seller
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement).

         7.2 Effect of Termination. If any Party terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1, all obligations of the Parties hereunder shall
terminate without any liability of any Party to the other Party. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any Party for any
breach by such Party, prior to the termination of this Agreement, of any
covenant or agreement (but not any representation or warranty) contained in this
Agreement or impair the right of any Party to obtain such remedies as may be
available to it in law or equity with respect to such a breach by any other
Party.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                                EMPLOYEE MATTERS

         8.1 Offer of Employment; Continuation of Employment. The Parties hereto
intend that there shall be continuity of employment with respect to all
employees of the Seller (other than those employees specifically identified in
writing by the Seller (the "Employees"). The Buyer shall offer employment
commencing on the Closing Date to all Employees, including those on vacation,
military leave, leave of absence (whether paid or unpaid), disability or layoff,
on substantially similar terms to those in effect for such Employee immediately
prior to Closing.

         8.2 Cessation of Business Benefit Plan Participation; 401(k) Plan
Matters. Except as otherwise provided in this Article VIII or as otherwise
required by applicable law, the Employees shall cease to participate in or
accrue further benefits under the Seller Benefit Plans immediately prior to the
Closing. Effective as of the Closing, all Employees who participate in the
defined contribution plan qualified under Section 401 of the Code sponsored by
the Seller (the "Seller's 401(k) Plan") shall cease to participate in said plan.
The Buyer shall establish, if it does not already maintain, a defined
contribution plan qualified under Section 401 of the Code which shall accept
direct or indirect rollovers by Employees of their vested interest in the
Seller's 401(k) Plan.

         8.3 Employment Related Liabilities. The Buyer shall assume liability
for and shall pay directly to the appropriate Employee (or reimburse the Seller
for amounts that it pays to any such Employee) any amounts to which any Employee
becomes entitled under any Seller Benefit Plan or individual arrangement
disclosed to the Buyer, applicable law or otherwise that exists or arises (or
may be deemed to exist or arise) as a result of, or in connection with (i) the
sale of the Seller hereunder, (ii) the Buyer's failure to offer employment or to
employ Employees in accordance with Section 8.1 or applicable local law, (iii)
the employment of any Employee on or after the Closing Date, (iv) any change or
proposed change to the remuneration, benefits, terms and conditions of

Closing Date, the Buyer shall provide each Employee who accepts the Buyer's
offer of employment and who commences working with the Buyer on the Closing Date
(other than the employees who sign an Employment Agreement) (collectively, the
"New Buyer Employees") with total cash compensation (including base salary and
bonus opportunity) that is substantially similar to such New Buyer Employee's
total cash compensation immediately prior to the Closing Date. Beginning on the
Closing Date, the Buyer shall also maintain (or cause its Affiliates to
maintain) employee benefit plans, agreements, programs, policies and
arrangements for the benefit of each New Buyer Employee that are substantially
similar to the Employee Benefit Plans in effect immediately prior to the Closing
Date with respect to employees of the Buyer (the "Buyer Plans"). The Buyer will
give credit for past service with the Seller under all the Buyer Plans
including, without limitation, severance pay plans, to all New Buyer Employees,
to the same extent such service was credited under similar plans of the Seller
in which the New Buyer Employees participated prior to the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, beginning on the
Closing Date, the Buyer shall maintain (or cause its Affiliates to maintain) a
severance pay plan, program or practice for the benefit of each New Buyer
Employee that is substantially similar to the plan, program or practice in
effect immediately prior to the Closing Date with respect to such New Buyer
Employee.

         8.5 Welfare Plans. With respect to any Buyer Plan that is an "employee
welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) or any plan directly
or indirectly maintained or contributed to by the Buyer providing similar
benefits to an "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of
ERISA), the Buyer shall (a) cause to be waived any pre-existing condition
limitations or actively-at-work requirements and (b) give effect, in determining
any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and
amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, such New Buyer Employees with
respect to similar plans maintained by the Seller for such New Buyer Employees
immediately prior to the Closing Date. The Buyer shall make appropriate
arrangements to allow the use by New Buyer Employees of any amounts available
under any cafeteria plan or flexible spending account (as defined in Section 125
of the Code) which was maintained by the Seller for such New Buyer Employees.

         8.6 Accrued Personal, Sick or Vacation Time. With respect to any
accrued but unused personal, sick or vacation time to which any New Buyer
Employee is entitled pursuant to the personal, sick or vacation policies
applicable to such New Buyer Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date (the

determination of the Kellwood Closing Net Worth Amount the liability for such
accrued personal, sick or vacation time and allow such New Buyer Employee to use
such accrued personal, sick or vacation time; provided, however, that if the
Buyer deems it necessary to disallow any such New Buyer Employee from taking
such accrued personal, sick or vacation time, the Buyer shall be liable for and
pay in cash to each such New Buyer Employee an amount equal to such personal,
sick or vacation time in accordance with the terms of the PSV Policies; and
provided, further, that the Buyer shall be liable for and pay in cash an amount
equal to such accrued personal, sick or vacation time to any New Buyer Employee
whose employment terminates for any reason subsequent to the Closing Date.

         8.7 U.S. WARN Act. The Buyer agrees to provide any required notice
under the WARN Act and any other similar applicable law and to otherwise comply

or after the Closing Date or arising as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Buyer shall assume sole responsibility for any
liabilities or obligations arising under the WARN Act or other applicable law
resulting from the actions (or inactions) of the Buyer or its Affiliates on or
after the Closing Date or from the transactions contemplated hereby.

         8.8 U.S. COBRA. The Buyer agrees to provide any required notice under
the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 ("COBRA") and any
other similar applicable law on or after the Closing Date. The Buyer shall

COBRA or other similar applicable law resulting from the actions (or inactions)
of the Buyer or its Affiliates on or after the Closing Date or from the
transactions contemplated hereby.

         8.9 Payroll Withholding Matters. The Buyer and the Seller agree to
utilize the Alternate Procedure described in Section 5 of IRS Revenue Procedure
96-60 with respect to each Employee who accepts the Buyer's offer of employment
and who commences working with the Buyer on the Closing Date. Pursuant to such
agreement, the Buyer will assume responsibility for filing and providing to such
Employees Forms W-2 and other required Tax forms for the calendar year in which
the Closing Date occurs. The Seller shall provide information and data to the
Buyer with respect to wages and payroll taxes for the period of such calendar
year ending on the Closing Date, and the Buyer shall report such information and
data, as provided, on the Forms W-2 and other required Tax forms for the

unreasonably interfere with the conduct of business (i) reasonable access and
duplicating rights to all non-privileged records, books, contracts, instruments,
documents, correspondence, computer data and other data and information
(collectively, "Information") within the possession or control of such Party
relating to the Business and (ii) reasonable access to the personnel of such
Party. Requests may be made under this Section 9.1(a) for financial reporting

analyzing the Closing Statement, resolving any differences between the Parties
with respect to the Closing Statement, preparing and filing of any Tax Returns,
prosecuting any claims for refund, defending any Tax claim or assessment,

full access to the Business, its financial management and any accountant's work
papers, and all financial books, accounts and records relating to the Business.

             (c) Reimbursement. A Party making Information or personnel
available to another Party under Section 9.1 shall be entitled to receive from
such other Party, upon the presentation of invoices therefor, payments for such
amounts relating to supplies, disbursements and other out-of-pocket expenses, as
may reasonably be incurred in making such Information or personnel available;
provided, however, that no such reimbursements shall be required for the salary
or cost of fringe benefits or similar expenses pertaining to employees of the
providing Party.

             (d) Retention of Records. Except as may otherwise be required by
law or agreed to in writing by the Parties, each Party shall use reasonable
commercial efforts to preserve, until six years after the Closing Date, all
Information in its possession or control pertaining to the Seller prior to the
Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in lieu of retaining any specific
Information, any Party may offer in writing to the other Party or Parties to
deliver such Information to the other Party or Parties, and if such offer is not
accepted within 90 days, the offered Information may be disposed of at any time.

             (e) Confidentiality. Each Party shall hold, and shall use
reasonable commercial efforts to cause their respective Affiliates, consultants
and advisors to hold, in strict confidence all Information concerning the other
furnished to it by the other Party or Parties or their representatives pursuant
to this Section 9.1 (except to the extent that such Information (i) is or
becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of any action
or inaction by the receiving Party, (ii) was within the possession of the
receiving Party prior to it being furnished to the receiving Party by or on
behalf of the disclosing Party pursuant hereto, provided that the source of such
information was not bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other
contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to any person or
entity with respect to such information, or (iii) is or becomes available on a
non-confidential basis to the receiving Party from a source other than the
disclosing Party, provided that the source of such information was not bound by
a confidentiality agreement with or other contractual, legal or fiduciary
obligation of confidentiality to any person or entity with respect to such
information), and each Party shall not release or disclose such Information to
any other person, except its auditors, attorneys, financial advisors, bankers
and other consultants and advisors, unless compelled to disclose such
Information by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of
law or so as not to violate the rules of any stock exchange; provided, however,
that in the case of disclosure compelled by judicial or administrative process,
the receiving Party shall (to the extent permitted by applicable law) notify the
disclosing Party promptly of the request and the documents requested thereby so
that the disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protective order or other
appropriate remedy. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or
the receipt of a waiver hereunder, a Party is, in the written opinion of its
counsel, compelled to disclose any Information to any tribunal or other entity
or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or penalty, such Party
may so disclose the Information without liability hereunder; provided, however,
that, such Party gives written notice to the other Party of the information to
be disclosed (including copies of the relevant portions of the relevant

<PAGE>

documents) as far in advance of its disclosure as is practicable, uses all
reasonable efforts to limit any such disclosure to the precise terms of such
requirement and cooperates with the disclosing Party to obtain an appropriate
protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded to such information by the tribunal or other entity.

         9.2 Collection of Accounts Receivable. The Seller agrees that it shall
forward promptly to the Buyer any monies, checks or instruments received by it
after the Closing with respect to the accounts receivable purchased by the Buyer
from the Seller pursuant to this Agreement. The Seller hereby authorizes the
Buyer to endorse and cash any checks or instruments payable or endorsed to the
Seller or its order which are received by the Buyer and which relate to accounts
receivable purchased by the Buyer from the Seller.

         9.3 Payment of Assumed Liabilities. In the event that the Seller (or an
Affiliate thereof) inadvertently pays or discharges, after the Closing, any
Assumed Liabilities, the Buyer shall reimburse the Seller or Affiliate for the
amount so paid or discharged within 30 days of being presented with written
evidence of such payment or discharge.

         9.4 [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED].

         9.5 Covenant Not To Compete. For a period of four (4) years from the
Closing Date, each Beneficial Owner shall not, directly or indirectly, by or for
himself or herself or as the agent of another or through others as his or her
agent, except for or in connection with the performance of his or her duties
under his Employment Agreement:

             (a) promote, sell, license, distribute or service anywhere in the
United States (the "Territory") products which are in competition with those of
the Business;

             (b) operate any facility for the design, manufacture, marketing or
distribution of products in competition with those of the Business anywhere in
the Territory;

             (c) own, manage, operate, control, participate in, provide
consulting services to or be employed by any other business directly or
indirectly engaged in the design, manufacture, marketing or distribution of
products competitive with the Business anywhere in the Territory, other than
through ownership of shares representing less than four percent (4%) of the
outstanding stock of any publicly traded company;

             (d) interfere with the business relationships or publicly disparage
the good name or reputation of the Business, or intentionally engage in any
conduct which brings the Buyer, the Business or the Guarantor into public
ridicule or disrepute; or

             (e) solicit for employment or employ any employee of the Business
or request, induce or advise any employee to leave the employ of the Business or
the Guarantor;

provided, however, that the obligations under this Section 9.5 shall terminate
and be of no further force and effect upon (i) the voluntary or involuntary
filing of any petition seeking the appointment of a trustee, receivor or
liquidator, in bankruptcy or otherwise, of the Buyer or all or a substantial
portion of its assets, (ii) the termination of employment of any Beneficial
Owner by the Buyer without "cause" or by such Beneficial Owner for "good reason"

<PAGE>

(as such terms are defined in such Beneficial Owners Employment Agreement), and
(iii) the default by the Buyer in the payment of any Contingent Purchase Price
Amount that has become due and payable.

The parties agree and acknowledge that the duration, scope and geographic areas
applicable to the covenants described in this Section are reasonable and that
the Purchase Price for the Acquired Assets includes adequate compensation for
such obligations. If, however, any court determines that any of the restrictions
are not reasonable, the parties hereby give the court the right and power to
interpret, alter, amend or modify any or all of the terms contained herein to
include as much of the scope, time period and geographic area as will render
such restrictions enforceable. The Beneficial Owners agree that in the event of
a breach or violation or attempted breach or violation of this Section, said
provisions, or any of them, may be enforced by an injunction in a suit in
equity, and that a temporary or preliminary injunction or restraining order may
be granted immediately upon the commencement of any such suit and without
notice.

         9.6 No Disparagement by the Buyer. For a period of four (4) years from
the Closing Date, each of the Buyer and the Guarantor (and their respective
affiliates) shall not, directly or indirectly, publicly disparage the good name
or reputation of any Beneficial Owner or any family member of any Beneficial
Owner, or intentionally engage in any conduct which brings any Beneficial Owner
or any family member of any Beneficial Owner into public ridicule or disrepute.

         9.7 Limited Guaranty. Subject to the limitations set forth in Sections
6.4 and 6.5, each of the Beneficial Owners hereby guarantees the obligations of
the Seller under Article VI of this Agreement for a period of five (5) years
after the Closing Date; provided, however, if an indemnification claim is
properly asserted in writing pursuant to Section 6.3 prior to the fifth
anniversary of the Closing Date, then the provisions of this Section 9.7 shall,
subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 6.4 and 6.5, survive until, but
only for the purposes of, the resolution of such claim.

                                   ARTICLE X
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         10.1 Press Releases and Announcements. No Party shall issue (and each
Party shall cause its Affiliates not to issue) any press release or public
disclosure relating to the subject matter of this Agreement without the prior
written approval of the other Party; provided, however, that any Party may make
any public disclosure it believes in good faith is required by law, regulation
or stock exchange rule (in which case the disclosing Party shall advise the
other Party and the other Party shall, if practicable, have the right to review
such press release or announcement prior to its publication).

         10.2 No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall not confer any
rights or remedies upon any person other than the Parties and the Beneficial

         10.3 Action to be Taken by Affiliates. The Parties shall cause their
respective Affiliates to comply with all of the obligations specified in this
Agreement to be performed by such Affiliates.

         10.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the documents referred
to herein) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement
between the Buyer and the Seller. This Agreement supersedes any prior agreements
or understandings between the Buyer and the Seller, and any representations or
statements made by or on behalf of the Seller or any of its Affiliates to the
Buyer, whether written or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof, other
than the Confidentiality Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement shall
terminate effective as of the Closing.

         10.5 Succession and Assignment. No Party may assign either this
Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the
prior written approval of the Seller (in the case of an assignment by the Buyer)
or the Buyer (in the case of an assignment by the Seller), which written
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Agreement, and all rights, interests and obligations hereunder,
may be assigned, without such consent, to any entity that acquires all or
substantially all of a Party's business or assets. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

         10.6 Notices. All notices, requests, demands, claims and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing. Any notice, request, demand, claim
or other communication hereunder shall be deemed duly delivered four Business
Days after it is sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested,
postage prepaid, or one Business Day after it is sent for next Business Day
delivery via a reputable nationwide overnight courier service, in each case to
the intended recipient as set forth below:

     If to the Buyer:

after the Closing Date.

Any Party may give any notice, request, demand, claim, or other communication
hereunder using any other means (including personal delivery, expedited courier,
messenger service, telecopy, telex, ordinary mail, or electronic mail), but no
such notice, request, demand, claim or other communication shall be deemed to
have been duly given unless and until it actually is received by the party for
whom it is intended. Any Party may change the address to which notices,
requests, demands, claims and other communications hereunder are to be delivered
by giving the other Parties notice in the manner herein set forth.

<PAGE>

         10.7 Amendments and Waivers. The Parties may mutually amend or waive
any provision of this Agreement at any time. No amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by all of the Parties. No waiver by any Party of any default,
misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether
intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent
default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect
in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such
occurrence.

         10.8 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or
unenforceable, the Parties agree that the body making the determination of
invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope,
duration or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases,
or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or
provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the
intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement
shall be enforceable as so modified.

         10.9 Expenses. Except as otherwise specifically provided to the
contrary in this Agreement, each of the Parties shall bear its own costs and
expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

         10.10 Specific Performance. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the
other Party would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the provisions of
this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each Party agrees that the other Party may
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the
provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the
terms and provisions hereof in any action instituted in any court of the United
States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the Parties and the matter.

         10.11 Governing Law. This Agreement and any disputes hereunder shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts without giving effect to any choice or conflict of
law provision or rule (whether of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdiction other
than those of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

         10.12 Submission to Jurisdiction. Each Party (a) submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding
may be heard and determined only in any such court, (c) waives any claim of
inconvenient forum or other challenge to venue in such court, and (d) agrees not
to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement
in any other court. Each Party agrees to accept service of any summons,
complaint or other initial pleading made in the manner provided for the giving
of notices in Section 10.6. Nothing in this Section 10.12 however, shall affect
the right of any Party to serve such summons, complaint or initial pleading in
any other manner permitted by law.

<PAGE>

         10.13 Bulk Transfer Laws. The Buyer acknowledges that the Seller will
not comply with the provisions of the bulk transfer laws of any jurisdiction in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         10.14 Construction.

             (a) The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the
language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of
strict construction shall be applied against any Party.

             (b) Any reference to any federal, state, local, or foreign statute
or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise.

             (c) The section headings contained in this Agreement are inserted
for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

             (d) Any reference herein to an Article, section or clause shall be

context clearly indicates otherwise.

the United States of America.

         10.15 Waiver of Jury Trial. To the extent permitted by applicable law,

proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise)

hereby or the actions of any Party in the negotiation, administration,
performance and enforcement of this Agreement.
