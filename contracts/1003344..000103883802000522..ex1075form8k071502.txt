upon written notice to Parent, may delay the Closing (but not beyond October 18,

Certificate of Merger (the "Certificate of Merger"), executed in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the DGCL, is duly filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware, or at such other time as the Sub and the Company shall
agree should be specified in the Certificate of Merger. When used in this

the State of Delaware or such later time established by the Certificate of
Merger. The filing of the Certificate of Merger shall be made contemporaneously
with or as promptly as practicable after the Closing.

immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each share of Series B Preferred
Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Series B Preferred," and
together with the Series A Preferred, the "Preferred Stock") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the
right to receive the Preferred Per Share Consideration. At the Effective Time,
all shares of Preferred Stock shall cease to be outstanding, shall be canceled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate formerly representing
a share of Preferred Stock shall thereafter cease to have any rights with
respect to the shares of Preferred Stock, except as provided herein or by law.

Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (each a "Class B Common Share",

converted into the right to receive (i) the Common Per Share Cash Consideration,
and (ii) the Common Per Share Equity Consideration (together with any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Stock to be paid pursuant to Section
3.1(g)). At the Effective Time, all Common Shares shall cease to be outstanding,
shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate
formerly representing a Common Share shall thereafter cease to have any rights
with respect to the Common Shares, except as provided herein or by law. The
shares of Parent Stock issued as Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section
3.1(b) and Section 3.2 shall be referred to as "Merger Shares."

         (c) Adjustment Escrow. An aggregate of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($500,000) in cash of the Merger Consideration otherwise deliverable to the
holders of Common Shares upon exchange of their Common Shares and the holders of
the CVC Warrant pursuant to Section 3.2 hereof, shall be withheld on a pro rata
basis from the aggregate amount of cash to be delivered to such Persons and
shall be deposited by Parent at the Effective Time (with respect to the Common
Shares) and at the Closing (with respect to the CVC Warrants) with an escrow
agent (the "Escrow Agent") selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to
Parent, such deposits to constitute an escrow fund (the "Escrow Fund") to be
governed by the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Escrow
Agreement, attached as Exhibit B hereto. The portion of the Merger Consideration
delivered to the Escrow Agent pursuant to this Section 3.1(c) shall be known as
the "Escrow Amount."

         (d) Stock Options. At the Effective Time, all unexercised options to
purchase Common Shares ("Company Stock Options") then outstanding under the
Company's 1999 Stock Option Plan (the "Company Stock Option Plan"), whether
vested or unvested, shall be terminated and the Company Stock Option Plan shall
be terminated.

         (e) Capital Stock of the Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of the Sub, immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall remain
outstanding as one share of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

         (f) Treasury Stock and Parent Owned Stock. Each Company Share owned by
the Company or Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Excluded Company
Shares") shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

         (g) Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Stock will be issued and any holder of
Company Shares or of the CVC Warrants entitled to receive a fractional share of
Parent Stock but for this Section 3.1(g) shall be entitled to receive a cash
payment (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) in lieu thereof, without
interest, in an amount equal to such fractional share interest multiplied by the
Parent Stock Price, which payment shall represent such holder's proportionate
interest in a share of the Parent Stock. Fractional share interests of a holder
will be aggregated, and no holder will receive cash in an amount equal to or
greater than the value of one full share of Parent Stock.

         SECTION 3.2 Phantom Stock Right and CVC Warrants.

Common Shares underlying the CVC Warrants held by such holders and (ii)
following repayment of the Mezzanine Financing Facility by the Company pursuant
to Section 6.19, the Mezzanine Stock Purchase Warrant pursuant to Section 6.18.

         SECTION 3.3 Post-Closing Adjustment.

         (a) Not later than thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Parent
shall prepare a financial data schedule (the "Parent Financial Data Schedule")
of the Company and its Subsidiaries presenting, as of the Closing Date, Parent's
good faith calculation of (i) the Other Indebtedness and (ii) the Transaction
Expenses. The Company Financial Data Schedule and the Parent Financial Data
Schedule and the items set forth therein shall each be prepared in accordance
with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the Company Financial Statements,
except to the extent otherwise provided herein. In connection with the Parent
Financial Data Schedule all (i) known arithmetic errors contained in the Company
Financial Data Schedule shall be taken into account and (ii) assuming compliance
with the immediately preceding sentence, no changes in accounting principles,
policies, practices, procedures or methodologies shall be made from those
utilized in preparing the Company Financial Data Schedule, including, without
limitation, with respect to the nature and classification of accounts or the
determination of the level of reserves, accruals or materiality. The Company
Financial Data Schedule and the Parent Financial Data Schedule shall each be
accompanied by all necessary and appropriate supporting work papers and
materials. With respect to the Parent Financial Data Schedule, if these work
papers and materials are materially deficient or incomplete, the Review Period
referenced in Section 3.3(b) hereof shall be extended to give the Holders'
Representatives' accountants sufficient time to complete their review of the
Parent Financial Data Schedule.

         (b) Following receipt of the Parent Financial Data Schedule and
supporting work papers and materials, the Holders' Representatives and its
accountants will be afforded a period of thirty (30) days (the "Review Period")
to review the Parent Financial Data Schedule. At or before the end of the Review
Period, the Holders' Representatives may deliver to Parent a written notice (an
"Objection Notice") in accordance with paragraph (d) of this Section 3.3
disputing the Parent Financial Data Schedule. Any Objection Notice shall specify
in reasonable detail the dollar amount of any objection and the basis therefor.
Any determination expressly set forth on the Parent Financial Data Schedule
which is not specifically objected to in the Objection Notice shall be deemed
final and binding upon the parties upon delivery of the Objection Notice If the
Holders' Representatives do not give Parent such an Objection Notice before the
end of the Review Period, then the Parent Financial Data Schedule will be
conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto.

         (c) Within ten (10) days following the later of (i) the date the Parent
Financial Data Schedule is accepted by the Holders' Representatives, and (ii)
the final, binding and conclusive determination of all disputes with respect to

Merger Agmt                          - 14 -
<PAGE>

the Parent Financial Data Schedule as provided in paragraph (d) of this Section
3.3 (such later date, the "Adjustment Determination Date"), the Parent shall
deliver to former holders of Common Shares and of the CVC Warrants receiving
Merger Consideration, on a pro rata basis pursuant to the provisions of Section
3.4(a)(2), an aggregate amount in cash equal to either (A) in the event the
Estimated Aggregate Cash Consideration Value is greater than the Aggregate Cash
Consideration Value, the Escrow Amount minus such difference; (B) in the event
the Estimated Aggregate Cash Consideration Value is less than the Aggregate Cash
Consideration Value, the Escrow Amount plus such difference; or (C) in the event
the Estimated Aggregate Cash Consideration Value and the Aggregate Cash
Consideration Value are the same, the Escrow Amount.

         (d) In the event that prior to the expiration of the Review Period the
Holders' Representatives provide Parent with an Objection Notice, Parent and the
Holders' Representatives shall attempt to reconcile in good faith their
differences as to the items specified therein within ten (10) days (the
"Resolution Period") after Parent's receipt of the Objection Notice, and any
resolution by them as to any disputed items shall be final, binding and
conclusive on Parent and the former holders of Common Shares and of the CVC
Warrants. If Parent and the Holders' Representatives are unable to reach a
resolution with such effect within the Resolution Period, Parent and the
applicable Holders' Representatives shall submit the dispute to the Salt Lake
City, Utah office of KPMG (the "Independent CPA"). The parties hereto
acknowledge that separate resolutions maybe reached for the CVC Group and the
Management Group as described in Section 8.7. The Independent CPA shall only
decide the specific items under dispute by the parties and shall be instructed
to determine the Adjustment Items in accordance with the principles set forth in
this Agreement. The Independent CPA shall establish procedures giving due regard
to the intention of the parties to resolve disputes as quickly, efficiently and
inexpensively as possible. The parties shall then submit evidence in accordance
with the procedures so established and the Independent CPA shall decide the
dispute or disputes in accordance therewith; provided the Independent CPA shall
select a resolution that is the Parent's position, the applicable Holders'
Representatives' position, or between such positions. The determination of such
dispute by the Independent CPA shall be final, binding and conclusive on Parent
and the former holders of Common Shares and of CVC Warrants. The fees and
expenses of the Independent CPA shall be assessed by the Independent CPA fifty
percent (50%) against the former holders of Common Shares and of CVC Warrants
(for whom settlement has not been reached prior to the commencement of such
arbitration) and fifty percent (50%) against Parent, and shall be paid by each
of them in those proportions.

         SECTION 3.4 Exchange of Certificates for the Stock Merger
Consideration.

         (a) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent or
Surviving Corporation shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate
("Certificate") in respect of Company Shares (other than holders of a
Certificate in respect of Excluded Company Shares), which have not been
surrendered to Parent at Closing for cancelation, (i) a letter of transmittal
specifying that delivery shall be effected, and that risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent, such letter of
transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the
Company may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for exchanging the
Certificates for (A) the Merger Consideration and (B) any cash in lieu of

Merger Agmt                          - 15 -
<PAGE>

fractional shares. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancelation to Parent,
together (if such Certificates were not so surrendered at Closing) with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the following:

         (1) with respect to the shares of Preferred Stock the applicable Merger
Consideration;

         (2) with respect to Common Shares surrendered prior to the Adjustment
Determination Date, (x) the applicable Merger Consideration (based upon the
Estimated Aggregate Cash Consideration Value, and less the allocable portion of
the Escrow Amount), and (y) a check in the amount (after giving effect to any
required tax withholdings pursuant to Section 3.4(f)) of (A) any cash in lieu of
fractional shares plus (B) any cash dividends or other cash distributions and
(C) any other dividends or distributions issuable or payable at such time that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section
3.4(b); provided, however, following the Adjustment Determination Date such
holders shall be entitled to receive their pro rata portion of any amount
payable thereto pursuant to Section 3.3(c); or

         (3) with respect to Common Shares surrendered following the Adjustment
Determination Date, (x) the applicable Merger Consideration, and (y) a check in
the amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings pursuant to
Section 3.4(g)) of (A) any cash in lieu of fractional shares plus (B) any cash
dividends or other cash distributions and (C) any other dividends or
distributions issuable or payable at such time that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.4(b).

Each Certificate so surrendered as set forth above shall forthwith be canceled.
No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of
the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Shares that
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the applicable Merger
Consideration, together with (A) a check for any cash to be paid upon due
surrender of the Certificate and (B) any non-cash dividends or distributions in
each case shall be issued or paid as provided in Section 3.4(a) to such a
transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Company Shares is
presented to the Parent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes
have been paid. If the Merger Consideration is to be issued in a name or paid to
a person other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange
therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Person
requesting such exchange shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the issuance or payment of the Merger Consideration in a name or to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall
establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable.

         (b) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. Whenever a
dividend or other distribution is declared by Parent in respect of Parent Stock,
the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that declaration
shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all shares of
Parent Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other
distributions in respect of Parent Stock shall be paid to any holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate until such Certificate is surrendered for exchange in
accordance with this Article III. Subject to the effect of applicable laws,

Merger Agmt                          - 16 -
<PAGE>

following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be issued and, if
applicable, paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole shares of
Parent Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at the time of
such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of issuance of
such whole shares of Parent Stock and not previously paid in respect of such
whole shares and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to
surrender. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of shares
of Parent Stock, all shares of Parent Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger
shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

         (c) Voting. No holder of unsurrendered Certificates shall be entitled
to exercise any voting rights with respect to Parent Stock which it is entitled
to receive in the Merger.

         (d) Transfers. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Company of the Company Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

         (e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact in form and substance satisfactory to Parent by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent will
issue and/or pay in the manner provided in Section 3.4(d) in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration, any unpaid
dividends or other distributions and any cash payment in lieu of a fractional
share in respect thereof issuable and/or payable pursuant to this Article III
upon due surrender of and delivery in respect of the Company Shares represented
by such Certificate pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without interest.

         (f) Withholding Rights. Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise issuable and/or
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Shares, the CVC
Warrants, the Mezzanine Stock Purchase Warrant and the Phantom Stock Right such
amounts as Parent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax
law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the Company Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by Parent.

         SECTION 3.5 Dissenters' Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, no Company Shares, the holder of which (a "Dissenting
Stockholder") has properly exercised and perfected dissenters' rights of
appraisal under Section 262 of Delaware Law (a "Dissenting Share"), shall be
converted into the right to receive any Merger Consideration, but such
Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive such consideration as shall
be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such
Dissenting Share; provided that if any such Dissenting Stockholder shall fail to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or otherwise lost his, her or its
rights to appraisal under the DGCL, each of such Dissenting Stockholder's
Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration applicable thereto as if such
Dissenting Share had not been a Dissenting Share at the Effective Time, without
any interest thereon, and such share shall thereupon no longer be a Dissenting
Share. Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for

Merger Agmt                          - 17 -
<PAGE>

appraisal in respect of any Company Shares, withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL (including, without limitation,
instruments concerning appraisal or dissenters' rights) and received by the
Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
the exercise of dissenters' rights in respect of any Company Shares or offer to
settle or settle any such demands. Each holder of Company Shares who becomes
entitled pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL to payment for such shares under
the provisions of such section shall receive payment therefor from the Surviving
Corporation and such Company Shares shall be canceled.

                                  ARTICLE IV.
          REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY AND PUBLIC SUB

Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do
business and in good standing in each state or other jurisdiction in which the
property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted
by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good
standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company or prevent or result in a third party materially delaying the
consummation of the Merger. Section 4.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a complete and accurate list of each jurisdiction in which the Company is
qualified to do business. The Company has delivered or made available to Parent
complete and correct copies of its certificate of incorporation and bylaws and
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or similar organizational

Subsidiaries, setting forth the jurisdictions where each Subsidiary is organized
and qualified to do business. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or
equity interests of each such Subsidiary are owned by the Company, by one of its
wholly owned subsidiaries or by the Company and one of its wholly owned
subsidiaries, free and clear of all Liens other than Liens incurred in
connection with the Credit Facility, and are duly authorized, validly issued,

delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to grant,
extend or enter into any such option, warrant, call, right or agreement. Except
for the Existing Stockholder Agreements, those equity-related agreements with
executives of the Company set forth on Schedule 4.3 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (the "Executive Equity Agreements"), and as provided in this Agreement,
there are no outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (i) to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of
capital stock or other equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (ii) to vote or to dispose of any shares of the capital stock

corporate action on the part of each of the Company and Public Sub and each of
their respective stockholders. This Agreement has been duly executed and

constitutes the valid and binding obligation of each, enforceable against each
in accordance with its terms, subject to (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium
or other similar laws affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors'
rights generally and (b) general principles of equity.

         SECTION 4.5 Consent and Approvals; No Violations. The execution and
delivery by the Company and Public Sub of this Agreement do not, and the
consummation by the Company and Public Sub of the Transactions and compliance by
each with the provisions hereof will not, result in any violation of, or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or the loss
of a benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, (i) any
provision of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or comparable organization

its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, other than, in
the case of clause (ii) or (iii), any such violations, defaults, rights, losses
or Liens, that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or prevent or result
in a third party materially delaying the consummation of the Merger. No filing
or registration with, or authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental
Authority is required by or with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Company or is necessary for the consummation of the Transactions, except (i)

         SECTION 5.4 Consents and Approvals; No Violations. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Parent and the Sub does not, and the consummation

required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein,

2002, and such certified balance sheets and related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows (including the related notes and
schedules) will not deviate from the Preliminary PWC Audited Financials in a
manner that is adverse to Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

         (d) The draft consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its Subsidiaries

under GAAP to be set forth on or reserved against Parent Balance Sheet or a

done all things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part (or, as to the
Company, on the part of any of its stockholders) under this Agreement and
applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Transactions as soon as
practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all
documentation to effect all necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings
and other documents and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents,
registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to
be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Authority in order to
consummate the Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Company and Parent shall respond as promptly as practicable to (i) any
inquiries or requests received from the Federal Trade Commission or the
Department of Justice for additional information or documentation and (ii) any
inquiries or requests received from any state attorney general or other

governmental body in connection with antitrust or related matters. Each of the
Company and Parent shall (i) give the other party prompt notice of the
commencement of any material legal proceeding by or before any court or other
governmental body with respect to the Transactions, (ii) keep the other party
informed as to the status of any such legal proceeding and (iii) except as may
be prohibited by any governmental body or by any legal requirement, permit the
other party to be present at each meeting or conference relating to any such
legal proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any
document filed with or provided to any governmental body in connection with any
such legal proceeding. Nothing in this Section 6.4 shall require, or be
construed to require, Parent or the Company, or any of their Subsidiaries, to
proffer to, or agree to, any divestiture by Parent or the Company, or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates, of shares of capital stock or of
any business, assets or properties thereof, the imposition of any material
limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their business or to own or
exercise control of such assets, properties or stock, or any other concession to
any Governmental Authority, that Parent concludes is reasonably likely to
materially reduce the economic or business benefits Parent expects, as of the
date hereof, to realize from the Merger.

         (b) Subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information,
Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable each will consult the other on, all information relating to
Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective
Subsidiaries, that appear in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection
with the Transactions, including any Financing Activities. In exercising the
foregoing right, each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as
promptly as practicable. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent
each shall, upon reasonable request by the other, furnish the other with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be necessary or advisable in
connection with any statement, filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any
third party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Transactions, including any Financing Activities; provided that any actions
requested by Parent related to the Financing Activities shall be at Parent's
sole cost and expense. None of such information furnished by the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of its stockholders will, at the time provided or at any
time such information is provided to third parties or filed with any
Governmental Authority, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The Company shall promptly advise the Parent in
writing if, at any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company obtains
Knowledge of any facts that would make it necessary or advisable to supplement
or amend any materials containing information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers or stockholders or such other matters,
including materials provided to third parties or filed with any Governmental
Authority in connection with any Financing Activities.

         (c) Upon written request by Parent, the Company shall make at least one
of its executive officers (and, if the Company designates only one executive
officer, at least one other senior employee reasonably acceptable to Parent)
available to participate in the road show or other presentations which may be
conducted in connection with any Financing Activities. The costs and expenses of
such participation shall be borne by Parent.

         (d) The Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent, and Parent
shall give prompt written notice to the Company, of (a) the occurrence or
non-occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which causes or
is likely to cause any representation or warranty of the Company, Public Sub or
Parent or the Sub, respectively, contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect at or prior to the Effective Time and (b) any
failure of the Company, Public Sub or Parent or the Sub, respectively, to comply
with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall not limit or otherwise
affect the other party's right to rely on the representations and warranties
herein or any of the other remedies available to the party receiving such
notice; provided further that if any party has Knowledge of a breach of a
representation or warranty by the other party (the "Breaching Party") prior to
the Effective Time (other than with respect to a breach of Section 4.3, 4.12(u),
4.15(a), 4.24 or Section 4.25 for which the stockholders and the holders of the
CVC Warrants shall be obligated to indemnify the Parent Indemnitees in
accordance with Section 8.2 hereof), and such party elects to consummate the
Merger, then the Breaching Party's Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed (other
than with respect to Sections 4.3, 4.12(u), 4.15(a), 4.24 and 4.25) to have been
amended so as to have cured such breach and such party shall not be entitled to
indemnification for any Losses in connection with such breach under Article VIII
hereof. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Knowledge of
a breach of the representations and warranties contained in Sections 4.3,
4.12(u), 4.15(a), 4.24 and 4.25 will under no circumstances have the effect of
amending or in anyway qualifying the representations and warranties contained in
Sections 4.3, 4.12(u), 4.15(a), 4.24 or 4.25 or curing any misrepresentation or
breach of warranty with respect to Sections 4.3, 4.12(u), 4.15(a), 4.24 and
4.25, and the Parent Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification for any
Losses pursuant to Section 8.2 in connection with such breaches under Sections
4.3, 4.12(u), 4.15(a), 4.24 and 4.25 regardless thereof. The parties acknowledge
and agree that the burden of proof for proving that a party had Knowledge of a
breach of a representation or warranty by a Breaching Party prior to the
Effective Time shall be on the Breaching Party and in no event shall
constructive knowledge, imputed knowledge or similar concepts of deemed
knowledge be deemed to constitute Knowledge for purposes of this Section 6.4(d)
and any litigation or proceedings related thereto.

         SECTION 6.5 Nasdaq Listing. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to authorize for listing on the Nasdaq National Market the shares of
Parent Stock issuable pursuant hereto.

         SECTION 6.6 Indemnification of Company Directors and Officers.

         (a) From and after the Effective Time for a period of three (3) years,
Parent agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless each present and former
director and officer of the Company (when acting in such capacity) determined as
of the Effective Time (the "Charter Indemnified Parties"), against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (collectively, "Costs") incurred in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether

Merger Agmt                          - 48 -
<PAGE>

asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent that the Company would have been permitted under the DGCL and its bylaws
in effect on the date hereof to indemnify such Person (and Parent shall also
advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
law, provided the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking
to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not
entitled to indemnification).

         (b) Any Charter Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification
under paragraph (a) of this Section 6.6, upon learning of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof,
but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent of any liability it may
have to such Indemnified Party if such failure does not materially prejudice the
indemnifying party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) Parent
or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof
and Parent shall not be liable to such Charter Indemnified Parties for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation elect to assume such defense or
counsel for the Charter Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which
raise conflicts of interest between Parent or the Surviving Corporation and the
Charter Indemnified Parties, the Charter Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
satisfactory to them, and Parent shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of
such counsel for the Charter Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor
are received; provided, however, that Parent shall be obligated pursuant to this
paragraph (b) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Charter Indemnified
Parties in any jurisdiction (unless there is a conflict of interest as provided
above) (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such
matter and (iii) Parent shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
the prior written consent of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
appropriate, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent shall not enter into any settlement regarding the above
matters without the prior written consent of the Charter Indemnified Parties
(not to be withheld unreasonably) unless such settlement contains an
unconditional release of the Charter Indemnified Party.

         (c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain a policy
of officers' and directors' liability insurance for acts and omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time, with coverage in amount and scope at least as
favorable as the Company's existing primary directors' and officers' liability
insurance coverage (excluding any supplemental or excess directors and officers
liability insurance coverage, including, without limitation, the supplemental
coverage policy identified as policy number 590CM0269 issued by St. Paul Mercury
Fire Insurance Company and any similar policies with respect to the Citicorp
Venture Capital Ltd. portfolio participants applicable to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries) for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time;
provided, however, that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation or Parent be
required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 125% of the annual
premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance.

         (d) The provisions of this Section are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Charter Indemnified Parties, their
heirs and their representatives and shall be binding on all successors and
assigns of Parent.

         SECTION 6.7 Access.

         (a) Upon reasonable notice, and except as may otherwise be required by
applicable law, each of the parties hereto shall afford, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to afford, the other's Representatives full access,
during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time,
to their and their Subsidiaries properties, books, contracts and records and,
during such period, each shall furnish promptly to the other all information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as may reasonably be
requested, provided that no investigation pursuant to this Section shall affect
or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the parties and
their respective Subsidiaries, hereunder except as specifically set forth in
Section 6.4(c), and provided further, that the foregoing shall not require any
party to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the
reasonable judgment of such party would result in the disclosure of any trade
secrets of third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to
confidentiality if such party shall have used all reasonable efforts to obtain
the consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure. All requests
for information made pursuant to this Section shall be directed to the Company
Designee or the Parent Designee, as appropriate.

         (b) All information obtained by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or
Public Sub pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall be kept confidential in accordance
with the letter agreement dated November 7, 2001 between Parent and the Company
(the "Confidentiality Letter").

         SECTION 6.8 Publicity. The initial press release with respect to the
Merger shall be a joint press release of Parent and the Company. Thereafter
Parent shall consult with the Company prior to issuing any press releases or
otherwise making public announcements with respect to the Transactions and prior
to making any filings with any third party or any Governmental Authority
(including any national securities exchange) with respect thereto, except as may
be required by law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any national securities exchange. The Company shall consult with Parent
prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public announcements
with respect to the Transactions and prior to making any filings with any third
party or any Governmental Authority (including any national securities exchange)
with respect thereto and shall not issue any such press releases, make any such
public announcements or make any such filings without the prior written consent
of Parent, unless required by law upon advice of counsel.

         SECTION 6.9 Employee Benefits; Treatment of Plans.

         (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall grant all employees
of the Company credit for all service with the Company prior to the Effective
Time for (i) eligibility and vesting purposes and (ii) for purposes of vacation
accrual after the Effective Time as if such service with the Company was service
with Parent. Parent and the Company agree that with respect to any medical or
dental benefit plan of Parent, Parent shall waive any pre-existing condition
exclusion and actively-at-work requirements and similar limitations, eligibility
waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under any of Parent's
group health plans. Parent shall provide that any covered expenses incurred on
or before the Effective Time by the Company's employees or such employees'
covered dependents shall be taken into account for purposes of satisfying
applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions after
the Effective Time to the same extent as such expenses are taken into account
for the benefit of similarly situated employees of Parent. As soon as

Merger Agmt                          - 50 -
<PAGE>

administratively practicable after the Effective Time but in no event later than
thirty (30) days after the Effective Time, employees of the Company shall be
eligible to participate in a plan with a cash or deferred arrangement subject to
Section 401(k) of the Code, subject to the generally applicable terms of the
plan.

         (b) The foregoing shall not constitute any commitment, contract,
understanding or guarantee (express or implied) on the part of Parent or the Sub
of a post-Effective Time employment relationship of any term of duration or on
any terms other than those that Parent or the Sub may establish. Employment of
any of the employees by Parent will be "at will" and may be terminated by Parent
or the Sub at any time for any reason (subject to any legally binding agreement
other than this Agreement, or any applicable laws or collective bargaining
agreement, or any other arrangement or commitment). Except as otherwise provided
in this Section, nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as limiting the
power of the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any particular Benefit
Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program, agreement or policy or as
requiring the Surviving Corporation or Parent to offer to continue (other than
as required by its terms) any written employment contract.

         (c) Prior to the Closing Date and upon request by Parent, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall take all necessary action to terminate or cause
to be terminated effective as of the Effective Time each Employee Plan that
contains a cash or deferred arrangement subject to Section 401(k) of the Code.

         (d) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take all action
necessary or required to terminate the Company Stock Options and the Company
Stock Option Plan.

         SECTION 6.10 Fees and Expenses.

         (a) All fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses,
whether or not the Merger is consummated, except that expenses incurred in
connection with the filing fee under the HSR Act shall be shared equally by
Parent and the Company, and Parent shall be responsible for the payment of all
Excluded Transaction Expenses. To the extent that Excluded Transaction Expenses
are first paid by the Company, Parent, upon request, shall promptly reimburse
the Company therefor and in any event within thirty (30) days of such request.

         (b) If this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to (X) Section 9.1(b)(i) or (Y) Section 9.1(b)(iii)(Y) and, in each
case, at the time of such termination (A) the condition set forth in Section
7.2(m) to the obligations of Parent and Sub shall not have been satisfied due to
either (i) Parent's refusal to accept a Termination Financing or (ii) Parent's
failure to consummate a Termination Financing (based on, for purpose of (ii),
Parent's failure to perform its obligations under the Agreement) of which it has
been notified pursuant to Section 6.15 (provided that for the purpose of (X)
above, Section 7.2(m) shall not be deemed to have been satisfied by Parent's
acceptance of a Termination Financing), (B) the other conditions set forth in
Sections 7.1(b) and (c), Sections 7.2 (a), (b), (c), (d), (h), (i), (j), (k),
(n), (r), (s), and (t), and Section 7.3(i) (except that such opinion may contain
customary qualifications and assumptions, including standard representations by
Parent, may assume the consummation of the Merger and the Termination Financing,
shall be a "would qualify" opinion and shall be delivered to Parent for its
review, but Parent shall not be entitled to rely thereon), shall have been
satisfied or waived and (C) Parent and Sub shall not have then been entitled to

Merger Agmt                          - 51 -
<PAGE>

terminate this Agreement pursuant to any of the provisions of Section 9.1 (other
than Section 9.1(b)(i) or Section 9.1(b)(iii)(Y)), then Parent shall be
obligated to pay to the Holders' Representatives a non-refundable fee in the
aggregate amount of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) (the "Parent Termination
Fee") plus all reasonable fees and expenses incurred by the Company or the
Holders' Representatives in connection with the collection of the Parent
Termination Fee within three (3) days following termination by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account(s) specified by the Holders'
Representatives for distribution thereby to each stockholder of the Company and
each holder of CVC Warrants as of the date of termination pro rata based on the
percentage of Merger Consideration such Person would have received upon
consummation of the Merger.

         SECTION 6.11 Form 10-Qs. The Parent and Public Sub shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to file their respective Form 10-Qs for the
quarter ended June 30, 2002, on or prior to July 31, 2002, and in any event on
or prior to August 14, 2002, and Public Sub shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to file its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30,
2002 on or before October 31, 2002, and in any event on or prior to November 14,
2002. Parent and the Public Sub each agree that their respective Form 10-Qs, as
of their respective dates, will (i) comply in all material respects with
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and (ii) will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein, or necessary to make the statement made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company shall also
(i) use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Parent on or before July
31, 2002, and in any event on or prior to August 14, 2002, the consolidated
balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of June 30, 2002, and the
related consolidated statements of operations and stockholders' equity of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for the three-month and six-month periods then
ended, and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Parent on or
before October 31, 2002, and in any event on or prior to November 14, 2002, the
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of September
30, 2002, and the related consolidated statements of operations and
stockholders' equity of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the three-month and
nine-month periods then ended. Such consolidated financial statements shall have
been reviewed by the Company's outside independent auditors in accordance with
the standards and procedures of SAS 72.

         SECTION 6.12 State Takeover Laws. If any "fair price" or "control share
acquisition" statute or other similar statute or regulation shall become
applicable to the Transactions, Parent and the Company and their respective
Boards of Directors shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to grant
such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the Transactions
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby
and otherwise act to minimize the effects of any such statute or regulation on
the Transactions.

         SECTION 6.13 Accountant's Letter. The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent and its
directors a Comfort Letter dated the Closing Date and addressed to Parent and
its directors covering the Company Financial Statements for the most recent
fiscal year then ended, and any interim financial periods subsequent thereto. In
addition to the foregoing, upon the request of Parent, the Company shall cause
to be delivered and addressed to the underwriters, placement agent or lenders,
as the case may be, a Comfort Letter of the Company's outside independent
auditors covering any

Merger Agmt                          - 52 -
<PAGE>

financial information of the Company and its Subsidiaries used in connection
with any Financing Activities. Further, the Company agrees to cause its
independent auditors to grant any consents to Parent or the Company required
under the United States securities laws in connection with any filings of
materials with the SEC under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case
may be.

         SECTION 6.14 Tax-Free Reorganization. Parent and the Company shall each
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to be treated as a
reorganization within the meaning of section 368 of the Code. Parent and the
Company shall each use reasonable best efforts to obtain opinions from counsel
to Parent and the Company, respectively, that the Merger is a reorganization
within the meaning of section 368 of the Code, and Parent and the Company shall
each to the extent accurate make certain representations and warranties as
requested by counsel to Parent and counsel to Company, respectively, in
connection with such opinions.

         SECTION 6.15 Commitment Financing. Parent hereby agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to arrange and complete the Commitment Financing
including without limitation (i) to negotiate definitive agreements with respect
thereto and (ii) to satisfy all conditions applicable to Parent and Sub in such
definitive agreements. Parent will keep the Company informed at all times with
respect to the status of its efforts to arrange and complete the Commitment
Financing, including, without limitation, with respect to the occurrence of any
event which Parent believes may have a materially adverse effect on the ability
of Parent to obtain the Commitment Financing. In the event Parent is (i) unable
to arrange or complete any portion of the Commitment Financing in the manner
described in the Term Sheet attached to the Commitments, or from the sources
originally contemplated or (ii) indicates or pursuant to this Section 6.15 is
deemed to have indicated in the Financing Notification (as defined below) that
Parent is unwilling to complete the Commitment Financing due to the fact that
such financing constitutes a Termination Financing (as defined below), Parent
will use commercially reasonable efforts to arrange any such portion from
alternate sources; provided that Parent shall not be obligated to accept terms
not reasonably satisfactory to it; provided further that any such alternate
financing shall be deemed acceptable to Parent if such alternate financing is on
terms at least as favorable to Parent as the terms in the Term Sheet attached to
the Commitments and the conditions are at least as favorable as those set forth
in the Commitments. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, Parent shall not be
required to complete any Commitment Financing, whether from the sources
originally contemplated or alternate sources, if the pricing of the Term B
Facility corresponding to that described in the Term Sheet attached to the
Commitments exceeds the pricing set forth in the Term Sheet attached to the
Commitments, in each case measured on a yield equivalent basis (taking into
consideration original issue discount, underwriting fees, other fees or
consideration that affect the yield equivalent pricing), by more than 100 basis
points (any such financing, a "Termination Financing"). Parent shall notify the
Company and the Holders' Representatives in writing (the "Financing
Notification") within five (5) days following notification from the financing
source as required by the Commitments or otherwise, that the syndication results
have caused changes in the terms that result in the Commitment Financing
becoming a Termination Financing, and Parent shall indicate whether or not
Parent is willing to complete the Commitment Financing due to the fact that such
financing constitutes a Termination Financing. If a Financing Notification is
not delivered within such five (5) day period, then Parent shall be deemed to
have rejected the Termination Financing. The non-economic terms and conditions
and the identity of the provider of such alternate financing shall be reasonably

Merger Agmt                          - 53 -
<PAGE>

satisfactory to the Company (it being understood that if such provider(s) is a
nationally recognized financing source(s) and such non-economic terms and
conditions are not in the aggregate materially more burdensome on the Parent's
ability to obtain the financing described therein than the non-economic terms
and conditions of the financing which such alternate financing would replace,
then such alternate financing shall be deemed acceptable to the Company). The
Company hereby agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to assist Parent to
arrange and complete the Commitment Financing, including to satisfy all
conditions applicable to the Company in connection therewith at Parent's sole
cost and expense and the Company shall not be obligated to incur any monetary
obligations or expenditures in connection with such assistance not otherwise
payable by Parent.

         SECTION 6.16 Company Financial Data Schedule. Immediately prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent, accompanied by necessary and
appropriate supporting work papers and materials, a financial data schedule (the
"Company Financial Data Schedule") prepared (unless otherwise provided herein)
in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the Company Financial
Statements presenting, as of the Closing Date, the Company's good faith estimate
of (i) the Other Indebtedness, (ii) the Transaction Expenses, (iii) the Net
Asset Value, and (iv) the Net Working Capital.

         SECTION 6.17 Transaction Expenses. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause all of its and its Subsidiaries' legal, accounting
and financial advisory and other Transaction Expenses to be invoiced at or prior
to the Closing, and the Company shall include alls such amounts in the
Transaction Expenses item presented on the Company Financial Data Schedule.

         SECTION 6.18 Debt; Warrants. At the Closing and subject to obtaining
the financing referred to in Section 6.15, the Parent shall provided funds
necessary for the Company to repay all amounts, including principal and
interest, outstanding under each of the Credit Facility and the Mezzanine
Financing Facility. In connection with such repayment, the Company at the
Closing shall cause the lenders under each of the Credit Facility and the
Mezzanine Financing Facility to release the Company, its Subsidiaries and each
of their respective Affiliates from any and all obligations under such
agreements and shall cause such lenders to file all documents and filings in all
local and state jurisdictions releasing any and all liens any lenders may have
on the tangible or intangible assets or properties of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. All such releases, filings and documentation shall be in the form
and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and shall be hereafter referred to
collectively as the "Releases." At the Closing and subject to the financing
referred to in Section 6.15, Parent shall purchase the CVC Warrants in the
aggregate for the CVC Warrant Cash Consideration and the CVC Warrant Equity
Consideration as provided for herein and the Mezzanine Stock Purchase Warrant
for such amount in cash as provided in Section 3 of the Mezzanine Stock Purchase
Warrant.

         SECTION 6.19 Debt Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation. On or about
the date which is estimated to be twenty (20) Business Days prior to the
Effective Time, and upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Noteholder
Agreements, Public Sub shall (a) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
under the Exchange Act) a cash tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding
Notes and (b) solicit the consents of the holders of the Notes to the Indenture
Amendments (as defined in the Noteholder Agreement) (collectively, the "Debt
Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation").

         SECTION 6.20 Closing Preferred Liquidation Value. At the Closing, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate of the Chief Executive Officer and
the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, representing and warranting on
behalf of the Company as to the Preferred Liquidation Value as of the Closing
Date (the "Preferred Liquidation Value Certificate").

         SECTION 6.21 Registration Rights Agreement. At the Closing, Parent
shall, and the Company shall cause recipients of Merger Shares to, execute a
Registration Rights Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the
"Registration Rights Agreement").

         SECTION 6.22 FIRPTA. The Company will cause its stockholders and other
holders of an interest (other than an interest solely as a creditor) in the
Company to provide certificates in a form that meets the requirements of section
1.1445-2(b)(2) of the Income Tax Regulations.

                                 ARTICLE VIII.
               INDEMNIFICATION, ESCROW AND HOLDERS' REPRESENTATIVE

         SECTION 8.1 Survival. Other than (i) the representations and warranties
of the Company and Public Sub in Sections 4.3, 4.12 and 4.24, and of the Parent
in Sections 5.5, 5.8 and 5.17, and the obligations under this Article VIII,
which shall survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect until the
expiration of the respective statute of limitations applicable to the underlying
claim and (ii) the representations and warranties of the Company and Public Sub
in Section 4.25, which shall survive the Merger and continue in full force and
effect until 5:00 p.m., California time, on the date which is the four-year
anniversary of the Closing Date, the representations, warranties, covenants,
obligations and agreements of the parties contained in this Agreement or in any
agreement, instrument or document delivered pursuant to or entered into in
connection with this Agreement shall survive the Merger and continue until 5:00
p.m., California time, on the date which is the earlier of (a) fifteen (15)
months after the Closing Date and (b) October 31, 2003 (the expiration date for
each representation, warranty, covenant, obligations or agreement is referred to
herein as the "Expiration Date"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time
prior to the Expiration Date, any Parent Indemnitee delivers to the Holders'
Representative or any Company Indemnitee delivers to Parent a written notice
asserting a claim for recovery under Sections 8.2 or 8.3 hereof, then the claim
asserted in such notice shall survive the Expiration Date until such time as
such claim is fully and finally resolved. The waiver of any condition based on
the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or the performance of or
compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to
indemnification set forth in this Article VIII or the right to any other remedy.

         SECTION 8.2 Indemnification by the Company Stockholders. Subject to the
limitations set forth herein, from and after the Effective Time, the
stockholders of the Company and the holders of CVC Warrants will on a several
(not joint) and pro rata basis based on the percentage of Merger Consideration
received by such stockholder or holder of a CVC Warrant defend and indemnify
Parent (and, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) and its Affiliates,
directors, officers, stockholders, successors and assigns (collectively, the
"Parent Indemnitees") against and hold each of them harmless from any and all
losses, liabilities, Taxes, claims, suits, proceedings, demands, judgments,
damages, expenses and costs, including, without limitation, reasonable counsel
fees, costs and expenses (collectively, "Losses") incurred in the investigation,
defense or settlement of any claims covered by this indemnity which any such
Parent Indemnitee may suffer or incur by reason of or against the inaccuracy or
breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or
agreements of the Company contained in this Agreement or any document,
certificate or agreement delivered pursuant hereto (the "Indemnifiable
Damages"). The stockholders of the Company and the holders of the CVC Warrants
shall be obligated to indemnify the Parent Indemnitees for Parent Indemnifiable
Damages pursuant to this Section 8.2 only if a claim for indemnification is made
by the Parent Indemnitees prior to the Expiration Date in the manner set forth
in Section 8.6 below. The stockholders of the Company and the holders of CVC
Warrants acknowledge that such Parent Indemnifiable Damages would relate to
unresolved contingencies existing at the Effective Time, which if resolved at
the Effective Time would have led to a reduction in the aggregate Merger
Consideration. The Parent Indemnitees shall not be entitled to assert any claim
for indemnification pursuant to this Section 8.2 (other than with respect to
Section 4.3, 4.24 or 4.25) unless and until the amount of Indemnifiable Damages
sustained by any such Parent Indemnitee with respect to any individual matter
exceeds $20,000. The stockholders of the Company and holders of CVC Warrants
shall not be obligated to indemnify any such Parent Indemnitee with respect to
any Indemnifiable Damages (other than Indemnifiable Damages arising out of or

Merger Agmt                          - 59 -
<PAGE>

related to the inaccuracy or breach of any of the representations and warranties
in Sections 4.3, 4.24 or 4.25) as to which any such Parent Indemnitee is
otherwise entitled to assert a claim for indemnification unless and until the
aggregate amount of the Indemnifiable Damages attributable to Parent Indemnitees
equals $1,500,000 (the "Basket Amount"); provided, however, that thereafter the
Indemnifying Party shall indemnify Parent Indemnitees for any amounts in excess
of, and not including, the Basket Amount. Other than with respect to
Indemnifiable Damages related to the inaccuracy or breach of any of the
representations and warranties contained in Sections 4.3, 4.24 or 4.25 (which
shall not be subject to any limitation), the aggregate liability of the
stockholders of the Company and the holders of CVC Warrants for Indemnifiable
Damages under this Section 8.2 shall be limited to Twenty Million Dollars
($20,000,000).

         SECTION 8.3 Indemnification by Parent. Subject to the limitations set
forth herein, from and after the Effective Time, Parent will defend and
indemnify each of the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time and its Affiliates, directors, officers, stockholders, successors
and assigns (collectively, the "Company Indemnitees") against and hold each of
them harmless from any and all Losses which any such Company Indemnitees may
suffer or incur by reason of (i) the inaccuracy or breach of any of the
representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or agreements of Parent
contained in this Agreement or any document, certificate or agreement delivered
pursuant hereto, (ii) the participation, at the request of Parent, of the
Company Indemnitees in any Financing Activities or any filing on behalf of
Parent in connection therewith, except, with respect to this subsection (ii), to
the extent that any Losses arise out of or are based upon the reliance on the
SEC Documents, the Company Financials or other information furnished by the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Company Indemnitee expressly for use by
Parent in connection with such Financing Activities or filings or the breach by
the Company of its obligations under the last sentence of Section 6.4(b) in
connection therewith, and (iii) the termination, at the request of Parent under
Section 6.9(c), of each Employee Plan that contains a cash or deferred
arrangement subject to Section 401(k) of the Code (the "Company Indemnifiable
Damages"). Parent shall be obligated to indemnify the Company Indemnitees for
Company Indemnifiable Damages pursuant to this Section 8.3 only if a claim for
indemnification is made by the Holders' Representatives on behalf of the Company
Indemnitees prior to the Expiration Date in the manner set forth in Section 8.6
below. The Company Indemnitees shall not be entitled to assert any claim for
indemnification pursuant to this Section 8.3 (other than with respect to
Sections 5.5, 5.8 and 5.17) unless and until the amount of the Indemnifiable
Damages sustained by such Company Indemnitee with respect to any individual
matter exceeds $20,000. Neither the Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall
be obligated to indemnify any Company Indemnitee with respect to any
Indemnifiable Damages (other than Indemnifiable Damages arising out of or
related to the inaccuracy or breach of any of the representations or warranties
in Sections 5.5, 5.18 and 5.17) as to which any such Company Indemnitee is
otherwise entitled to assert a claim for indemnification unless and until the
aggregate amount of the Indemnifiable Damages attributable to the Company
Indemnitees equals the Basket Amount; provided, however, that thereafter the
Indemnifying Party shall indemnify the Company Indemnitees for any amounts in
excess of, and not including, the Basket Amount. Other than Indemnifiable
Damages arising out of or related to the inaccuracy or breach of any of the
representations or warranties in Sections 5.5, 5.18 and 5.17, the aggregate
liability of Parent for Company Indemnifiable

Merger Agmt                          - 60 -
<PAGE>

Damages under this Section 8.3 shall be limited to Ten Million Dollars
($10,000,000). No Indemnifiable Damages shall in any event be deemed to have
occurred to the extent that the per share value of Parent Stock did not decline
below the Parent Stock Price as a result of such inaccuracy or breach, except
and only to the extent that the Indemnifiable Damages are Losses incurred in
connection with third-party claims against a Company Indemnitee.

         SECTION 8.4 Calculation of Indemnifiable Damages. In calculating the
amount of Indemnifiable Damages suffered or incurred by a party for which
indemnification is sought hereunder there shall be deducted the amount of (i)
any insurance or any recovery from a third party, paid or payable to such party
or otherwise inuring to the benefit of such party as a result of any such loss,
and (ii) any reduction in income taxes attributable to such Indemnifiable
Damages which directly or indirectly inures to the benefit of that party for any
tax year as a result of any such Indemnifiable Damages.

         SECTION 8.5 Sole Remedy. The foregoing indemnification provisions shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy from and after the Effective Time for all
claims for breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or
agreement contained herein or in any of the Schedules or Exhibits attached
hereto other than a suit for specific performance and other than claims of
willful misconduct.

         SECTION 8.6 Indemnification Procedures. Any Person making a claim
pursuant to Sections 8.2 or 8.3 above (an "Indemnified Party") shall make claims
for indemnification hereunder by giving written notice to the party from whom
the indemnification is sought (an "Indemnifying Party") and the Holders'
Representatives for such Indemnifying Party, if applicable, within the period in
which indemnification claims can be made hereunder. If indemnification is sought
for a claim or liability asserted by a third party, the Indemnified Party shall
also give written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party promptly after it
receives notice of the claim or liability being asserted, but the failure to do
so shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability except to the
extent that it is prejudiced by the failure or delay in giving such notice. Such
notice shall summarize the bases for the claim for indemnification and any claim
or liability being asserted by a third party. Within thirty (30) days after
receiving such notice the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to the
Indemnified Party stating whether it disputes the claim for indemnification and
whether it will defend against any third party claim or liability at its own
cost and expense. If the Indemnifying Party fails to give notice that it
disputes an indemnification claim within thirty (30) days after receipt of
notice thereof, it shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the claim,
which shall become immediately due and payable. The Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled to direct the defense against a third party claim or liability with
counsel selected by it (subject to the consent of the Indemnified Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) as long as the Indemnifying Party is
conducting a good faith and diligent defense. The Indemnified Party shall at all
times have the right to fully participate in the defense of a third party claim
or liability at its own expense directly or through counsel; provided, however,
that if the named parties to the action or proceeding include both the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified Party is
advised that representation of both parties by the same counsel would be
inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct, the
Indemnified Party may engage separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying
Party. If no such notice of intent to dispute and defend a third party claim or
liability is given by the Indemnifying Party, or if such good faith and diligent

Merger Agmt                          - 61 -
<PAGE>

defense is not being or ceases to be conducted by the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right, at the expense of the Indemnifying
Party, to undertake the defense of such claim or liability (with counsel
selected by the Indemnified Party), and, with the consent of the Indemnifying
Party, not to be unreasonably withheld, to compromise or settle it, exercising
reasonable business judgment. If the third party claim or liability is one that
by its nature cannot be defended solely by the Indemnifying Party, then the
Indemnified Party shall make available such information and assistance as the
Indemnifying Party may reasonably request and shall cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party in such defense, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party.

         SECTION 8.7 Holders' Representatives.

         (a) The adoption and approval of this Agreement by the Company's
stockholders shall constitute the approval and appointment of Joseph M.
Silvestri (the "CVC Representative") and R Steve Creamer (the "Management
Representative") (each a "Holders' Representative" and, collectively, the
"Holders' Representatives") to act for and on behalf of all stockholders of the
Company and all others receiving Merger Consideration hereunder with respect to
Section 3.3 and Article VIII of this Agreement and with respect to the Escrow
Agreement, as the attorney-in-fact and agent of all such persons, to, among
other things, give and receive notices and communications, to settle and
determine all claims for Indemnifiable Damages and determination of the
adjustment amounts under Section 3.3, to agree to, negotiate and enter into
settlements and compromises of, and comply with orders and decrees with respect
to such claims or adjustments, and to take all actions necessary or appropriate
in the judgment of such representative, for the accomplishment of the foregoing
(collectively, the "Permitted Acts"). A decision, act, consent or instruction of
the Holders' Representatives shall constitute a decision of all the stockholders
of the Company and other recipients of Merger Consideration and shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon each of the stockholders of the Company and other
recipients of Merger Consideration. For purposes of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement, any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Holders'
Representatives shall be based upon the affirmative consent or vote of all of
the persons then constituting the Holders' Representatives; provided that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if the Persons then
constituting the Holders' Representatives disagree on any decision, act, consent
or instruction, then the CVC Representative or the Management Representative
may, to the extent applicable, independently take any Permitted Act on behalf of
the stockholders and other recipients of Merger Consideration set forth on part
I of Schedule 8.7 (the "CVC Group"), with respect to the CVC Representative, and
on behalf of the stockholders and other recipients of Merger Consideration set
forth on part II of Schedule 8.7 (the "Management Group"), with respect to the
Management Representative, with respect to the portion of any claim of
Indemnifiable Damages or the portion of the Escrow Amount attributable to the
CVC Group or the Management Group, as applicable, based upon the relative
percentage of Merger Consideration received by the CVC Group and the Management
Group, as applicable. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Holders' Representatives shall have full power and authority, on behalf of the
Company stockholders and other recipients of Merger Consideration that they
represent, and their successors, to interpret all the terms and provisions of
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and to dispute or fail to dispute any
claim of Indemnifiable Damages made by a Parent Indemnitee, to negotiate and
compromise any dispute which may arise under this Agreement, to sign any
releases or other documents with respect to any such dispute, and to authorize
delivery of any Escrow Amounts.

         (b) Each Holders' Representative, or any successor hereafter appointed,
may resign and shall be discharged of his or her duties hereunder upon the
appointment of a successor Holders' Representative as hereinafter provided. In
case of such resignation, or in the event of the death or inability to act of a
Holders' Representative, a successor shall be named by a the holders of a
majority of Parent Stock held by the group which such Holders' Representative
represents pursuant to Section 8.7 hereof. Each such successor Holders'
Representative shall have all the power, authority, rights and privileges hereby
conferred upon the original Holders' Representative, and the term "Holders'
Representative" as used herein shall be deemed to include such successor
Holders' Representative.

         (c) In performing any of its duties under this Agreement or under the
Escrow Agreement, or upon the claimed failure to perform its duties hereunder or
thereunder, the Holders' Representatives shall not be liable to the Company
stockholders or anyone else for any Indemnifiable Damages, losses or expenses
which they may incur as a result of any act, or failure to act under this
Agreement; provided, however, that the Holders' Representatives shall be liable
for Indemnifiable Damages arising out of actions or omissions that both (i) were
taken or omitted not in good faith and (ii) constituted willful default or gross
negligence under this Agreement. Accordingly, the Holders' Representatives shall
not incur any such Liability with respect to (i) any action taken or omitted to
be taken in good faith upon advice of his or her counsel given with respect to
any questions relating to the duties and responsibilities of the Holders'
Representatives hereunder; or (ii) any action taken or omitted to be taken in
reliance upon any document, including any written notice or instructions
provided for in this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, not only as to its due
execution and to the validity and effectiveness of its provisions, but also as
to the truth and accuracy of any information contained therein, which the
Holders' Representatives shall in good faith believe to be genuine, to have been
signed or presented by the purported proper person or persons and to conform
with the provisions of this Agreement. The limitation of liability provisions of
this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement and the resignation of the Holders' Representatives. The CVC Group
shall on a several (not joint) and pro rata basis based on the percentage of
Merger Consideration received by such member of the CVC Group indemnify the CVC
Holders' Representative and hold the CVC Holders' Representative harmless
against any loss, liability or expense (including any expenses of legal counsel
retained by the CVC Holders' Representative) incurred without willful default,
gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the CVC Holders' Representatives
and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of his
or her duties hereunder. The Management Group shall on a several (not joint) and
pro rata basis based on the percentage of Merger Consideration received by such
member of the Management Group indemnify the Management Holders' Representative
and hold the Management Holders' Representative harmless against any loss,
liability or expense (including any expenses of legal counsel retained by the
Management Holders' Representative) incurred without willful default, gross
negligence or bad faith on the part of the Management Holders' Representatives

or her duties hereunder.

         (a) by mutual written consent of Parent, Sub, the Company and Public
Sub;

         (b) by either Parent or the Company:

                  (i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated by October
         31, 2002; provided that the terminating party shall not have breached
         in any material respect its obligations under this Agreement in any
         manner that shall have proximately contributed to the failure to
         consummate the Merger by such date;

                  (ii) if any court or Governmental Authority of competent
         jurisdiction shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any
         other action permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise
         prohibiting the Transactions and such order, decree or ruling or other
         action shall have become final and nonappealable; provided, however,
         that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
         9.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to any party who has not used its
         reasonable best efforts to cause such order, decree or ruling to be
         lifted; or

                  (iii) on or after the date that is thirty (30) days following
         (X) the expiration or termination (other than by Parent) of the
         Commitments or (Y) the date on which the Company and the Holders'
         Representatives receive or are deemed to have received a Financing
         Notification indicating that Parent is unwilling to complete a
         Commitment Financing due to the fact that such financing has become a
         Termination Financing, in each case unless an alternate Commitment
         Financing has been put in place prior to the end of such thirty (30)
         days in accordance with the terms of Section 6.15 hereof.

         (c) by Parent if (i) the representations and warranties of the Company
and Public Sub contained in this Agreement shall not be true in any respect
(without giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality," "material adverse
effect," or similar qualifying language set forth therein), except to the extent
that any breach (either individually or in the aggregate with all other such
breaches) would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company or (ii) the Company or Public Sub shall have failed to perform in
any material respect any obligation or to comply in any material respect with
any agreement or covenant of the Company or Public Sub to be performed or
complied with by them under this Agreement, in each case such that the
conditions set forth in Sections 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) would not be satisfied, and,
in the case of (i) such untruth or incorrectness cannot be or has not been cured
within 20 days after the giving of written notice to the Company and the Public
Sub, and, in the case of (ii) such failure cannot be or has not been cured
within 10 days after the giving of written notice to the Company and the Public
Sub;

         (d) by Parent if there has been a change, event or condition of any
character (whether or not covered by insurance) which, in the aggregate, has had
or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company;

         (e) by the Company if (i) the representations and warranties of Parent
or the Sub contained in this Agreement shall not be true in any respect (without
giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality," "material adverse effect,"

Merger Agmt                          - 64 -

or similar qualifying language set forth therein), except to the extent that any
breach (either individually or in the aggregate with all other such breaches)
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent; or
(ii) Parent or the Sub shall have failed to perform in any material respect any
obligation or to comply in any material respect with any agreement or covenant
of Parent or the Sub to be performed or complied with by them under this
Agreement, in each case such that the conditions set forth in Sections 7.3(a) or
7.3(b) would not be satisfied, and, in the case of (i) such untruth or
incorrectness cannot be or has not been cured within 20 days after the giving of
written notice to Parent or the Sub, and, in the case of (ii) such failure
cannot be or has not been cured within 10 days after the giving of written
notice to Parent or the Sub;

         (f) by the Company if there has been a change, event or condition of
any character (whether or not covered by insurance) which, in the aggregate, has
had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent;
or

         (g) by the Company if the certified financial statements delivered
pursuant to Section 5.6(c) deviate from the Preliminary PWC Audited Financials
in a manner that is adverse to Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole
(provided, however, that the Company may not exercise its right of termination
pursuant to this Section 9.1(g) unless it provides notice of termination to
Parent within five (5) days after the delivery to the Company by Parent of such
financial statements).

         SECTION 9.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of a termination of
this Agreement, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no
liability or obligation on the part of Parent, the Sub, the Company or the
Public Sub or their respective officers or directors, except as provided in
Section 10.1; provided, however, that nothing herein shall relieve any party for
liability for any willful breach by a party hereto of its representations,
warranties, covenants, obligations or agreements.

         SECTION 9.3 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors at
any time before or after obtaining the approval of the Company's stockholders,
but after such stockholder approval no amendment shall be made which by law
requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without obtaining
such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

         SECTION 9.4 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Board of
Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto,
(ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (iii) waive compliance
with any of the covenants, obligations, agreements or conditions contained
herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf
of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its
rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those
rights.

         SECTION 10.3 Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement
to a Section or Article, such reference shall be to a Section or Article of this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect
in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be
deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

         SECTION 10.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and
shall only become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties and delivered to the other parties.

         SECTION 10.5 Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except for
the Confidentiality Letter, this Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedules,
the Annexes and Exhibits thereto) constitutes the entire agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof; provided, however, that
it is expressly agreed that the Transactions do not violate any provision of the
Confidentiality Letter. This Agreement is not intended to confer upon any person
other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder; provided that it
is intended that the Charter Indemnified Parties and the Company Indemnities are
third-party beneficiaries with respect to the provisions of Section 6.6 and
Article VIII hereof, respectively.

         SECTION 10.6 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Utah, regardless of the
laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of
laws thereof; provided that any questions regarding interpretation of provisions
of the DGCL, including with respect to Articles II and III hereof, shall be
governed by the laws of the State of Delaware.

         SECTION 10.7 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that the
Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and
obligations under this Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent of any
of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the
parties and their respective successors and assigns.

         SECTION 10.8 Severability. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law,
or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic and legal
substance of the Transactions are not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
Transactions may be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

         SECTION 10.9 Enforcement of This Agreement. The parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction, such remedy being in addition to
any other remedy to which any party is entitled at law or in equity. Nothing in
this Agreement shall impair the right of any party to compel specific
performance by another party of its obligations under this Agreement.

         SECTION 10.10 Obligations of Subsidiaries. Whenever this Agreement
requires any Subsidiary of Parent (including the Sub) or of the Company to take
any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the
part of Parent or the Company, as the case may be, to cause such Subsidiary to
take such action.

         SECTION 10.11 Waiver of Right to Jury Trial. THE COMPANY, THE PUBLIC
SUB, THE PARENT AND THE SUB HEREBY WAIVE, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION IN ANY COURT WITH RESPECT TO, IN CONNECTION
WITH, OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER AGREEMENT CONTEMPLATED HEREBY
OR THE VALIDITY, PROTECTION, INTERPRETATION, COLLECTION OR ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.
