LICENSE-BACK AGREEMENT

  



  

This License-Back Agreement and its Exhibits (this " _Agreement_ "), is
entered into on March 3, 2017 (the " _Effective Date_ ") between Cardinal
Health 414, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the " _Buyer_ "), and
Navidea Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Seller_ ").
Buyer and Seller are each individually referred to herein as a " _Party_ "
and are collectively referred to herein as the " _Parties_ ".

  



  

INTRODUCTION

  



  

The Parties have entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated November 23,
2016 (the " _APA_ "), under which, among other things, the Parties agreed
that at Closing, Buyer and Seller would execute and deliver to each other a
License-Back Agreement.

  



  

The Parties agree that this Agreement is the License-Back Agreement as
contemplated under the APA.

  



  

The Parties also intend for this Agreement to set forth certain rights and
obligations with respect to the Licensed IP, including rights and
obligations with respect to the prosecution, maintenance, enforcement and
defense of the Licensed IP.

  



  

All capitalized terms not defined in this Agreement have the meanings given
to them in the APA.

  



  

In consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement and the APA and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties,
intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

  



   | 1.| _License Grant_ 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 1.1| _License Grant_. Buyer hereby grants to Seller a perpetual
(except as provided in Sections 5.2 and 5.3), transferable and royalty-
free license to use the Intellectual Property Rights included in the Acquired
Assets and owned by Buyer as of the Effective Date (the " _Licensed IP_ ")
only to the extent reasonably necessary for Seller to do any of the following
which would otherwise infringe the Licensed IP but for the grant of this
license (together, the " _Field_ "): 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| on an exclusive basis (subject to Section 1.9),
develop, manufacture, market, sell and distribute new pharmaceutical and
other products that are not Competing Products (collectively, "
_New Products_ "); and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| on a non-exclusive basis, develop, manufacture, market, sell and
distribute the Business Product anywhere in the world except in the Territory
(the " _Licensed Territory_ ") (such Business Product manufactured, marketed,
sold or distributed in the Licensed Territory, the " _Ex-America Product_ "). 
---|---|--- 
  



  

As used in this Agreement, a " _Competing Product_ " is any pharmaceutical or
other product that: (i) accumulates in lymphatic tissue or tumor-draining
lymph nodes for the purpose of (A) lymphatic mapping or (B) identifying the
existence, location or staging of cancer in a body; (ii) provides for or
facilitates any test or procedure that is reasonably substitutable for any
test or procedure provided for or facilitated by the Business Product; or
(iii) is marketed for unapproved uses that allow such product to compete with
the Business Product.

  



  

   

 | | 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | 1.2| _Buyer 's Restricted Use_. During the term of this Agreement,
subject to Section 1.9, Buyer agrees not to use the Intellectual Property
Rights included in the Acquired Assets to develop, manufacture, market,
sell or distribute any product other than the Business Product or any other
product that (a) accumulates in lymphatic tissue or tumor-draining lymph
nodes for the purpose of (i) lymphatic mapping or (ii) identifying the
existence, location or staging of cancer in a body, or (b) provides for or
facilitates any test or procedure that is reasonably substitutable for any
test or procedure provided for or facilitated by the Business Product. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 1.3| _Sublicenses_. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| The license granted under Section 1.1 (the " _License Grant_ ")
may be sublicensed to any third party with prior written notice to Buyer,
provided that Seller shall ensure that any sublicense of the License Grant
that it (or its sublicensee) enters into (a " _Sublicense_ "): 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| contains terms no less protective of Buyer's rights than those
set forth in this Agreement; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| if the sublicensee is a sublicensee of the Licensed IP with
respect to the New Products, expressly prohibits the sublicensee from
manufacturing, marketing, selling or distributing any Competing Products and
expressly provides Seller with a right to terminate the Sublicense in the
event the sublicensee fails to comply with such prohibition; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iii)| is not in conflict with this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| Seller shall and shall ensure that its sublicensees provide Buyer
with a complete electronic or paper copy of each Sublicense within thirty
(30) days after execution of the Sublicense. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| Seller shall be fully responsible and liable to Buyer for any
breach of the terms of this Agreement or any sublicense by its sublicensees
(or its sublicensees' sublicensees). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (d)| In the event any sublicensee manufactures, markets, sells or
distributes any Competing Products, in addition to exercising any termination
rights it may have under the relevant sublicense, Seller shall immediately:
(i) notify Buyer in writing, including providing Buyer with all information
regarding the Competing Products sold or distributed by the sublicensee as
requested by Buyer; and (ii) pay to Buyer an amount equal to two times (2x)
Buyer's then-current list price of the Business Product in the Territory (as
of the date of Seller's notice under clause (i)) for each Competing Product
that the sublicensee has sold or distributed. Seller acknowledges that in the
event a Seller sublicensee sells or distributes any Competing Product, the
damages which Buyer will sustain may be difficult to ascertain and such amount
in clause (ii) is reasonable, does not constitute a penalty, and Seller shall
not contest the reasonableness of such amount in any Action commenced by
either Party with respect to this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | 2| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | 1.4| _Seller Marks_. _Exhibit A_ to this Agreement sets forth the
Contracts (the " _Existing Licenses_ ") under which Seller has committed, as
of the date of the APA, to license the trademarks identified in the
exhibit (the " _Licensed Marks_ ") to the distributors identified in the
exhibit (the " _Licensed Distributors_ ") for the purpose of using such
Licensed Marks in connection with marketing, selling and distributing the Ex-
America Products in one or more jurisdictions of the Licensed Territory.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer hereby grants to
Seller a non-transferable and royalty-free nonexclusive right to allow the
Licensed Distributors to use the Licensed Marks only for the purpose of
marketing, selling and distributing the Ex-America Products in one or more
jurisdictions of the Licensed Territory, subject to the terms and conditions
of the Existing Licenses and this Section 1.4). Except as expressly set forth
in the foregoing license grant (" _Trademark License_ "), nothing in this
Agreement grants or confers to Seller (or its distributors) any right, title
or interest in or to the Seller Marks or any goodwill associated with the
Seller Marks (notwithstanding that they form part of the Acquired Assets) and
Seller and its distributors have no right to use the Seller Marks in any
other manner, for any other purpose or in any other territory. In addition,
nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as limiting, preventing, or
restricting, in any manner, Buyer's right to use, to license any third
party to use, or to register the Seller Marks in any manner whatsoever
anywhere in the world. Except pursuant to the Existing Licenses, Seller shall
not at any time make any commitments or grant any rights with respect to the
Seller Marks without the prior written consent of Buyer. Without limiting the
foregoing: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| Seller shall ensure that the Licensed Marks are not used by any
Licensed Distributors in a manner that would disparage, tarnish, or dilute
the distinctive quality of the Licensed Marks or the reputation or goodwill
represented by the Licensed Marks or which would reflect adversely on the
Seller Marks, Buyer or its Affiliates, the Ex-America Products or any other
products or services of Buyer or its Affiliates; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| Seller shall, to the extent permitted by the applicable Existing
License (or, if not permitted by the applicable Existing License, Seller
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to), cause the Licensed
Distributor, upon reasonable advance notice, to allow Seller and its
designees (including Buyer and its Affiliates) to access and inspect any
and all of the Licensed Distributor's facilities and to inspect, copy and
audit the Licensed Distributor's books and records, in each case, to the
extent related to the Licensed Distributor's use of any of the Licensed Marks
and to confirm that the Licensed Marks are not used or planned to be used by
the Licensed Distributor in any manner that would or could reasonably be
expected to result in a violation of Section 1.4(a); 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | 3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | (c)| without limiting any rights or remedies available to Buyer, in
the event Seller or its distributors use any Seller Marks outside the scope
or in contravention of the Trademark License or this Section 1.4, Seller
shall turn over to Buyer all revenues derived from such unauthorized use and
promptly withdraw the relevant product and materials from the market in
consultation with Buyer; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (d)| Seller shall not modify the Licensed Marks in any form or manner
unless approved in advance in writing by Buyer; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (e)| Seller shall pass through to Buyer any royalties paid by a
Licensed Distributor to Seller to the extent expressly attributable to a
license of the Licensed Marks and not attributable to any other rights
licensed by Seller to the Licensed Distributor; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (f)| to the extent Seller or its distributors market, distribute or
sell any New Products or Ex-America Products not covered by the Trademark
License under this Agreement, such New Products and Ex-America Products shall
be: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| marketed, distributed and sold under a different trademark,
service mark, service names, brand, trade dress and logos than any Seller
Marks, including "Lymphoseek®"; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| otherwise differentiated from the Seller Marks, including
"Lymphoseek®" and the Business Product, to ensure that end customers in the
Licensed Territory and other third parties could not reasonably confuse
or substitute such New Products or Ex-America Products for the Business
Product or Seller Marks. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Without limiting any other remedies or rights that may be available to Buyer
(including under Section 7.4), Buyer may immediately terminate the Trademark
License upon written notice to Seller if Seller breaches this Section 1.4 and
fails to remedy such breach within 30 days after receiving notice of
the breach by Buyer; provided that (A) if the breach is attributable solely
to a particular Licensed Distributor, then such termination shall apply only
with respect to such Licensed Distributor and the Trademark License will
remain in full force and effect with respect to Seller and each other
Licensed Distributor, and (B) if the breach is attributable solely to Seller,
then such termination shall apply only with respect to Seller and the
Trademark License (as a pass through to each Licensed Distributor) will
remain in full force and effect with respect to each Licensed Distributor as
long as such Licensed Distributor grants Buyer the right as an express third
party beneficiary to enforce Seller's rights under the applicable Existing
License.

  



  

   

 | 4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | 1.5| _Patent Marking_. Seller shall mark any and all New Products and
Ex-America Products in accordance with the applicable patent marking laws.
Seller shall be responsible for all monetary and legal liabilities arising
from or caused by failure to abide by applicable patent marking laws and any
type of incorrect or improper patent marking for any New Products or Ex-
America Products. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 1.6| _Government Rights_. Seller acknowledges and agrees that the
License Grant shall be subject to any rights or duties to the applicable
Governmental Authorities or any academic institutions if the Intellectual
Property Rights were created or invented in the course of government-funded
or academic institution-funded research or using government or
academic institution resources or personnel prior to the Effective Date, and
Seller agrees that it would be subject to such rights and duties. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 1.7| _Permission to Reference Data_. Seller shall not have the right
to use, reference, modify, amend or supplement any of the Product
Registrations (and Buyer shall not be obligated to permit any such use,
reference, modification, amendment or supplement), _except that_ Seller shall
have the right to reference data in IND 061757 and NDA 202207 only to the
extent reasonably necessary for Seller to develop, manufacture, market, sell
or distribute New Products under one or more new product registrations. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 1.8| _Costs and Expenses_. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| Seller shall be responsible for all costs and expenses incurred
by or on behalf of Buyer in connection with Seller's exercise of its rights
under this Agreement, including any costs and expenses incurred by or on
behalf of Buyer if Seller submits any new IND, NDA, clinical trial or other
product registration or references Buyer's data as described in Section 1.7. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| Buyer may invoice Seller any costs and expenses payable under
this Agreement and Seller shall pay each invoice within 30 days of the date
of each invoice. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 1.9| _Breach of License Grant_. If Seller markets, sells or
distributes the Business Product or any Competing Product in the Territory
and Seller fails to cure such breach to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction within
30 days of Buyer's notice to Seller (or if such cure cannot reasonably be
accomplished within such original 30-day period, and Seller notifies Buyer in
writing within such 30-day period of Seller's intention and proposed steps to
cure and thereafter diligently pursues the same, then Seller will have such
additional period of time (not to exceed 60 days following expiration of the
original 30-day period) as is necessary to accomplish such cure), then,
without limiting any other remedies or rights that may be available to Buyer
(including under Section 7.4), upon notice from Buyer to Seller, (a) the
exclusive license granted to Seller under Section 1.1(a) shall be converted
to a non-exclusive license, and Buyer's obligations and Seller's rights under
Sections 1.2, 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6 shall no longer apply and (b) Seller shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause Buyer to receive the same or
substantially similar rights, on a non-exclusive basis, as Seller currently
has under the License Agreement between Seller and the University for
Case No. SD1998-088, effective July 14, 2014, which contemplates a field of
use for all diagnostic, detection and therapeutic uses in targeting of CD206
receptor positive cells, excluding diagnostic uses covered by license
agreement #2002-03-0237. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | 2.| _Ownership, Prosecution, Defense and Enforcement of Licensed IP_ 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 2.1| _No Other Rights_. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
interpreted as conferring by implication, estoppel or otherwise any license
or rights under any Intellectual Property Rights or other rights, other than
those expressly granted under the License Grant. Seller acknowledges and
agrees that Buyer has no obligation to deliver or furnish to Seller
any information, materials or items other than those set forth in this
Agreement or the APA. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 2.2| _Ownership_. Subject to the License Grant, Buyer shall remain
the sole and exclusive owner of any and all right, title and interest in and
to the Licensed IP, and all modifications, improvements, enhancements, and
derivative works of the Licensed IP created, conceived, discovered, first
reduced to practice or invented by or on behalf of Buyer. Seller shall not,
and shall not direct or aid any third party to, attack, dispute, or otherwise
challenge Buyer's ownership of or the validity of the Licensed IP. Subject to
Buyer's ownership in and to the Licensed IP, Seller shall remain the sole
and exclusive owner of any and all right, title and interest in and to any
modifications, improvements, enhancements, and derivative works of the
Licensed IP created, conceived, discovered, first reduced to practice or
invented by or on behalf of Seller, provided that Seller shall not, at any
time during the term of this Agreement or thereafter, file or have filed any
patent applications that claim priority to any Licensed IP except with the
prior written consent of Buyer (which may be reasonably withheld by Buyer). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 2.3| _Buyer 's Prosecution, Defense and Enforcement Rights_. Without
limiting the foregoing but subject to Buyer's obligations under Section 2.4,
Buyer shall retain the sole right and full discretion to determine the
protection mechanism of the Licensed IP and to file, record, prosecute,
abandon prosecution of, maintain, discontinue maintenance of and/or defend or
enforce its right, title and interest in and to any and all Licensed IP.
Buyer shall be entitled to any and all recovery or settlement received in
connection with any suit or claim initiated or pursued by Buyer. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 2.4| _Seller 's Prosecution Rights_. Seller may from time to time
consult with Buyer (or Buyer's external patent counsel) regarding the filing,
prosecution or maintenance of any patents or patent applications that form
part of the Licensed IP and comment on all relevant material matters related
to prosecution of the Licensed IP that include claims of a scope that in
whole or in part are directed to the Field. Buyer shall reasonably consider
any such comments provided by Seller, and Buyer will within a reasonable time
either: 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | 6| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | (a)| implement such comments received from Seller itself (or direct
its external patent counsel to do so), at Seller's sole cost and expense
(including legal fees and filing, prosecution and maintenance fees) and in a
manner as reasonably determined by Buyer having regard to how Seller's
comments may affect any claims directed in whole or in part to the Business
or the Business Product. Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably informed regarding
matters related to the implementation of Seller's comments under this clause
(a) and shall, without limitation: (i) provide (or direct its external patent
counsel to provide) Seller with access to copies of all material
documentation and correspondence relating to the filing, prosecution
and maintenance of the relevant Licensed IP so that Seller may remain
informed with respect thereto; and (ii) give Seller, at Seller's expense,
reasonable opportunity to consult with Buyer (or its external patent counsel)
regarding such filing, prosecution, maintenance and to comment on all
relevant material matters related to prosecution of the Licensed IP with
claims of a scope that in whole or in part are directed to the Field. Seller
shall, at its sole cost and expense, provide all reasonable assistance to
Buyer, as requested by Buyer, to assist Buyer in implementing Seller's
comments under this clause (a); or 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| authorize Seller to implement such comments itself, in which case
Seller shall be completely responsible for the prosecution of the relevant
Licensed IP, and all related costs and expenses (including legal fees and
filing, prosecution and maintenance fees). Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably
informed regarding matters related to its prosecution activities under this
clause (b) and shall, without limitation: (i) provide (or direct its external
patent counsel to provide) Buyer with access to copies of all material
documentation and correspondence relating to the filing, prosecution and
maintenance of the Licensed IP so that Buyer may remain informed with respect
thereto; and (ii) give Buyer, at Buyer's expense, reasonable opportunity to
consult with Seller (or its external patent counsel) regarding such filing,
prosecution, maintenance and to comment on all relevant material matters
related to prosecution of the Licensed IP (particularly, but without
limitation, to matters that may affect any claims directed to the Business or
the Business Product), provide input on the drafting of any claims and
amendments to claims and review draft responses prior to filing with
Governmental Authorities, such that Buyer is given a reasonable opportunity
to provide meaningful input in advance of any applicable deadlines. Seller
shall ensure that all comments by Buyer are reasonably considered by Seller
and its prosecuting counsel and shall implement any comments by Buyer that
relate to the Business or the Business Product. Buyer shall, at Seller's sole
cost and expense, provide all reasonable assistance to Seller and provide and
execute all documents prepared and reasonably requested by Seller, to assist
Seller in exercising its rights under this clause (b). 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | 7| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Buyer's decision to implement Seller's comments under clause (a) or authorize
Seller to implement such comments itself under clause (b) shall be made in
consultation with Seller, having reasonable regard to the subject matter,
scope and territory of the Licensed IP, the nature of the proposed
prosecution activities, Seller's interests in protecting its rights with
respect to the Field and Buyer's interests in protecting its rights with
respect to the Business Product and Business.

  



   | 2.5| _Abandonment of Licensed IP_. In the event Buyer elects, in its
sole discretion, not to pursue, maintain or retain a particular patent or
patent application that forms part of the Licensed IP, Buyer shall so notify
Seller and, subject to the rights of relevant Governmental Authorities and
any other contractual obligations to research sponsors, Buyer will authorize
Seller to assume the filing, prosecution and/or maintenance of such patent or
patent application in Buyer's name or Seller's name, at Seller's option, and
at Seller's sole cost and expense, and such notification will be
in reasonable time for Seller to satisfy any agency or judicial requirements.
In such event, Buyer shall provide to Seller any authorization necessary to
permit Seller to pursue and/or maintain such patent right, on such economic
and other terms as the Parties shall mutually agree. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 2.6| _Defense and Enforcement of Licensed IP_. The Parties shall keep
each other informed of any alleged infringement by a third party of the
Licensed IP in the Field and any legal or administrative action by any third
party against the Licensed IP in the Field, including any oppositions,
interference, derivation, revocation, reexamination, _inter partes_ review,
post-grant review, nullity action, compulsory license proceeding, or
declaratory judgment action (" _Invalidity Action_ "). Any defense of an
Invalidity Action by Seller shall be governed by this Section 2.6. Seller may
defend or enforce any Licensed IP with the prior written consent of Buyer,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the event Buyer
provides Seller with written consent to defend or enforce any Licensed IP,
Seller shall defend or enforce the Licensed IP at Seller's sole cost and
expense, shall keep Buyer reasonably informed regarding matters related to
its activities under this Section 2.6 and, without limitation: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| provide (or direct its external counsel to provide) Buyer with
access to copies of all material documentation and correspondence relating to
the defense and enforcement so that Buyer may remain informed with respect
thereto; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| give Buyer reasonable opportunity to consult with Seller (or its
external counsel) regarding such defense and enforcement and to comment on
all relevant material matters related to defense and enforcement of the
Licensed IP (particularly but without limiting to matters that may affect any
claims directed in whole or in part to the Business or the Business
Product) and provide input on strategy, filings and selection and use of
outside counsel; and 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | 8| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | (c)| ensure that all comments by Buyer are reasonably considered by
Seller and its counsel and shall implement any and all comments provided by
Buyer that relate to the Business or the Business Product. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Buyer shall, at Seller's request and sole cost and expense, provide all
reasonable assistance to Seller, provide and execute all documents prepared
and reasonably requested by Seller and, if required, join Seller as a party
plaintiff in the relevant suit, to assist Seller in exercising its rights
under this Section 2.6. Buyer may also voluntarily join Seller as a party
plaintiff in any related suit with counsel of its choice, and Seller hereby
authorizes Buyer to do so. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing, Seller
shall not waive, release, settle or compromise any claim or make any
admission as to Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates, without the prior
written approval of Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. Any recovery or settlement derived from any suit or claim initiated
or pursued by Seller under this Section 2.6 shall first be applied to the
Parties' costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, in connection
therewith, and any balance remaining shall then be divided equally between the
Parties.

  



   | 3.| _Supply of New Products and Ex-America Products to Buyer_ 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 3.1| _Right of First Offer_. If at any time during the term of this
Agreement, Seller decides to market, launch, sell or distribute any New
Product, Seller shall immediately notify Buyer in writing (the " _Offer
Notice_ "). Except pursuant to a right of first offer granted pursuant to any
of the Contracts listed in _Exhibit B_ (each, a " _Superior ROFO_ "), Seller
shall not offer any third party a right to market, sell and/or distribute the
New Product until at least sixty (60) days after the Offering Notice is given
to Buyer (plus the amount of time in which any Licensed Distributor has to
exercise a Superior ROFO). Following Buyer's receipt of the Offer Notice, at
Buyer's option, which Buyer may exercise in its sole discretion, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith the terms that will apply to Buyer's marketing,
selling and/or distribution of such New Product (the " _Distribution
Agreement_ "), subject to Section 3.2 and provided that (i) Buyer may
terminate the negotiations at any time, and (ii) Seller may terminate the
negotiations in the event a Licensed Distributor exercises the same right
under a Superior ROFO. If the Parties, despite their good faith negotiations
are unable to agree to a Distribution Agreement during such 60-day period, as
extended (or such other period as mutually agreed to by the Parties), or
Buyer or Seller terminates the negotiations as provided above, Seller shall
have the right to market, launch, sell and distribute the New Product without
restriction hereunder. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 3.2| _Most Favored Customer_. Seller acknowledges and agrees that the
terms and conditions under which Seller may grant Buyer a right to market,
sell or distribute any New Product under a Distribution Agreement, including
the amounts payable by Buyer under the Distribution Agreement (the "
_Distribution Terms_ "), shall be at least as favorable as the terms granted
by Seller to its other distributors, customers or resellers of the New Product
in the country in which Buyer intends to market, sell or distribute the New
Product (if applicable), under agreements signed before, on or after the
effective date of the Distribution Agreement and to whom Seller provides
products similar to the New Product. If the terms granted by Seller to
another one of its distributors, customers or resellers are, considering the
foregoing, more favorable than the terms under the Distribution Terms (such
as if the amounts payable by the Seller's other distributors, customers or
resellers are lower than the amounts payable by Buyer), then the Distribution
Agreement shall be retrospectively amended to provide Buyer with the benefit
of such more favorable terms on and from the first date on which such more
favorable terms first became effective for Seller's other distributors,
customers or resellers. Every six (6) months commencing from the effective
date of the Distribution Agreement, Seller shall certify in writing to Buyer
that it has complied with this Section. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | 9| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | 3.3| _No Obligation_. Without limiting Buyer's rights under Section
3.1 or 3.2, nothing in this Agreement shall create an obligation on Buyer to
market, launch, buy, sell, supply, resell or distribute any New Products or
Ex-America Products. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 4.| _UCSD Patents_ 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 4.1| _Definitions_. For the purpose of this Section 4 only, any
capitalized terms which have not been defined in this Agreement have the
meanings given to them in the UCSD License Agreements (defined below). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 4.2| _Background_. Each of the Parties has entered into a license
agreement with The Regents of the University of California (the "
_University_ "), represented by its San Diego campus (the " _UCSD
License Agreements_ "), for the license of the University's rights in any of
the following: (a) the US patent application (serial number 09/569,466,
titled "MACROMOLECULAR CARRIER FOR DRUG AND DIAGNOSTIC AGENT DELIVERY")
disclosing and claiming the Invention, filed by Inventor and assigned to the
University; (b) continuing applications thereof including
divisions, substitutions, and continuations-in-part (but only to the extent
the claims thereof are entirely supported in the specification and entitled
to the priority date of the parent application), and (c) any patents issuing
on said applications including reissues, reexaminations and extensions; and
any corresponding foreign applications or patents. Under such UCSD License
Agreements, Buyer and Seller have separately agreed to reimburse the
University for certain Patent Costs and have been granted certain rights
with respect to the infringement and defense of Patent Rights. This Section 4
is intended to set forth each Party's rights and obligations as between Buyer
and Seller, with respect to the matters described in the foregoing sentence.
The Parties acknowledge that nothing in this Agreement is intended to affect
or limit the rights of the University under the UCSD License Agreements. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | 10| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | 4.3| _Maintenance Fees_. As between Buyer and Seller: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| Seller shall be responsible for any and all out-of-pocket
expenses for the maintenance of all patents filed in the Licensed Territory
(as defined in Section 1.1(b) of this Agreement) included in the Patent
Rights, and Seller shall ensure that all such expenses are reimbursed to the
University in accordance with the terms of its UCSD License Agreement; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| Buyer shall be responsible for any and all out-of-pocket expenses
for the maintenance of all patents filed in the Territory (as defined in the
APA) included in the Patent Rights, and Buyer shall ensure that all such
expenses are reimbursed to the University in accordance with the terms of its
UCSD License Agreement; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| any other Patent Costs that are required to be reimbursed under
the UCSD License Agreement shall be allocated between the Parties in
accordance with a written amendment to this Agreement executed by both
Parties.

   | 4.4| _Enforcement and Defense of UCSD Patents_. Each Party may
exercise its rights and fulfill its obligations with respect to the
infringement, enforcement and defense of any Patent Rights (including with
respect to Invalidity Actions relating to the Patent Rights) in accordance
with its respective UCSD License Agreement, and without any obligation to the
other Party except as set forth in this Section 4.4. Seller may not defend or
enforce any Patent Rights under its UCSD License Agreement (including but not
limited to the defense of Invalidity Actions), except with the prior written
consent of Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the
event Buyer provides Seller with written consent to defend or enforce any
such Patent Rights and Seller is permitted to defend or enforce the Patent
Rights under its UCSD License Agreement, Seller shall defend or enforce the
Patent Rights at Seller's sole cost and expense, shall keep Buyer reasonably
informed regarding matters related to its activities under this Section
4.4 and shall, without limitation: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| provide (or direct its external counsel to provide) Buyer with
access to copies of all material documentation and correspondence relating to
the defense and enforcement so that Buyer may remain informed with respect
thereto; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| give Buyer reasonable opportunity to consult with Seller (or its
external counsel) regarding such defense and enforcement and to comment on
all relevant material matters related to defense and enforcement of the
Licensed IP (particularly but not limited to such matters that may affect the
Business or the Business Product) and provide input on strategy, filings
and selection and use of outside counsel; and 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | 11| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | (c)| ensure that all comments by Buyer are reasonably considered by
Seller and its counsel and shall implement any and all comments by Buyer
which relate to the Business or the Business Product. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 4.5| If permitted by the University, Buyer may voluntarily join Seller
in the suit initiated by Seller with counsel of Buyer's choice at Buyer's
sole cost. If necessary to maintain a lawsuit initiated by Seller,
Buyer will, at Seller's sole cost, join Seller in any infringement suit
necessary to enforce Seller's rights. Notwithstanding anything in the
foregoing, Seller shall not waive, release, settle or compromise any such
claim or make any admission as to Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates, without the
prior written approval of Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 5.| _Term And Termination_ 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 5.1| _Term_. The term of the Agreement shall commence as of the
Effective Date and shall continue perpetually unless terminated in accordance
with Section 5.2 or 5.3. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 5.2| _Termination by Buyer_. Without limiting any other rights or
remedies that may be available to Buyer, Buyer may terminate this Agreement

Person acting under direction of Seller or any such Affiliate, directly or
indirectly, files or takes any action to challenge any of Buyer's or its
Affiliate's rights in the Licensed IP or any University-owned patent licensed
under the UCSD License Agreements in the Territory, and Seller fails to
reverse and cure the challenge to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction within 30
days of Buyer's notice to Seller (or if such reversal and cure cannot
reasonably be accomplished within such original 30-day period, and
Seller notifies Buyer in writing within such 30-day period of Seller's
intention and proposed steps to reverse and cure and thereafter diligently
pursues the same, then Seller will have such additional period of time (not to
exceed 60 days following expiration of the original 30-day period) as is
necessary to accomplish such reversal and cure). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 5.3| _Termination by Seller_. Seller may terminate this Agreement
upon at least 90 days' written notice to Buyer, provided that such notice
shall state Seller's reason for terminating this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 5.4| _Effect of Termination_. Upon termination of this Agreement for
any reason: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| neither Party's obligation or liability accrued or any rights
arising under this Agreement prior to such termination shall be impaired or
affected; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| Seller's rights to the Licensed IP shall immediately cease;

possession or control, including written and electronic records (and
copies thereof) that contain Confidential Information of Buyer or the
Licensed IP and materials that are based on or use or incorporate any
Confidential Information of Buyer or the Licensed IP, and certify to Buyer
that it has complied with this Section 5.4(c); and

   | (d)| Sections 1.2, 1.3(b), 1.3(d), 1.7, 1.8, 2.1, 2.2 and 4 to 8

---|---|--- 
  



   | 6.| _Confidentiality_ 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 6.1| _Definition_. " _Confidential Information_ " means any and all
non public information or other confidential or proprietary information
disclosed by or on behalf of Buyer to Seller, whether orally or in writing,
that is either: (a) conspicuously marked or otherwise identified as
confidential or proprietary at the time of disclosure; or (b)
should reasonably be understood by Seller to be confidential based upon the
nature of the information disclosed or the circumstances of the disclosure.
Confidential Information includes the Licensed IP. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 6.2| _Nonuse and Nondisclosure_. Seller shall not: (a) use any
Confidential Information other than for the purpose of exercising its rights
under the License Grant; or (b) disclose any Confidential Information to any
third party. Seller shall take all reasonable precautions to prevent any
unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information, at least by
exercising no less than the same degree of care as Seller exercises with
respect its own proprietary and confidential information. If Seller receives
a subpoena or other validly issued administrative or judicial process
requesting Confidential Information, it will, to the extent legally
permissible, promptly notify Buyer, and provide reasonable assistance to Buyer
to object to, oppose, squash or otherwise limit the subpoena or process. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 7.| _Liability_ 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 7.1| _Disclaimer_. SELLER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE LICENSED
IP IS LICENSED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. BUYER
DISCLAIMS AND SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS,
GUARANTEES, COVENANTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, WHETHER EXPRESS
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO THE USEFULNESS,
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
VALIDITY, PERFORMANCE, MARKETABILITY OR TITLE OF THE LICENSED IP OR
SELLER'S EXERCISE OF ITS RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. SELLER ASSUMES THE
ENTIRE RISK AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SAFETY, EFFICACY, PERFORMANCE, DESIGN,
MARKETABILITY, TITLE, AND QUALITY OF ALL PRODUCTS WHICH PRACTICE OR USE THE
LICENSED IP (OTHER THAN ANY PRODUCTS OF BUYER OR BUYER'S OTHER LICENSEES OR
ANY USE OF THE LICENSED IP BY BUYER OR ITS OTHER LICENSEES). Seller hereby
covenants not to sue Buyer or its Affiliates with respect to any of the
matters which are disclaimed by Buyer in this Section 7.1. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | 13| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | 7.2| _Limitation of Liability_. In no event shall Buyer or its
Affiliates be responsible or liable for any indirect, special, punitive,
incidental, or consequential damages or lost profits, lost business, lost
reputation, lost opportunity, or intellectual property infringement to
Seller, regardless of legal theory. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 7.3| _Application_ _._ The disclaimers and limitations in this
Section 7 apply even though Buyer or its Affiliates may have been advised of
the possibility of the relevant loss or damage. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 7.4| _Indemnification_. Seller shall, and will require its
Sublicensees (including distributors) to, indemnify, hold harmless, and
defend Buyer and its Affiliates, and each of their officers, employees,
sublicensees, distributors, customers, representatives and agents, against
any and all claims, suits, losses, damages, costs, fees, and expenses,
including any indirect, special, punitive, incidental, or consequential
damages, and any profits, lost business or lost opportunity, regardless of
legal theory, in connection with: (a) Seller's exercise of its rights under
this Agreement; (b) the New Products or Ex-America Products; (c) Seller's
breach of this Agreement; or (d) any act or omission by Seller, any Licensed
Distributor or any Person acting under Seller's control that results in: (i)
a material reduction of Buyer's ability to use, design, develop, manufacture,
use, import, export, offer for sale, sell, license, reproduce, distribute, or
otherwise exploit or commercialize any Business Product; (ii) the withdrawal
or any adverse effect on any IND, NDA, clinical trial or other product
registration; (iii) Buyer or its Subsidiaries to be in breach or violation of
any condition under any IND, NDA, clinical trial or other product
registration or any Laws applicable to the Business Product; or (iv) any
Governmental Authority commencing or threatening an investigation, audit,
Action, suit, hearing, charge, claim, demand, notice or other proceeding
(each, an " _Indemnified Claim_ "). Nothing is indemnified if Seller is
merely providing a regulatory agency with information regarding an adverse
event. Without limiting the foregoing obligations of Seller, where an
Indemnified Claim is asserted by a third party, Buyer will have the right at
its option, to have sole control over the defense, settlement, compromise,
admission, or acknowledgment of the Indemnified Claim, or to request that
Seller undertake the defense, settlement, compromise, admission, or
acknowledgment of the Indemnified Claim. If Buyer notifies Seller that Buyer
shall have sole control over the defense, settlement, compromise, admission,
or acknowledgment of the Indemnified Claim, Seller shall at Seller's own cost
and expense, provide all assistance as requested by Buyer. If Buyer requests
that Seller undertakes the defense, settlement, compromise, admission, or
acknowledgment of the Indemnified Claim, Seller shall immediately comply with
such request, keep Seller reasonably informed of the progress of the
Indemnified Claim (including providing all information as requested by Buyer)
and allow Buyer to reasonably participate, at Buyer's sole cost and
expense, in such defense, settlement, compromise, admission, or
acknowledgment using counsel of Buyer's choice. Notwithstanding anything in
the foregoing, Seller shall not waive, release, compromise or settle any
Indemnified Claim that may adversely affect Buyer in any manner, without
Buyer's prior written approval.

---|---|--- 

 



    



   | 8.| _Miscellaneous_ 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 8.1| _Compliance with Laws_. Seller shall comply with all Legal
Requirements, including all applicable United States and foreign laws with
respect to the transfer of New Products and Ex-America Products and related
technical data to foreign countries, including the International Traffic in
Arms Regulations and the Export Administration Regulations, in the exercise
of its rights and fulfillment of its obligations under this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 8.2| _Right to Injunction_. Seller acknowledges that the Licensed IP
possesses special, unique and extraordinary characteristics which could make
difficult the assessment of monetary damages, which Buyer could sustain
due to a breach or threatened breach by Seller of this Agreement, such as
Seller's unauthorized use of the Licensed IP or the Confidential Information.
Seller recognizes and acknowledges that such unauthorized activities or
breaches of obligations could cause irreparable injury to Buyer and
specifically agrees that injunctive and other equitable relief is appropriate
in the event of a breach or threatened breach by Seller of this Agreement.
Such equitable relief shall not be exclusive of or in lieu of any other
remedies available to Buyer. Buyer's pursuit of equitable remedies hereunder
shall not be deemed to be an election of remedies by Buyer. Seller agrees to
waive any requirement for the security or posting of any bond in connection
with such remedy. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 8.3| _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement together with the Transaction
Documents constitutes the entire agreement between Seller and Buyer in
relation to the subject matter set forth herein. Any prior agreements, letters
of intent, term sheets or understandings among Seller and Buyer, and any
representations or statements made by or on behalf of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates to Seller, whether written or oral, with respect to the subject
matter of this Agreement are superseded to the extent not expressly included
in this Agreement or the APA. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 8.4| _Assignment_. Seller shall not assign, transfer, or delegate any
of its obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, without Buyer's
prior written consent. Any attempt to assign, transfer, or delegate in breach
of the foregoing assignment shall be null and void and of no force or effect.
Buyer may assign this Agreement at any time and Seller hereby agrees to any
such assignment. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 8.5| _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts and by facsimile or other means of electronically imaging a
signature, each of which, when taken together, shall constitute one and the
same instrument. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 8.6| _Relationship of Parties_. The Parties are independent
contractors. There is no relationship of principal to agent, master to
servant, employer to employee, or franchiser to franchisee between the
Parties. Neither Party has the authority to bind the other or incur any
obligation on its behalf. 
---|---|---

   | 8.7| _Incorporation by Reference and Notices to Seller_. Sections 1,
9.1, 9.3, 9.5, 9.8, 9.10, 9.11, 9.13, 9.14 and 9.15 of the APA are hereby
incorporated into this Agreement by reference; provided that, for purposes of
providing any notice, request instruction or other document to be given
hereunder to Seller, a copy thereof shall be provided, in addition to the
Persons set forth in Section 9.1, to: Porzio Bromberg and Newman in DC.
