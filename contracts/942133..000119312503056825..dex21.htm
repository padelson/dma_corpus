to the Company: (i) any change in the market price or trading volume of the Company Common Stock after the date hereof; (ii) any failure by the Company to meet internal projections or forecasts or published revenue or earnings predictions for any
period ending (or for which revenues or earnings are released) on or after the date of this Agreement; (iii) any adverse change, effect, event, occurrence, state of facts or development to the extent attributable to the announcement or pendency of
the Merger (including cancellations in customer orders, reduction in sales, disruption in suppliers, distributors, partners or similar relationships or loss of employees, and any litigation brought by stockholders of the Company in connection with
the Merger), provided that the affected Party shall bear the burden of demonstrating the cause of such change, effect, event, occurrence, state of facts or development; (iv) any failure by the Company to obtain any consent or approval, provided that
nothing in this Section 9.11(e)(iv) shall modify the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1(d) and 7.2(c) hereof, (v) any adverse change, event, circumstance or effect that results from changes attributable to conditions affecting the industry in
which the Company participates, the United States economy as a whole, or foreign economies in any locations where the Company has material operations or sales (which changes in each case do not disproportionately adversely affect the Company); or
(vi) any adverse change, effect, event, occurrence, state of facts or development resulting from or relating to compliance with the terms of, or the taking of any action required by, this Agreement. </FONT></P> <P
