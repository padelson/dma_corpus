A-ii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER



This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of September
29, 2003, is made and entered into by and among Garden Fresh Restaurant
Corp., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), GF Holdings, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), and GFR Acquisition Company, a Delaware
corporation ("Sub").



WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company, acting upon the
recommendation of a special committee of the Board of Directors, which is
composed of three independent directors and was formed specifically for the
purpose of evaluating and negotiating potential strategic transactions (the
"Special Committee"), has determined that it is advisable and in the best
interest of the Company and its stockholders to consummate, and has
recommended approval by the stockholders of the Company of, the business
combination transaction provided for herein in which Sub would merge with and
into the Company and the Company would become a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent (the "Merger");



WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent and Sub have each determined that
it is advisable and in the best interests of their respective companies and
stockholders to consummate, and have approved, the Merger; and



WHEREAS, Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to
prescribe various conditions to the Merger;



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
set forth in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties
hereto agree as follows:



ARTICLE I



THE MERGER



1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3 below), Sub shall
be merged with and into the Company in accordance with the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"). At the Effective Time, the separate
existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent. Sub and the Company are sometimes referred to herein as
the "Constituent Corporations." As a result of the Merger, the outstanding
shares of capital stock and the treasury shares of the Constituent
Corporations shall be converted or cancelled in the manner provided in Article
II.



1.2 _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and
the transactions herein contemplated shall have been abandoned pursuant to
Section 8.1, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver (where applicable) of
the conditions set forth in Article VII, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") will take place at the offices of Gray Cary Ware and Freidenrich LLP
("Gray Cary"), 4365 Executive Drive, Suite 1100, San Diego, California 92121
at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the second calendar day following satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that,
by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) (or, if such day is not a Business
Day, on the next succeeding Business Day), unless another date, time or place
is agreed to by the parties hereto (the "Closing Date"). At the Closing there
shall be delivered to Parent, Sub and the Company the certificates and other
documents and instruments required to be delivered under Article VII.



1.3 _Effective Time_. A certificate of merger (the "Certificate of
Merger") shall be duly prepared and executed, and shall be filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Secretary of State") in
accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL on the Closing Date. The Merger shall
become effective upon the  



 

A-1  filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State unless
Parent and the Company agree to a subsequent date or time and specify such
date and time in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes
effective being hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time").



1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Sub or the Company, the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended in its entirety to
read as set forth on _Exhibit A_ hereto. As of the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Sub or the Company, the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated to read the
same as the bylaws of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable law, except that the bylaws shall be amended to reflect that the
name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Garden Fresh Restaurant Corp."



1.5 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The
directors and officers of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
from and after the Effective Time, be the directors and officers,
respectively, of the Surviving Corporation until their successors shall have
been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporations
certificate of incorporation and bylaws.



1.6 _Effects of the Merger_. Subject to the foregoing, the effects of
the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.



1.7 _Further Assurances_. Each party hereto will, either prior to or
after the Effective Time, execute such further documents, instruments, deeds,
bills of sale, assignments and assurances and take such further actions as may
reasonably be requested by one or more of the others to consummate the Merger,
to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all assets, properties,
privileges, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either of the
Constituent Corporations or to effect the other purposes of this Agreement.



ARTICLE II



CONVERSION OF SHARES



2.1 _Conversion of Capital Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof:



(a) _Conversion of Sub Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share
of Common Stock, $0.001 per share par value, of Sub ("Sub Common Stock") shall
be converted into and become one fully paid and non-assessable common share,
without par value, of the Surviving Corporation ("Surviving Corporation Common
Stock"). Each certificate representing outstanding Sub Common Stock shall, as
of the Effective Time, represent an equal number of Surviving Corporation
Common Stock.



(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares and Shares Owned by Parent and
Subsidiaries_. All shares of Company Common Stock, $0.01 par value, of the
Company ("Company Common Stock") that are owned by the Company as treasury
shares and any Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Sub or any other wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Parent shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist and no stock of Parent or any other consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.



(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_.



(i) Each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than
shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and other than
Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 2.1(d)) shall be converted into the
right to receive $16.35 in cash, without any interest thereon (the  



 

A-2  "Merger Price"), subject to appropriate adjustment for any stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or
exchange with respect to the Company Common Stock occurring before the
Effective Time.



(ii) All Company Common Stock converted in accordance with paragraph (i) of
this Section 2.1(c) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate representing any such shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Price per share, upon
the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.2, without any
interest thereon, subject to any applicable withholding tax.



(d) _Appraisal Rights_.



(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each
outstanding share of Company Common Stock that is held of record by a holder
who has properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto under Section
262 of the DGCL (a "Dissenting Share"), shall not be converted into or
represent the right to receive the Merger Price pursuant to Section 2.1(c),
but the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive such payment of the fair
cash value of such share of Company Common Stock from the Surviving
Corporation as shall be determined pursuant to the DGCL; provided, however,
that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall withdraw or lose
such holders rights under the DGCL, all of such holders Company Common Stock
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time
into the right to receive the Merger Price, without any interest thereon,
pursuant to Section 2.1(c).



(ii) The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any written demands for
payment of the fair cash value of shares, withdrawals of such demands and any
other instruments delivered pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company
will not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands delivered to
the Company pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and will not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, settle or offer to settle any such demands.



(e) _Company Equity Plans_.



(i) Subject to paragraph (ii) below, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each outstanding right to acquire Company Common Stock ("Company
Options") granted under the Companys Key Employee Stock Option Plan, the
Restaurant Management Stock Option Plan, the 1995 Outside Directors Stock
Option Plan, the 1998 Stock Option Plan and the 1999 Nonstatutory Stock
Option Plan (collectively, the "Company Option Plans"), whether or not then
exercisable, shall be cancelled by the Company, and in consideration of such
cancellation, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive from the
Company at the Effective Time an amount in respect thereof equal to the
product of (A) the excess, if any, of the Merger Price per share over the per
share exercise price thereof and (B) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to the Company Options, including shares, if any, which
would otherwise be unvested or non-exercisable prior to the Closing Date (the
"Option Amount") (such payment to be net of applicable withholding taxes).
Company shall take all necessary actions (including providing all required
notices and obtaining all applicable consents) to ensure that all outstanding
Company Options and all Company Option Plans are terminated as of
the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deposit in
a bank account an amount of cash equal to the Option Amount for each Company
Option then outstanding (subject to any applicable withholding tax), together
with instructions that such cash be promptly distributed following the
Effective Time to the holders of such Company Options in accordance with this
Section 2.1(e). From and after the Effective Time, other than as expressly set
forth in this Section 2.1(e), (i) no holder of a Company Option shall have
any other rights in respect thereof other than to receive payment, if any, for
his or her Company Options as set forth in this Section 2.1(e) and (ii) any
Company Option not otherwise exercised and/or cancelled prior to the
Effective Time, on account of the lack of such option holders consent (if
required) to terminate such Company Option, shall nevertheless automatically
be terminated as required pursuant to the Company Option Plan and
applicable Company Option agreement, and the  



 

A-3  holder of such terminated Company Option shall forfeit any and all rights to
any proceeds or other consideration, including specifically the Option
Amount, on account of the termination and cancellation of such Company
Option.



(ii) Except as provided herein or as otherwise agreed by the parties, the
Company shall take all actions prior to or as of the Closing Date to the
effect that the Company Option Plans and any other plan, program or
arrangement with any current or former employee, officer, director or
consultant providing for the issuance or grant of any interest in respect
of the capital stock of the Company shall terminate as of the Effective Time.
The Company shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that
following the Effective Time no current or former employee, officer, director
or consultant shall have any option to acquire any Company Common Stock or
any other equity interest in the Company under the Company Option Plans or any
other plan, program or arrangement maintained by the Company.



(iii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Companys Board of Directors
(acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee), or, if appropriate,
any committee administering the Company Option Plans, shall adopt such
resolutions or take such actions as are necessary to carry out the terms of
Section 2.1(e)(i), subject, if necessary, to obtaining consents of the holders
of Company Options to the cancellation thereof in exchange for the
consideration set forth in Section 2.1(e)(i).



(iv) The Companys Board of Directors shall take all action necessary to
cause (i) any "Purchase Periods" (as defined in the Companys Employee Stock
Purchase Plan ("ESPP")) then in progress to be shortened by establishing a
final "Purchase Date" (as also defined in the Company ESPP) as of a date
prior to the Effective Time, and any Purchase Periods then in progress shall
end on such new final Purchase Date, and (ii) the termination of the Company
ESPP effective as of a time following such new final Purchase Date but at or
prior to the Effective Time. All outstanding purchase rights under the ESPP
shall automatically be exercised, in accordance with the terms of the ESPP, on
the day immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each share of Company
Common Stock purchased under those exercised rights shall at the Effective
Time be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Price
pursuant to Section 2.1(c) of this Agreement. The Company shall cause the
ESPP to terminate with such purchase.



2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.



(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deposit
with a bank or trust company designated before the Closing Date by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Paying Agent"), a cash amount
equal to the aggregate Merger Price to which holders of Company Common Stock
shall be entitled upon consummation of the Merger, to be held for the benefit
of and distributed to such holders in accordance with this Section 2.2. The
Paying Agent shall agree to hold such funds (such funds, together with
earnings thereon, being referred to herein as the "Payment Fund") for delivery
as contemplated by this Section 2.2 and upon such additional terms as may be
agreed upon by the Paying Agent, the Company and Parent. If for any reason
(including losses) the Payment Fund is inadequate to pay the cash amounts to
which holders of Company Common Stock shall be entitled, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall in any event remain liable, and shall make
available to the Paying Agent additional funds, for the payment thereof. All
earnings in the Payment Fund in excess of the aggregate Merger Price are the
property of the Surviving Corporation and shall be disbursed to the Surviving
Corporation promptly upon termination of the Payment Fund. The Payment Fund
shall not be used for any purpose except as expressly provided in this
Agreement.



(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail
to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock (the "Certificates") whose shares are converted pursuant to Section
2.1(c) into the right to receive the Merger Price (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions
as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions
for use in  



 

A-4  effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Price. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal duly executed and completed in
accordance with its terms, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor a check representing the Merger Price per share
of Company Common Stock represented thereby, subject to any applicable
withholding tax, which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this Article II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. In no event shall the holder of any Certificate be
entitled to receive interest on any funds to be received in the Merger,
including any interest accrued in respect of the Payment Fund. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered
in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Price may be issued to a
transferee if the Certificate representing such Company Common Stock is
presented to the Paying Agent accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.2(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Price per share of Company Common Stock represented thereby as
contemplated by this Article II, together with the dividends, if any, which
may have been declared by the Company on the Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the
Effective Time. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all fees and
expenses of the Paying Agent in connection with the distribution of the Merger
Price.



(c) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Merger Price due to such Person as provided in Section
2.2(b).



(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All cash
paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the
terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Company Common Stock represented thereby. Unless
otherwise required by Section 262 of the DGCL, from and after the Effective
Time, the share transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the share transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the Company Common Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (except for any transfers
made in accordance with customary settlement procedures to reflect trades
effected prior to the Effective Time). If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates (other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled
and exchanged as provided in this Section 2.2.



(e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund
which remains undistributed to the stockholders of the Company for one (1)
year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation,
upon demand, and any stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore
complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) as
general creditors for payment of their claim for the Merger Price per share of
Company Common Stock. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable to any holder of Company Common Stock for cash representing the Merger
Price delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.



(f) _Withholding Rights_. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any applicable
provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by Parent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company
Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Parent.



 

A-5 (g) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Payment Fund in United States government securities with
a maturity period of thirty (30) days or less or in certificates of deposit
issued by any United States bank with at least $5 billion in assets,
as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation
upon termination of the Payment Fund.



ARTICLE III



REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY



The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub that, except as
expressly set forth in the written disclosure schedule prepared by the Company
which is dated as of the date of this Agreement and arranged in sections
corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections contained in this Article
III (provided, however, that disclosure in any section shall be deemed to have
been set forth in all other applicable sections where it is reasonably
apparent that such disclosure is applicable to such other sections
notwithstanding the omission of any cross-reference to such other section) and
is being concurrently delivered to Parent in connection herewith (the
"Company Disclosure Schedule"), as of the date of this Agreement and as of the
Closing Date, except where another date is specified:



3.1 _Organization and Qualification_. The Company is a corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation and has full corporate power and authority to
conduct its business as and to the extent now conducted and to own, use and
lease its assets and properties. The Company has no subsidiaries. The Company
is duly qualified, licensed or admitted to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which the ownership, use or leasing of its assets and
properties, or the conduct or nature of its business, makes such
qualification, licensing or admission necessary, except for such failures to
be so qualified, licensed or admitted and in good standing which, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company does not directly or indirectly own
any equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity or similar interest in,
any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture or
other business association or entity. The Company has previously delivered or
made available to Parent complete and correct copies of the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or other comparable charter documents) of the
Company.



3.2 _Capitalization_.



(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 12,000,000
shares of Common Stock, $0.01 per share par value, and 2,500,000 shares of
Preferred Stock, $0.01 per share par value, 120,000 shares of which have been
designated Series A Preferred Stock, $0.01 per share par value. As of
September 26, 2003, 5,823,823 shares of Company Common Stock were issued and
outstanding and no shares of Company Common Stock were held in the treasury of
the Company. As of September 29, 2003, the Company had authorized 2,657,500
shares of Company Common Stock for issuance pursuant to the Company Option
Plans, and the Company had granted options to purchase 1,391,888 shares of
Company Common Stock under the Company Option Plans. As of September 29, 2003,

property identified as owned by it free and clear of all Liens other than (i)
Liens that do not, individually or in the aggregate, materially impair the
conduct by the Company of its business thereon or materially detract from the
value thereof, (ii) Liens for Taxes accrued but not yet payable, and (iii)
Liens that secure obligations of the Company under that certain Credit
Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2002, by and between the Company and Wells
Fargo Bank, as amended (the "Company Credit Facility") (each of (i), (ii) and
(iii) being "Permitted Encumbrances"). The Company holds a valid leasehold
interest under a lease or sublease covering each property identified as leased
by it free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Encumbrances.

current copy of the store leases and distribution center leases relating to
each property identified as leased by it (the "Company Store Leases"),
including any modifications and supplements. The Company Store Leases are
identified on Schedule 3.16 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. All of the
Company Store Leases are in full force and effect. The Company and, to the
knowledge of the Company, all other parties to the Company Store Leases have,
in all material respects, duly and timely performed their obligations and are
not in default under the Company Store Leases. The Company has not given or
received any notice of a material default under any of the Company Store
Leases. No event has occurred or condition exists that, with the giving of
notice, the passage of time, or both, would constitute a material default by
the Company or, to the knowledge of the Company, any other party under any of
the Company Store Leases, and, to the knowledge of the Company, none of the
Company Store Leases is subject to any impending cancellation.



 

A-14 (c) The use of the Company Real Property by the Company in its business as
presently and ordinarily conducted conforms with applicable zoning laws,
regulations and permits, except where the failure to conform would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The
Company is not obligated under or bound by any agreement, option, right of
first refusal, purchase contract or other contractual right to sell, lease or
dispose of any Company Real Property or any portions thereof.



3.17 _Intellectual Property Rights_. Schedule 3.17 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of all United States

and interest in, or a valid and binding license to use, all Intellectual
Property (as defined below) free and clear of all liens, security interests or
other encumbrances which is material to the conduct of the businesses of the
Company. The Company is not in default (or with the giving of notice or lapse
of time or both, would be in default) under any license to use such
Intellectual Property, and, to the Companys knowledge, such
Intellectual Property is not being infringed by any third party and the
Company, to its knowledge, is not infringing any Intellectual Property of any
third party, except for such defaults and infringements which, individually or
in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company. No material claim has been asserted and is pending by
any Person challenging the use of any such Intellectual Property or the
validity or effectiveness of any such Intellectual Property. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Intellectual Property" means patents and patent rights,
trademarks and trademark rights, trade names and trade name rights, service
marks and service mark rights, service names and service name rights,
copyrights and copyright rights, trade secrets, Internet domain names and
other proprietary intellectual property rights and all pending applications
for and registrations of any of the foregoing.

such insurance policies.

other transactions between the Company, on the one hand, and any (i) present

3.21 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Company has received the
opinion of SG Cowen Securities Corporation ("SG Cowen"), dated the date
hereof, to the effect that, as of the date hereof, the consideration to be
received in the Merger by the stockholders of the Company is fair from a
financial point of view to the stockholders of the Company other than: (i)
Parent and its affiliates; and (ii) other investors in the merger including
executive officers of the Company who will have an equity participation in
Parent or in the Surviving Corporation after Closing. 



3.22 _Company Rights Agreement_. Each right issued under the Company
Rights Agreement is represented by the certificate representing the associated
Company Common Stock and is not exercisable or transferable apart from the
associated Company Common Stock, and the Company has taken all necessary
actions so that the Company Rights Agreement will not be applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.



3.23 _DGCL Section 203_. The Board of Directors of the Company (acting
upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) has approved the Merger and

5.2 _No Solicitations_. 



(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company agrees (a) that it shall not,
and it shall cause its Representatives not to, initiate, solicit or encourage
any inquiries or the making or implementation of any proposal or offer
(including, without limitation, any proposal or offer to its
stockholders) with respect to an Alternative Proposal, or engage in any

A-19  to, or have any discussions with, any Person or group relating to an
Alternative Proposal (excluding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement); and (b) that it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties with
respect to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that nothing contained in
this Section 5.2 shall prohibit the Board of Directors of the Company from
(i) authorizing a communication with any party that is limited to making such
party aware of the provisions of this Section 5.2(a); (ii) furnishing
information to (but only pursuant to a confidentiality agreement in customary
form and having terms and conditions no less favorable to the Company than the
Confidentiality Agreement; provided, however, that any such confidentiality
agreement shall not restrict the parties thereto from making an Alternative
Proposal) or entering into discussions or negotiations with any Person or
group that makes an unsolicited bona fide Alternative Proposal, if the Special
Committee determines in good faith (after consulting with reputable
outside financial advisors experienced in such matters including, without
limitation, SG Cowen) that the Alternative Proposal is or presents a
reasonable likelihood of resulting in a Superior Proposal and was not
solicited by it after the date hereof and did not otherwise result from a
breach of this Section 5.2; and (iii) to the extent required, taking and
disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9
or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an
Alternative Proposal, or making any other disclosure to the Companys
stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Special Committee, after
being advised by reputable outside counsel experienced in such matters
(including, without limitation, Gray Cary), there is a reasonable basis to
conclude that disclosure is required under applicable Law. The Company will
promptly notify Parent after: (i) receipt of an Alternative Proposal
(including the terms of such Alternative Proposal), (ii) any request for
information relating to the Company (including non-public information) or for
access to the properties, books or records of the Company by any Person that
has made an Alternative Proposal, or (iii) receipt of an amendment to a
previously disclosed Alternative Proposal (including the terms of such
amendment), and will keep Parent fully informed on a current basis (and in any
event within 24 hours) of the status and details of any such Acquisition
Proposal, indication or request.



(b) Neither the Company nor the Board of Directors of the Company nor the
Special Committee shall withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify,
in any manner adverse to Parent, the approval or recommendation of this
Agreement or the Merger, or, except as contemplated by Section 5.2(a)(ii)
above, propose publicly to approve or recommend an Alternative Proposal unless
the Board of Directors or the Special Committee, as the case may be,
determines, in its good faith judgment (after receipt of advice from
reputable outside legal counsel experienced in such matters, including
without limitation Gray Cary) that there is a reasonable basis to conclude
that the failure to take such action would result in a breach of the Board of
Directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.



(c) Subject to the provisions of this Section 5.2, the Parties acknowledge
and agree that the Company may accept a Superior Proposal, enter into an
agreement for such Superior Proposal and terminate this Agreement immediately
prior to, or immediately after, such acceptance of a Superior Proposal
pursuant to the terms of Section 8.1(c) hereof, provided, however, that the
Company shall take no action under this Section 5.2(c) for three Business Days
after delivery of a written notice to Parent setting forth its intention
to take such action and will negotiate exclusively in good faith with Parent
for a three-day period prior to taking such action in order to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable
Company to proceed with the transactions contemplated herein on such adjusted
terms.



(d) For purposes of this Agreement, "Alternative Proposal" means any
written inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person relating to any merger,
consolidation or other business combination including the Company or any
acquisition or similar transaction (including, without limitation, a tender or
exchange offer) involving the purchase of (i) 50% of the assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, if any, on a consolidated basis, or (ii) 50% or more of
the outstanding Company Common Stock. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written Alternative Proposal (with the
percentages included in the definition of Alternative Proposal replaced with
80% for purposes of this definition) that the Special Committee determines
(after consultation and receipt of advice from reputable outside financial
advisors and legal counsel experienced in such matters, including without
limitation SG Cowen and Gray Cary, respectively) in its good faith judgment,
 



 

A-20  that contains terms that provide greater value to the Companys stockholders
than the Merger (taking into account all the terms and conditions of
the Alternative Proposal, this Agreement and such other factors as are deemed
relevant by such Special Committee), and for which financing, to the extent
required, is fully committed.



5.3 _Financing-Related Cooperation_. Parent agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the financing necessary to
consummate the Merger. Subject to the final sentence of this Section 5.3, the
Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide, and to
cause its directors, officers, employees and advisors to provide, all
cooperation reasonably necessary in connection with the arrangement of any
financing to be consummated in respect of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including participation in meetings, due diligence sessions,
the execution and delivery of any commitment letters, pledge and security
documents, other definitive financing documents or other requested
certificates or documents as may be reasonably required by Parent and taking
such other actions as are reasonably required to be taken by the Company;
provided that all such agreements, letters, and instruments executed by the
Company are unilaterally revocable by the Company as to the Company prior to
the Effective Time without notice or penalty of any kind and do not obligate
the Company to pay any fees or expenses to such financing sources prior to the
Effective Time; provided further that Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that the disclosures made by Parent in response to
representations and warranties contained in any financing agreements executed
by Parent in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
not materially inconsistent with the corresponding disclosures contained in
the Company Disclosure Schedule (or with the information provided pursuant to
the following sentence) with respect to the same or similar matters; and
provided further, that Parent shall use reasonable efforts not to materially
interfere with the duties of such officers, employees and advisors such that
the Companys business and results of operations would be materially affected
thereby. The Company also agrees, solely for the purposes of facilitating any
financing to be consummated in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide any
additional disclosure information that is reasonably requested by either
Parent or the sources of such financing. In addition, in conjunction with the
obtaining of any such financing, the Company agrees, at the reasonable request
of Parent, to call for prepayment or redemption, or to prepay, redeem and/or
renegotiate, as the case may be, any then existing indebtedness of
the Company; provided that no call for redemption or prepayment shall be
irrevocably made until contemporaneously with or after the Effective Time. The
Companys obligations in connection with the arrangement of any financing set
forth above in this Section 5.3 are contingent upon Parent furnishing the
Company with written evidence that such financing sources agree to be bound by
the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 6.1 below) to the same
extent that Parent is so bound. 



5.4 _SEC Reports_. The Company shall cause the forms, reports,
schedules, statements and other documents required to be filed with the SEC by
the Company between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time (the
"New SEC Reports") to be prepared in all material respects in accordance with
provisions set forth in Section 3.5(a) hereof.

thereafter as is reasonably practicable. Parent, Sub and the Company shall

Effective Time, except if such amendment is required by applicable Law.



(b) With respect to acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, until the sixth anniversary
of the Effective Time and for so long thereafter as any claim for insurance
coverage asserted on or prior to such date has not been fully adjudicated,
cause to be maintained in effect, at no cost to the beneficiaries thereof, to
the extent available, the policies of directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by the Company as of the date hereof to the extent that
such insurance coverage can be maintained at an annual cost to the Surviving
Corporation of not greater than 250% of the annual premium for the Companys
current insurance policies and, if such insurance coverage cannot be
so purchased or maintained at such cost, providing as much of such insurance
as can be so purchased or maintained at such cost.



(c) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so

business or make any investments other than as specifically contemplated by

obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement. As promptly as practicable following
the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall vote all of the shares of Sub in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement.



6.9 _Brokers or Finders_. Each of Parent and the Company represents, as
to itself and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, that no agent, broker,
investment banker, financial advisor or other firm or Person is or will be
entitled to any brokers or finders fee or any other commission or similar
fee in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
except SG Cowen, whose fees and expenses will be paid by the Company in
accordance with the Companys agreement with such firm and, in the event that
this Agreement is terminated prior to Closing, each of Parent and the Company
shall indemnify and hold the other harmless from and against any and all
claims, liabilities or obligations with respect to any other such fee or
commission or expenses related thereto asserted by any Person on the basis of
any act or statement alleged to have been made by such party or its
Affiliate.





 

A-24 6.10 _Conveyance Taxes_. The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications
or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use,
transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, any transfer,
recording, registration and other fees, and any similar taxes which become
payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that are required or permitted to be filed on or before the Effective Time.



6.11 _Notice and Cure_. Each of Parent and the Company will notify the
other of, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to cure before the
Closing, any event, transaction or circumstance, as soon as practicable after
it becomes known to such party, that causes or will cause any covenant or
agreement of Parent or the Company under this Agreement to be breached or that
renders or will render untrue any representation or warranty of Parent or the
Company contained in this Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company also
will notify the other in writing of, and will use commercially reasonable
efforts to cure before the Closing, any violation or breach, as soon as
practicable after it becomes known to such party, of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement made by Parent or the Company in this
Agreement. No notice given pursuant to this Section 6.11 shall have any effect
on the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement for purposes of determining satisfaction of any condition contained
herein.



6.12 _Fulfillment of Conditions_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company will take or cause to be taken
commercially reasonable steps necessary or desirable to satisfy each
condition to the others obligations contained in this Agreement and to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and neither Parent nor the Company will, nor will they permit any of their
Subsidiaries to, take or fail to take any action that could be reasonably
expected to result in the non-fulfillment of any such condition.



6.13 _Delisting_. Each of the parties agrees to cooperate with each other
in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to delist the
