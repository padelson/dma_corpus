AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the "Agreement"), dated as of July __, 2000,
among BARNETT, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"),
WILMAR INDUSTRIES, INC., a New Jersey corporation ("Parent") and BW
ACQUISITION, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Merger Sub").   WHEREAS, the
respective Boards of Directors of each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
have approved this Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, Merger
Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger") upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein and in accordance with the
Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended ("Delaware Corporate Law");  
WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of the Agreement, as a condition to
the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter into the Agreement, (i)
Waxman Industries Inc. and Waxman USA Inc. (collectively, the "Company
Principal") entered into a Stockholder Agreement and Voting Trust Agreement
with Parent and Merger Sub (collectively, the "Company Voting Agreement"),
which provides for, among other things, the Company Principal to deposit
6,186,530 shares of the Company\'s common stock, par value $0.01 per share
(the "Common Stock"), beneficially owned by the Company Principal in a voting
trust, and the agreement of the Company Principal and the voting
trustee named therein to vote all shares of Common Stock beneficially owned
by the Company Principal in favor of approval and adoption of this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) the
Company Principal delivered to Parent and Merger Sub a proxy (the "Proxy") in
respect of an additional 1,000,000 of such shares of Common Stock
beneficially owned by the Company Principal.   WHEREAS, certain terms used
in this Agreement which are not capitalized have the meanings specified in
Section 8.1.   WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection
with this Agreement.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing
and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set
forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   THE
MERGER   Section 1.1 THE MERGER. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions hereof, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2 hereof),
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance with the
applicable provisions of Delaware Corporate    1  8  Law and the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and the
Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes referred
to as the "Surviving Corporation") and all of its rights, privileges, powers,
immunities, purposes and franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger.
The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Sections 251, 259 and 261 of
Delaware Corporate Law. Pursuant to the Merger, the Certificate
of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be the Certificate
of Incorporation of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time (the "Surviving Corporation Certificate of Incorporation") until amended
in accordance with the terms thereof and applicable law, except that as of
the Effective Time, Article I of such Certificate of Incorporation shall be
amended to read as follows: "The name of the corporation is Barnett, Inc."
The bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be the bylaws of Merger Sub in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Surviving Corporation
Bylaws") until amended in accordance with the terms thereof and applicable
law.   Section 1.2 EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER. The Merger shall
become effective when the Certificate of Merger is executed and filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with
Delaware Corporate Law, or at such later time as the parties hereto shall
have designated in such filing as the effective time of the Merger (the
"Effective Time"), which filing shall be made as soon as practicable after
the closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance
with Section 1.3 hereof.   Section 1.3 CLOSING. The Company shall promptly
notify Parent and Merger Sub, and Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly notify
the Company, when the conditions to such party\'s obligation to effect the
Merger contained in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the closing of the Merger (the "Closing"), but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) have been satisfied
or waived in accordance with this Agreement. The Closing shall take place at
the offices of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison, 1285 Avenue of the
Americas, New York, New York at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the third business
day after the later of these notices has been given (the "Closing Date"),
unless another date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto.   Section 1.4 DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION.
The directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation at
the Effective Time. Immediately after the Effective Date, William R. Pray
shall be elected to the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation. The
directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation shall hold office until
their respective successors shall have been duly elected or appointed and
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the Surviving Corporation Certificate of Incorporation and the Surviving
Corporation Bylaws.   2  9   ARTICLE II   CONVERSION OR CANCELLATION
OF SHARES IN THE MERGER   Section 2.1 CONVERSION (OR CANCELLATION) OF
SHARES. At the Effective Time, pursuant to this Agreement and by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities:   (a) Except as
otherwise provided in Section 2.1(b) and Section 2.4, each share of Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the
"Shares") shall be canceled and shall be converted automatically into the
right to receive an amount equal to $13.15 in cash, without interest (the
"Merger Consideration"), payable to the holder thereof upon surrender of the
certificate formerly representing such share of Common Stock in the manner
provided in Section 2.2.   (b) Each share of Common Stock held in the
treasury of the Company and each Share owned by Parent or Merger Sub, if any,
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled without any
conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect
thereto.   (c) Each share of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub ("Merger Sub Common Stock") that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one newly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock.  Section 2.2
PAYMENT OF CASH FOR SHARES.   (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall
appoint American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, or another bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to Parent and Merger Sub, (the "Exchange
Agent") to act as exchange agent for the exchange of the Merger Consideration
upon surrender of certificates representing issued and outstanding Shares. At
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall irrevocably deposit or
cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders
of Shares, cash in the aggregate amount required to pay the Merger
Consideration in respect of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Pending distribution pursuant to Section 2.2(b) hereof of the
cash deposited with the Exchange Agent, such cash shall be held in trust for
the benefit of the holders of Shares and such cash shall not be used for any
other purposes; provided that the Surviving Corporation may direct the
Exchange Agent to invest such cash, provided that such investments (i) shall
be obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in
commercial paper obligations receiving the highest rating from either
Moody\'s Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Corporation, or
in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances
of domestic commercial banks with capital exceeding $250,000,000
(collectively "Permitted Investments") or in money market funds which are
invested solely in Permitted Investments and (ii) shall have maturities that
will not prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to Section 2.2(b)
hereof. Each holder of a certificate or       3  10  certificates
representing Shares canceled and extinguished at the Effective Time pursuant
to Section 2.1(a) hereof may thereafter surrender such certificate
or certificates to the Exchange Agent, as agent for such holder of such
Shares, to effect the exchange of such certificate or certificates on such
holder\'s behalf for a period ending two hundred seventy (270) days after the
Effective Time.   (b) After surrender to the Exchange Agent of any
certificate which prior to the Effective Time shall have represented any
Shares, the Exchange Agent shall promptly distribute to the person in whose
name such certificate shall have been registered, a check in the amount of
the Merger Consideration into which such Shares shall have been converted at
the Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.1(a) hereof, net of any required Tax
withholdings. Until so surrendered and exchanged, each such certificate
shall, after the Effective Time, be deemed to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, and until such surrender and exchange, no
cash shall be paid to the holder of such outstanding certificate in respect
thereof. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the Merger Consideration. The
Surviving Corporation shall promptly after the Effective Time cause to be
distributed to such holders appropriate materials to facilitate such
surrender.   (c) If payment is to be made to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Shares represented by the certificate or
certificates surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition to
such payment that the certificate or certificates so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer
or other taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than
the registered holder of such Shares or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.   (d) After
the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
certificates representing Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation,
they shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and
in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article II.   (e) If
any cash deposited with the Exchange Agent for purposes of payment in
exchange for Shares remains unclaimed for two hundred seventy (270) days
after the Effective Time, such cash (together with any interest received
or accrued with respect thereto) shall be returned to the Surviving
Corporation, upon demand, and any such holder who has not converted his
Shares into the Merger Consideration prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Surviving Corporation and Exchange Agent
shall not be liable to any holder of Shares for any amount paid to a public
official pursuant to applicable unclaimed property laws. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares seven (7) years after the Effective
Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any      4 
11  Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.5) shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation
free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.   (f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to
the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(a) to pay for Shares for
which dissenter\'s rights have been perfected shall be returned to the
Surviving Corporation, upon demand.   (g) No dividends or other
distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with
a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered certificate for Shares.   (h) From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, other than
the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this
Agreement.   (i)In the event that any Share certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the person claiming such Share certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Share certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Share certificate the Merger Consideration, to which such person is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.1 upon due surrender of and deliverable in respect of
such Share certificate pursuant to this Agreement.   Section 2.3 EXCHANGE OF
CERTIFICATES. Immediately after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall deliver to the record holder of the certificates which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented all the outstanding shares of Merger
Sub Common Stock that were converted into the right to receive shares of
Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.1(c), in exchange for
such certificates, duly endorsed in blank, share certificates, registered in
the name of such record holder, representing the number of shares of Common
Stock to which such record holder is so entitled by virtue of Section
2.1(c).   Section 2.4 DISSENTING SHARES. Notwithstanding Section 2.1, any
Shares which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and which are held by a holder who has not voted such shares of Common
Stock in favor of the Merger and who has delivered a written demand for
relief as a dissenting stockholder in the manner provided by Delaware
Corporate Law and who, as of the Effective Time, shall not have effectively
withdrawn or lost such right to relief as a dissenting stockholder
("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent a right to
receive the Merger Consideration. The holders thereof shall be entitled only
to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of Delaware Corporate Law. Each
holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled to payment for such
Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware    5 
12  Corporate Law shall receive payment therefor from the Surviving
Corporation in accordance with Delaware Corporate Law; provided, however,
that if any such holder of Dissenting Shares (i) shall have failed to
establish his entitlement to relief as a dissenting stockholder as provided
in Section 262 of Delaware Corporate Law, (ii) shall have effectively
withdrawn his demand for relief as a dissenting stockholder with respect to
such Shares or lost his right to relief as a dissenting stockholder and
payment for his Shares under Section 262 of Delaware Corporate Law or (iii)
shall have failed to file a complaint with the appropriate court seeking
relief as to determination of the value of all Dissenting Shares within the
time provided in Section 262 of Delaware Corporate Law, such holder shall
forfeit the right to relief as a dissenting stockholder with respect to such
Shares and each such Share shall be converted into or represent the right to
receive the appropriate Merger Consideration without interest thereon, from
the Surviving Corporation as provided in Section 2.1. The Company shall give
Parent and Merger Sub prompt notice of any demands received by the Company
for relief as a dissenting stockholder, attempted withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to Delaware Corporate Law
received by the Company relating to stockholders\' rights of appraisal,
and Parent and Merger Sub shall have the right to direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent and Merger Sub, make any payment
with respect to, any such demands, or negotiate, offer to settle, or settle
any such demands except as required by law.   Section 2.5 STOCK OPTIONS.
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase
shares of Common Stock (an "Option") granted under the Company\'s Omnibus
Incentive Plan, Employee Stock Purchase Plan and 1996 Non-Employee Director
Stock Option Plan and any similar plan or arrangement providing for the
issuance of options (collectively, the "Option Plans"), whether or not then
exercisable or vested, shall become fully exercisable and vested. At the
Effective Time (A) each Option which is then outstanding shall be canceled
and each Option Plan shall be terminated and (B) in consideration of such
cancellation, and except to the extent that Parent, Merger Sub and the holder
of any such Option otherwise agree, immediately following consummation of the
Merger, the Company shall pay to such holders of Options an amount in respect
thereof equal to the product of (x) the excess of the Merger Consideration
over the exercise price thereof, if any, and (y) the number of shares of
Common Stock subject thereto (such payment to be net of taxes required by law
to be withheld with respect thereto). No payment shall be made with respect
to any Option having a per share exercise price, as in effect at
the Effective Time, equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration. In
connection herewith, the Company shall take all actions required to be taken
under Section 20 of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.     6  13  
ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   Except as
otherwise disclosed to Parent and Merger Sub in a letter of even date
delivered to it prior to the execution hereof (which letter shall contain
appropriate references to identify the representations and warranties herein
to which the information in such letter relates) (the "Company
Disclosure Letter"), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger
Sub as follows:   Section 3.1 ORGANIZATION. The Company is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware and has the corporate power and authority and all necessary
governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry
on its business as it is now being conducted or presently proposed to be
conducted, except where the failure to have such power and authority or
necessary governmental approvals would not, individually or in the aggregate
have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). The Company is
duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or
held under lease or the nature of its business makes such qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified and in good standing
individually or in the aggregate, has not resulted and could not reasonably
be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Company" Material Adverse Effect" means any change in or
effect on the business, assets, properties, results of operations or
condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
(as defined below) that is or could reasonably be expected to be materially
adverse to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or
that could reasonably be expected to materially impair or delay the ability
of the Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement or consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.   Section 3.2
CAPITALIZATION. As of the date hereof the authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of 40,000,000 shares of Common Stock, of which 16,263,928
shares of Common Stock as of the date of this Agreement are issued and
outstanding, and 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.10 per
share (the "Preferred Stock"), of which no shares of Preferred Stock are
issued and outstanding. As of the date of this Agreement, options to purchase
an aggregate of 1,047,050 shares of Common Stock were issued and outstanding,
as set forth in Section 3.2 of the Company Disclosure Letter. All of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock are validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. Except as set forth above or
as specified in Section 3.2 of the Company Disclosure Letter, as of the date
of this Agreement there are no shares of capital stock of the Company issued
or outstanding or any options, warrants, subscriptions, calls, rights,
convertible securities or other agreements or commitments obligating the
Company to issue, transfer, sell, redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire any
shares of its capital stock. All of the foregoing Options shall be canceled
as of the Effective Time.     7  14  Section 3.3 COMPANY
SUBSIDIARIES.   (a) Section 3.3(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets
forth the name of each subsidiary of the Company (collectively, the "Company
Subsidiaries") and the state or jurisdiction of its incorporation. Each
Company Subsidiary is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has
the corporate power and authority and all necessary government approvals to
own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now
being conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing and in
good standing or to have such power and authority or necessary governmental
approvals would not individually or in the aggregate have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed and in
good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the property
owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except in such jurisdictions
where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing
would not individually or in the aggregate have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   (b)Except as set forth in Section 3.3(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, the Company is, directly or indirectly, the record and
beneficial owner of all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each of
the Company Subsidiaries, there are no proxies with respect to any such
shares, and no equity securities of any Company Subsidiary are or may become
required to be issued by reason of any options, warrants, rights to subscribe
to, calls or commitments of any character whatsoever relating to, or
securities or rights convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for,
shares of any capital stock of any Company Subsidiary, and there are no
contracts, commitments, understandings or arrangements by which the Company
or any Company Subsidiary is or may be bound to issue, redeem, purchase or
sell additional shares of capital stock of any Company Subsidiary or
securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any such
shares. Except as set forth in Section 3.3(b) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, all of such shares so owned by the Company are validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and are owned by it free and clear of any Encumbrances
(as defined in Section 3.5), restraints on alienation, or any other
restrictions with respect to the transferability or assignability thereof
(other than restrictions on transfer imposed by federal or state securities
laws).   (c)Except for the Company Subsidiaries and as set forth in
the Financial Statements (as hereinafter defined) of the Company or in
Section 3.3(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company does not
directly or indirectly own any equity or similar interest in, or any interest

The Company has the corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and to carry out its obligations hereunder. The execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly      
8  15  authorized by the Company\'s Board of Directors, and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, other than, with
respect to the Merger, the adoption of this Agreement by the affirmative vote
of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (the
"Requisite Company Vote"). Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming this
Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger
Sub) constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium and other laws affecting
creditors\' rights generally from time to time in effect and to general
equitable principles. At a meeting on July 9, 2000, the Board of Directors of
the Company (i) unanimously adopted the plan of merger set forth in Articles
I and II of this Agreement and approved this Agreement and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) unanimously determined that
the Merger is advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, the
stockholders of the Company and has determined to recommend to the
stockholders the approval of this Agreement, the Merger, and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) unanimously approved the
Company Voting Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. The Board
of Directors has taken all necessary action so as to render Section 203 of
the Delaware Corporate Law and Article Seventh of the Company\'s Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation inapplicable to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   Section 3.5 CONSENTS
AND APPROVALS; NO VIOLATIONS. Except (a) for applicable requirements of the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR
Act"), the filing of the Proxy Statement (as defined in Section 5.6) with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") pursuant to the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, the "Exchange Act"), the filing of the Certificate of
Merger as required by Delaware Corporate Law or as set forth in Section 3.5
of the Company Disclosure Letter or (b) where the failure to make any filing
with, or to obtain any permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any
court or tribunal or administrative, governmental or regulatory body, agency,
commission, division, department, public body or other authority
(a "Governmental Entity") or other person would not prevent or delay
the consummation of the Merger, or otherwise prevent the Company from
performing its obligations under this Agreement, and would not individually
or in the aggregate have a Company Material Adverse Effect, no filing with,
and no permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Entity
or other person is necessary for the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Except as set forth in Section 3.5 of the
Company Disclosure Letter, neither the execution, delivery or performance of
this Agreement by the Company, the negotiations relating thereto, nor the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor
compliance by the Company with any of the provisions hereof, will (i)
conflict with or result in any breach of any provisions of the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company or the Certificate or Articles of
Incorporation, as the case may be, or Bylaws of any of the Company
Subsidiaries, (ii) result in a violation or breach of, or constitute
(with      9  16  or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a
default (or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation, vesting,
payment, exercise, acceleration, suspension or revocation) under, any of the
terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, deed of trust,
security interest, indenture, license, contract, agreement, plan or other
instrument or obligation to which the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any of their properties or
assets may be bound or affected (collectively, "Contracts"), (iii) conflict
with or violate any foreign or domestic law, statute, ordinance, rule,
regulation, order, judgment or decree ("Law") applicable to the Company
or any Company Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary is or may be bound or affected, (iv) result in the
creation or imposition of any lien, pledge, charge, security interest, claim,
option, right of first refusal, agreement, limitation on the Company\'s or
any Company Subsidiary\'s voting rights, mortgage, lease, sublease, adverse
claim or interest, title defect or other encumbrance of any nature
whatsoever (collectively, an "Encumbrance") on any asset of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or (v) cause the suspension or revocation of any
Company Permit (as defined in Section 3.11), except in the case of clauses
(ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) for violations, breaches, defaults, terminations,
cancellations, accelerations, creations, impositions, suspensions or
revocations which would not individually or in the aggregate have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct
and complete list of all material Contracts to which the Company or any

reasonable, good faith judgment of the Company, is likely individually or in
the aggregate to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, nor is there any
judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any court, governmental

Act, (ii) compliance with the HSR Act, (iii) the filing of the Certificate of

action, or to provide such notice to make such filing, individually or in the
aggregate, has not resulted and could not reasonably be expected to result in
a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Subject to the foregoing, the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub do not, and the
performance of this Agreement by each of Parent and Merger Sub will not:  
(a) conflict with or violate any provision of any Parent or Merger
Sub charter document;   (b) conflict with or violate any foreign or
domestic Law applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or by which any property or
asset of Parent or Merger Sub is or may be bound or affected, except for any
such conflicts or violations which, individually or in the aggregate, have
not resulted and could not reasonably be expected to result in a Parent
Material Adverse Effect; or     20  27   (c) result in any breach of or
constitute a default (or an event which with or without notice or lapse of
time or both, would become a default) under, or give to others any right of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of an Encumbrance on any property or asset of Parent or Merger Sub
under any Contract to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party or by which it or
its assets or properties are or may be bound or affected, except for any such
breaches, defaults or other occurrences which, individually or in the
aggregate, have not resulted and could not reasonably be expected to result
in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   Section 4.5 LITIGATION. There is no
suit, action or proceeding (whether at law or equity, before or by any
federal, state or foreign commission, court, tribunal, board, agency or
instrumentality, or before any arbitrator) pending or, to the best knowledge
of the Merger Sub, threatened against or affecting the Merger Sub, the
outcome of which, in the reasonable judgment of the Merger Sub, is likely
individually or in the aggregate to have a Merger Sub Material
Adverse Effect, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order
of any court, governmental department, commission, agency, instrumentality
or arbitrator outstanding against Merger Sub having, or which, insofar as
can reasonably be foreseen by Merger Sub, in the future may have, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.   Section 4.6 INFORMATION. None of the information
to be supplied by Parent and Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement (as defined in Section 5.4) will, at the
time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement and any amendments or supplements
of the Proxy Statement and at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting
(as defined in Section 5.4), contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated in that Proxy
Statement or necessary in order to make the statements in that Proxy
Statement, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading.   Section 4.7 BROKERS.   No broker, finder or investment
banker is entitled to any brokerage, finder\'s or other fee or commission in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby

receipt of funding pursuant to the Financing Letters (as defined below),
Parent and Merger Sub will have at the Closing sufficient cash, through a
combination of committed capital from Parent\'s investors and commitments
from financial institutions, subject to the conditions set forth in the

herein, to make all other necessary payments by it in connection with the
Merger and the transactions contemplated herein (including the repayment of
certain outstanding indebtedness of the Surviving Corporation) and to pay all
of the related fees and expenses (the "Financing"). The Company shall use all
reasonable efforts to cooperate with and assist Merger Sub in obtaining the
Financing. The parties acknowledge that debt and equity financing commitment
letters have been      21  28  delivered to the Board of Directors of
the Company by Parent (collectively, the "Financing Letters"). Parent has
paid or caused to be paid all commitment fees and similar fees and expenses
set forth in such Financing Letters which are due and payable. Parent and
Merger Sub have no reason to believe that Merger Sub will not be able to
satisfy the terms of the Financing Letters applicable to Parent and Merger
Sub.   ARTICLE V   COVENANTS   Section 5.1 CONDUCT OF BUSINESS BY THE

who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer, employee or director of
Company (the "Indemnification Parties") is, or is threatened to be, made a
party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or
pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is or was an officer, employee
or      29  36  director of Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
or any action or omission by such person in his or her capacity as an officer
or director, or (ii) this Agreement, the Merger or the Transactions

full extent permitted by applicable law, each Indemnification Party against
any losses, claims, liabilities, expenses (including reasonable attorneys\'

accordance herewith in connection with any such threatened or actual claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation. Any Indemnification Party
proposing to assert the right to be indemnified under this Section 5.9(b)
shall, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action against
such Indemnification Party in respect of which a claim is to be made under
this Section 5.9(b) against the Indemnifying Party, notify the Indemnifying
Party of the commencement of such action, enclosing a copy of all papers
served; provided, however, that the failure to provide such notice shall not
affect the obligations of the Indemnifying Party except to the extent
such failure to notify materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party\'s
ability to defend such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation; and
provided, further, however, that no Indemnification Party shall be obligated
to provide any notification pursuant to this Section 5.9(b) prior to the
Effective Time. If any such action is brought against any of the

participate in and, to the extent that they elect by delivering written
notice to such Indemnification Parties promptly after receiving notice of the
commencement of the action from the Indemnification Parties, to assume the
defense of the action and after notice from the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnification Parties of their election to assume the defense, the
Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the Indemnification Parties for any
legal or other expenses except as provided below. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to settle
such action without the consent of the Indemnification Parties; provided,
however, that the Indemnifying Party shall be required to obtain such consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) if the settlement includes
any admission of wrongdoing on the part of the Indemnification Parties or any
decree or restriction of the Indemnification Parties; provided, further, that
no Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such action shall, except with
the consent of the Indemnification Parties (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving
by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnification Parties of a release
from all liability with respect to such action. The Indemnification Parties
will have the right to employ their own counsel in any such action, but the
fees, expenses and other charges of such counsel will be at the expense
of such Indemnification Parties unless (i) the employment of counsel by
the Indemnification Parties has been authorized in writing by the
Indemnifying Party, (ii) the Indemnification Parties have reasonably
concluded (based on written advice of counsel to the Indemnification Parties)
that there may be legal defenses available to them that are different from or
in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Party, (iii) a conflict or
potential conflict exists (based on written advice of counsel to the
Indemnification Party) between the Indemnification Parties and the
Indemnifying Party (in which case the Indemnifying Party      30 
37  will not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf
of the Indemnification Parties, or (iv) the Indemnifying Party have not in
fact employed counsel to assume the defense of such action within a
reasonable time after receiving notice of the commencement of the action, in
each of which cases the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of
counsel will be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party and shall promptly
be paid and advanced by each Indemnifying Party as they become due and
payable in advance of the final disposition of the claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation to the fullest extent and in the manner permitted
by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be
obligated to advance any expenses or costs prior to receipt of an undertaking
by or on behalf of the Indemnification Party to repay any expenses advanced
if it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnification Party is not
entitled to be indemnified against such expense. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party (i) shall
not be liable for any settlement affected without its prior written consent,
and (ii) shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnification Party
to the extent that a court or competent jurisdiction shall determine in a
final and non-appealable order that such indemnification is prohibited by
applicable law. In the event of a final and non-appealable determination by a
court that any payment of expenses is prohibited by applicable law, the
Indemnification Party shall promptly refund to the Indemnifying Party the
amount of all such expenses theretofore advanced pursuant hereto.   (c)
Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained
in effect for not less than six years from the Effective Time the current
policies of the directors\' and officers\' liability insurance maintained by
the Company (provided that Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least equivalent coverage
containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous) with respect
to matters occurring prior to or at the Effective Time and this Agreement and
the matters contemplated herein, provided that in no event shall Parent,
Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend to maintain or
procure insurance coverage pursuant to this Section 5.9 any amount per annum
in excess of 150% of the aggregate premiums paid in 1999 on an annualized
basis for such purpose. In the event the payment of such amount for any year
is insufficient to maintain such insurance or equivalent coverage cannot
otherwise be obtained, the Surviving Corporation shall purchase as much
insurance as may be purchased for the amount indicated.   (d) This Section
5.9 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant third party
rights to, the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnification Parties and their
successors, assigns and heirs and shall be binding on all successors and
assigns of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation.
Each of the Indemnified Parties and the Indemnification Parties shall be
entitled to enforce the covenants contained in this Section 5.9 and
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation acknowledge and
agree that each Indemnified Party and Indemnification Party would suffer
irreparable harm and that no adequate remedy at law exists for a breach of
such covenants and such Indemnified Party or such Indemnification Party shall
be entitled to injunctive       31  38  relief and specific
performance in the event of any breach of any provision in this Section
5.9.   (e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of
its respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or mergers into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each of such
case, the successors and assigns of such Person shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 5.9, which obligations are expressly intended to be
for the irrevocable benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnification Person covered hereby.   Section 5.10 NO SOLICITATION.  
(a) The Company agrees that, prior to the Effective Time, it shall not, and
shall not authorize or permit any Company Subsidiaries or any of its or
the Company Subsidiaries\' directors, officers, employees, investment
bankers, attorneys or other agents or representatives, directly or
indirectly, to invite, solicit, initiate or encourage any inquiries or the
making of any proposal or provide any confidential or non-public information
about the Company or the Company Subsidiaries with respect to any merger,
acquisition, tender offer, consolidation or other business combination
involving the Company (a "Takeover Proposal") or negotiate, explore or
otherwise engage in discussions with any person (other than Parent and Merger
Sub or their directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives) with
respect to any Takeover Proposal or enter into any agreement, arrangement or
understanding requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith, after consultation with and based, among other things, upon advice of
its outside counsel and financial advisor, that it is necessary to do so in
order to act in a manner consistent with its obligations under applicable
law, the Company may, in response to any Superior Proposal (as defined
below), which proposal was not solicited by it and which did not otherwise
result from a breach of this Section 5.10, and subject to providing prior
written notice of its decision to take such action to Parent and Merger Sub
and compliance with the other requirements of this Section 5.10, (i) furnish
information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to any
person making a Superior Proposal pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement no less favorable to the Company than the
Confidentiality Agreement (as determined in good faith by the Company based
on the advice of its outside counsel); and (ii) participate in discussions or
negotiations regarding such Superior Proposal; and provided further that
nothing contained in Section 5.10 shall prohibit the Company from, following
advance written notice to Parent and Merger Sub delivered promptly following
its decision to do so, (i) making and disclosing to the Company\'s
stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated
under the Exchange Act with regard to any tender or exchange offer; (ii)
subject to the restrictions in Section 5.10(b), making any disclosure to the
Company\'s Stockholders which the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in its good faith, after consultation with and based, among other
things, upon advice of its outside legal counsel      32  39  and
financial advisor, that it is necessary to do so in order to act in a
manner consistent with its obligations under applicable law; (iii) conducting
"due diligence" inquiries (which shall be in writing to the extent
reasonably practicable) in response to any Takeover Proposal as the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in its good faith judgment, after
consultation with and based, among other things, upon the advice of its
outside legal counsel to be consistent with its obligations under applicable
law.   (b) Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement, the Board
of Directors shall not (i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to
withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent and Merger Sub, the
approval or recommendation by the Board of Directors of the Company of the
Merger or this Agreement, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal, or (iii) cause the Company to
enter into any Acquisition Agreement (as defined below). If the Board of
Directors of the Company, by a majority vote, determines in its good faith
judgment after consultation with and based, among other things, upon the
advice of its outside legal counsel, that it is required to do so in order to
comply with its duties to shareholders under applicable law, the Board of
Directors of the Company may withdraw its recommendation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or approve or recommend a Superior Proposal, but in each
case only (i) after providing written notice to Parent and Merger Sub (a
"Notice of Superior Proposal") advising Parent and Merger Sub that the Board
of directors of the Company has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying the
person making such Superior Proposal and (ii) if Parent and Merger Sub do
not, within five (5) business days of receipt by Parent and Merger Sub of the
Notice of Superior Proposal, make a binding, written offer that the Board of
Directors of the Company by a majority vote determines in its good faith
judgment (after receipt of advice of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown or another
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation selected by the Board
of Directors of the Company consistent with such determination) to be at
least as favorable, from a financial point of view, to the Company\'s
stockholders as such Superior Proposal.   (c) In addition to the obligations
of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 5.10, the
Company shall promptly advise Parent and Merger Sub orally and in writing
within one business day of any request for information or any Takeover
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request or Takeover
Proposal (and any amendments or proposed amendments thereto) and the identity
of the person making such request or Takeover Proposal.   (d) For purposes
of this Agreement:   (i) "Superior Proposal" means any proposal made by a
third party  to acquire, directly or indirectly, including pursuant to a
tender  offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation, business combination,

cash and/or securities, all or substantially all of the  shares of the
Company\'s capital stock then outstanding or all or  substantially all the
assets      33  40   of the Company, on terms which the Board of
Directors of the Company  determines in its good faith judgment to be more
favorable to the  Company\'s stockholders than the Merger and for which
financing, to the  extent required, is then committed or which, in the good
faith  judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, is reasonably 
capable of being obtained by such third party.   (ii) "Acquisition
Agreement" means any letter of intent,  agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement or  other similar agreement, contract or
commitment related to any  Takeover Proposal.   Section 5.11 ADDITIONAL
MATTERS. Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of the
parties hereto agrees to use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including

construed to require, Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, in connection with
the receipt of any regulatory approval, to proffer to, or agree to (i) sell
or hold separate and agree to sell, divest or to discontinue to or limit,
before or after the Effective Time, any assets, businesses or interest in any
assets or businesses of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their
respective affiliates (or to the consent to any sale, or agreement to sell,
or discontinuance or limitation by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as the
case may be, of any of its assets or businesses) or (ii) agree to any
conditions relating to, or changes or restriction in, the operations of any
such asset or business which, in either case, could reasonably be expected to
result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect or a Company Material Adverse
Effect or to materially and adversely impact the economic or
business benefits to such party of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   Section 5.12 OFFER TO REPURCHASE CERTAIN SHARES. On or prior to
September 1, 2000, the Company shall offer to purchase from the Company

person shall have made a public announcement or otherwise communicated to the

amount of $7,200,000 (such fee, the "Termination Fee").   (b) Any payment

agrees that it shall pay to Merger Sub an amount equal to Parent\'s and
Merger Sub\'s documented Expenses directly related to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby if Parent and Merger Sub terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g) provided that Company shall have no
such obligation if the Company was entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(f) (unless the event giving rise to the Company\'s
right to terminate under Section 7.1(f) was caused by a breach by the Company
referred to in Section 7.1(g))or Section 7.1(h). Parent and Merger Sub agree
that Parent and Merger Sub shall pay to the Company an amount equal to the
Company\'s documented Expenses directly related to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby if the Company terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(h), provided the Parent and Merger Sub shall have no
such obligation if Parent and Merger Sub were entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g).   (d) The Company acknowledges that
the agreements contained in this Section 7.5 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails to pay promptly the Termination Fee, and,
in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit which
results in a judgment against the Company for the Termination Fee, the
Company shall pay to Parent and Merger Sub their Expenses in connection with
such suit, together with interest on the amount of the Termination Fee at the
prime rate of Fleet National Bank in effect on the date such payment was

THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL

provisions of this Agreement and of the documents referred to in this
Agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and by those documents, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a
defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or
enforcement of this Agreement or of any such document, that it is not subject
to this Agreement or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought
or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be
appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced
in or by such courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all
claims with respect to such action or proceeding shall be heard and
determined in such a federal court. The parties hereby consent to and grant
any such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the

RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES

shall have received counterparts hereof signed by all of the other parties
hereto.   Section 8.10 SEVERABILITY. If any term or other provision of this

nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.   Section 8.11 SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. The
parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the failure of any party to perform
its agreements and covenants hereunder, including its failure to take all
actions as are necessary on its part to the consummation of the Merger, will
cause irreparable injury to the other parties, for which damages, even if
available, will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party hereby
consents to the issuance of injunctive relief by any court of competent
jurisdiction to compel performance of such party\'s obligations and to the
granting by any court of the remedy of specific performance of its
obligations hereunder.      44  51   Section 8.12 ENTIRE AGREEMENT; NO
THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. This Agreement (including any exhibits and annexes
to this Agreement), (i) constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all
prior agreements, representations and warranties, and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement and (ii) except for the provisions of Article II and Sections
