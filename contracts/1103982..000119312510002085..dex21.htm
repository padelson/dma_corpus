Buyer and Seller shall, during the thirty (30)&nbsp;days following such delivery, consult with each other in good faith and exercise reasonable efforts to attempt to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine, as may be
required, a mutually agreed Closing Inventory Amount. If during such period or any mutually agreed upon extension thereof, Buyer and Seller are unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter retain a nationally recognized accounting
firm which is reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller and which has no material relationship with Buyer, Seller or their respective Affiliates or other material conflict (in either case, the &#147;<B>Independent Expert</B>&#148;) to review this
<U>Section&nbsp;1.8</U>, the definitions for the terms used herein and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of promptly calculating Closing Inventory Amount, which amount shall not be more than the amount thereof shown in Seller&#146;s

a reasonable engagement letter. The Independent Expert shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator. If Buyer and Seller do not promptly agree to such selection, which shall occur no later than five (5)&nbsp;days after the end of the 30-day
period referred to above, then each shall select an independent accounting firm of nationally recognized standing and such two independent accounting firms shall jointly select the Independent Expert pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;1.8(c)</U>. In
making its calculation in accordance with this Agreement, the Independent Expert will make its determination based solely on presentations by Seller and Buyer and not by independent review and shall consider only those items or amounts in
Seller&#146;s calculation of the Closing Inventory Amount as to which Buyer has disagreed. The Independent Expert shall deliver to Buyer and Seller, as promptly as practicable, a written report setting forth such calculation. Such report shall be
final and binding upon Buyer and Seller. Buyer and Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Expert to render its decision as soon as reasonably practicable, including by promptly complying with all reasonable requests
by the Independent Expert for information, books, records and similar items. The costs, fees and expenses of the Independent Expert engaged pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;1.8(c</U>) shall be borne proportionately by Buyer and Seller to the extent
that Buyer&#146;s and Seller&#146;s respective calculations of Closing Inventory differ from the Independent Expert&#146;s determination. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:8%"><FONT
