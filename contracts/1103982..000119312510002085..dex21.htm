1.7 _Consideration_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, in consideration for the transfer of the Included Assets by Seller or
its Affiliates to Buyer or its designated Affiliates pursuant to  _Section
1.2_, at the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause its designated Affiliates
to, (a) pay, or cause to be paid, to Seller or its Affiliates an aggregate
cash 



 

25  purchase price equal to Three Billion Seven Hundred Million United States
Dollars ($3,700,000,000) (the "Initial Purchase Price"), subject to adjustment
pursuant to the inventory adjustment set forth in _Section 1.8_ (as so
adjusted, the "Final Purchase Price"), and (b) assume the Included Liabilities
as specified in _Section 1.5_.

1.8 _Inventory Adjustment_.

(a) _Closing Inventory Calculation_. _Schedule 1.8_ is a statement setting
forth Sellers estimate of the type and value of the Inventory of the
Business, in each case to be transferred to Buyer pursuant to _Section 1.2_
on the Closing Date. As soon as practicable, but in no event later than ninety
(90) days following the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a report
setting forth Sellers calculation of the dollar amount of the Inventory as
of the close of business on the Closing Date (the "Closing Inventory Amount")
prepared as described herein. The Closing Inventory Amount and Final Inventory
Amount shall be determined in a manner consistent with GAAP and with the past
practice of the Business and the Financial Information to the extent the past
practices of the Business and such Financial Information are consistent with
GAAP (the "Closing Inventory Statement"). In the event of any conflict
between the past practice of the Business and the Financial Information, on
the one hand, and GAAP, on the other hand, GAAP shall control. For purposes of
calculating the value of the Inventory under this _Section 1.8(a)_, Canadian
dollars will be converted to U.S. dollars at the rate of 1-to-0.91.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Closing Inventory Amount shall be
calculated excluding any items for amounts with respect to Taxes, if any, and
without giving effect to any changes or adjustments arising from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Collateral Agreements. Upon
the reasonable request of the other party, each party shall provide to the
other party and/or its designated independent certified public accountants
access to the books and records, any other information, including working
papers of its accountants, and to any employees, the Transferred Facilities
and the facilities that are leased pursuant to the Transferred Leases
necessary for the other party to prepare the Closing Inventory Amount, and to
prepare or to respond to a notice of disagreement delivered pursuant to
_Section 1.8(b)_ and to prepare materials for presentation to the
Independent Expert in connection with _Section 1.8(c)_, and each party shall
otherwise cooperate and assist the other party as may be reasonably necessary
to carry out the purposes of this  _Section 1.8_. Buyer and/or its
designated independent certified public accountants shall have the right to be
present to observe and verify the taking of any physical inventory in
conjunction with the preparation of Sellers calculation of the Closing
Inventory Amount, and, at any time after Sellers notice of its calculation of
the Closing Inventory Amount but prior to the determination of the Final
Inventory Amount in accordance with this _Section 1.8_, may review and
examine the procedures, books, records and work papers of Seller relating to
such calculation.

(b) _Notice of Disagreement_. If Buyer disagrees with Sellers calculation of
the Closing Inventory Amount delivered pursuant to _Section 1.8(a)_ in good
faith, Buyer may, within thirty (30) days following such delivery, notify
Seller in writing that it objects to the computation of said amount,
specifying those items and amounts as to which Buyer disagrees with a written
explanation of the reasons for disagreement with each such item and amount,
and its alternative computation of each such item and amount; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the only bases for objection shall be (i) non-compliance with
the standards set forth in this _Section 1.8_ for the preparation of the
Closing Inventory Statement and (ii) computational errors. Buyer shall be 



 

26  deemed to have agreed with all items and amounts contained in Sellers
calculation of the Closing Inventory Amount that it has not disputed in
accordance with the foregoing. If Buyer fails to deliver such written notice
within such 30-day period, Sellers calculation of the Closing Inventory
Amount shall be the Final Inventory Amount, which shall be binding upon the
parties.

(c) _Dispute Resolution_. If a notice of disagreement shall be duly delivered
pursuant to _Section 1.8(b)_, Buyer and Seller shall, during the thirty (30)
days following such delivery, consult with each other in good faith and
exercise reasonable efforts to attempt to reach agreement on the disputed
items or amounts in order to determine, as may be required, a mutually agreed
Closing Inventory Amount. If during such period or any mutually agreed upon
extension thereof, Buyer and Seller are unable to reach such agreement, they
shall promptly thereafter retain a nationally recognized accounting firm
which is reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller and which has no material
relationship with Buyer, Seller or their respective Affiliates or other
material conflict (in either case, the "Independent Expert") to review this 
_Section 1.8_, the definitions for the terms used herein and the disputed
items or amounts for the purpose of promptly calculating Closing Inventory
Amount, which amount shall not be more than the amount thereof shown in
Sellers calculations delivered pursuant to _Section 1.8(a)_ nor less than
the amount thereof shown in Buyers calculation delivered pursuant to _Section
1.8(b)_. Each party agrees to execute, if requested by the Independent
Expert, a reasonable engagement letter. The Independent Expert shall act as
an expert and not as an arbitrator. If Buyer and Seller do not promptly agree
to such selection, which shall occur no later than five (5) days after the end
of the 30-day period referred to above, then each shall select an independent
accounting firm of nationally recognized standing and such two independent
accounting firms shall jointly select the Independent Expert pursuant to this
_Section 1.8(c)_. In making its calculation in accordance with this
Agreement, the Independent Expert will make its determination based solely on
presentations by Seller and Buyer and not by independent review and shall
consider only those items or amounts in Sellers calculation of the Closing
Inventory Amount as to which Buyer has disagreed. The Independent Expert shall
deliver to Buyer and Seller, as promptly as practicable, a written report
setting forth such calculation. Such report shall be final and binding upon
Buyer and Seller. Buyer and Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Independent Expert to render its decision as soon as reasonably
practicable, including by promptly complying with all reasonable requests by
the Independent Expert for information, books, records and similar items. The
costs, fees and expenses of the Independent Expert engaged pursuant to this
_Section 1.8(c_) shall be borne proportionately by Buyer and Seller to the
extent that Buyers and Sellers respective calculations of Closing Inventory
differ from the Independent Experts determination.

(d) _Adjustment of Purchase Price_. If the Final Inventory Amount exceeds the
target inventory amount identified on _Schedule 1.8_ for the month in which
the Closing Date occurs (the "Target Closing Inventory Amount"), Buyer shall
pay to Seller, as an adjustment to the Initial Purchase Price, in the manner
and with interest as provided in _Section 1.8(e)_, the amount of such excess.
If the Target Closing Inventory Amount exceeds the Final Inventory Amount,
Seller shall pay to Buyer, as an adjustment to the Initial Purchase Price, in
the manner and with interest as provided in _Section 1.8(e)_, the amount of
such excess. The "Final Inventory Amount" means the Closing Inventory Amount
(i) as shown in Sellers calculation delivered pursuant to _Section 1.8(a)_
if no notice of disagreement with respect thereto is duly delivered
pursuant to _Section 1.8(b)_; or (ii) if such a notice of disagreement is
delivered, (A) as 



 

27  agreed by Buyer and Seller pursuant to _Section 1.8(c)_ or _(B)_ in the
absence of such agreement, as shown in the Independent Experts calculation
delivered pursuant to  _Section 1.8(c)_; _provided_ that in no event shall
the Final Inventory Amount be more than Sellers calculation of the Closing
Inventory Amount delivered pursuant to _Section 1.8(a)_ or less than
Buyers calculation of the Closing Inventory Amount delivered pursuant to
_Section 1.8(b)._

(e) _Payment of Adjustment_. Any payment pursuant to _Section 1.8(d)_ shall
be made within ten (10) Business Days after the Final Inventory Amount has
been determined by delivery by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the other party or by causing such
payments to be credited to such account of such other party as may be
designated by such other party; _provided_ that if Buyer shall have delivered
a notice of disagreement pursuant to _Section 1.8(b)_ and either (i) Buyers
and Sellers calculations of Closing Inventory Amount would both require a
payment by Buyer pursuant to _Section 1.8(d)_ or (ii) Buyers and Sellers
calculations of Closing Inventory Amount would both require a payment by
Seller pursuant to _Section 1.8(d)_ (although in each case there is
disagreement as to the amount of such payment), then Buyer or Seller, as the
case may be, shall pay the lesser of the amounts that would be payable
pursuant to _Section 1.8(d)_ based on their respective calculations of
Closing Inventory Amount within ten (10) Business Days of the date such notice
of disagreement was delivered, and any such payment shall be credited against
the payment required by _Section 1.8(e)_. Any payment made pursuant to this
_Section 1.8_ shall be accompanied by the payment of interest on the amount
so paid, from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of the
payment, calculated on a monthly basis at the prime rate of interest, as
published from time to time in The Wall Street Journal during the period
beginning at the Effective Time and ending on the date of payment.

1.9 _Prorations_. On the Closing Date, or as promptly as practicable following
the Closing Date, but in no event later than sixty (60) days thereafter,
Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a statement setting forth the
proration of the water, gas, electricity and other utilities, rent payable to
lessors, common area maintenance reimbursements to lessors, local business or
other license fees, merchants association dues, and other similar charges
(the "Charges") payable with respect to the Included Assets, the Transferred
Facilities, the facilities that are the subject of the Transferred Leases or
the Business, which shall be prorated between Buyer and Seller effective as of
the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent practicable,
utility meter readings for any Transferred Facilities for which Seller is
responsible for the payment of utility charges shall be determined as of the
Effective Time. If Sellers prorated share of the Charges exceeds the amount
of Charges prepaid with respect to the Business as of the Effective Time,
Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of such excess. If the amount of Charges
prepaid with respect to the Business as of the Effective Time exceed Sellers
prorated share of the Charges, Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount of such
excess. Any payment of prorated amounts hereunder shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
receiving party within ten (10) Business Days after delivery by Buyer of
the statement referred to in the first sentence of this _Section 1.9_. This
_Section 1.9_ does not relate to proration of Taxes, such matter being the
subject of _Section 7.6(a)_.

1.10 _Rights Under Seller Insurance Policies_. If any Included Asset or the
Business suffers or has suffered any damage, destruction or other casualty
loss (in each case, a "Casualty Loss") that is insured under one or more
insurance policies currently maintained with respect to 



 

28  the Included Assets and the Business (the "Seller Insurance Policies"), and
arises or has arisen prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall, or shall cause
its appropriate Affiliate to, (a) assert a claim under the appropriate Seller
Insurance Policies, and (b)(i) surrender to Buyer after the Closing Date any
insurance proceeds received by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller under any
Seller Insurance Policy with respect to such Casualty Loss, less any amount
of cash or proceeds applied by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller to the
physical restoration of such asset, and (ii) assign to Buyer all rights of
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller with respect to any causes of action (other
than the rights with respect to causes of actions under the Seller Insurance
Policies, which are hereby expressly retained by Seller), whether or not
litigation has commenced as of the Effective Time, in connection with such
Casualty Loss. Buyer acknowledges that any and all Seller Insurance Policies
are owned and maintained by Seller or an Affiliate of Seller and are Excluded
Assets.

1.11 _Allocation of Final Purchase Price_. The purchase price, as properly
determined for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, shall be allocated in its
entirety among the Included Assets, the Licensed Intellectual Property and the
covenant not to compete set forth in _Section 5.5_ in accordance with Section
1060 of the Code and any similar provision of state, local or foreign law, as
applicable. Prior to Closing, Buyer and Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to tentatively agree on an Allocation Schedule (the
"Initial Allocation Schedule") setting forth that portion of the purchase
price (i) to be allocated to the Canadian Seller for the Canadian Included
Assets (including inventory, approximately four employees and certain
specified contracts), (ii) to be allocated to Seller and each of its U.S.
Affiliates that is selling assets hereunder for the Included Assets, the
Licensed Intellectual Property and the covenant not to compete set forth in
_Section 5.5_ (other than the Canadian Included Assets), and (iii) to be paid
by Buyer and each of its Affiliates intending to purchase assets hereunder.
Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a tentative updated allocation
schedule within one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing Date (the
"Tentative Final Allocation Schedule"). Buyer agrees to share the underlying
valuation and methodology of the Tentative Final Allocation Schedule with
Seller and consider in good faith any views or comments of Seller in revising
the Tentative Final Allocation Schedule. Buyer will provide to Seller any
revised Tentative Final Allocation Schedule promptly after receiving such
views or comments of Seller (if any). The Tentative Final Allocation Schedule,
as so revised, shall be the final allocation schedule (the "Final Allocation
Schedule") unless Seller believes that the Tentative Final Allocation
Schedule, as so revised, is substantially and materially incorrect and
provides notice of such disagreement within 30 days after receipt of such
revised Tentative Final Allocation Schedule from Buyer. If Seller provides
such notice, neither party shall be bound by the Initial Allocation Schedule
or the Tentative Final Allocation Schedule and Buyer and Seller shall
cooperate in good faith to resolve such dispute and agree upon an allocation
schedule, which shall be the Final Allocation Schedule. Buyer and Seller agree
to file all income Tax Returns (including, without limitation, IRS Form 8594)
consistent with the Final Allocation Schedule unless otherwise required by
Applicable Law. If the Final Purchase Price is adjusted pursuant to _Section
8.8_, the Final Allocation Schedule shall be adjusted in a manner consistent
with the foregoing procedures. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, Buyer
and Seller hereby agree that the Licensed Intellectual Property shall be
treated as having been sold to Buyer or its permitted assignee, as the case
may be.

3.1 _Seller s Authority; No Conflicts_.

(a) Seller and each Seller Affiliate is a corporation or limited liability
company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under its
respective state or other jurisdiction of organization. Seller and its

and its applicable Affiliates to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the Collateral Agreements to which they are
a party and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby have been duly and properly taken. No other corporate proceedings on
the part of Seller or its applicable Affiliates are necessary to authorize
this Agreement and the Collateral Agreements to which they are a party and to
authorize the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. This Agreement has been, and each of the Collateral Agreements
to which Seller and its applicable Affiliates are a party at the Closing will
be, duly executed and delivered by Seller or such Affiliate and, assuming the
due execution hereof and thereof by Buyer or an Affiliate, this Agreement
constitutes, and each of the Collateral Agreements will constitute, the valid

(b) The execution, delivery and performance by Seller and the Seller
Affiliates of this Agreement does not and will not, and the execution,
delivery and performance by Seller or an Affiliate of each of the Collateral
Agreements to which Seller or such Affiliate is a party will not, in any
material respect, violate, breach, conflict with, constitute (with or without
due notice or lapse of time or both) a Default under, or result in the
creation of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) on any Included Assets or
the Business under (i) any provision of Sellers or such Affiliates
certificate of incorporation, by-laws or equivalent organizational documents,
(ii) subject to the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the

Applicable Law that is applicable to Seller or such Affiliate or any of their
respective properties or assets or (iii) except as set forth in _Schedule
3.1(b)_ , any material Contract or Permit to which Seller or such Affiliate is
a party or by which any of their respective properties or assets is bound. No
material Consents of Governmental Authorities are required to be obtained by
Seller or its Affiliates in connection with the execution or delivery of this
Agreement and the Collateral Agreements to which they are party, or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, other
than filings and other applicable requirements under the HSR Act, the
Competition Act and any similar foreign Applicable Law.

Sellers obligation to update such lists pursuant to _Section 5.12_. In
addition, _Schedule 3.4(a)(i)_ sets forth any material Trademark or Patents
that to Sellers Knowledge would otherwise have constituted (i) registrations

Intellectual Property, including the right to receive royalty payments based
on Sellers, Sellers Affiliates or Sellers customers license, sale or use
of the Products, and no Licensed Intellectual Property or Retained
Intellectual Property licensed under the Collateral Agreements will require
Buyer and its 



 

36  Affiliates to pay a royalty to Seller, its Affiliates, or any third party
under the Collateral Agreements based on Sellers, Sellers Affiliates or
Sellers customers license, sale or use of the Products. Other than in
respect of the licenses set forth in _Schedule 3.4(b)(i)_ and _Schedule
3.4(b)(ii)_ , no Person has any interest or other right in or to any
modifications, improvements, or enhancements to the Transferred Intellectual
Property or Licensed Intellectual Property made by or on behalf of Buyer or
its Affiliates after the Closing Date. Neither Seller nor its Affiliates have
granted any exclusive rights to any Transferred Intellectual Property or
Licensed Intellectual Property to any Person. Except as set forth in _Schedule
3.4(a)(v)_ , there are no material Proceedings that have been served upon
Seller or its Affiliates, there are no material Proceedings of which Seller
or its Affiliates have otherwise been notified or have knowledge, and to
Sellers Knowledge, no material Proceedings are threatened, in each case which
challenge any rights in respect of any of the Transferred Intellectual
Property or Licensed Intellectual Property or the validity or enforceability
thereof, and neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates has received any written
notice or claims challenging Sellers or its Affiliates exclusive ownership
of (or, in the case of Third Party Intellectual Property, Sellers or its
Affiliates right to use) any material Transferred Intellectual Property or
Licensed Intellectual Property. There are no material outstanding Judgments
relating to the Transferred Intellectual Property, or against any Licensed
Intellectual Property or Retained Intellectual Property that would adversely
affect the licenses granted under the Collateral Agreements. Seller and its
Affiliates are not in Default under any Judgment against Seller or its
Affiliates with respect to the Transferred Intellectual Property, or with
respect to any Licensed Intellectual Property or Retained Intellectual
Property that would adversely affect the licenses granted under the

_Schedule 3.4(b)(ii)_ lists all Third Party Intellectual Property Agreements
other than the Non-Material In-Licenses and Third Party Intellectual Property
Agreements in respect of Excluded Software (collectively, the "Seller
Licenses-In"). Seller has delivered to Buyer copies of all Seller Licenses-Out
and Seller Licenses-In. There are no outstanding and, to Sellers Knowledge,
no threatened, material disputes or disagreements with respect to any such

(c) To Sellers Knowledge, (i) there has been no material misappropriation or
unauthorized disclosure by any Person of any Trade Secrets and Know-How used
in, held for use in or related to the Business as it is currently conducted,
(ii) no employee, independent contractor or agent of Seller or its Affiliates
has misappropriated any Trade Secrets and Know-How of any other Person in the
course of performance as an employee, independent contractor or agent of the
Business in any material respect; and (iii) no employee, independent
contractor or agent of Seller or its Affiliates is in material default or
breach of any term of any employment agreement, non-disclosure agreement,
assignment of invention agreement or similar agreement relating to the
Transferred Intellectual Property and Licensed Intellectual Property.

(d) Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.4(d)_ , neither Seller nor its
Affiliates have infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated the
Intellectual Property of any Person in any material respect, and Seller and
its Affiliates are not currently infringing, misappropriating or 



 

37  otherwise violating the Intellectual Property of any Person in any material
respect, in each case as it relates to the Products and/or the Business. No
claim of such infringement, misappropriation or other violation of
Intellectual Property that has been served upon Seller or its Affiliates or of
which Seller has otherwise been notified or has Knowledge is pending or, to
Sellers Knowledge, threatened against Seller or any of its Affiliates, and
neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates has received any written notice
alleging any such infringement, misappropriation or other violation of
Intellectual Property, other than routine cease and desist letters
or infringement claims or notices received in the ordinary course of business
that are not material to any item of Transferred Intellectual Property or
Licensed Intellectual Property and that have been resolved as of the date of
this Agreement. 

(e) The Transferred Intellectual Property, the Intellectual Property to be
licensed to Buyer or its designated Affiliates under the General Intellectual
Property License Agreement and Transitional Trademark License, the Third Party
Intellectual Property licensed or sublicensed to Buyer and its Affiliates
pursuant to the General Intellectual Property License Agreement and the
rights to Intellectual Property under the Transferred Contracts (subject to
the terms and conditions therein) are sufficient to operate the Business
immediately following the Closing Date in substantially the same manner as

on behalf of any Business Employees.

standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Buyer and/or its designated
Affiliates have all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and each of the Collateral Agreements to which they are
a party, and to perform their respective obligations hereunder and
thereunder. All other corporate proceedings required to be taken by Buyer
and/or its designated Affiliates to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the Collateral Agreements to which they are
a party and the consummation of the 



 

48  transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly and properly
taken. No other corporate proceedings on the part of Buyer and/or its
designated Affiliates are necessary to authorize this Agreement and the
Collateral Agreements to which they are a party and to authorize the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. This
Agreement has been, and each of the Collateral Agreements to which Buyer
and/or its designated Affiliates are a party at Closing will be, duly
executed and delivered by Buyer and/or its designated Affiliates and, assuming
the due execution hereof and thereof by Seller and its Affiliates party
thereto, this Agreement and each of the Collateral Agreements to which they
are a party when executed will constitute, the valid and binding obligation of
Buyer and/or its designated Affiliates, enforceable against Buyer and/or its
designated Affiliates in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement
hereof and thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy insolvency or other
similar laws affecting creditors rights generally and by general equitable
principles.

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Buyer does
not and will not, and the execution, delivery and performance by Buyer and/or
its designated Affiliates of each Collateral Agreement to which they are a
party will not in any material respect violate, breach, conflict with,
constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a Default
under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) on
any asset of Buyer and/or its designated Affiliates under (i) any provision of
Buyers or such Affiliates articles of incorporation, by-laws or similar
organizational documents, (ii) subject to the expiration or termination of
the waiting period under the HSR Act or any similar foreign Applicable Law,
any Judgment or Applicable Law that is applicable to Buyer, such Affiliates or
any of their respective properties or assets or (iii) any material Contract
or Permit to which Buyer or such Affiliates is a party or by which any of its
properties or assets is bound. No Consents of Governmental Authorities are
required to be obtained by Buyer or its Affiliates in connection with the
execution or delivery of this Agreement and the Collateral Agreements to which
they are party, or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, other than (i) filings and other applicable requirements under
the HSR Act, the Competition Act and any similar foreign Applicable Law and
(ii) such other Consents of Governmental Authorities, the failure of which to
obtain, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on Buyers ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

4.2 _Litigation; Proceedings_. There are no material (a) outstanding Judgments
against Buyer or its Affiliates that would prevent, or otherwise materially
adversely affect the ability of Buyer or such Affiliates to consummate,
the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Collateral Agreements; or (b)
Proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Buyer, threatened against Buyer or
such Affiliates, that would prevent, or otherwise materially adversely affect
the ability of Buyer or such Affiliates to consummate, the transactions
contemplated hereby or by the Collateral Agreements.

4.3  _Availability of Funds_. Buyer has cash available or existing borrowing
facilities or commitments which, together with available cash, are sufficient
to enable it to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



 

49 4.4 _Brokers_. None of Buyer or any of Buyers officers, directors, employees
or Affiliates have employed or made any agreement with any broker, finder or
similar agent or any Person or firm that will result in the obligation of
Seller or any of its Affiliates to pay any finders fee, brokerage fees or
commission or similar payment in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

4.5 _Applicable Buyer Brand Data_. _Schedule 4.5_  sets forth a statement of
the net sales of the Applicable Buyer Brand for the twelve-month period ended
November 30, 2009, which has been calculated in a manner materially consistent
with GAAP.

ARTICLE 5

_COVENANTS OF SELLER_

Seller covenants and agrees as follows:

5.1 _Access_.

(a) Prior to the Closing, subject to Applicable Law, Seller will grant to
Buyer or cause to be granted to Buyer and its Representatives (collectively
who are subject to the same obligations of secrecy and non-use as Buyer under
the Confidentiality Agreement) reasonable access, during normal business
hours (except as provided below) and upon reasonable notice, to the personnel,
properties, books and records of Seller and its Affiliates to the extent
relating to the Business, Included Assets, Included Liabilities or Products,
including access to the Transferred Facilities, the facilities subject to a
Transferred Lease and Shared Facilities; _provided_ , in each case that such
access will be made in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the
normal operations of Seller, its Affiliates or the Business, and will not
include any right by Buyer or its Representatives to conduct any Phase II
environmental site assessment or any other environmental sampling or testing;
_provided further_ , _however_ , that any such access to any Shared Facility
shall be (i) outside of normal business hours and (ii) shall be supervised and
escorted by Representatives of Seller and its Affiliates. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller will not be required to disclose any information or provide
access to Buyer solely to the extent such disclosure or access would, in
Sellers reasonable discretion, (A) cause significant competitive harm to the
Business if the transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated,
including without limitation access to Formulations, Specifications and
Processing Instructions, or (B) result in a waiver of any attorney-client
privilege or other legal privilege.

(b) Seller shall furnish to Buyer and its Representatives all financial,
operating and other data and information relating to the Business as Buyer or
its Affiliates, through their respective Representatives, may reasonably
request, including unaudited monthly management reports prepared on a basis
consistent with past practice of the Business as such reports become
available for each month falling within the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Closing Date.

5.2 _Ordinary Conduct of the Business_. Except as permitted by the terms of
this Agreement or as may be necessary to comply with Applicable Law, from the
date hereof to the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates will use their
commercially reasonable efforts to conduct the 



 

50  Business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and the
historical growth of the Business, including the filing, maintenance and
prosecution of Intellectual Property registrations and applications, and will
not take any action inconsistent with this Agreement or with the consummation
of the Closing. Seller and its Affiliates shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts consistent with past practice to preserve intact
the Business and the Included Assets and to maintain relationships with third
Persons to preserve the goodwill of the Business, including, without
limitation, suppliers, distributors, brokers, co-manufacturers, customers and
employees of the Business. From the date hereof to the Closing, Seller shall
give Buyer prompt written notice (and in any case within three (3) Business
Days) if Seller or any of its Affiliates receives any written communication
from any customer, distributor, supplier, broker or co-manufacturer named or
required to be named on _Schedule 3.7_ of any intention to terminate or
materially reduce purchases of Products from, sales of supplies to or the
brokerage or co-manufacturer relationship with Seller, its Affiliates or the
Business. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as provided
in this Agreement or as may be necessary to comply with Applicable Law
(provided Seller promptly notifies Buyer in writing of any such action taken
or not taken due to a requirement of Applicable Law), Seller shall not, and
shall cause its Affiliates not to, without the prior written consent of Buyer
(not to be unreasonably withheld):

(a) Sell, assign, transfer, convey, lease or otherwise dispose of or abandon
any of the Transferred Facilities, facilities subject to a material
Transferred Lease or material Included Assets, except in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice or the disposition of obsolete or
inoperable Included Assets; in addition, to the extent that any such Included
Assets constitute Transferred Intellectual Property, abandon, permit to
lapse, or in the case of Transferred Patents, not file in a timely manner in a
jurisdiction where Seller or its Affiliates are conducting the Business any
application or in the case of the Transferred Patents filing; however,
nothing in this _Section 5.2(a)_ will require Seller or its Affiliates to
make an application, registration, or other filing regarding Transferred
Patents in jurisdictions where Seller and its Affiliates are not conducting
the Business as of the Closing Date;

(b) Mortgage, pledge, or encumber any material portion of the Included
Assets, the Transferred Facilities or facilities leased pursuant to the
Transferred Leases, other than to Permitted Liens;

(c) Except (i) to the extent required by any Seller Plan or other binding
agreement as they exist on the date hereof, (ii) as effected in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, (iii) as would relate to
substantially all other similarly situated employees of Seller or its
Affiliates who participate in the applicable Seller Plan (including those
outside of the Business) and would not result in a material increase in
benefits to such employees or (iv) as set forth on _Schedule 5.2(c)_ for
which Seller or its Affiliates shall be solely liable, materially increase the
compensation or benefits of any current employee of the Business (including,
without limitation, under any bonus, severance, termination pay or retention
arrangement and including any increase that would affect such employee
following termination of employment), or adopt, enter into or amend in any
material respect any Seller Plan, agreement (including, without limitation,
any employment agreement), trust, fund or other arrangement for the benefit or
welfare of any current employee of the Business, or pay any material benefit
not required by any such existing Seller Plan or arrangement;



 

51 (d) Except as set forth in _Schedule 5.2(d)(i)_ and other than in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice and the historical growth of
the Business, enter into, renew, amend in any material respect or terminate
any Transferred Contract listed on _Schedule 3.6(a)_ (or that would be
required to be listed on or required to be listed on _Schedule 3.6(a)_ had
such Contract been entered into prior to the date hereof) or any Included
Shared Contract; _provided_ , that Buyers consent (which may be withheld in
its sole discretion) shall be required for (i) any amendment to, or
termination of or other modification of the Contract listed on _Schedule
5.2(d)(ii)_, (ii) any entry into, amendment to, or other modification of, any
co-manufacturing agreement which creates a volume commitment for a period of
greater than one year, (iii) any renewal of, amendment to, or other
modification of, any Transferred Contract with a broker or distributor of the
Business in effect on the date of this Agreement, which provides the broker
or distributor exclusivity rights for a longer period than in the Transferred
Contract prior to its renewal and (iv) any entry into any new Transferred
Contract with a broker or distributor of the Business, which provides the
broker or distributor exclusivity rights for a period of greater than two (2)
years, and so long as that, with respect to clauses (iii) and (iv), (A) no
such Transferred Contract shall include an exclusivity provision that relates
to businesses other than the Business, (B) prior to entering into such
Transferred Contract, Seller shall provide Buyer or its Affiliates with a
right of first refusal to enter into such Contract at market price and (C)
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the length of
such exclusivity provisions;

(e)(i) make any change in the key management structure for the Business
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall mean the President of Pizza, Kraft
North America, and his or her direct reports), (ii) make any material change
in the key research and development personnel for the Business (which, for
the avoidance of doubt, shall mean the Senior Director Research, Development,
and Quality of Pizza, Kraft North America, and his or her direct reports), (iii)
make any change in the direct reports to the Persons included in clauses (i)
and (ii), or (iv) make any change in the customer business team exclusively
devoted to the Business, other than (A) to replace employees who terminate
employment due to death, disability, voluntary resignation or for cause, (B)
to retain those employees listed on _Schedule 6.1(b)_ and (C) to reassign the
executive identified on _Schedule 5.2(e)_ to another business of Seller or its
Affiliates in accordance with  _Schedule 5.2(e)_ ;

(f) Waive any claim or right of material value that relates to the Business;

(g) Make any material change in any method of accounting or accounting
practice or policy applicable to the Business other than those required by
GAAP or Applicable Law, or required by Seller as part of a change in Sellers
accounting practice or policy that impacts businesses of Seller (including the
Business) generally;

(h)(i) Fail in any material respect to pay the accounts payable and debts owed
or obligations due with respect to the Business, or pay or discharge when due
any Liabilities with respect to the Business in the ordinary course of
business; or (ii) fail in any material respect to collect its accounts
receivable with respect to the Business in the ordinary course of business; 



 

52 (i) Enter into any agreement without Buyers prior written consent (i)
licensing or disposing of any Transferred Intellectual Property to any
Person, other than to an Affiliate of Seller, except for Non-Material
Licenses-Out, or (ii) licensing or disposing of any Licensed Intellectual
Property in a manner that would adversely affect the licenses to be granted
to Buyer and its Affiliates pursuant to the Collateral Agreements;

(j) Make, change or revoke any Tax election; change an annual accounting
period; adopt or change any accounting method with respect to Taxes; file any
amended Tax Return; enter into any closing agreement; settle or compromise any
Tax claim or assessment; or consent to any extension or waiver of the
limitation period applicable to any claim or assessment with respect to Taxes;
in each case to the extent such action relates to the Included Assets or the
Business and it is reasonably foreseeable that such action would materially
increase Taxes with respect to the Included Assets or the Business in a Post-
Closing Tax Period; or

(k) Agree, whether in writing or otherwise, to do any of the foregoing.

5.3 _Accounts Receivable_. Seller shall be entitled to the collection and
receipt of all accounts receivable arising from the conduct of the Business
prior to the Effective Time and Buyer shall be entitled to collection and
receipt of all accounts receivable arising from the conduct of the Business
thereafter; _provided_ that (i) to the extent that any customer takes a
deduction against any invoice paid to Seller that constitutes an Included
Liability, Seller shall be entitled to be reimbursed by Buyer for each
such deduction and (ii) to the extent that any customer takes a deduction
against any invoice paid to Buyer that constitutes an Excluded Liability,
Buyer shall be entitled to be reimbursed by Seller for such deduction. Seller
and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith in order to ensure that Seller
receives payment of the customer accounts receivable arising from the conduct
of the Business prior to the Effective Time and that Buyer receives payment of
accounts receivable arising thereafter. To the extent that either Buyer or
Seller receives payment of accounts receivable owned by the other party, Buyer
and Seller agree to promptly (within twenty (20) Business Days) remit the
proceeds to the designated bank account of Seller or Buyer, as appropriate.
Seller may direct all trade debtors to make payment on such accounts
receivable arising from the conduct of the Business prior to the Effective
Time to Sellers specified address and/or account.

5.4 _Confidential Information_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein or in the Collateral Agreements, after
the Effective Time, Seller shall, and Seller shall cause each of its
Affiliates to keep secret and retain in strictest confidence, and shall
Seller not, and Seller shall cause each of its Affiliates not to, use for the
benefit of Seller or any of its Affiliates, or others, all confidential or
proprietary information relating to the Business, the Included Assets,
the Included Liabilities or the Products that Seller did not make generally
publicly available during the time period when Seller conducted the Business
prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Included Confidential
Information"), including, without limitation, "know-how," trade secrets,
customer lists, details of client or consultant contracts, pricing policies,
marketing plans or strategies, product development techniques or plans,
business acquisition plans, designs and design projects, inventions and
research projects, in each case, relating to the Business, the Products, the
Included Assets or the Included Liabilities but excluding (i) any information
that is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result
of a disclosure by Seller or its Affiliates, (ii) any information in respect
of the Licensed Intellectual Property or the Retained Intellectual Property 



 

53  and (iii) any information that relates to any Shared Contract, Shared
Facility, Shared Fixtures and Equipment, Shared Permits, Shared Tangible
Assets, Excluded Liabilities or Excluded Assets, and except as may be
necessary to comply with Applicable Law or to the extent reasonably necessary
to defend or prosecute litigation, and Seller shall not, and Seller shall
cause each of its Affiliates not to disclose such Included Confidential
Information to anyone outside of Buyer except with Buyers express written
consent. Without limiting the foregoing, Seller shall maintain the
confidentiality of the Included Confidential Information in accordance with
the policies and procedures that were applicable to the Included Confidential
Information prior to the date of this Agreement. The Included Confidential
Information shall be subject to the provisions of _Section 7.3_.

(b) Except as otherwise provided herein or in the Collateral Agreements, after
the Effective Time, Seller shall, and Seller shall cause each of its
Affiliates to keep secret and retain in confidence, and Seller shall, and
Seller shall cause each of its Affiliates to, undertake reasonable precautions
to safeguard and protect all confidential or proprietary information relating
to the Business that it has retained after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated hereby (the "Retained Confidential Information") in accordance
with the policies and procedures that are applicable to its own
confidential information, including, without limitation, "know-how," trade
secrets, customer lists, details of client or consultant contracts, pricing
policies, marketing plans or strategies, product development techniques or
plans, business acquisition plans, designs and design projects, inventions
and research projects, but excluding (i) any information that is or becomes
generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by
Seller or its Affiliates, (ii) except as may be necessary to comply with
Applicable Law or to the extent reasonably necessary to defend or prosecute
litigation, and (iii) any information Seller or its Affiliates disclose
pursuant to any legitimate business purpose. In the event that Seller or its
Affiliates disclose any information pursuant to foregoing clause (iii), then
Seller shall, and Seller shall cause each of its Affiliates to, keep secret
and retain in confidence the fact that any such information relates to the
Business. The Retained Confidential Information shall be subject to the
provisions of _Section 7.3_.

(c) The parties acknowledge that any information posted on the intranet
website of Seller or its Affiliates and widely accessible by their employees
without security restriction in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice shall not be deemed to be confidential or proprietary
information for purposes of this _Section 5.4_; _provided_ , _however_ , that
after the Effective Time Seller shall make reasonable efforts to remove
information relating to the Business from such website and instruct such
employees to return or destroy any information relating to the Business they
have accessed from such website.

5.5 _Seller s Covenant Not To Compete_.

(a) For a period of five (5) years from and after the Effective Time, Seller
shall not, and Seller shall cause each of its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) in any manner engage in, either alone or with any Person, any
Competitive Activity in the Geographic Area or (ii) aid or abet, give
information or financial assistance to, or become associated with any Person
with respect to a Competitive Activity in any Geographic Area; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (A) Seller and its Affiliates may acquire and own any
interests in Persons that engage in Competitive Activities so long as such
interests in the aggregate constitute less than 5% of such 



 

54  Persons voting securities, (B) Seller and its Affiliates may acquire any
Person engaged in a Competitive Activity (i) if the consolidated annual net
revenues for such Persons most recently completed fiscal year from the
Competitive Activities are less than $100 million, so long as such Person is
not primarily engaged in the Competitive Activities or (ii) if the
consolidated annual net revenues for such Persons most recently completed
fiscal year from the Competitive Activities are greater than $100 million, so
long as such Person is not primarily engaged in the Competitive Activities and
Seller agrees to use its best efforts to, as promptly as practicable within a
reasonable period of time after the date of acquisition, dispose of
substantially all of the assets, properties or businesses of such Person that
engaged in the Competitive Activities and (C) Seller and its Affiliates may
perform their respective obligations under the Collateral Agreements.

(b) If the covenant set forth in  _Section 5.7(a)_ is determined by any
court to be unenforceable by reason of its extending for too great of a period
of time or over too great a geographic area, or by reason of its being too
extensive in any other respect, such covenant shall be interpreted to extend
only for the longest period of time and over the greatest geographic area, and
to otherwise have the broadest application as shall be enforceable. The
invalidity or unenforceability of any particular provision of this Agreement
shall not affect the other provisions hereof, which shall continue in full
force and effect. Without limiting the foregoing, the covenants contained
herein shall be construed as separate covenants, covering their respective
subject matters, with respect to each of the separate cities, counties and
states of the United States, and each other country, and political subdivision
thereof, in which the Business is being conducted.

5.6 _Consents to Certain Assignments; Separation of Included Shared Contracts;
Pass-Through Arrangements_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to assign any Transferred Contract
(including any Transferred Lease), Transferred Permit or any claim or right or
any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if an attempted
assignment thereof, without the Consent of another Person thereto, would
constitute a Default or violation thereof, or would in any way adversely
affect the rights of Buyer or its Affiliates under such Transferred Contract,
Transferred Permit, claim or right. If any transfer or assignment by Seller or
its Affiliates to Buyer or its Affiliates, or any assumption by Buyer or its
Affiliates of, any interest in, or liability, obligation or commitment under,
any Transferred Contract that is an Included Asset requires the Consent of
another Person (an "Assignment Consent"), then such transfer or assignment or
assumption shall be made subject to such Assignment Consent being obtained. If
any Assignment Consent is not obtained prior to the Closing, then the Closing
shall nonetheless take place on the terms set forth herein, subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Article 2_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, however, unless in its sole discretion Buyer elects in writing to
forego the Assignment Consent in favor of a Pass-Through Arrangement with
respect to the applicable Transferred Contract, Seller shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to secure such Assignment Consent as promptly
as practicable after the Closing Date, and Buyer shall provide or cause to be
provided commercially reasonable assistance to Seller with respect thereto.
Subject to _Section 5.6(d)_, prior to receipt of the applicable Assignment
Consent, Buyer may elect to cause Seller to terminate the related
Transferred Contract at any time.



 

55 (b) Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as promptly as
practicable all consents of the counterparties under the Included Shared
Contracts (each, a "Separation Consent") required to separate the rights and
obligations under the Included Shared Contracts relating to the Business, the
Included Assets and/or the Included Liabilities transferred to Buyer and its
Affiliates hereunder from the rights and obligations relating to the
businesses retained by Seller and its Affiliates after the Effective Time,
unless in its sole discretion Buyer elects in writing to forego the
Separation Consent in favor of a Pass-Through Arrangement with respect to the
applicable Included Shared Contract. Buyer shall provide or cause to be
provided commercially reasonable assistance to Seller in connection
with obtaining the Separation Consents. Promptly upon receipt of any
Separation Consent following the Closing Date, Seller shall cause the
applicable counterparty to the related Included Shared Contract to assign the
portion of the Included Shared Contract relating to the Business, the
Included Assets and/or the Included Liabilities to Buyer and/or its designated
Affiliates, and Buyer and/or such Affiliates shall assume the rights and
obligations under such portion of the Included Shared Contract for periods
from and after the effective date of such assignment. Subject to _Section
5.6(d)_, prior to receipt of the applicable Separation Consent, Buyer may
elect to cause Seller to terminate the portion of an Included Shared Contract
relating to the Business, the Included Assets and/or the Included Liabilities
at any time.

(c) Unless and until any Assignment Consent or Separation Consent is obtained
with respect to a Transferred Contract or an Included Shared Contract Buyer
has assumed hereunder, or to the extent that Buyer has elected in writing to
forego an Assignment Consent or Separation Consent in favor of such an
arrangement, Seller shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, enter into an
arrangement (a "Pass-Through Arrangement") with Buyer under which Buyer or its
Affiliates shall obtain (without infringing upon the legal rights of the
counterparties under the Transferred Contracts or Included Shared Contracts or
violating any Applicable Law) the economic claims, rights and benefits, and
Buyer or such Affiliates shall become responsible for the obligations arising
from and after the Effective Time (including, if applicable, the payment of
rent, but excluding obligations arising from Defaults solely caused by Seller
or its Affiliates and not directly or indirectly caused by Buyer or its
Affiliates) under the applicable Transferred Contract or Included Shared
Contract (only with respect to the rights and obligations relating to the
Business, the Included Assets and/or Included Liabilities). Subject to
_Section 5.6(d)_, Buyer may elect to terminate a Pass-Through Arrangement at
any time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Seller be required
to enter into or maintain any Pass-Through Arrangement after the second
anniversary of the Closing Date.

(d) Buyer and Seller shall share one-half of the out-of-pocket fees (not
including attorneys fees) and breakage or termination fees, if applicable,
(i) required under a Transferred Contract to be assumed by Buyer hereunder to
obtain the Assignment Consents under _Section 5.6(a)_, (ii) required under an
Included Shared Contract to be assumed by Buyer hereunder to obtain the
Separation Consents under _Section 5.6(b)_, (iii) required under a
Transferred Contract or Included Shared Contract to be assumed by Buyer
hereunder for Seller or its Affiliates to enter into a Pass-Through
Arrangement with Buyer or its Affiliates under _Section 5.6(c)_, and (iv)
required under an Included Shared Contract or Transferred Contract to be
assumed by Buyer hereunder to terminate such Contract at the election of Buyer
in accordance with  _Section 5.6(a)_ or _5.6(b)_ (collectively, the "Consent
Fees"). The parties shall cooperate in minimizing all such Consent Fees.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Buyer elects 



 

56  to terminate any Transferred Contract or Included Shared Contract to be
assumed by Buyer hereunder in accordance with _Section 5.6(a)_ or _5.6(b)_
and the Consent Fees relating to such termination exceed the Consents Fees
required to obtain the applicable Assignment Consent or Separation Consents
under _Section 5.6(a)_ or _5.6(b)_ , then Buyer shall reimburse Seller for
one hundred percent (100%) of such excess amount promptly after the
termination of the Contract. Further, (i) in the event that Seller delivers a
written request to Buyer to forego an Assignment Consent or Separation Consent
in favor of a Pass-Through Arrangement with respect to the applicable
Contract, (ii) within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such request Buyer
does not agree to enter into such Pass-Through Arrangement with Seller and
(iii) the Consent Fees relating to obtaining such Assignment Consent or
Separation Consent in accordance with _Section 5.6(a)_ or _5.6(b)_ exceeds
the Consent Fees to enter into a Pass-Through Arrangement under _Section
5.6(c)_, then Buyer shall reimburse Seller for one hundred percent (100%) of
such excess promptly after expiration of the fifteen-day period.

(e) Nothing in this _Section 5.6_ shall limit Buyer or Sellers obligations
under _Section 7.1(a)_, or Seller or its Affiliates obligations under the
Transition Services Agreement.

5.7 _No Solicitation_. From the date hereof through the Closing or the earlier
termination of this Agreement, Seller shall not, and will cause its
Affiliates, officers, directors, principals, attorneys, agents, investment
bankers, accountants, employees and other representatives (the
"Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly, (a) encourage, solicit or
initiate any Alternative Proposal (as defined below) or (b) enter into,
respond to, initiate or engage in discussions or negotiations concerning any
Alternative Proposal with, or disclose in connection with any Alternative
Proposal any non-public information relating to the Included Assets or
the Business (except to Buyer and its Representatives). From the date hereof
through the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement, Seller will
discontinue and not resume any discussions with respect to any Alternative
Proposal commenced prior to the date hereof (other than with Buyer and its
Representatives). The term "Alternative Proposal" means any offer or proposal
for the acquisition of the Business or the Included Assets (or material
portion thereof), regardless of transaction structure (but excluding any
offer or proposal for Seller and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

5.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. From the date hereof through the
Closing, Seller shall give prompt notice to Buyer of (a) the occurrence, or
failure to occur, of any event which occurrence or failure would be likely
to cause any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or in any
exhibit or schedule hereto to be materially untrue or materially inaccurate
and (b) any failure of Seller or any of its Affiliates, or of any of its
Representatives, to materially comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement or
any exhibit or schedule hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that such disclosure
shall not be deemed to cure any breach of a representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement or to satisfy any condition. Seller shall promptly
notify Buyer of any Default, the threat or commencement of any Proceeding, or
any development of which it has knowledge that occurs before the Closing that
would reasonably be expected to cause a condition to the Closing contained in
_Sections 2.2_ or _2.3_ not to be satisfied.



 

57 5.9 _Satisfaction of Obligations_. Following the Effective Time, consistent
with past practice Seller shall pay promptly when due all of the debts and
liabilities of Seller and its Affiliates relating to the Business other than
the Included Liabilities.

5.10 _Promotional and Advertising Activities_. At least two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall provide a true and accurate schedule
to Buyer setting forth (a) all trade and consumer promotion activities or
events relating to the Business scheduled to occur after the Effective Time
and (b) all advertising commitments for the Business for periods after the
Effective Time.

5.11 _Termination of Affiliate Agreements and Other Specified Agreements_.
Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, terminate, at or prior to
the Closing, all Contracts relating to the Business between or among Seller
and/or its Affiliates, other than the Collateral Agreements and the Shared
Contracts, which shall survive. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
provide Buyer evidence reasonably satisfactory to Buyer that such Contracts
have been or will be terminated.

5.12 _Additional Contracts Disclosure and Additional Intellectual Property
Disclosure_. Prior to the earlier of (i) that date that is thirty (30) days
after the date of this Agreement and (ii) the second Business Day prior to
Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer _Schedule 5.12_ which shall completely
and accurately list each Transferred Contract in effect as of the date of this
Agreement that is (a) a Transferred Lease that was not required to be listed
on  _Schedule 3.3(a)(i)_, (b) a Contract with a broker or a distributor that
was not required to be listed on _Schedule 3.6(a)_ accounting for more than
$250,000 of total annual sales, (c) a Contract that has an aggregate future
liability, actual or potential, to any Person in excess of $250,000 that was
not required to be listed on _Schedule 3.6(a)_ or (d) is a Contract for the
lease of automobiles to employees. Concurrently with the delivery of 
_Schedule 5.12_, Seller shall deliver true, correct and complete copies of
all of the Transferred Contracts listed on _Schedule 5.12_, including all
amendments and supplements thereto, and all Transferred Contracts described
in  _Section 3.6(a)_ and not previously delivered. On or prior to the
Closing, Seller shall deliver true, correct and complete copies of all
Transferred Contracts, including all amendments and supplements thereto, which
have not been previously delivered to Buyer. At least two (2) days prior, but
not more than five (5) Business Days prior, to the Closing, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer an updated _Schedule 3.4(a)(i)_ , _Schedule 3.4(a)(ii)_ and
_Schedule 3.4(a)(iii)_ , which shall completely and accurately update
_Schedule 3.4(a)(i)_ , _Schedule 3.4(a)(ii)_ and _Schedule 3.4(a)(iii)_ to
identify each item required to be listed under the first sentence of _Section
3.4_ as if the representation and warranty in such sentence had been made as
of the date of delivery instead of as of the date of this Agreement.

5.13 _Preliminary Title Reports; Surveys_. On or before the twentieth day
after the date of this Agreement, Seller shall order a current preliminary
title report and commitments for an American Land Title Association extended
coverage owners policy of title insurance (collectively, the "PTRs") for
each Transferred Facility from First American Title Insurance Company (in such
capacity, "Title Company"), and instruct the Title Company to deliver them to
Buyer and Seller together with legible copies of all documents referenced as
exceptions in the PTRs (collectively, the "Underlying Documents"). After
receipt of the PTRs and the Underlying Documents for any Transferred
Facility, in its sole discretion Buyer may order a current survey for such
Transferred Facility, in form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and Title 



 

58  Company (collectively, the "Surveys"). Seller shall reasonably cooperate
with Buyer so it can obtain the Surveys and owners policies of title
insurance, including by executing such written consents or other instruments
as may be reasonably requested by the Title Company in connection therewith
and providing reasonable access to the Transferred Facilities to the
surveyors.

5.14 _Transition Services_.

(a) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to finalize the list of Transition Services (as
defined in the Transition Services Agreement) set forth on Annex A to the
Transition Services Agreement. In addition, during such period, the parties
shall negotiate in good faith regarding an implementation plan for the
Transition Services, including, without limitation, target termination
dates for such Transition Services. The final Annex A to the Transition
Services Agreement will be attached to the definitive form of such agreement
executed at Closing.

(b) Within thirty (30) days of the date of this Agreement, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer a written statement setting forth Sellers good faith
estimate of the Agreed Price (as defined in the Transition Services
Agreement) for each Transition Service listed on Annex A to the Transition
Services Agreement. The good faith estimate will be based on current usage
levels, and will be informed by discussions with Buyer who will
qualitatively describe any desired changes or clarifications to the
Transition Services or additional services to be required under Annex A (such
changes not to include Excluded Services, as defined in the Transition
Services Agreement). Seller will disaggregate its estimate of the Agreed
Price into (i) third party costs and (ii) Seller costs including overhead
allocations. Upon Buyers request, Seller will provide reasonable detail
concerning these calculations.

5.15 _Re-filing of Expired Trademarks_. At the request of Buyer and to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, Seller shall, or shall cause its
applicable Affiliates, to re-file applications for the expired Trademarks
listed on _Schedule 3.4(a)(vi)_ with the appropriate Governmental Authorities
and to pay all filing fees and take such other reasonably necessary actions
in connection therewith.

ARTICLE 6

_EMPLOYEE BENEFITS_

6.1 _Continued Employment_. Within three Business Days following the date
hereof, Seller shall deliver to Buyer _Schedule 6.1(a)_ , which shall list
each employee of Seller and its Affiliates who is employed in the Business and
his or her position (with such list to be updated immediately prior to
Closing), except for the Canadian Employees and the employees listed on
_Schedule 6.1(b)_. "Business Employees" shall mean the employees listed on
_Schedule 6.1(a)_ and the Canadian Employees. As of the Closing, Buyer shall,
or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, make offers of employment (in
compliance with the covenants set forth in this _Article 6_) to each of the
Business Employees, including any such Business Employee who is not actively
at work on the Closing Date other than each Business Employee who is, as of
the Closing, absent due to short-term or long-term disability or workers
compensation leave (the "Employees on  



 

59  Disability Leave"). Business Employees who accept Buyers offer of
employment under this section shall, as of the effective date of their
employment with Buyer or one of its Affiliates, be referred to as
"Transferred Employees." Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to,
make offers of employment to each Employee on Disability Leave as of the date
on which such Employee on Disability Leave is able to commence active
employment and presents himself or herself to Buyer or one of its Affiliates
for active employment; _provided_ that such Employee on Disability Leave so
presents himself or herself within two years following the date that he or
she incurred such disability. Each Employee on Disability Leave who accepts
such offer and actually returns to work not later than two years following the
incurrence of such disability shall become a Transferred Employee effective as
of the date of such return. The date of such return shall be considered the
"Transfer Date" of each such Employee on Disability Leave, and the Effective
Time shall be considered the Transfer Date for each other Transferred
Employee. Seller and Buyer intend that the Business Employees shall continue
to provide services to the Business without interruption and that Business
Employees shall have continuous and uninterrupted employment with respect to
the Business immediately after the Closing (provided they accept the offered
employment with Buyer). If any Transferred Employee requires a visa, work
permit or pass or other approval for his or her employment to continue with
Buyer or its Affiliates following such employees Transfer Date, Buyer shall
use its reasonable best efforts to see that any necessary applications are
promptly made and to secure the necessary visa, permit, pass or other
approval. Buyer shall comply with all Applicable Laws relating to the offers
of employment to, and continuation of employment of, the Business Employees on
and after the Effective Time.

6.2 _Post-Closing Compensation Generally_. As of the Transfer Date of any
Transferred Employee, such Transferred Employee shall cease active
participation in the Seller Plans, except as otherwise provided in this
_Article 6_, or under the Transition Services Agreement. Except as otherwise
provided in this _Article 6_ , from the Effective Time through December 31,
2011 ("Compensation Continuation Period"), Buyer shall provide, or shall cause
its Affiliates to provide:

(a) to each Transferred Employee who is compensated by Seller or its
Affiliates on a commission basis, base salary or wages, commission
opportunities, and target annual cash bonus and, if such Transferred Employee
is eligible for long-term cash incentive opportunities with Seller or its
Affiliates, long-term cash incentive opportunities (plus such additional cash
compensation as Buyer may determine) not less favorable, in the aggregate,
than the base salary or wages, commission opportunities, and target annual
cash bonus and long-term cash incentive opportunities provided to such
Transferred Employee immediately prior to such employees Transfer Date (but
excluding any compensation increase which may occur pursuant to _Section
5.2(c)(iii)_ of this Agreement and any transaction, retention or similar
bonus), and

 

(b) to each other Transferred Employee, base salary or wages and target annual
cash bonus, and, if such Transferred Employee is eligible for long-term cash
incentive opportunities with Seller or its Affiliates, long-term cash
incentive opportunities not less favorable, in the aggregate, than those
provided to such Transferred Employee immediately prior to such
employees Transfer Date (but excluding any compensation increase which may
occur pursuant to _Section 5.2(c)(iii)_ of this Agreement and any
transaction, retention or similar bonus);



 

60 _provided_ that the aggregate cash compensation actually paid by Buyer or its
Affiliates under subsections (a) and (b) to each such Transferred Employee
for each full or partial year during the Compensation Continuation Period
while such Transferred Employee is employed by Buyer or its Affiliates shall
not be less than such employees base salary or wages (if any) for such full
or partial year at the rates as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time (but excluding any compensation increase which may occur pursuant to
_Section 5.2(c)(iii)_ of this Agreement); and _provided, further,_ that
nothing in this Agreement shall require Buyer to continue, or cause any of its
Affiliates to continue, to employ any Transferred Employee. Except as
otherwise provided in this _Article 6_ , and except to the extent that the
Transferred Employees are to be covered under any Seller Plan pursuant to the
Transition Services Agreement, during the Compensation Continuation Period,
Buyer shall also offer and maintain, or shall cause its Affiliates to offer
and maintain, for the benefit of the Transferred Employees, employee benefits
(including, without limitation, pension, active welfare, retiree medical,
deferred compensation, 401(k) and equity-related compensation (including
any such compensation that may be settled in cash)) at levels as are made
available under Plans covering similarly situated employees of Buyer and its
Affiliates from time to time and consistent with the then-current, generally
applicable features of such Plans (taking into account service as provided
under _Section 6.3_ and disregarding any historical, grandfathered, or
similar transitional or special provisions); _provided_ that, for purposes of
determining whether the Transferred Employees are similarly situated to
employees of Buyer and its Affiliates, Buyers reasonable classification of
employees into relevant categories, including hourly and salaried, shall
control.

6.3 _Service Credit_. For purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting
(but not benefit accrual or level of benefits, except with respect to
vacation, severance and short-term disability benefits, or otherwise
specifically provided below) under the Plans of Buyer and its Affiliates
providing benefits to any Transferred Employee at any time after the Effective
Time (the "New Plans"), each Transferred Employee shall be credited with his
or her years of service with Seller and its Affiliates (and any predecessors)
before such employees Transfer Date, to a similar extent as such
Transferred Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time to credit for
such service under any comparable Seller Plan in which such Transferred
Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such Seller
Plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"), _provided_ that, Buyer shall have the
discretion to credit such service in a manner ( _i.e._ , on an hourly basis or
elapsed time basis) applicable under the New Plans had such service been
performed with Buyer or its Affiliates. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (a) each Transferred Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under
an Old Plan, commencing at or as soon as practicable, using reasonable best
efforts, after the later of the Effective Time or the time that coverage under
such Old Plan ceases (including under the Transition Services Agreement), and
(b) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical
and/or vision benefits to any Transferred Employee, Buyer shall (to the extent
all information reasonably necessary to implement such actions has
been received from Seller) cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee
and his or her covered dependents, to the extent such exclusions or
requirements were waived or satisfied under the corresponding Old Plan, and
any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be
taken into account under 



 

61  such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such New Plan.

6.4 _Welfare Benefits Generally_. With respect to Transferred Employees, (a)
Seller and its Affiliates shall be solely responsible for (i) claims for
welfare benefits that are incurred under the Seller Plans by or with respect
to any Transferred Employee before his or her Transfer Date, (ii) claims for
workers compensation that are incurred by or with respect to any Transferred
Employee before his or her Transfer Date, (iii) claims relating to health
continuation coverage required by Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of
Title I of ERISA ("COBRA Coverage") attributable to "qualifying events" with
respect to any Transferred Employee and his or her beneficiaries and
dependents that occur before such Transferred Employees Transfer Date and
(iv) claims for retiree medical or retiree life benefits arising under the
Seller Plans regardless of when incurred (including without limitation, such
benefits to be provided pursuant to the terms of this  _Section 6.4_), and
(b) Buyer and its Affiliates shall be solely responsible for (i) claims for
welfare benefits that are incurred under the New Plans by or with respect to
any Transferred Employee on or after his or her Transfer Date, (ii) claims
for workers compensation that are incurred by or with respect to any
Transferred Employee on or after his or her Transfer Date, (iii) claims
relating to COBRA Coverage attributable to "qualifying events" with respect
to any Transferred Employee and his or her beneficiaries and dependents that
occur on or after such Transferred Employees Transfer Date and (iv) claims
for retiree medical or retiree life benefits arising under the New
Plans regardless of when incurred (including without limitation, such
benefits to be provided pursuant to the terms of this _Section 6.4_). For
purposes of the foregoing, (A) a claim for a welfare benefits shall be
considered incurred as follows: (x) disability, life, accidental death and
dismemberment, and business travel accident insurance benefits, upon the
death, accident or other event giving rise to such benefits and (y) health,
dental and prescription drug benefits (including in respect of any hospital
confinement), upon provision of such services, materials or supplies and (B) a
workers compensation claim shall be considered incurred before the applicable
Transfer Date if the injury or condition giving rise to the claim occurs
before such Transfer Date, but only if such claim is actually filed before the
first anniversary of such Transfer Date, or such longer period as coincides
with the applicable statute of limitations for filing a claim. In the case of
a workers compensation claim relating to an injury or condition that occurred
over a period both preceding and following the Transfer Date, subject to the
immediately preceding sentence, the claim shall, except to the
extent inconsistent with Applicable Law or any applicable workers
compensation insurance policy, be the joint responsibility of Seller and Buyer
and be equitably apportioned between them based upon the relative periods of
time that the condition or injury transpired preceding and following the
Transfer Date. In addition, Seller shall treat Transferred Employees who
immediately prior to the Effective Time, have satisfied the age and service
requirements, or who are within one year of satisfying the age and service
requirements, as eligible for retiree medical and retiree life benefits under
the applicable Seller Plan (on a subsidized basis, if such Transferred
Employees are in a group to which such subsidy applies under the
applicable Seller Plan), and permit them to elect to commence such retiree
medical and retiree life benefits at any time on and after their respective
Transfer Dates (including without limitation, at the time they terminate
employment with Buyer and its Affiliates). Moreover, Transferred Employees
who, as of the Transfer Date, are participants in an applicable Seller Plan
which provides retiree medical and retiree life benefits on a subsidized basis
(and are in a group to which such subsidy applies under the 



 

62  applicable Seller Plan), and have been employees of Seller since prior to
2003, but are more than one (1) year, but not more than ten (10) years, away
from satisfying the age and service requirements to commence such retiree
medical and retiree life benefits under the applicable Seller Plan, shall be
participants in an applicable New Plan which provides retiree medical and
retiree life benefits on a subsidized basis, and Buyer shall count the years
of service with Seller and its Affiliates (and any predecessors) before such
employees Transfer Date for purposes of determining the eligibility for such
subsidized retiree medical and retiree life benefits and the level of such
benefits. Transferred Employees who commenced employment with Seller or its
Affiliates on January 1, 2003 or later, shall participate in an applicable New
Plan which provides retiree medical and retiree life benefits on
an unsubsidized basis to the extent such Transferred Employees were
participants in the applicable Seller Plan which provides retiree medical and
retiree life benefits, respectively. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, nothing herein shall prohibit Seller (or Buyer, as
applicable), from amending, modifying or terminating any of their respective
post -retirement welfare plans or prevent the application of any such
amendment, modification or termination to any Transferred Employee;
_provided_ that no such amendment shall treat the Transferred Employees in
materially less favorable a manner than similarly situated former employees of
Seller (or current or former employees of Buyer, as applicable). 

6.5 _Flexible Spending Plans_. Except to the extent that continued coverages
for flexible spending accounts for medical and dependent care expenses
("FSAs") are otherwise provided under the Transition Services Agreement, as of
the Transfer Date for each Transferred Employee, Buyer will establish flexible
spending accounts for medical and dependent care expenses under a new or
existing plan ("Buyers FSA") for such Transferred Employee who, on or prior
to the Effective Time, is a participant in a flexible spending account for
medical and dependent care expenses under a Seller Plan ("Sellers FSA") or
who elects to participate in Buyers FSA. Subject to Buyer being provided all
information reasonably necessary to permit the administrator of Buyers FSA to
accommodate the inclusion of the Transferred Employees in Buyers FSA on the
basis described herein, Buyer will credit or debit, as applicable, effective
as of the Transfer Date, the applicable account of each Transferred Employee
under Buyers FSA with an amount equal to the balance of each such
Transferred Employees account under Sellers FSA as of immediately prior to
the Transfer Date.

6.6 _Vacation_. From and after the Transfer Date for each Transferred
Employee, Buyer shall credit to such Transferred Employee under the applicable
vacation or paid time off program of Buyer all unused vacation days of such
Transferred Employees that accrued prior to the applicable Transfer Date,
_provided_ , _however_ , that Seller and Buyer shall comply with any
Applicable Law that mandates other treatment.

6.7 _Seller Plans Generally_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
Seller will retain all liabilities and obligations under Seller Plans and no
assets or liabilities of any Seller Plan will be transferred to any Plan
maintained by Buyer. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or under
the Transition Services Agreement, no Transferred Employee shall accrue
any benefits under any Seller Plans in respect of service with Buyer or any
of its Affiliates after such employees Transfer Date. Seller and Buyer shall
also take such actions as are provided in _Schedule 6.7_ (which is
incorporated herein by reference and shall be as binding and enforceable as
if fully set forth herein).



 

63 6.8 _Rollovers to U.S. Tax-Qualified Savings/401(k) Plan_. Buyer shall cause
a tax-qualified defined contribution plan established or maintained by Buyer
or its applicable Affiliate to accept eligible rollover distributions (as
defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) from Transferred Employees with
respect to any account balances distributable in cash within a reasonable
time after the Closing Date by applicable Seller Plans which represent pre-tax
amounts (and shall also arrange to permit such Transferred Employee a one-time
election to include a participant loan with a duration of not more than 15
years in such rollover, along with such cash; _provided_ that any such loan
would not be treated as taxable distribution at any time prior to such
rollover), to the extent it determines such rollovers are consistent with
ERISA, the Code, other Applicable Law and the existing terms of such Plan.

6.9  _Severance_. During the Compensation Continuation Period, if Buyer
terminates the employment of any Transferred Employee without cause (which,
for this purpose, shall mean discharge due to the actions of the Transferred
Employee, including unacceptable performance or unsatisfactory conduct) or
subjects any Transferred Employee to any indefinite lay-off (and, solely with
respect to hourly Transferred Employees, in no event including any lay-off not
anticipated to last at least six months), or if any Transferred Employee
voluntarily terminates employment either because Buyer or its Affiliates have
failed to honor, in all material respects, the terms of employment required by
_Section 6.2_ with respect to such employee or because a condition of
continued employment is such employees agreement to work at a job site that
is more than 50 miles from the location of the job site immediately prior to
such employees Transfer Date (35 miles, in the case of the Glenview,
Illinois locations), Buyer shall pay to such Transferred Employee cash
severance in an amount equal to the greatest of (a) the severance pay due
under the applicable severance plan of Buyer and its Affiliates for
similarly situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates, (b) the severance
pay that would have been due under the severance plan of Seller and its
Affiliates that was applicable to such Transferred Employee immediately prior
to such employees Transfer Date, (c) in the case of exempt Transferred
Employees, three months base salary and (d) in the case of non-exempt
Transferred Employees (including both hourly and salaried non-exempt
employees), six week base salary. The level of severance benefits a
terminated Transferred Employee is entitled to receive pursuant to clauses (a)
through (d) of the preceding sentence shall be determined by taking into
account such employees service with Seller and its Affiliates (and any
predecessor) prior to such employees Transfer Date and such employees
service with Buyer and its Affiliates on and after such employees Transfer
Date. In addition, Buyer shall provide to each such terminated Transferred
Employee a cash payment equal to the premiums for group health continuation
coverage (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include medical, dental and
vision benefits) during the Severance Period (as defined below). Buyer
shall provide reasonable outplacement services to any Transferred Employee
entitled to severance benefits pursuant to this _Section 6.9_. For purposes
of this _Section 6.9_, "Severance Period" shall mean, with respect to any
such terminated Transferred Employee, a number of weeks determined by dividing
such Transferred Employees cash severance benefit by such Transferred
Employees weekly base rate of pay. As of and following the applicable
Transfer Date, Buyer and its Affiliates shall be solely liable with respect
to the Transferred Employees for all severance and termination pay and
benefits continuation, in each case, not incurred under a Seller Plan, and any
other notice, pay in lieu of notice, pay, benefits or compensation that is
required by Applicable Law, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and
its Affiliates with respect to all such liabilities, obligations and
commitments. Notwithstanding any provision of this  _Section 6.9_ to the
contrary, except as 



 

64  otherwise required by Applicable Law, no Business Employee will be entitled
to any of the severance or separation benefits pursuant to this _Section 6.9_
unless and until such Business Employee executes a release of claims in favor
of Seller, Buyer and each of their respective Affiliates and each of their
respective predecessors, successors, parents and Affiliates, and their
respective present and former officers, directors, employees and agents, and
such release has not been revoked by such employee during the seven-day
revocation period following execution, and such severance or separation
benefits may be subject to such other reasonable or customary terms as
are applicable to similarly situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates
from time to time (including, without limitation, with respect to any
voluntary termination, to such notice to, and opportunity for, Buyer to cure
such situation as are provided in Treasury Regulations Section
1.409A-1(n)(2)(ii)(C)).

6.10 _Cash Compensation Obligations_. Seller and its Affiliates shall retain
liability for payment of base salary, wages and overtime pay for each Business
Employee accruing prior to such Business Employees Transfer Date, and Buyer
and its Affiliates shall assume responsibility for payments of base salary,
wages and overtime pay to each Transferred Employee accruing on or after such
Transferred Employees Transfer Date. Seller shall make a prorated annual
bonus payment to each Business Employee who remains employed immediately
prior to the Closing Date, the amount of which shall equal the product of the
applicable Business Employees annual bonus amount (as described in the next
sentence) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
days in the calendar year during which the Closing Date occurs that elapse
prior to the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is 365. Seller may
determine the annual bonus amount using any good faith methodology (which need
not be the same for each Business Employee), including, without limitation,
by basing such amount upon target bonus or upon actual performance. Such
prorated bonuses shall be paid no later than the date on which Seller pays
annual bonuses to similarly situated other employees of Seller and its
Affiliates.

6.11 _WARN Act_. Buyer shall assume liability for, and shall fully indemnify
and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates with respect to, any Liabilities
incurred by Seller and its Affiliates pursuant to the Workers Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act and any similar statute in connection with any
Business Employee, to the extent such liability arises from actions of Buyer
and its Affiliates on or after the Effective Time, including without
limitation, a failure to extend an offer of employment complying with the
requirements of this Article 6 to a Business Employee (or, solely with
respect to a Business Employee based in Ontario, Canada, a failure to extend
an offer complying with the requirements of Ontario Law). Seller shall retain
liability for, and shall fully indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its
Affiliates with respect to, any liabilities incurred by Buyer and its
Affiliates pursuant to the Workers Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act
and any similar statute in connection with any Business Employee or other
employee, to the extent such liability arises from actions of Seller and its
Affiliates prior to the Effective Time , or from the failure of any Business
Employee to accept and commence employment with Buyer or its Affiliates
pursuant to an offer of employment complying with the requirements of this
Article 6 (or, solely with respect to a Business Employee based in Ontario,
Canada, a failure to accept and commence employment with Buyer or its
Affiliates pursuant to an offer complying with the requirements of Ontario
Law).



 

65 6.12 _Treatment of Transaction under Code Section 409A_. For purposes
of Sellers Plans, which constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation
plans" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, the purchase and
related transactions contemplated under this Agreement shall constitute a
separation from service of the Transferred Employees who participate therein.

6.13 _Agreement Is Not a Plan Amendment_. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, the terms of this _Article 6_ are not intended
to, and do not, constitute (i) an amendment to any Old Plan or New Plan or any
other Plan of Seller, Buyer or any of any of their respective Affiliates,
(ii) a promise or commitment to any current or former employees or
participants under any Old Plan or New Plan or any other Plan of Seller, Buyer
or any of any of their respective Affiliates, (iii) the establishment of any
new Plan of Seller, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates, (iv) a
promise or commitment to any current or former employees of the Business to
provide or continue any benefits under any Old Plan or New Plan or any other
Plan of Seller, Buyer or any of any of their respective Affiliates, or (v) a
limitation on the authority of Seller or Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates to amend or terminate any Old Plan or New Plan or any other Plan of
Seller, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, shall be interpreted to confer upon any of the
current or former employees of the Business or any Plan participants
(including the Transferred Employees) any rights or remedies as third-party
beneficiaries under this _Article 6_.

6.14 _U.S. Employment Tax Reporting_. Buyer and Seller hereby agree to follow
the alternate procedure for United States employment Tax withholding as
provided in _Section 5_ of Rev. Proc. 2004-53, I.R.B. 2004-34. Accordingly,
Seller shall have no United States employment Tax reporting responsibilities,
and Buyer and its Affiliates shall have full United States employment Tax
reporting responsibilities, for each Transferred Employee subject to United
States employment Taxes on and following such employees Transfer Date, to
the extent provided under such Rev. Proc. 2004-53, and except to the extent
that Seller provides payroll services to Buyer pursuant to the Transition
Services Agreement.

ARTICLE 7

_MUTUAL COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES _

Each of Seller and Buyer covenants and agrees as follows:

7.1 _Reasonable Efforts_.

(a) Seller and Buyer shall each reasonably cooperate with the other and use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take or cause to be
taken all necessary actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and Applicable Laws to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as soon as reasonably practicable, including, without limitation,
preparing and filing promptly all documentation to effect all necessary
filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of
information, applications and other documents and (ii) obtain or transfer as
soon as reasonably practicable all approvals, clearances, Consents,
registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations required to be
obtained from any 



 

66  other Person necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, _provided_ that, except as expressly provided
in _Section 5.6_ or this  _Section 7.1_, neither Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates shall be required to make any payments, commence litigation or make
any undertaking in order to obtain any such approvals, clearances, Consents,
registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Seller and Buyer
shall as promptly as practicable, (i) but in no event later than ten (10)
Business Days following the date of this Agreement, file or cause to be filed
with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the United
States Department of Justice (the "DOJ") the notification and report form
required for the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the HSR Act,
(ii) file or cause to be filed with the Commissioner under the Competition Act
such filings as may be required or agreed to by the parties for the
transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the Competition Act, including an
application for an advance ruling certificate under section 102 of the
Competition Act and a notification under section 114 of the Competition Act,
and (iii) make such other filings as are necessary in other jurisdictions in
order to comply with all Applicable Laws. Any such filing, notification and
report form shall be in substantial compliance with the requirements of the
HSR Act, the Competition Act or such other Applicable Law. Each of Seller and
Buyer shall furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other may request in connection with its preparation of any
filing or submission that is necessary under the HSR Act, the Competition Act
or such other Applicable Law. Each of Seller and Buyer shall keep each other
apprised of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries
or requests for additional information from, the FTC, the DOJ, the
Commissioner under the Competition Act and any other applicable Governmental
Authority and shall take reasonable best efforts to promptly provide any
supplemental information reasonably requested in connection with the filings
made hereunder pursuant to the HSR Act, the Competition Act or such other
Applicable Law. Any such supplemental information shall be in substantial
compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act, the Competition Act or such
other Applicable Law. Each party shall provide the other party (or its
external counsel in respect of competitively sensitive, privileged, or
confidential matters) with reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
all filings, applications and submissions under the HSR Act, the Competition
Act or such other Applicable Law. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall engage in any
meetings or material communications with any Governmental Authority other than
in the ordinary course, without counsel for the other party being advised of
the same, and in any event shall promptly notify and provide copies to the
other partys counsel of any communications to or from a Governmental
Authority in relation to the Agreement. Buyer and Seller shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under the HSR Act, the Competition Act or such other Applicable Law
that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon
as reasonably possible. If it is reasonably necessary to institute any action
or proceeding to obtain any approval under the HSR Act, the Competition Act
or such other Applicable Law for the transactions contemplated hereby, or if
any action or proceeding is instituted by a Governmental Authority challenging
the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of the HSR Act, the
Competition Act or such other Applicable Law, Buyer and Seller shall use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to institute or defend any
such action or proceeding; _provided_ that Buyer shall have the sole right to
direct and control the 



 

67  defense of such action or proceeding with counsel of its own choosing, and
Seller may, at its own expense, participate therein with counsel of its own
choosing and Seller and Buyer agree to reasonably cooperate with each other
with respect thereto.

(c) Buyer shall not be required to (i) commit to or effect, by consent
decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of any businesses, product lines or assets relating to Buyers or
its Affiliates business or the Business, the Included Assets, the
Transferred Facilities, the real property and/or improvements, as applicable,
leased pursuant to the Transferred Leases, the Included Liabilities or the
Products, or (ii) otherwise take or commit to take actions that after the
Effective Time would limit Buyers freedom of action with respect to, or its
ability to retain, one or more of the businesses, product lines or assets of
Buyer and its Affiliates or the Business, the Included Assets, the Transferred
Facilities, the real property and/or improvements, as applicable, leased
pursuant to the Transferred Leases, the Included Liabilities or the Products,
except as provided in the following two sentences. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, solely to the extent required by an
applicable Governmental Authority in order to resolve any objection under the
HSR Act asserted by such Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby and to enable the Closing to occur by the End
Date (as may be extended in accordance with _Section 9.1(b)_), Buyer shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates, to use its reasonable best efforts to hold
separate or divest, at its election, either (x) the Applicable Business Brand
or (y) the Applicable Buyer Brand, _provided_ , _however_ , that if Buyer
elects the divestiture of the Applicable Buyer Brand, in no event shall Buyer
or its Affiliates be required to hold separate or divest itself of the
Trademark listed on _Schedule 7.1(c)_ , but, to the extent required, Buyer or
its applicable Affiliates shall enter into a transitional trademark license
agreement on terms reasonably acceptable to Buyer, pursuant to which Buyer or
its applicable Affiliates shall license such Trademark listed on _Schedule
7.1(c)_ to the purchaser of the Applicable Buyer Brand on a transitional basis
not to exceed five (5) years. In connection with such holding separate or
divestiture of the Applicable Business Brand or the Applicable Buyer Brand,
Buyer shall also hold separate or divest, if required, the product lines
(i.e., stock keeping units (SKUs)) relating to such Applicable Business Brand
or Applicable Buyer Brand, as applicable, the goodwill exclusively relating
to such brand, the recipes relating to such SKUs, and any existing inventory
of such SKUs, and shall, if required, enter into co-manufacturing agreements,
intellectual property licenses (solely for use in such business) and
transition services arrangements, in each case, on terms reasonably acceptable
to Buyer, but shall not otherwise be required to divest or hold separate any
tangible or other assets (including know-how and patents). In the event that
Buyer is required to divest the Applicable Business Brand or Applicable Buyer
Brand pursuant to the preceding sentence, unless a Buyer Acquisition has
occurred, Seller agrees to pay Buyer the Antitrust Loss-Sharing Amount on the
later of (I) the Closing Date and (II) the date of consummation of such
divestiture.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer and its Affiliates may enter into any
transaction, or any agreement to effect any transaction (including any merger
or acquisition), subject to the following sentence. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that Buyer or its Affiliates acquire a Person engaged
in a Competitive Activity during the period from the date of this Agreement
through the earlier of the Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement
(a "Buyer Acquisition"), solely to the extent required by an
applicable Governmental Authority in order to resolve any objection under the
HSR Act asserted by such Governmental Authority 



 

68  with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and to enable the
Closing to occur by the End Date (as may be extended in accordance with
_Section 9.1(b)_), Buyer shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliates, to
use best efforts to hold separate and/or divest the portion of the business of
such acquired Person engaged in the Competitive Activities. In addition, if
Buyer enters into an agreement with respect to a Buyer Acquisition between
the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, the Antitrust Loss-Sharing
Amount shall no longer apply.

7.2 _Publicity_. Seller and Buyer agree that, from the date hereof through the
Closing Date, no public release or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be issued by a party without the prior written
consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), except (a) as such release or announcement may be required by
Applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any United States or foreign
securities exchange, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall have given, to the extent reasonably possible, not less
than two (2) Business Days prior notice to the other party, and shall have
attempted, to the extent reasonably possible, to allow the other party
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance, (b) Seller and Buyer shall prepare a mutually acceptable press
release or releases concerning the transactions contemplated hereby for
dissemination upon signing of this Agreement and (c) Seller or Buyer may
respond to questions from analysts or news reporters to the extent that such
responses are consistent with public releases or announcements previously
disclosed in accordance with this _Section 7.2_.

7.3 _Access to Information_. After the Closing, upon reasonable notice, Buyer
and Seller agree to cooperate with and afford or cause to be afforded to each
other and their Representatives reasonable access, during normal business
hours, to the personnel (without substantial disruption of employment),
properties, books and records (including, without limitation, the Excluded
Books and Records), Contracts, and information and commitments relating to the
Business, the Transferred Facilities, the Shared Facilities or the real
property and/or improvements, as applicable, leased pursuant to the
Transferred Leases that are necessary or useful in connection with: (a) the
filing of any Tax Return or Tax election with respect to the Business, the
Included Assets, the Transferred Facilities, the Shared Facilities, the real

Transferred Leases, or the Included Liabilities or any amended return or claim
for refund, determining a Liability for Taxes or a right to refund of Taxes or
in conducting any audit or other Proceeding in respect of Taxes with respect
to the Business, the Included Assets, the Transferred Facilities, the Shared
Facilities, the real property and/or improvements, as applicable, leased
pursuant to the Transferred Leases or the Included Liabilities; (b) any
Proceeding or investigation; or (c) any other matter requiring any such
personnel, properties, books and records, Contracts, information or
commitments for any reasonable business purpose; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such access and assistance do not unreasonably disrupt the normal
operations of Buyer or Seller and documents requested by Buyer or Seller shall
require a reasonable business purpose and shall be limited to those documents
that reasonably relate to such purpose. In the event that documents requested
by a party include information relating to the Business and other businesses,
then the other party shall be permitted to redact the information relating to
the other businesses in such documents. Such access and assistance shall
include, without limitation, providing copies of all relevant portions of Tax
Returns with respect to the Business, the Included Assets, the Transferred
Facilities, the Shared Facilities, the real property and/or improvements, as
applicable, leased pursuant to the 



 

69  Transferred Leases, or the Included Liabilities, together with accompanying
schedules and related work papers, documents relating to rulings or other
determinations by taxing authorities and records concerning the ownership and
tax basis of the property, which either party may possess; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Seller shall not provide any tax basis information or Tax
Returns other than copies of the Federal pro forma, state and local income
and property, sales, use and franchise Tax Returns of the Kraft Pizza Company
for the years 2006 through 2008, with the returns for 2009 to be provided when
filed (and corresponding Canadian Tax Returns to the extent such Tax Returns
are filed (or pro forma versions of such Tax Returns are prepared) solely with
respect to the Canadian Included Assets; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for
the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall not be required to provide Buyer with
any Canadian Tax Returns that relate in whole or in part to any business or
assets other than the Canadian Included Assets or to prepare pro forma
versions of such Tax Returns). The party requesting such personnel,
properties, books and records, Contracts, information or commitments shall
bear all of the out-of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred in
connection with providing such personnel, properties, books and records,
Contracts, information or commitments. Each party shall retain all returns,
schedules and work papers and all material records or other documents relating
thereto, until the expiration of the statute of limitations (including
extensions) of the Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period to which
such returns and other documents relate and, unless the relevant portions of
such returns and other documents are offered to the other party, until the
final determination of any payments which may be required in respect of such
years under this Agreement. All information received pursuant to this
_Section 7.3_ shall be subject to the provisions of _Section 5.4_, except as
may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of returns or claims
for refund or in conducting any audit or other Proceeding.

7.4 _Bulk Sales Waiver_. Buyer and Seller hereby waive compliance with
the terms and conditions of any applicable bulk sales law or similar laws
that may be applicable to the sale or transfer of the Included Assets.

or the Competition Act or (b) as otherwise expressly provided herein
(including, without limitation, _Article 5_ and _Article 8_).

7.6 _Tax Matters_.

(a) _Allocation of Certain Taxes_. In the case of any Straddle Period, (i)
Property Taxes for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the amount of
such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that
is in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number
of days in the entire Straddle Period, and shall be an Excluded Liability and
(ii) Property Taxes for the Post-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the
amount of such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by
a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle
Period that is in the Post-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is
the number of days in the entire Straddle Period, and shall be an Included
Liability. The party that has the primary obligation to do so under 



 

70  Applicable Law shall file any Tax Return that is required to be filed in
respect of Taxes described in this _Section 7.6(a)_, and that party shall pay
the Taxes shown on such Tax Return. To the extent any such Taxes paid by
Buyer (or any refund of Taxes received by Buyer) is allocable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period, or any such Taxes paid by Seller (or any refund of Taxes
received by Seller) is allocable to the Post-Closing Tax Period, Buyer or
Seller (as applicable) shall pay to the other party such proportionate amount
promptly after the payment of such Taxes (or the receipt of any such refund).

(b) _Transfer Taxes_.

(i) All sales, use, retail sales, excise, goods and services, harmonized
sales, value-added, transfer, recording, privilege, documentary, registration,
conveyance, real estate transfer, excise, license, stamp, or similar Taxes,

the Included Assets pursuant to this Agreement and that are recoverable by
Buyer under Applicable Law governing the payment of transfer
taxes, including, but not limited to, GST, HST, and QST, and other similar
recoverable transfer taxes in other jurisdictions (the "Recoverable Transfer
Taxes") shall, subject to _Sections 7.6(b)(ii)_ and _7.6(b)(iii)_ , be paid
and borne by Buyer. All other sales, use, retail sales, excise, goods and
services, harmonized sales, value-added, transfer, recording, privilege,
documentary, registration, conveyance, real estate transfer, excise, license,
stamp, or similar Taxes arising out of, in connection with or attributable to
the purchase by Buyer of the Included Assets pursuant to this Agreement
(together with the Recoverable Transfer Taxes, the "Transfer Taxes") shall be
borne 50% by the Buyer and 50% by the Seller. The party that has the primary
obligation to file any Tax Return that is required to be filed in respect of
Transfer Taxes (the "Filing Party") shall prepare and file such return after
providing the other party the opportunity to review and approve the return
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Filing
Party shall, subject to reimbursement from the other party as provided in this
_Section 7.6(b)_, pay the Taxes shown on such Tax Return and the other party
shall reimburse the Filing Party for its share of such Transfer Taxes by wire
transfer of immediately available funds no later than five (5) days after
receipt of written notice (or notice delivered by electronic communication)
from the Filing Party that any such Transfer Tax is required to be paid to the
applicable Governmental Authority. The parties agree to cooperate with each
other in connection with the preparation and filing of any such Tax Returns,
in obtaining all available exemptions from such Transfer Taxes, and in timely
providing each other with resale certificates or other documents necessary to
satisfy any such exemptions.

(ii) Canadian Seller is registered for GST/HST and QST purposes and will
provide its registration numbers to the Buyer on or before Closing. The
Affiliate of Buyer that is purchasing the Canadian Included Assets hereunder
will provide the GST/HST and, if applicable, QST registration numbers to
Seller on or before Closing.

(iii) Notwithstanding _Sections 7.6(b)(i)_ and _(ii)_ , the Affiliate of Buyer
that is purchasing the Canadian Included Assets hereunder, which is a
corporation incorporated under the laws of Canada or a province thereof and
which has a place of business in the province of Ontario, shall not be
responsible to pay any provincial Transfer Taxes in respect of any
Included Assets referenced in any purchase exemption certificate completed by
such Affiliate of Buyer and provided to Seller on or before Closing.



 

71 (c) _Required Notices_. Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing upon
receipt by Seller (or any of its Affiliates, as applicable) of notice of any
pending or threatened Tax audits or assessments relating to the income,
properties or operations of Seller (or any of its Affiliates, as applicable)
that reasonably may be expected to relate to or give rise to a Lien on the
Included Assets or the Business. Each of Buyer and Seller (and any of Sellers
Affiliates, as applicable) shall promptly notify the other in writing upon
receipt of notice of any pending or threatened Tax audit or assessment
challenging the Final Allocation Schedule.

(d) _Canadian Election_. Buyer and Canadian Seller shall, if applicable,
jointly execute and file an election under subsection 20(24) of the _Income
Tax Act_ (Canada) in the manner required by subsection 20(25) of the _Income
Tax Act_ (Canada) and under the equivalent or corresponding provisions of any
other applicable provincial or territorial statute, in the prescribed forms
and within the time period permitted under the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada) and
under any other applicable provincial or territorial statute, as to such
amount paid by the Canadian Seller to Buyer or its designated Affiliate for
assuming future obligations. In this regard Buyer and Canadian Seller
acknowledge that a portion of the Included Assets transferred by Canadian
Seller pursuant to this Agreement and having a value equal to the amount
elected under subsection 20(24) of the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada) and the
equivalent provisions of any applicable provincial or territorial statute, is
being transferred by Canadian Seller as a payment for the assumption of such
future obligations by Buyer or its designated Affiliate.

(e) _Clearance Certificates_. Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to
provide Buyer, at the Closing, a clearance certificate or similar document(s)
that may be required by any state Tax authority in order to relieve Buyer of
any obligation to withhold any portion of the Initial Purchase Price or the
Final Purchase Price.

proceeds received by Buyer or its Affiliates under any Seller Insurance
Policy, 



 

73  incurred in connection with, arising out of, resulting from or incident to
(A) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of Seller made
in or pursuant to this Agreement, (B) any breach of any covenant or agreement

Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars ($18,500,000) (the "Lower
Basket"), and then only to the extent that the aggregate of all such Losses
relating thereto exceeds the Lower Basket and (y) with respect to breaches or

Facility or any Remedial Action relating thereto based on industrial use or
zoning; (C) costs incurred or Remedial Actions implemented that are
commercially unreasonable for purposes of remediating such Loss or Liability,

with respect to which Buyer and/or its Affiliates (and/or any of their
respective officers, directors, employees, shareholders, agents and
Representatives) are otherwise entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this Agreement (but for the provisions of this sentence).

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers obligation to indemnify or hold
harmless Buyer pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(C)_ for any Loss or Liability that
would be an Excluded Liability under _Section 1.6(h)_ under or relating to
any Environmental Law (or any Permit required thereunder) that (i) arises
from or relates to a Change in Environmental Law and (ii) is incremental to
any other Loss or Liability with respect to which Buyer and/or its Affiliates
(and/or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, shareholders,
agents and Representatives) are otherwise entitled to indemnification pursuant

and Liabilities, "Change in Environmental Law Losses"), shall be (A) only
fifty percent (50%) of such Change in Environmental Law Losses for claims made
within twenty (20) years following the Closing Date and (B) zero percent (0%)
of all such Change in Environmental Law Losses for claims made after twenty
(20) years following the Closing Date.

(d) To the extent a Loss or Liability under or relating to any Environmental
Law (or any Permit thereunder) for which Buyer and/or its Affiliates (and/or
any of their respective officers, directors, employees, shareholders, agents
and Representatives) are entitled to indemnification under this Agreement
arises (i) from a Change in Environmental Law that would require altering,
retrofitting or replacing the improvements, equipment or materials at the
Transferred Facilities (but not with respect any Loss or Liability arising
from or relating to the presence of any Hazardous Substances encountered in
the course of any such alterations, retrofitting or replacements) and (ii) is
incremental to any other Loss or Liability with respect to which Buyer and/or
its Affiliates (and/or any of their respective officers, directors,
employees, shareholders, agents and Representatives) are otherwise entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement (but for the provisions of this
sentence) (any such Losses and Liabilities, "Change in Law Alteration and
Retrofitting Losses"), then Seller shall have no indemnification obligation
with respect to such Change in Environmental Law Alteration and Retrofitting
Losses.

(e) Any Loss or Liability meeting the tests described in both _Section
8.2(b)(i)_ and _(ii)_ , fifty percent (50)% of any Change in Environmental

Date, one hundred percent (100%) of all Change in Environmental Law Losses for
claims made after twenty (20) years following the Closing Date and one
hundred percent (100%) of all Change in Law Alteration and Retrofitting Losses
shall be deemed to constitute Included Liabilities; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such Included Liabilities shall not include any such Loss or Liability
to the extent they are retained by Seller or its Affiliates (other than
pursuant to _Section 1.6(h)_), or otherwise are the responsibility of Seller
or its Affiliates pursuant to other provisions of this Agreement,
whether arising from Sellers breach or inaccuracy of a representation or
warranty (including, without limitation, the representations and warranties
contained in _Section 3.13_) or pursuant to Sellers indemnification
obligations or otherwise.

shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates and each of
their respective officers, directors, employees, shareholders, agents and
Representatives from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by
any such indemnified party, net of any Tax benefits actually realized in the
year of the related indemnity payment or earlier, calculated on a with and
without basis, attributable to the incurrence or payment of the incurred
Losses, to the extent incurred in connection with, arising out of, resulting
from or incident to (a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty of Buyer made in or pursuant to this Agreement, (b) any breach of any
covenant or agreement of Buyer made in or pursuant to this Agreement, (c) the
Included Liabilities, (d) all Liabilities with respect to Taxes relating to
the Business, the Included Assets and the Included Liabilities (other than
Excluded Taxes) for Post-Closing Tax Periods, or (e) any fees, expenses or
other payments incurred or owed by Buyer or its Affiliates to any agent,
broker, investment banker or other firm or Person retained or employed by it
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_
,  _however_ , that Buyer shall not have any Liability under clause (a) above
unless the aggregate of all Losses relating thereto for which Buyer would, but
for this proviso, be liable exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to
the Higher Basket, and then only to the extent that the aggregate of all such
Losses relating thereto exceeds the Higher Basket; _provided_ _further_ , that
Buyers aggregate liability under clause (a) above shall in no event
exceed the Cap.

8.4 _Exclusive Remedy; Damages_. Buyer and Seller each acknowledge and agree
that, from and after the Closing, their sole and exclusive remedy, with
respect to any and all claims relating to the subject matter of this Agreement
(other than specific performance or injunctive relief, with respect to claims
of, or causes of action arising from, fraud or with respect to matters
described in the last sentence of this _Section 8.4_), shall be pursuant to
the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article 8_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement or provided for under
any Applicable Law, no indemnifying party shall be liable to an indemnified
party hereunder for (i) any consequential damages, other than consequential
damages that such indemnified party would be able to recover under applicable
general principles of contract law under the circumstances ( _e.g_.,
reasonably foreseeable damages) or (ii) any punitive or exemplary damages,
except, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), where such damages are recovered
by a third party from an indemnified party in connection with Losses
indemnified hereunder. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
elsewhere in this Agreement in no case shall either party have any obligation
under  _Section 8.2(a)(C)_ or _Section 8.3(c)_ for any Liability or Loss
arising under Environmental Law (i) with respect to real property that is
leased pursuant to the Transferred Leases and (ii) with respect to the
presence of Hazardous Substances on the Transferred Facilities that are
naturally occurring (and not the result of any release or disposal of
Hazardous Substances at, in, on, under or from the Transferred Facilities, any
use of the Transferred Facilities prior to the Effective Time or any act of
man).

8.5 _Procedures Relating to Indemnification_.

(a) In respect of any claim regarding indemnification for any Liability or
Loss arising under this Agreement, the Person making such claim shall have
the burden of proof that such Person is entitled to such indemnification.



 

76 (b) In order for an indemnified party to be entitled to any indemnification
provided for under this _Article 8_ in respect of, arising out of or
involving a claim or demand made by any Person, Governmental Authority or
corporation against the indemnified party (a "Third-Party Claim"), such
indemnified party shall notify the indemnifying party in writing, and in
reasonable detail to the extent known, of the Third-Party Claim promptly after
receipt by such indemnified party of notice of the Third-Party Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such notification shall not
affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
indemnifying party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure. The indemnified party shall deliver to the indemnifying party,
within ten (10) Business Days after the indemnified partys receipt thereof,
copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
indemnified party relating to the Third-Party Claim.

(c) If a Third-Party Claim is made against an indemnified party, and the
indemnifying party acknowledges in writing to the indemnified party that the
indemnifying party shall be obligated under the terms of its indemnity
hereunder in connection with such Third-Party Claim, then the indemnifying
party shall be entitled if it so elects, at its own cost, risk and expense, to
assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the indemnifying party
and reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. The indemnifying party
will have fifteen (15) calendar days from receipt of any such notice of a
Third-Party Claim to give notice to assume the defense thereof. Should the
indemnifying party so elect to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the
indemnifying party will not be liable to the indemnified party for legal
expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with
the defense thereof, unless the joint representation of the indemnifying party
and the indemnified party by a single law firm with respect to such Third-
Party Claim involves potential conflicts of interest or
substantially different defenses for the indemnified party and the
indemnifying party, or the Third-Party Claim seeks an injunction or other
equitable relief against the indemnified party that would restrict or
adversely affect the ongoing business or operations of such indemnified party
or its Affiliates in a material manner if successful. If the indemnifying
party assumes such defense, the indemnified party shall have the right to
participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense
(except to the extent provided in the immediately preceding sentence),
separate from the counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it being
understood that the indemnifying party shall control such defense. If the
indemnifying party shall have assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the
indemnified party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle,
compromise or discharge, such Third-Party Claim without the indemnifying
partys prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld). Any compromise or settlement of a Third-Party Claim by the
indemnifying party shall be made only with the written Consent of the
indemnified party (in its sole discretion), if such compromise or settlement
(i) would restrict or adversely affect the indemnified party or the conduct of
any of its or its Affiliates businesses or operations in a material manner,
(ii) would include an admission of wrongdoing or misconduct by
the indemnified party, (iii) does not fully and irrevocably release the
indemnified party from all Liabilities and obligations with respect to such
Third-Party Claim, (iv) involves any claim for which the indemnified party is
not fully indemnified by the indemnifying party or (v) imposes any injunctive
or other equitable relief against the indemnified party. If the indemnifying
party fails to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim within fifteen (15)
calendar days after receipt of such notice, the indemnified party against
which such Third-Party Claim has been asserted will (upon delivering notice to
such effect to the indemnifying party) have the right to undertake, at the
indemnifying partys cost and expense, the defense, 



 

77  compromise or settlement of such claim on behalf of and for the account and
risk of the indemnifying party. In the event the indemnified party assumes the
defense of the Third-Party Claim, the indemnified party will keep the
indemnifying party reasonably informed of the progress of any such defense,
compromise or settlement; provided, however, that if the indemnifying party
has agreed in writing that it is obligated under the terms of its indemnity
hereunder in connection with such Third-Party Claim, then any compromise or
settlement of a Third-Party Claim by the indemnified party shall require the
prior written Consent of the indemnifying party (not to be unreasonably
withheld). The indemnifying party shall be liable for the fees and expenses
of one (1) outside counsel and reasonably necessary local counsel employed by
the indemnified party for any period during which the indemnifying party has
not assumed the defense thereof. If the indemnifying party chooses to defend
any Third-Party Claim, all the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense
or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the indemnifying partys request) the provision to the indemnifying party of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party
Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder.

(d) The indemnified party will notify the indemnifying party in writing as
soon as practicable of its discovery of any matter or condition that does not
involve a Third-Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected
from the indemnified party, giving rise to the claim of indemnity pursuant
hereto. The failure so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the
indemnifying party from liability on account of this indemnification, except
only if and to the extent that the indemnifying party demonstrates actual
damage caused by such failure. The indemnifying party will have fifteen (15)
calendar days from receipt of any such notice to give notice of dispute of the
claim to the indemnified party. The indemnified party will reasonably
cooperate and assist the indemnifying party in determining the validity of
any claim for indemnity by the indemnified party and in otherwise resolving
such matters. Such assistance and cooperation will include providing
reasonable access to and copies of information, records and documents relating
to such matters, and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the parties rights and
obligations under _Sections 8.2(a)_ , _8.3_ , _8.5(a)_ , _8.5(b)_ , _8.5(c)_
or _8.5(d)_ or the limitations on Sellers indemnification obligations under
_Section 8.2(b)_, _(c) _or _(d)_ , Buyer shall be entitled to manage,
control and/or perform any remedial or other responsive action or remedy or
investigation ("Remedial Action"), in connection with any Liability under or
relating to any Environmental Law that is or may reasonably become the subject
of any claim for indemnification by the Buyer under this Agreement; _provided_
that (i) the need for and the nature or scope of any such Remedial Action,
and any workplan, proposed action or selection of consultant in connection
therewith, shall be subject to Sellers prior review; (ii) Buyer shall provide
Seller with (A) copies of reports, studies, investigations, data, sampling
results or, as reasonably requested by Seller, other correspondence,
documentation or information relating to such Remedial Action; (B) a
reasonable opportunity to comment in advance on drafts of reports, studies or
investigations and on any material submissions or communications to any
Governmental Authority in connection with such Remedial Action, which Buyer
shall reasonably consider, and to attend (but not participate in) any
meetings with any Government Authority regarding any such Remedial 



 

78  Action; (C) access any applicable Buyer real property or facility reasonably
necessary for Seller to monitor or observe, or for Seller to collect (at
Sellers expense) split samples relating to, such Remedial Action; and (D)
updates on the status of any such Remedial Action on a regular basis or as
otherwise reasonably requested by Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing, but
without limiting the parties rights and obligations under _Sections 8.2(a)_
, _8.3_ , _8.5(a)_ , _8.5(b)_ , _8.5(c)_ or _8.5(d)_ or the limitations on
Sellers indemnification obligations under _Section 8.2(b)_, _(c) _or _(d)_
, Buyer shall have the sole authority to make any and all decisions with
respect to Remedial Actions. Any Remedial Action that is the subject of any
claim for indemnification by the Buyer under this Agreement shall be performed
in accordance with all applicable Environmental Laws and in a workmanlike
manner. Buyer and Seller shall reasonably cooperate with one another in
connection with any Remedial Action that is the subject of any claim for
indemnification by the Buyer under this Agreement. In the event that Seller
or Buyer may have a claim against any third party (including any landlord of
any leased property), or any legal defense, with respect to any Liability
under or relating to any Environmental Law that is or may reasonably
become the subject of any claim for indemnification by the Buyer under this
Agreement (regardless of whether any such Liability involves any Remedial
Action), Buyer shall cooperate with Seller, at Sellers sole cost and expense
(other than Buyers administrative and other internal costs), with respect to
asserting and establishing such claim or defense.

(f) Each party shall act in a commercially reasonable manner with respect to
any Remedial Action and any other matter that, in each case, is or may
reasonably become the subject of any claim for indemnification for any Loss or
Liability under or relating to any Environmental Law by such party under this
Agreement, including reasonably promptly taking action in response to known
non-compliance with Environmental Laws if taking action would be commercially
reasonable and would avoid further exacerbation of Liabilities or Losses
associated with such non-compliance. Buyer shall follow in all material
respects the same internal standards regarding compliance with Environmental
Laws with respect to the Transferred Facilities that it applies to its
other comparable manufacturing facilities in the United States.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a partys failure to take the actions to it
described in the immediately preceding two sentences shall not affect the
other partys indemnification obligations hereunder, except to the extent
such failure has resulted in Losses or Liabilities in excess of those for
which the other party would have been responsible absent such failure.

(g) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Sections 8.5(b)_ , _(c)_ and _(d)_ ,
if a Third-Party Claim relating to Taxes ("Tax Claim") shall be made by any
Governmental Authority which, if successful, might result in an indemnity
payment to Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, pursuant to
this _Article 8_, the indemnified party shall notify the indemnifying party
in writing of such Tax Claim within 15 days of receipt of any written notice
from the taxing authority, and shall give the indemnifying party such other
information with respect thereto as the indemnifying party may reasonably
request. With respect to any Tax Claim, the indemnifying party may, at its own
expense, participate in and assume the defense of any such claim, suit,
action, litigation or Proceeding (including any Tax audit); _provided_ , 
_however_ , that if the indemnifying party assumes such defense, the
indemnified party may participate in such defense. In no case shall a party
settle or otherwise compromise any Tax Claim without the prior written Consent
of the other party (which Consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.) Anything to the contrary in this _Section 8.5_ notwithstanding, if
a Tax Claim includes or could reasonably be expected to include both a claim
for Taxes that are Excluded Taxes and a 



 

79  claim for Taxes that are not Excluded Taxes, and such claim for Taxes that
are Excluded Taxes is not separable from such a claim for Taxes that are not
Excluded Taxes, Seller (if the claim for Taxes that are Excluded Taxes
exceeds or reasonably could be expected to exceed in amount the claim for
Taxes that are not Excluded Taxes) or otherwise the Buyer (Seller or Buyer, as
the case may be, the "Controlling Party"), shall be entitled to control the
defense of such Tax Claim. In such case, the other party (Seller or Buyer, as
the case may be, the "Non-Controlling Party") shall be entitled to participate
fully (at the Non-Controlling Partys sole expense) in the conduct of such
Tax Claim and the Controlling Party shall not settle such Tax Claim without
the consent of such Non-Controlling Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld). The costs and expenses of conducting the defense of
such Tax Claim shall be reasonably apportioned based on the relative amounts
of the Tax Claim that are Excluded Taxes and the Tax Claim that are not
Excluded Taxes. It is provided, however, that neither party shall be required
to provide the other party with copies of, or access to, its consolidated
income tax returns or audits of any consolidated income tax returns (except to
the extent they relate solely to the relevant Tax Claims).

8.6 _Recoverable Damages_. The term "Losses" as used in _Section 8.2_ or
_Section 8.3_ is not limited to matters asserted by any third Person against
Seller or Buyer, but includes Losses incurred or sustained by Seller or Buyer
in the absence of other Person claims. Payments by Buyer of amounts for which
Buyer is indemnified hereunder, and payment by Seller of amounts for which
Seller is indemnified, shall not be a condition precedent to recovery.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, for purposes of
determining the amount of any Losses that are the subject matter of a claim
for indemnification hereunder, each representation and warranty in this
Agreement and each certificate or document delivered pursuant hereto shall be
read without giving effect to any deductible or threshold dollar amounts or
the terms "material" or "Material Adverse Effect" in each instance where the
effect of such term would be to make such representation and warranty less
restrictive (as if such words and surrounding related words (e.g., "reasonably
be expected to," "could have" and similar restrictions and qualifiers) were
deleted from such representation and warranty). The amount of any Losses
payable under _Article 8_ , as between Canadian Seller and designated
Canadian Affiliate of Buyer, as determined without regard to _Article 8_
shall be increased by an amount equal to the rate of GST/HST (and QST if
applicable) applied to such amount.

8.7 _Recoverable Damages for Certain Tax Representations and Warranties_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, for purposes of
determining (i) whether there has been a breach or inaccuracy of a
representation or warranty and (ii) the amount of any Losses that are the
subject matter of a claim for indemnification hereunder, each representation
and warranty in _Section 3.16(d)_ and _Section 3.16(g)_ shall be read
without giving effect to the term "material" where the effect of such term
would be to make such representation and warranty less restrictive (as if
such word were deleted from such representation and warranty).

8.8 _Adjustment for Tax Purposes_. Any indemnity payment made pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article 8_ shall be deemed to be and treated as, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price
for tax purposes.



 

80 ARTICLE 9

_TERMINATION_

9.1 _Basis for Termination_. Anything contained herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated and the transactions
contemplated hereby abandoned at any time prior to the Closing Date:

(a) by mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer;

(b) either by Seller or Buyer if the Closing does not occur on or prior to
October 4, 2010 (the "End Date"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the End Date
may be extended by either party, by written notice to the other party, to
January 4, 2011 (the "Extended End Date"), in the event that all conditions to
Closing in _Section 2.2_ and _Section 2.3_ (other than the conditions
set forth in _Section 2.2(g)_ and _Section 2.3(e)_ (the "Regulatory
Conditions")) have been or are reasonably capable of being satisfied at the
time of such extension and the Regulatory Conditions are reasonably capable
of being satisfied on or prior to the Extended End Date;

(c) by Buyer if there is a breach of any representation or warranty set forth
in _Article 3_ hereof (disregarding all qualifications and exceptions
contained therein relating to Sellers Knowledge, materiality, Material
Adverse Effect or words of similar import) which, individually or in
the aggregate, would reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect
or any failure to perform in any material respect any covenant or agreement to
be complied with or performed by Seller pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement or the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 2.2_ to be
satisfied (and such condition is not waived in writing by Buyer) on or prior
to the Extended End Date, or the occurrence of any event which results or
would result in the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 2.2_ to be
satisfied on or prior to the Extended End Date, if such breach or failure to
perform cannot be cured or has not been cured within forty-five (45) calendar
days following the receipt by Seller of written notice from Buyer of such
breach or failure to perform; or

(d) by Seller if there is a breach of any representation or warranty set
forth in _Article 4_ hereof (disregarding all qualifications and exceptions
contained therein relating to Buyers knowledge, materiality, material adverse
effect or words of similar import) that would have a material adverse effect
on Buyers ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any failure to perform in any material respect any covenant or
agreement to be complied with or performed by Buyer pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement or the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 2.3_ to
be satisfied (and such condition is not waived in writing by Seller) on or
prior to the Extended End Date, or the occurrence of any event which results
or would result in the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 2.3_ to
be satisfied on or prior to the Extended End Date, if such breach or failure
to perform cannot be cured or has not been cured within forty-five (45)
calendar days following the receipt by Buyer of written notice from Seller of
such breach or failure to perform;

_provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to clause (b), (c) or (d) shall not be available to a party whose failure to
fulfill materially any covenant or obligation under this Agreement has been
the cause of, or resulted in (or would result in), the failure of the Closing
to occur on or before the Extended End Date.



 

81 9.2 _Notice of Termination_. In the event of termination by Seller or Buyer
pursuant to this _Article 9_ , written notice thereof shall forthwith be
given to the other party and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be terminated, without further action by any party.

9.3 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby are abandoned as described in this _Article
9_ , this Agreement shall become void and of no further force and effect,
except for the provisions of (a) _Sections 3.10_ and _4.4_ relating to
finders fees and brokers fees, (b) _Section 7.2_ relating to publicity,
(d) _Section 7.5_ relating to expenses, (e) this _Section 9.3_ and (f)
_Article 10_. Nothing in this _Article 9_ shall be deemed to release
any party from any liability for any breach by such party of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement or to limit or restrict the availability of
specific performance or other injunctive relief to the extent that specific
performance or such other relief would otherwise be available to a party
hereunder.

ARTICLE 10

_GENERAL PROVISIONS_

10.1 _Assignment_. Except as set forth below, this Agreement and the rights
and obligations hereunder shall not be assignable or transferable by Buyer or
Seller without the prior written consent of each of the other parties hereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any party hereto Buyer
may assign its right to purchase any of the Included Assets, its right to
license the Licensed Intellectual Property or any of its other rights
hereunder or under the Collateral Agreements to one or more Affiliates of
Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that no assignment shall limit or affect the
assignors obligations hereunder. Subject to the first two sentences of this 
_Section 10.1_, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Any
attempted assignment or transfer in violation of this _Section 10.1_ shall
be void.

10.2 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except for Persons entitled to
indemnification under _Article 8_ hereof, this Agreement is for the sole
benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted successors and assigns, and
nothing herein express or implied shall give or be construed to give to any
Person, other than the parties hereto, any legal or equitable rights
hereunder as a third-party beneficiary or otherwise.

10.3 _Amendments_. No amendment, supplement, modification or cancellation of
this Agreement shall be effective unless it shall be in writing and signed by
each party hereto.

10.4  _Waiver of Compliance_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
any failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition herein may be waived by the party entitled to the
benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by such party, granting
such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with
such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a
waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any other provision hereof (whether
or not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless
otherwise expressly provided.



 

82 10.5 _Notices_. All notices or other communications required or permitted to
be given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered by hand or sent
by facsimile, or sent, postage prepaid, by registered, certified or express

shall be deemed given when delivered by hand or faxed, three days after
mailing (one Business Day in the case of guaranteed overnight express mail or
guaranteed overnight courier service), as follows:

or to such other address(es) as shall be furnished in writing by any such
party to each of the other parties hereto in accordance with the provisions of
this _Section 10.5_.

10.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement,
and shall become effective when one or more such counterparts have been signed
by each of the parties and delivered to the other party.

10.7 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the application of
any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be held invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction,
such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provision hereof.

10.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to agreements
made and to be performed entirely within such State, without regard to the
conflicts of law principles of such State (to the extent the application of
the laws of another jurisdiction would be required thereby).

10.9 _Actions and Proceedings_. Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to
submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Federal and state courts in
the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York in the event any
dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court
and (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other
than such state or Federal court. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably
consents to the service of any summons and complaint and any other process in
any other action relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
on behalf of itself or its property, by the personal delivery of copies of
such process to such party. Nothing in this _Section 10.9_ shall affect the
right of any party hereto to serve legal process in any other manner permitted
by law.



 

84 10.10 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any provision of this Agreement (including, without
limitation, _Section 5.5_) were not performed in accordance with the terms
hereof and that the parties shall be entitled, without posting a bond or
similar indemnity, to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof in any Federal or state court sitting in the Borough of
Manhattan, the City of New York, in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity.

10.11 _Inclusion in Disclosure Schedules_. Inclusion of any matter in any
Disclosure Schedule does not imply that such matter would, under the
provisions of this Agreement, have to be included in such Disclosure Schedule.

10.12 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Collateral Agreements and the
Confidentiality Agreement dated February 4, 2009 between Buyer and Seller (the
"Confidentiality Agreement") contain the entire agreement and understanding
between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and,
except to the extent specifically set forth herein, supersede all prior
agreements and understandings relating to such subject matter.

10.13 _Disclosure Schedules_. Any disclosure contained in any section of the
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed with respect to any other
section of such Disclosure Schedule as though fully set forth in such other
section for which the applicability of such disclosure is reasonably apparent
on the face of such disclosure.

10.14 _Interpretive Matters_.

(a) Notwithstanding the third sentence of _Section 8.1_, if to Buyers
Knowledge as of the date of this Agreement, a particular representation or
warranty of Seller in _Article 3_ is materially inaccurate on the date of
this Agreement (other than as disclosed in the Disclosure Schedules, and
subject to all qualifications and exceptions relating to Sellers Knowledge,
Material Adverse Effect, materiality or words of similar import contained in
_Article 3_ ), Seller shall not have any liability under _Section 8.2(a)(A)_
in respect of such particular materially inaccurate representation or warranty
(to the extent of Buyers Knowledge of such inaccuracy as of the date of this
Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall have the burden of
proof of demonstrating that the material inaccuracy of such representation or
warranty was within Buyers Knowledge as of the date of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 10.14(a)_
shall affect the status of any matter as an Included Liability or Excluded
