ARTICLE III

  

  

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK;

  

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

  

  

Section 3.1 Effect on Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Acquisition Sub or
the holders of any securities of the Company or Acquisition Sub:

  

  

(a) Cancellation of Company Securities. Each share of Company Common Stock
held by the Company as treasury stock, held by a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Company or held by Parent or Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor
or in respect thereof.

  

  

(b) Conversion of Company Securities. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to the
Recapitalization, including the Total Option Cash Payment, and other than
shares canceled pursuant to Section 3.1(a) and Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted into the right to receive $7.31 in cash, without interest (the
"Merger Consideration"). Each share of Company Common Stock to be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section
3.1(b) shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist, and the
holders of certificates (the "Certificates") or book-entry shares ("Book-Entry
Shares") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such
Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Company Common Stock other than the right to receive, upon surrender of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section 3.2, the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon.

  

  

(c) Conversion of Acquisition Sub Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
each share of common stock, par value of $0.001 per share, of Acquisition Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one (1) fully paid

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation and constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(d) Adjustments. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement and
subject to Section 6.1(c), if at any time during the period between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number of
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall occur as a result of a
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, the
Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change;
provided that the parties acknowledge that the Recapitalization shall not
require an adjustment to the Merger Consideration.

  

  

Section 3.2 Exchange of Certificates.

  

  

(a) Designation of Paying Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall designate a paying agent (the "Paying Agent"),
the identity and the terms of appointment of which shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company, for the payment of the Merger Consideration as
provided in Section 3.1(b) and to effect the Recapitalization contemplated by
Section 6.14. On or before the Effective Time, (i) Parent shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, cash constituting an amount equal
to the Total Common Merger Consideration, and (ii) the Company shall deposit,
or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, cash constituting an amount
equal to the Total Recapitalization Cash Portion and the Total Option Cash
Payments (the sum of the Total Common Merger Consideration, Total
Recapitalization Cash Portion (less the Total Recapitalization Restricted
Stock Unit Cash Payment) and the Total Option Cash Payments as deposited with
the Paying Agent, the "Exchange Fund"). In the event the Total Common Merger
Consideration portion of the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the
payments contemplated by Section 3.1(b), Parent shall promptly deposit, or
cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount
that is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment.
Following the Effective Time, if not already paid, Parent shall promptly cause
the Paying Agent to make, and the Paying Agent shall make, payments of the
Total Common Merger Consideration and the Total Recapitalization Cash Portion
to the holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.1(b) and Section
6.14, and payments of the Total Option Cash Payments to the holders of Company
Options pursuant to Section 3.3(a). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for
any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to Section 3.1, Section
3.3(a) and Section 6.14, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement.

  

  

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in any event
not later than the second Business Day thereafter, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail (and to make available for collection by
hand) (i) to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock (x) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to
the Paying Agent and which shall be in the form and have such other provisions
as Parent may reasonably specify and (y) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration and

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

Recapitalization Cash Portion into which the number of shares of Company
Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement (which instructions shall
provide that, at the election of the surrendering holder, (1) Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares may be surrendered by hand delivery or otherwise or (2) the
Merger Consideration and Recapitalization Cash Portion in exchange therefor
may be collected by hand by the surrendering holder or by wire transfer to the
surrendering holder), and (ii) to each holder of a Company Option, a check or
direct deposit in an amount due and payable to such holder pursuant to Section
3.3(a) in respect of such Company Option.

  

  

(c) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a letter
of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions (including, without limitation, any necessary Tax forms),
the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration and the Recapitalization
Cash Portion for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, to be mailed, made available for
collection by hand or delivered by wire transfer, as elected by the
surrendering holder, within two (2) Business Days following the later to occur
of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) the Paying Agent's receipt of such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share, and
the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share so
surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. The Paying Agent shall accept such
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2(c),
each Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed, at any time after the Effective Time, to represent only the
right to receive, upon proper surrender, the Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this Article III and the Recapitalization Cash Portion as
contemplated by Section 6.14. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the
benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger
Consideration and Recapitalization Cash Portion payable upon the surrender of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

  

  

(d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, it shall be a
condition of payment that any Certificate surrendered in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 3.2 shall be properly endorsed or shall
be otherwise in proper form for transfer, or any Book-Entry Share shall be
properly transferred, and that the person requesting such payment shall have
paid any transfer taxes and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of
the Merger Consideration and Recapitalization Cash Portion to a person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered
or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either
has been paid or is not applicable.

  

  

(e) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent
(including, without limitation, all interest and other income received by the
Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to it), upon

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

demand, and any such holders prior to the Merger who have not theretofore
complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to Surviving
Corporation and Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheatment or other
similar Laws) as general creditor thereof for payment of their claims for
cash, without interest, to which such holders may be entitled under or
pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

(f) No Liability. None of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any cash held in the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the
date on which any cash in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Authority, any such cash in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto.

  

  

(g) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation; provided that (i) no such investment shall
relieve Parent or the Paying Agent from making the Total Common Merger
Consideration payments required by this Article III, and, to the extent that
there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund
diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments
of the Total Common Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall
promptly replace or restore the portion of the Exchange Fund lost through
investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is
reasonably maintained at a level sufficient to make the Total Common Merger
Consideration payments, (ii) no such investment shall have maturities that
could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement, and
(iii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States
of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by
the United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States of America. Any interest or income produced by such investments
will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as directed by Parent.

  

  

(h) Withholdings. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration, the Option
Cash Payment and the Recapitalization Cash Portion and any amounts otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock and Company Options such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of applicable Tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

Section 3.3 Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units; Employee Stock Purchase
Plan.

  

  

(a) Treatment of Company Options. As of the filing of the Recapitalization
Certificate, each Company Option that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Recapitalization (whether vested or unvested) shall
be deemed fully vested and canceled without any action on the part of any
holder of any Company Option in consideration for the right at the time of the
Recapitalization to receive, as promptly as reasonably practicable following
the Recapitalization, a cash payment with respect thereto equal to the product
of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option as of immediately prior to the Recapitalization and (B) the excess, if
any, of the Option Per Share Consideration over the exercise price per share
of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option, less any required
withholding Taxes (the "Option Cash Payment," and the sum of all such
payments, the "Total Option Cash Payments"); provided that each Company Option
for which the Option Per Share Consideration does not exceed the exercise
price per share of the Company\'s Common Stock subject to such Company Option
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Recapitalization (whether
vested or unvested) shall be cancelled without consideration and without any
action on the part of any holder of such Company Option. As of the
Recapitalization, all Company Options shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically terminate and cease to exist, and each holder of a Company
Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Option Cash Payment in respect thereof.

  

  

(b) Treatment of Company Restricted Stock Units. As of the Effective Time,
each Company Restricted Stock Unit that is issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall become or
otherwise be deemed fully vested and all restrictions thereon shall lapse and
each Company Restricted Stock Unit for which vesting accelerated and
restrictions lapsed at the Effective Time, shall, in either case, be canceled
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of
any Company Restricted Stock Unit in consideration for the right at the
Effective Time to receive, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
Effective Time, a cash payment with respect thereto equal to the product of
(i) the number of shares of Common Stock previously subject to such Company
Restricted Stock Unit and (ii) the Merger Consideration, less any required
withholding Taxes (the "Restricted Stock Unit Payment," and the sum of all
such payments, the "Total Restricted Stock Unit Payments"), subject, however,
to any rights of such holder pursuant to Section 3.5. As of the Effective
Time, all Company Restricted Stock Units shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically terminate and cease to exist, and each holder of a Company
Restricted Stock Unit shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Restricted Stock Unit Payment. As soon as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, and in any event
prior to and effective as of the Effective Time, the Company's board of
directors (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the
Company's equity incentive plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such
other actions as necessary to effectuate this Section 3.3(b). All Restricted
Stock Unit Payments and Recapitalization Restricted Stock Unit Payments shall
be made promptly after the Effective Time by the Parent through the Surviving
Corporation's payroll account.

  

  

(c) Withholdings. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the Total Restricted Stock Unit Payments and any
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of any
Company Restricted Stock Unit such

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

amounts as Parent or the Surviving Corporation are required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(d) No Adjustment. Except with respect to acceleration and vesting of the
Company Options and in connection with the Patent Sale Transaction and the
Recapitalization as determined by the Company\'s board of directors, neither
the Recapitalization, nor the Patent Sale Transaction, shall result in any
change, modification or adjustment in or to any Company Option, including, but
not limited to, any reduction in the exercise price of the Company Options. In
addition, except with respect to acceleration and vesting of the Company
Restricted Stock Units and other than in connection with the Patent Sale
Transaction and the Recapitalization as determined by the Company\'s board of
directors, neither the Recapitalization, nor the Patent Sale Transaction,
shall result in any change, modification or adjustment to the Company
Restricted Stock Units, including, but not limited to, the creation of
additional rights with respect to any Company Restricted Stock Unit.

  

  

(e) Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Effective as of no later than
the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Company shall have
terminated the Employee Stock Purchase Plan of the Company (the "Company
ESPP") and shall have provided such notice of termination as may be required
by the terms of the Company ESPP. Prior to such termination date of the
Company ESPP, the Company shall determine the date on which the then-current
offering period, if any, shall terminate in accordance with the terms of the
Company ESPP; and accumulated payroll deductions on such date shall be used to
purchase the applicable number of shares of Company Common Stock.

  

  

Section 3.4 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration and Recapitalization Cash
Portion to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this Article III.

  

  

Section 3.5 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, to the extent that holders thereof are entitled to appraisal
rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, shares of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder
who has properly exercised and perfected his or her demand for appraisal
rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but the holders
of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive such consideration as
shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the Effective
Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights set forth in
Section 262 of the

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

DGCL); provided, however, that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect
or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his or her right to appraisal and
payment under the DGCL, such holder's shares of Company Common Stock shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and
such shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. Any payments required
to be made with respect to the Dissenting Shares shall be made by Parent (and
not the Company or the Acquisition Sub), and the Aggregate Merger
Consideration shall be reduced, on a dollar for dollar basis, by the amount of
the Aggregate Merger Consideration to which the holders of such Dissenting
Shares would have been entitled had they not exercised their appraisal rights.
The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal or payment of the fair value of any shares of Company Common Stock
or withdrawals of such demands and (b) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
Section 262 of the DGCL. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Parent, make any payment with respect
to, or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

  

  

Section 3.6 Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights. Subject to Section 3.2 and
Section 3.3, from and after the Effective Time, the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Common Stock,
except as otherwise provided herein and by applicable Law. The Total Common
Merger Consideration and Total Recapitalization Cash Portion paid in respect
of shares of Company Common Stock, upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article
III shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. From and after the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation with respect to the Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. After the Effective Time,
Company Common Stock presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent for any reason, shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Article III.

its subsidiaries has the requisite corporate, partnership or limited liability
company power and authority and all necessary governmental approvals to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now

good standing, in each jurisdiction in which the character of the properties
owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed or to be in good standing would not have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

15  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
Exchange Act) to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by

information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company's
internal controls over financial reporting. No executive officer of the
Company has failed to make the certifications required of him or her under

permitted by this Agreement, (a) the businesses of the Company and its
subsidiaries have been conducted in the ordinary course of business consistent

balance sheet of the Company and its subsidiaries as of June 30, 2012 (the

course of business consistent with past practice since the Balance Sheet Date,
(c) for liabilities or obligations incurred or arising under the terms of any
Contract or Permit binding upon the Company or any of its subsidiaries
(including any contingent indemnification obligations), (d) for liabilities
permitted or contemplated by this Agreement and (e) for liabilities or
obligations which have been discharged or paid in full in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice, as of the date of this Agreement,
neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise,
and whether due or to become due, that would be required by GAAP to be
reflected or reserved against on a consolidated balance sheet (or the notes
thereto) of the Company and its subsidiaries, other than those which would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. There are no unconsolidated subsidiaries of the
Company or any off-balance sheet arrangements of any type (including any off-
balance sheet arrangement required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 303(a)(4)
of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act) that have not been so
described in the Company SEC Documents nor any obligations to enter into any
such arrangements.

its subsidiaries, or any of their respective properties or assets at law or in
equity, and there are no Orders, by or before any arbitrator or Governmental
Authority,

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

in each case as would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the Company,
as of the date of this Agreement, no director or officer of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries is a defendant in any suit, action, or proceeding to which
the Company or any of its subsidiaries is not also a defendant, including as a
nominal defendant, in connection with his or her status as a director or
officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

  

  

Section 4.14 Employee Benefit Plans.

  

  

(a) Company has furnished to Parent true and complete copies of each of the
Company Benefit Plans and material documentation related thereto. With respect
to each Company Benefit Plan that is subject to ERISA reporting requirements,
Company has provided copies of the Form 5500 reports filed for the last three
plan years. Company has furnished Parent with the most recent Internal Revenue
Service determination or opinion letter issued with respect to each such
Company Benefit Plan, and to Company's knowledge nothing has occurred since
the issuance of each such letter that could reasonably be expected to cause
the loss of the tax-qualified status of any Company Benefit Plan subject to
Code Section 401(a).

  

  

(b) Each Company Benefit Plan has been operated and administered in accordance
with its terms and applicable Law, including, but not limited to, ERISA and
the Code, except for instances of noncompliance that would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. There are
no pending investigations by any Governmental Authority, termination
proceedings or other claims (except routine claims for benefits payable under
the Company Benefit Plans) against or involving any Company Benefit Plan or
asserting any rights to or claims for benefits under any Company Benefit Plan,
other than any such investigations, proceedings, or claims that would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(c) Neither Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever maintained, established,
sponsored, participated in, contributed to, or is obligated to contribute to,
or otherwise incurred any obligation or liability (including without
limitation any contingent liability) under any "multiemployer plan" (as
defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) or to any "pension plan" (as defined in
Section 3(2) of ERISA) subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the
Code. None of Company or any ERISA Affiliate has any actual or potential
withdrawal liability (including without limitation any contingent liability)
for any complete or partial withdrawal (as defined in Sections 4203 and 4205
of ERISA) from any multiemployer plan.

  

  

(d) Each Company Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code, and the trust (if any) forming a part thereof, has received a
favorable determination or opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service as
to its qualification under the Code and to the effect that each such trust is
exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code, and, to the knowledge
of the Company, nothing has occurred since the date of such determination or
opinion letter that could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect on such qualification or tax-
exempt status.

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(e) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
whether alone or together with any other event, will not (i) entitle any
current or former employee or director of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to severance pay or any other payment under any Company Benefit
Plan or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the
amount, of compensation due any such current or former employee or director
under a Company Benefit Plan.

  

  

(f) No Company Benefit Plan provides benefits, including without limitation
death or medical benefits (whether or not insured), with respect to current or
former employees or directors of the Company or its subsidiaries beyond their
retirement or other termination of service, other than (i) coverage mandated
solely by applicable Law, (ii) death benefits or retirement benefits under any
"employee pension benefit plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA),
(iii) deferred compensation benefits accrued as liabilities on the books of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (iv) benefits the full costs of which
are borne by the current or former employee or director or his or her
beneficiary, (v) or certain rights to exercise stock options for a period of
time beyond such recipient's last day of service with the Company.

  

  

(g) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan established or maintained
outside of the United States of America primarily for benefit of employees of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries residing outside the United States of
America (a "Non-U.S. Benefit Plan"), except as would not have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect: (i) all employer and
employee contributions to each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan required by Law or by the
terms of such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan have been made, or, if applicable,
accrued, in accordance with normal accounting practices; (ii) the fair market
value of the assets of each funded Non-U.S. Benefit Plan, the liability of
each insurer for any Non-U.S. Benefit Plan funded through insurance or the
book reserve established for any Non-U.S. Benefit Plan, together with any
accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued
benefit obligations with respect to all current and former participants in
such plan according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently
used to determine employer contributions to such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan and no
transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such assets or
insurance obligations to be less than such benefit obligations; and (iii) each
Non-U.S. Benefit Plan required to be registered has been registered and has
been maintained in good standing with applicable regulatory authorities.

  

  

(h) Each "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (within the meaning of
Section 409A of the Code) is in material compliance with the requirements of
409A of the Code and guidance promulgated thereunder by its terms and has been
operated in material compliance with such requirements. All Company Options
were granted with an exercise price at least equal to the fair market value of
the Company's common stock (as determined pursuant to the applicable
provisions of Section 409A and 422 of the Code and the Regulations promulgated
thereunder) on the date such options were granted by the Company's board of
directors (or a committee thereof), and the Company has not incurred nor would
the Company or Parent reasonably be expected to incur any liability or
obligation to withhold taxes under Section 409A of the Code upon the vesting
of any Company Options or Company Restricted Stock Units, nor would the
vesting or settlement of such awards reasonably be expected to result in a
violation of Section 409A of the Code. In addition, there is no agreement,
plan, arrangement or other

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

18

and its subsidiaries.

business);

provisions that prohibit the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any person
that controls, or is under common control with, the Company from competing in

applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
Laws, now or hereafter in effect, relating to creditors' rights generally and

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND ACQUISITION SUB

  

  

Except as disclosed in the separate disclosure letter which has been delivered
by Parent to the Company prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Parent
Disclosure Schedule"), Parent and Acquisition Sub hereby jointly and severally
represent and warrant to the Company as of the date hereof as follows:

  

  

Section 5.1 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. Parent is a public
limited company duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of
England and Wales. Acquisition Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing, under the laws of the State of Delaware. Each
of Parent and Acquisition Sub has the requisite corporate power and authority
and all necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except
where the failure to have such power, authority and governmental approvals
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub is duly qualified or licensed as a
foreign corporation to do business, and, in the case of Acquisition Sub only,
is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the
properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failures to be so
qualified or licensed or to be in good standing would not have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 5.2 Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, and Other Organizational
Documents. Parent has made available to the Company true, correct and complete
copies of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws (or equivalent
organizational or governing documents), and other organizational or governing
documents, agreements or arrangements, each as amended to date, of each of
Parent and Acquisition Sub (collectively, "Parent Organizational Documents").
The Parent Organizational Documents are in full force and effect. None of
Parent, Acquisition Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent, any of the other
parties thereto are in violation of any provision of the Parent Organizational
Documents, as applicable, except as would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 5.3 Authority Relative to Agreement. Each of Parent and Acquisition
Sub has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and the other agreements referred to in this Agreement to which
Parent and Acquisition Sub is or will be a party, to perform its obligations
hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and
Acquisition Sub and the consummation by Parent and Acquisition Sub of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, have been duly and
validly authorized by all necessary corporate action of Parent and Acquisition
Sub, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Acquisition
Sub are necessary to authorize the execution of this Agreement or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger (other
than, with respect to the Merger, the filing of the Certificate of Merger with
the Secretary of State). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by Parent and Acquisition Sub and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by the Company, this Agreement constitutes a legal,
valid and binding obligation of Parent and Acquisition Sub, enforceable

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

29  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

against Parent and Acquisition Sub in accordance with its terms (except as
such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditor's rights, and to general
equitable principles).

Acquisition Sub, the consummation by Parent or Acquisition Sub of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, or

Agreement will (i) conflict with, violate or breach any provision of the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent organizational or
governing documents) of (x) Parent or (y) Acquisition Sub, (ii) assuming the
consents, approvals and authorizations specified in Section 5.4(b) have been
received and the waiting periods referred to therein have expired, and any
condition precedent to such consent, approval, authorization, or waiver has
been satisfied, conflict with or violate any Law, judgment, writ or injunction
or any Governmental Authority applicable to Parent or Acquisition Sub or by
which any property or asset of Parent or Acquisition Sub is bound or affected
or (iii) result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event which
with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or give to
others any right of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of,
or result in the creation of a Lien on any property or asset of Parent or
Acquisition Sub pursuant to, any Contract to which Parent or Acquisition Sub
is a party or by which Parent or Acquisition Sub or any property or asset of
Parent or Acquisition Sub is bound, other than, in the case of clauses (ii)
and (iii), for any such violations, breaches, defaults, rights, terminations,
amendments, accelerations, or cancellations which would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware pursuant to the

Proxy Statement. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of
any comments from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) or any request from the
SEC (or the staff of the SEC) for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement, and shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between
the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC (or the
staff of the SEC), on the other hand with respect to this Agreement. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC)
with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Proxy Statement shall comply as to
form in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

  

  

(b) Mailing of Proxy Statement; Amendments. The Company shall cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the holders of Company Common Stock as of the record
date established for the Stockholders' Meeting as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date on which the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) confirms
that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement. If at any time prior
to the Effective Time any event or circumstance relating to the Company or
Parent or any of the Company's or Parent's subsidiaries, or their respective
officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent,
respectively, which, pursuant to the Exchange Act, should be set forth in an
amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, such party shall promptly
inform the others. Except for annual, quarterly and current reports filed or
furnished with the SEC under the Exchange Act, which may be incorporated by
reference therein, no filing of, or amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement relating to the Merger will be made by the Company without providing
Parent the opportunity to review and comment thereon. Each of Parent,
Acquisition Sub and the Company agree to correct any information provided by
it for use in the Proxy Statement which shall have become false or misleading.

  

  

(c) Cooperation. Parent shall furnish to the Company all information
concerning Parent and Acquisition Sub required by the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy
Statement and shall otherwise assist and cooperate with the Company in the
preparation of the Proxy Statement and the resolution of comments from the SEC
(or the staff of the SEC). Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or
any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC
(or the staff of the SEC) with respect thereto, the Company shall provide
Parent a

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document or
response to the extent related to this Agreement.

  

  

Section 6.3 Stockholders' Meeting. The Company shall, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the date on which the SEC (or the staff of
the SEC) confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement, take
all action necessary in accordance with applicable Law, the rules of The
NASDAQ Global Select Market and the Restated Certificate of Incorporation and
the Bylaws of the Company to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the "Stockholders' Meeting") for the purpose of
obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval. Subject to the ability of the
board of directors of the Company to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in
accordance with Section 6.6(c), the board of directors of the Company shall
make the Company Recommendation with respect to the adoption of this Agreement
and the approval of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger, and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Parent
shall vote (or cause to be voted) all shares of Company Common Stock
beneficially owned by Parent or Acquisition Sub in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement the approval of the Merger and the approval of the
Recapitalization at the Stockholders' Meeting. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company, after consultation with
Parent, may adjourn or postpone the Stockholders' Meeting (i) as necessary to
ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is
provided to the Company's stockholders within a reasonable amount of time in
advance of the Stockholders' Meeting, (ii) if as of the time for which the
Stockholders' Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct
business at the Stockholders' Meeting, (iii) if required by applicable Law or
(iv) if in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of the Company
(after consultation with legal counsel), an adjournment or postponement of the
Stockholders' Meeting would be consistent with the fiduciary duties of the
members of the board of directors of the Company under applicable Law. Subject
to the provisions of this Agreement, the Company will use reasonable best
efforts to solicit from holders of Company Common Stock proxies in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and to take all other action
necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of holders of Company
Common stock required by the rules of the NASDAQ Global Select Market or
applicable Laws to obtain such approvals.

  

  

Section 6.4 Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings.

  

  

(a) Subject to Section 6.6, the parties hereto will use their respective
reasonable best efforts to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated hereby and to cause the conditions to the Merger set forth in
Article VII to be satisfied, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary
actions or nonactions, consents and approvals from Governmental Authorities or
other persons necessary in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and the
making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with
Governmental Authorities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as
may be necessary to obtain an approval from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Authority or other persons necessary in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, (ii) the defending of any lawsuits or other
legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions, including
the Merger, performed or consummated by such party in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or temporary
restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Authority vacated
or reversed, and (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and any other transactions to
be performed or consummated by such party in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and to carry out fully the purposes of this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take
(and to cause their affiliates to take) promptly any and all steps reasonably
necessary to obtain all consents under any Antitrust Laws that may be required
by any foreign or U.S. federal, state or local Governmental Authority, in each
case with competent jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties to close the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, as promptly
as practicable; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement, including
this Section 6.4(b), shall be construed to obligate Parent, Acquisition Sub,
or any of their affiliates to commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold
separate orders, trust, or otherwise, the sale, license, or other disposition
of any or their respective assets or businesses, even if such a step would
avoid the entry of, or would effect the dissolution of or vacate or lift, any
Order, that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially
delaying the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall give (or shall cause its respective
subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and Parent shall use, and
cause each of its affiliates to use, its reasonable best efforts, and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent in its
efforts, to obtain any third party consents not covered by paragraphs (a) and
(b) above that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger.
Each of the parties hereto will furnish to the other such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection
with the preparation of any required governmental filings or submissions and
will cooperate in responding to any inquiry from a Governmental Authority,
including immediately informing the other party of such inquiry, consulting in
advance before making any presentations or submissions to a Governmental
Authority, and supplying each other with copies of all material
correspondence, filings or communications between either party and any
Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, obtaining any third party consents pursuant to this Section 6.4(c)
shall not be considered a condition to the obligations of the Parent and
Acquisition Sub to consummate the Merger.

  

  

(d) Following the Effective Time, each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the
Company agrees to cooperate fully with the other parties to this Agreement and
the Patent Purchaser, to execute such further instruments, documents and
agreements, and to give such further written assurances, as may be reasonably
requested by any other party to this Agreement or the Patent Purchaser, to
evidence and better reflect the Patent Sale Transaction and to carry into
effect the intents and purposes of this Agreement and the Patent Sale
Agreement.

  

  

Section 6.5 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time or the earlier termination date
of this Agreement, if any, pursuant to Section 8.1, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and contracts, the Company will provide to Parent and its
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the
Company's and its subsidiaries' properties, books, Contracts and records and
other information as Parent may reasonably request regarding the business,
assets, liabilities, properties, employees and other aspects of the Company
and its subsidiaries, but only to the extent that such access does not
unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the Company and its
subsidiaries or could otherwise result in significant interference with the
discharge by employees of the Company or its subsidiaries of their material
duties; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to provide
access to any information or documents which would, in the reasonable judgment
of the Company, (i) breach any agreement with any Third Party, (ii) constitute
a waiver of the attorney-client or other privilege held by the Company, or
(iii) otherwise violate any applicable Laws, including data privacy laws.

  

  

(b) The parties shall comply with, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to comply with, all of their respective obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.

  

  

Section 6.6 Non-Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals.

  

  

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.6, the Company agrees that
neither it nor any of its subsidiaries shall, and the Company and its
subsidiaries shall not authorize any of their respective Representatives to,
from the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if
any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, directly
or indirectly, (x) solicit, initiate, seek, knowingly encourage or knowingly
facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) any inquiry,
discussion, offer or request that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected
to lead to, a Competing Proposal, (y) engage in, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations with (other than to state they
are not permitted to engage discussions), or furnish any non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries to, or afford
access to the books or records of the Company or its subsidiaries to, any
Third Party that, to the knowledge of the Company, is seeking to make, or has
made, a Competing Proposal, or (z) approve, endorse, recommend or enter into
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive agreement (other
than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) with respect to any Competing
Proposal (an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement").

  

  

(b) At any time after the date hereof and prior to obtaining the Requisite
Stockholder Approval, the Company or its board of directors, directly or
indirectly through its Representatives, may (i) furnish nonpublic information
to any Third Party making an unsolicited, written Competing Proposal
(provided, however, that prior to so furnishing such information, the Company
receives from the Third Party an executed Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement), and (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with such Third
Party with respect to the Competing Proposal if: (x) such Third Party has
submitted an unsolicited, written Competing Proposal which the board of
directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial and legal advisors, constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to
lead to, a Superior Proposal, and (y) the board of directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with legal counsel, that failure
to take such action would likely be inconsistent with

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, (a)
such Competing Proposal did not result from a breach of this Section 6.6, and
(b) the Company gives Parent the notice required by Section 6.6(e). Prior to
taking any of the actions referred to in this Section 6.6(b), and in
accordance with Section 6.6(e) below, the Company shall notify Parent and
Acquisition Sub orally and in writing that it proposes to furnish non-public
information and/or enter into discussions or negotiations as provided in this
Section 6.6(b).

  

  

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.6(c), neither the board of
directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, change,
qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withdraw, change, qualify or modify,
in a manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub, the Company Recommendation;
(ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or
recommend, any Competing Proposal or Alternative Acquisition Agreement made or
received after the date hereof (any of the actions described in clauses (i)
and (ii) of this Section 6.6(c), an "Adverse Recommendation Change"); or (iii)
cause or permit the Company to enter into any Alternative Acquisition
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval,
the board of directors of the Company shall be permitted (x) to terminate this
Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal, subject to compliance with Section 6.6(d) and Section 8.3, if the
board of directors of the Company (A) has received a Competing Proposal that,
in the good faith determination of the board of directors of the Company,
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal,
after having complied with, and giving effect to all of the adjustments which
may be offered by Parent and Acquisition Sub pursuant to, Section 6.6(d), and
(B) determines in good faith, after consultation with its legal advisors, that
failure to take such action may be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, or (y) to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change
described in clause (i) of such definition, if the board of directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its legal advisors,
that failure to take such action may be inconsistent with the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

  

  

(d) The Company shall not be entitled to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change or to terminate this Agreement as permitted under Section 6.6(c) with
respect to a Superior Proposal unless (i) the Company has provided a written
notice (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") to Parent and Acquisition Sub that
the Company intends to take such action and provides a copy of the Superior
Proposal and a copy of any transaction agreements, (ii) during the three (3)
Business Day period following Parent's and Acquisition Sub's receipt of the
Notice of Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, negotiate with Parent and Acquisition Sub in good faith
(to the extent Parent and Acquisition Sub desire to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal; and (iii)
following the end of the three (3) Business Day period, the board of directors
of the Company shall have determined in good faith, taking into account any
changes to this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent and Acquisition Sub in
response to the Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise, that the Superior
Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Superior Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal. Any material amendment to the financial terms
or any other material amendment of such Superior Proposal shall require a new
Notice of Superior Proposal and the Company shall be required to comply again
with the requirements of this Section 6.6(d); provided, however, that

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

references to the three (3) Business Day period above shall be deemed to be
references to a two (2) Business Day period; and provided, further that the
Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations under this
Section 6.6 and that any purported termination is in accordance with Section
8.1 and the Company pays Parent the applicable Termination Fee in accordance
with Section 8.3 prior to or concurrently with such termination.

  

  

(e) From and after the date hereof, the Company shall, as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and in any event within two (2) days), advise Parent
and Acquisition Sub of receipt by the Company of any Competing Proposal or any
request for non-public information in connection with any Competing Proposal,
the material terms and conditions of any such Competing Proposal or request,
including a copy of the Competing Proposal and any related draft agreements,
and shall as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within two
(2) days) advise Parent and Acquisition Sub of any material amendments to any
such Competing Proposal or request.

  

  

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its
board of directors, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, from
(i) taking and disclosing to the Company's stockholders a position with
respect to a tender or exchange offer by a Third Party pursuant to Rule 14d-9
or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication
to the Company's stockholders), or (ii) making any "stop, look and listen"
communication to the Company's stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the
Company's stockholders) if the board of directors of the Company has
determined in good faith, after consultation with legal counsel, that the
failure to do so may be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; provided, however, that any disclosures permitted under
this Section 6.6(f) shall not be a basis, in themselves, for Parent to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(i).

  

  

(g) For purposes of this Agreement:

  

  

(i) "Competing Proposal" shall mean, other than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Patent Sale Agreement, any bona fide proposal or
offer (other than a proposal or offer by Parent or any of its subsidiaries)
from a Third Party relating to (i) a merger, reorganization, sale of assets,
share exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
dissolution, liquidation, joint venture or similar transaction involving the
Company or any of its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute twenty percent (20%) or more of the consolidated assets
of the Company as determined on a book-value basis; (ii) the acquisition
(whether by merger, consolidation, equity investment, joint venture or
otherwise) by any person of twenty percent (20%) or more of the assets of the
Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole as determined on a book-value
basis; (iii) the acquisition in any manner, directly or indirectly, by any
person of twenty percent (20%) or more of the issued and outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock, (iv) any purchase, acquisition, tender offer or exchange
offer that, if consummated, would result in any person beneficially owning
twenty percent (20%) or more of the Company Common Stock or any class of
equity or voting securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries whose
assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute twenty percent (20%) or
more of the consolidated assets of the Company as determined on a book-value
basis. For the

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

avoidance of doubt, an Alternative Patent Sale Agreement shall not be deemed
to be a Competing Proposal.

  

  

(ii) "Superior Proposal" shall mean a Competing Proposal (with all percentages
in the definition of Competing Proposal increased to fifty percent (50%)) made
by a Third Party on terms that the board of directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's financial and
legal advisors, and considering such factors as the board of directors of the
Company considers to be appropriate (including the conditionality and the
timing and likelihood of consummation of such proposal), are more favorable to
the Company and its stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (after giving effect to all adjustments to the terms thereof which
may be offered by Parent in writing (including pursuant to Section 6.6(d)).

  

  

Section 6.7 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.

  

  

(a) Parent and Acquisition Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time
(including any matters arising in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), now existing in favor of the current or
former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or
its subsidiaries as provided in the Company's or each of the Company's
subsidiaries' respective articles or certificates of incorporation or bylaws
(or comparable organizational or governing documents) or in any agreement
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. For a
period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
fulfill and honor all obligations of the Company to the Indemnitees with
respect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any
time prior to the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by the Laws
of the State of Delaware and required by: (x) the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws (or equivalent organizational or governing documents)
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates as in effect on the
date of this Agreement and (y) the indemnification agreement(s) of the Company
or its subsidiaries or other applicable contract(s) as in effect on the date
of this Agreement, and (ii) not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such
provisions referenced in subsections (i)(x) and (y) above in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnitees, unless such
modification is required by the Laws of the State of Delaware.

  

  

(b) Without limiting the provisions of Section 6.7(a), during the period
commencing as of the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary
of the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will to the extent
permitted by the Laws of the State of Delaware: (i) indemnify and hold
harmless each Indemnitee against and from any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, inquiries, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to: (x) any action or
omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnitee's capacity as a
director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates; or (y) the

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

Recapitalization, the Merger, the Merger Agreement and any transactions
contemplated hereby or by the Patent Sale Agreement; and (ii) pay in advance
of the final disposition of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation the expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) of any
Indemnitee upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnitee
to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee
is not entitled to be indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Section 6.7(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation not to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation of a covered person for which
indemnification may be sought under this Section 6.7(b) unless such
settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional
release of such covered person from all liability arising out of such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and does not include an admission
of fault or wrongdoing by any Indemnitee or such Indemnitee otherwise consents
in writing to such settlement, compromise, consent or termination.

  

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain and fully pay the
premium for the non-cancellable extension of the directors' and officers'
liability coverage of the Company's existing directors' and officers'
insurance policies and the Company's existing fiduciary liability insurance
policies (collectively, the "DandO Insurance"), in each case for a claims
reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period or time at or
prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with respect to DandO
Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are
no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Company's existing
policies; provided that such DandO Insurance must have the limits set forth on
Section 6.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

(d) The Indemnitees to whom this Section 6.7 applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 6.7. The provisions of this Section 6.7 are
intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and his or her successors,
heirs or representatives.

  

  

(e) The rights of each Indemnitee under this Section 6.7 shall be in addition
to any rights such person may have under the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries,
or under any applicable Law or under any agreement of any Indemnitee with the
Company or any of its subsidiaries.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 9.1 or Section 9.7 to the
contrary, this Section 6.7 shall survive the consummation of the Merger
indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors
and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries, and
shall be enforceable by the Indemnitees and their successors, heirs or
representatives. In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any
of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall succeed to the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.7.

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

Section 6.8 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the this Agreement, the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby, or from any person alleging that the consent
of such person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such communication
or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be material to the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (b) any actions, suits, written
claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such party's knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party
or any of its subsidiaries which relate to this Agreement, the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby and (c) or the discovery by a party to this
Agreement of any fact, circumstance or event, the occurrence or non-occurrence
of which, would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions of the
obligations of such party to consummate the Merger as set forth in Article VII
not to be satisfied or the satisfaction of which to be materially delayed in
violation of this Agreement. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to
reasonably participate in the defense and settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated herein, and no such settlement shall be
agreed upon without Parent's prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  

  

Section 6.9 Public Announcements. The Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub
shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise
making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and none of the parties shall issue any such
press release or make any public statement prior to obtaining the other
parties' written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), except that no such consent shall be necessary to the extent
disclosure may be required by Law, Order or applicable stock exchange rule or
any listing agreement of any party hereto.

  

  

Section 6.10 Employee Matters.

  

  

(a) Parent shall provide or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide
to employees of the Company and any of its subsidiaries (the "Company
Employees") compensation and benefits that are, in the aggregate, no less
favorable than the compensation and benefits provided by Parent to its
similarly situated employees.

  

  

(b) For purposes of eligibility, vesting, benefit accrual and determination of
level of benefits under the compensation and benefit plans, programs,
agreements and arrangements of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
or any respective subsidiary and affiliate thereof providing benefits to any
Company Employees after the Closing (the "New Plans"), including for purposes
of accrual of vacation and other paid time off and severance benefits under
New Plans, each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with the Company, the Company subsidiaries and their respective
affiliates (and any additional service with any predecessor employer) before
the Closing, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before
the Closing, to credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit
Plan. Parent shall continue to maintain Company Benefit Plans providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits until the end of the
applicable plan year in which the Closing occurs.

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

Section 6.11 Acquisition Sub. Parent will take all actions necessary to (a)
cause Acquisition Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
(b) cause the Surviving Corporation to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and (c) ensure that, prior to the Effective Time, Acquisition Sub
shall not conduct any business or make any investments other than as
specifically contemplated by this Agreement, or incur or guarantee any
indebtedness.

  

  

Section 6.12 No Control of the Company's Business. Nothing contained in this
Agreement is intended to give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the Company's or its subsidiaries' operations prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its subsidiaries' operations.

  

  

Section 6.13 Rule 16b-3 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may
take such further actions, if any, as may be necessary or appropriate to
ensure that the dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including
derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by any officer or director of the Company who is subject to Section
16 of the Exchange Act are exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

  

  

Section 6.14 Recapitalization and Holdback; Tax Characterization. Following
the closing of the Patent Sale Transaction but prior to the Closing, the
Company shall, subject to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, effect
the Recapitalization by filing a certificate of amendment to the Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Recapitalization Certificate"); provided
however, that the Company shall take all actions necessary or appropriate such
that the aggregate Recapitalization amount shall be reduced to the extent
necessary to cause the Company to have available cash, following the
Recapitalization, in an amount equal to at least Ninety-Nine Million Seven
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($99,700,000), as may be adjusted in the event of an
Alternative Patent Sale Agreement (the "Holdback Amount"). Parent, Acquisition
Sub and the Company acknowledge and agree that (x) each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Recapitalization
shall, as a result of the Recapitalization, be converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to (i) (a) the amount of cash held by the
Company following the closing of the Patent Sale Transaction less (b) the
Holdback Amount, less (c) the Total Option Cash Payments divided by (ii) (a)
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock plus (b) the outstanding
Company Restricted Stock Units, to be calculated one Business Day prior to the
Recapitalization in accordance with Schedule 6.14 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (the "Recapitalization Cash Portion", and the sum of all such
payments, the "Total Recapitalization Cash Portion") and 0.1479 shares of
Company Common Stock, and (y) the Recapitalization of Company Common Stock is
both a condition to, and part of a plan that includes, the consummation of the

ARTICLE VIII

  

  

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

  

  

Section 8.1 Termination. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement
to the contrary, this Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after the Requisite Stockholder Approval is
obtained (except as otherwise expressly noted), as follows:

  

  

(a) by mutual written consent of each of Parent and the Company duly
authorized by each of their respective boards of directors; or

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if:

  

  

(i) the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before April 5, 2013 (the
"Termination Date"); provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(i) shall not be available to any
party if the failure of such party (including, in the case of Parent, the
failure of Acquisition Sub) to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement, the failure to act in good faith or the failure to use its
reasonable best efforts to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement has been a principal cause of or resulted in
the failure of the Merger to be consummated on or before such date; or

  

  

(ii) (A) a Law shall have been enacted, entered or promulgated prohibiting the
consummation of the Merger on the terms contemplated hereby or (B) any
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an Order or
taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such Order or
other action shall have become final and non-appealable; provided, however,
that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(b)(ii)(B) shall have used its reasonable best efforts to remove such Order
or other action; and provided, further, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 8.1(b)(ii)(B) shall not be available to a party
if the issuance of such final, non-appealable Order was primarily due to the
failure of such party, and in the case of Parent, including the failure of
Acquisition Sub, to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement;

  

  

(iii) if the Requisite Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained by
the Company at the Stockholders' Meeting duly convened therefor or at any
adjournment or postponement thereof; provided, however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b)(iii) shall not be available
to the Company if the failure by the Company to perform any of its obligations
under this Agreement has been the principal reason or resulted in the failure
to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval; or

  

  

(c) by the Company if:

  

  

(i) Parent or Acquisition Sub shall have breached or failed to perform in any
material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (x)
would result in a failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.3(a) or
Section 7.3(b) and (y) cannot be cured on or before the Termination Date or,
if curable, is not cured by Parent within thirty (30) days of receipt by
Parent of written notice of such breach or failure; provided, however, that
the Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 8.1(c)(i) if: the Company is then in material breach of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach would result in a failure of a condition set forth in
Section 7.2(a), Section 7.2(b), or Section 7.2(c); or

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) Prior to receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval (x) the board of
directors of the Company has determined to enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to a Superior Proposal to the extent permitted by, and subject to
the terms and conditions of, Section 6.6(c) and Section 6.6(d), and (y)
concurrently with such termination, the Company pays to Parent the fee
specified in Section 8.3(a)(ii)); or

  

  

(iii) all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been
satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied by actions taken at the Closing), and Parent and Acquisition Sub
fail to consummate the Merger within three (3) Business Days following the
date the Closing should have occurred; or

  

  

(d) by Parent if:

  

  

(i) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform in any material
respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (x) would
result in a failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.2(a), Section
7.2(b) or Section 7.2(c), and (y) cannot be cured on or before the Termination
Date (giving effect to the possible extension thereof pursuant to Section
8.1(b)(i)) or, if curable, is not cured by the Company within thirty (30) days
of receipt by the Company of written notice of such breach or failure;
provided, however, that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d)(i) if: Parent or Acquisition Sub is
then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach would result in a
failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b); or

  

  

(ii) (x) the board of directors of the Company shall have made an Adverse
Recommendation Change; (y) the board of directors of the Company approves or
recommends a Competing Proposal or the Company enters into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement; or (z) the board of directors of the Company fails to

(iii) any material amendment, change, modification or waiver to the terms,
conditions and obligations of (a) the Patent Sale Agreement, (b) the Assigned
Patent License Agreement, or (c) the Retained Patent License Agreement, that
would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
Surviving Corporation, is made without the express prior written consent of
Parent; or

  

  

(iv) any effect, change, event or occurrence has had or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

  

  

Section 8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated and the Merger abandoned pursuant to Section 8.1, written notice
thereof shall be given to the other party or parties, specifying the
provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is made and the basis
therefor described in reasonable detail, and this Agreement shall forthwith
become null

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

and void and of no effect without liability on the part of any party hereto
(or any of its Representatives), and all rights and obligations of any party
hereto shall cease; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in
Section 8.3 or in any other provision of this Agreement, no such termination
shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages (which the parties
acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of Expenses or
out-of-pocket costs) resulting from any breach of this Agreement prior to such
termination, in which case the aggrieved party shall be entitled to all
remedies available at law or in equity; and provided further, that the
Confidentiality Agreement, and the provisions of Section 6.5(b), Section 6.9,
this Section 8.2, Section 8.3, Section 8.6, Article IX and Appendix A shall
survive any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1.

  

  

Section 8.3 Termination Fees.

  

  

(a) If, but only if, the Agreement is terminated by:

  

  

(i) (x) either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) or Section
8.1(b)(iii), or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(i), Section
8.1(d)(ii)(x), Section 8.1(d)(ii)(z), Section 8.1(d)(iii) and (y) the Company
(A) receives or has received a Competing Proposal from a Third Party after the
date hereof, which Competing Proposal becomes publicly known, and (B) within
twelve (12) months of the termination of this Agreement, enters into, agrees
to or consummates a transaction regarding such Competing Proposal or any
Competing Proposal, then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent
an amount equal to Two Million Seven Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars
($2,750,000) (the "Termination Fee") and the Parent's reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, such fees and expenses to
not exceed Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000), not later than the third (3rd)
Business Day following the execution of the agreement relating to such
transaction arising from such Competing Proposal (provided, however, that for
purposes of this Section 8.3(a)(i), the references to "twenty percent (20%)"
in the definition of Competing Proposal shall be deemed to be references to
"fifty percent (50%)"); or

  

  

(ii) the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii) or Parent pursuant to Section
8.1(d)(ii)(y), then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the
Termination Fee and the Parent's reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, such fees and expenses to not exceed Two Million Dollars
($2,000,000) concurrently with such termination;

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement:

  

  

(i) the parties agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay
the Termination Fee on more than one occasion; and

  

  

(ii) the parties agree that the Termination Fee shall be reduced by any
amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under
applicable Tax Law.

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but
subject to Section 9.9, Parent's right to receive payment from the Company of
the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(a) shall constitute the sole and
exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and its
subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future general or
limited partners, stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers,
employees, agents, affiliates or assignees (collectively, the "Company Related
Parties") for all losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a
breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such
amount, none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability
or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated thereby (except that the Company shall also be obligated with
respect to Section 8.3(d)).

  

  

(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated
damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the
circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision, and (iii) without these agreements, the parties
would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to
timely pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.3 and, in order to obtain
such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the
other party for the payment of any amount set forth in this Section 8.3, such
paying party shall pay the other party its costs and Expenses in connection
with such suit, together with interest on such amount at the annual rate of
five percent (5%) plus the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal
in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date
such payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum
permitted by applicable Law.

  

  

Section 8.4 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of
the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards
of directors at any time whether before or after receipt of the Requisite
Stockholder Approval; provided, however, that after the Requisite Stockholder
Approval has been obtained, there shall not be any amendment that by Law or in
accordance with the rules of any stock exchange requires further approval by
the stockholders of the Company without such further approval of such
stockholders nor any amendment or change not permitted under applicable Law.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by
each of the parties hereto.

  

  

Section 8.5 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, subject to
applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance
of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) subject to the
proviso of Section 8.4, waive compliance with any agreement or condition
contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall only be valid if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound
thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company,
Parent or Acquisition Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

  

  

Section 8.6 Expenses; Transfer Taxes. Except as provided in Section 6.14, all
Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such
expenses.

parties which by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time

6.7 and Section 6.10.

sufficient if in writing and sent by facsimile transmission (providing

Section 9.3 Interpretation; Certain Definitions. The parties have participated
jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. Consequently, in
the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto, and
no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any
party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. When a
reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section, Appendix, Annex or
Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or an Appendix,
Annex or Exhibit to, this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of
contents and headings for this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar
import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. All terms defined in
this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or
other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined
therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the
singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as
well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any Law defined or
referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to
herein means such Law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
including (in the case of

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

statutes) by succession of comparable successor Laws. References to a person
are also to its successors and permitted assigns. All references to "dollars"
or "$" refer to currency of the United States of America. References to
"wholly owned subsidiaries" of the Company shall include any subsidiary of
which the Company owns, directly or indirectly, 100% of the equity interests.

  

  

Section 9.4 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or future
Law, or public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully
separable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof,
(c) all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable term or other provision or by its severance herefrom so long as
the economic or legal substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
