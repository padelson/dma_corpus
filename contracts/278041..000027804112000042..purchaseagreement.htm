Purchase Price, after giving effect to the adjustment to the Base Purchase
Price referred to herein that is effected on the Closing Date is referred to
herein as the "Closing Consideration"). In addition, at the Closing and in
accordance with the Signing Date Escrow Agreement, the parties shall cause the
entire Signing Date Escrow Amount to be paid to Seller in accordance with the
terms of the Signing Date Escrow Agreement. The payment of the Closing
Consideration and the deposit of the Closing Escrow Amount into the Closing
Escrow Account by Purchaser as provided in Section 2.4 shall, subject to
adjustment as provided in Section 2.3 below, constitute full and final payment
of the consideration to Seller for the Interests.

(c) Within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare
and deliver to Seller the following (collectively, the "Preliminary
Statement"):

  

  

(i) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the close of
business on the Closing Date (the "Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet"),
prepared by Purchaser in good faith in accordance with the terms set forth in
Section 2.5;

  

  

(ii) a calculation by Purchaser of the Net Working Capital based on the
Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and determined in good faith in accordance
with the terms set forth in Section 2.5 (the "Preliminary Net Working
Capital"); and

  

  

(iii) a calculation by Purchaser of the Covered Expenditures determined in
good faith in accordance with the terms set forth in Section 2.5 (the
"Preliminary Covered Capital Expenditure Amount").

  

  

(d) Seller shall have thirty (30) days following receipt of the Preliminary
Statement to review the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and the calculations
of the Preliminary Net Working Capital and the Preliminary Covered Capital
Expenditure Amount, and to notify Purchaser in writing if it disputes any
aspect of the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet, the Preliminary Net Working
Capital or the Preliminary Covered Capital Expenditure Amount set forth in the
Preliminary Statement (the "Dispute Notice"), specifying the reasons therefor
in reasonable detail, including without limitation the dollar amount of each
disagreement and supporting documentation for each disagreement. In connection
with Seller's review of the Preliminary Statement, Purchaser shall permit, and
shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives to permit, Seller and its
Representatives to have reasonable access, during normal business hours and
upon reasonable notice, to all relevant work papers, schedules, memoranda and
other documents prepared by Purchaser or its Representatives in connection
with its preparation of the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and/or its
calculation of the Preliminary Net Working Capital and the Preliminary Covered
Capital Expenditure Amount, and to finance personnel of Purchaser and its
Affiliates and any other information which Seller or any Representative
thereof reasonably requests, and Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates and Representatives to, otherwise cooperate with Seller and its
Representatives in connection therewith; provided, however, that Purchaser
shall not be required to provide, or cause to be provided, any relevant work
papers, schedules, memoranda or other documents if outside legal counsel to
Purchaser shall have advised Purchaser that the provision thereof would be
reasonably likely to jeopardize the attorney-client privilege.

  

  

(e) In the event that Seller shall deliver a Dispute Notice to Purchaser,
Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate in good faith to resolve such dispute as
promptly as practicable and, upon such resolution, if any adjustments to the
Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet, the Preliminary Net Working Capital and/or
the Preliminary Covered Capital Expenditure Amount] shall be made in
accordance with the agreement of Purchaser and Seller, then Purchaser and
Seller shall set forth any such agreement in writing. In connection with
Purchaser's review of the Dispute Notice, Purchaser and its Representatives
shall have reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable
notice, to all relevant work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents
prepared by Seller or its Representatives in connection with Seller's
preparation of the Dispute Notice and to finance personnel of Seller and any
other information which Purchaser or any of its Representatives reasonably
requests, and Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives
to, otherwise cooperate with Purchaser and its Representatives in connection
therewith; provided, however, that Seller shall not be required to provide, or
cause to be provided, any relevant work papers, schedules, memoranda or other
documents if outside legal counsel to Seller shall have advised Seller that
the provision thereof would be reasonably likely to jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege. If Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve any such
dispute within twenty (20) Business Days (or such longer period as Purchaser
and Seller shall mutually agree in writing) of Seller's delivery of such
Dispute Notice, Purchaser and Seller shall promptly submit to the Independent
Accounting Firm for resolution any items remaining in dispute, and any
determination of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on
the parties. Purchaser and Seller agree to enter into a customary engagement
letter with the Independent Accounting Firm (and shall provide customary
indemnification thereto, if so requested by the Independent Accounting Firm),
and any fees, costs or expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm (and the
American Arbitration Association if engaged pursuant to the definition of
Independent Accounting Firm) in respect of its services as contemplated by
this Section 2.3 shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Seller and fifty
percent (50%) by Purchaser. The Independent Accounting Firm shall be
instructed to use commercially reasonable efforts to perform its services and
reach a final determination with respect to the matters submitted to it for
resolution within thirty (30) days of submission of the Preliminary Closing
Balance Sheet, the Preliminary Statement and the Dispute Notice and, in any
case, as promptly as practicable after such submission. In resolving any
disputed item, the Independent Accounting Firm (i) shall be bound by the
provisions of this Section 2.3 and any other relevant provisions of this
Agreement and (ii) may not assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by either Purchaser or Seller or less
than the smallest value for such item claimed by either Purchaser or Seller.
The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm
shall be limited to whether the calculation of the Preliminary Closing Balance
Sheet and the Preliminary Net Working Capital was done in accordance with this
Section 2.3, and whether there were mathematical errors in such calculation,
and the Independent Accounting Firm is not to make any other determination.
The Independent Accounting Firm shall make its determination based solely on
presentations and supporting material provided by the parties and not pursuant
to any independent review. In connection with the Independent Accounting
Firm's consideration of the dispute submitted to it, each party hereto shall
permit, and cause its Affiliates and Representatives to permit, the
Independent Accounting Firm and its Representatives to have reasonable access,
during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to all relevant work
papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents prepared by such party or its
Representatives in connection with its preparation of the Preliminary Closing
Balance Sheet, the Preliminary Statement and/or the Dispute Notice, as the
case may be, and to finance personnel of such party and its Affiliates and any
other information which the Independent Accounting Firm or any Representative
thereof reasonably requests, and the parties hereto shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates and Representatives to, otherwise cooperate with
the Independent Accounting Firm and its Representatives in connection
therewith; provided, however, that neither Seller nor Purchaser shall be
required to provide, or cause to be provided, any relevant work papers,
schedules, memoranda or other documents if outside legal counsel to Seller or
Purchaser, as applicable, shall have advised Seller or Purchaser, as
applicable, that the provision thereof would be reasonably likely to
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege. The Preliminary Closing Balance
Sheet, the Preliminary Net Working Capital and the Preliminary Covered Capital
Expenditure Amount, (i) if no Dispute Notice has been timely delivered by
Seller, as originally submitted and calculated by Purchaser, or (ii) if a
Dispute Notice has been timely delivered by Seller, as adjusted pursuant to
the resolution of such dispute in accordance with this Section 2.3 (whether by
mutual written agreement of Purchaser and Seller, or by the determination of
the Independent Accounting Firm), is referred to herein, respectively, as the
"Final Closing Balance Sheet," the "Final Net Working Capital" and the "Final
Covered Capital Expenditure Amount."

  

  

(f) The Closing Consideration shall be adjusted as follows (and the aggregate
amount of the net increase or decrease, as the case may be, to the Closing
Consideration effected pursuant to the immediately following clauses (i) and
(ii) is referred to as the "Final Closing Adjustment"):

  

  

(i) (A) if the Final Net Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Net Working
Capital, increased by the amount of such excess, or (B) if the Estimated Net
Working Capital exceeds the Final Net Working Capital, decreased by the amount
of such excess; and

  

  

(ii) (A) if the Final Covered Capital Expenditure Amount exceeds the Estimated
Covered Capital Expenditure Amount, increased by the amount of such excess, or
(B) if the Estimated Covered Capital Expenditure Amount exceeds the Final
Covered Capital Expenditure Amount, decreased by the amount of such excess.

  

  

(g) After the determination of the Final Closing Adjustment pursuant to this
Section 2.3:

  

  

(i) if the Closing Consideration shall be increased, then Purchaser shall
promptly (but in no event more than five (5) Business Days after the
determination of the Final Closing Adjustment) pay to Seller the amount of the
Final Closing Adjustment by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Seller; and

  

  

(ii) if the Closing Consideration shall be decreased, then Purchaser and
Seller shall promptly (but in no event more than five (5) Business Days after
the determination of the Final Closing Adjustment) deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing it to pay to Purchaser from the
Closing Escrow Account and pursuant to the Closing Escrow Agreement an amount
equal to the amount of the decrease to the Closing Consideration as a result
of the Final Closing Adjustment, it being understood and agreed that payment
from the Closing Escrow Account shall be the sole and exclusive source of
recovery for Purchaser in the event that the Final Closing Adjustment results
in amounts being owed to Purchaser pursuant to the terms hereof; provided,
however, that solely with respect to the portion (if any) of the Final Closing
Adjustment attributable solely to Eligible Direct Claims, Purchaser shall have
the right, in lieu of (and not in addition to) receiving such payment from the
Closing Escrow Account, to receive payment in respect thereof directly from
Seller in an amount not to exceed the Eligible Direct Claims Amount (it being
understood that any amounts payable to Purchaser pursuant to this Section
2.3(g)(ii) that are in excess of the Eligible Direct Claims Amount or that do
not relate to an Eligible Direct Claim shall be paid to Purchaser solely out
of the Closing Escrow Account in accordance with the terms set forth herein
and in the Closing Escrow Agreement and Seller shall have no direct liability
with respect thereto).

  

  

(h) The parties acknowledge that the payments contemplated by this Section 2.3
are intended by the parties to be treated as part of the Closing Consideration
and the parties will treat any such payment as an adjustment to the Closing
Consideration for Tax and financial reporting purposes. Purchaser and Seller
agree not to take any position, including, without limitation, for federal,
state, foreign or local Tax purposes, that is inconsistent with the intent
expressed in this Section 2.3(h).

  

  

Section 2.4. Escrow Deposits.

  

  

(a) Concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Purchaser
shall deposit an amount equal to $5,550,000 (such amount, the "Signing Date
Escrow Amount") in immediately available funds into an escrow account (the
"Signing Date Escrow Account") to be established and maintained by JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. (the "Escrow Agent"), pursuant to an escrow agreement,
substantially in the form of Exhibit E attached hereto (the "Signing Date
Escrow Agreement"). In addition, in the event that prior to the close of
business on October 31, 2012, (i) the Closing shall not have occurred, and
(ii) this Agreement shall not have been validly terminated in accordance with
Section 7.1 (but in all cases subject to Section 2.2 above), Purchaser shall
deposit, prior to the close of business on the subsequent Business Day
thereafter, an additional $5,550,000 in immediately available funds into the
Signing Date Escrow Account (which, for purposes of this Agreement, shall be
deemed to increase the "Signing Date Escrow Amount", on a dollar-for-dollar
basis, as if such additional amount was deposited into the Signing Date Escrow
Account concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement). The
Signing Date Escrow Amount shall be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the
terms of the Signing Date Escrow Agreement and shall be released to (i) Seller
upon the earlier to occur of (A) the Closing, and (B) the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(f)(i) or Section 7.1(f)(iii) hereof, or (ii)
if not so released to Seller, shall be released to Purchaser upon the
termination of this Agreement (other than pursuant to Section 7.1(f)(i) or
Section 7.1(f)(iii) hereof), in all cases in accordance with the terms set
forth herein and therein.

  

  

(b) Concurrent with the Closing, Purchaser shall deposit an amount equal to
six percent (6%) of the Base Purchase Price (after giving effect to any
adjustment being made thereto on the Closing Date pursuant to Section 2.3(b))
(such amount, the "Closing Escrow Amount") in immediately available funds into
an escrow account (the "Closing Escrow Account") to be established and
maintained by the Escrow Agent pursuant to an escrow agreement, substantially
in the form of Exhibit F attached hereto, with such changes as may be required
by the Escrow Agent (the "Closing Escrow Agreement"), to be entered into on
the Closing Date by Purchaser, Seller and the Escrow Agent. The Closing Escrow
Amount shall be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the Closing
Escrow Agreement. Except as otherwise specified herein (including with respect
to Eligible Direct Claims), the Closing Escrow Amount shall serve as security
for, and as the sole source of payment of, the amounts (if any) payable to the
Purchaser Indemnitees or Purchaser pursuant to Article VIII and/or Section
2.3(g)(ii), as applicable.

  

  

Section 2.5. Accounting Principles.

  

  

(a) The Seller Certificate and the Preliminary Statement (and all estimates
and calculations of Net Working Capital and Covered Expenditures) shall be
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied using the same accounting
methodologies, principles and procedures used in, and on a basis consistent
with, those applied by Seller in preparing the Financial Statements of the
Company as of and for the period ended August 31, 2012 (including calculating
reserves in accordance with the same methodology used to calculate such
reserves in preparation of such Financial Statements), except that the Seller
Certificate and the Preliminary Statement (and all estimates and calculations
of Net Working Capital and Covered Expenditures) shall (i) not include any
purchase accounting or other adjustment arising out of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents, (ii) not be impacted by any action of Purchaser or its Affiliates
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries) after Closing and (iii) include,
in the case of Net Working Capital, only those items included in the
definitions of Current Assets and Current Liabilities. The computation of Net
Working Capital prepared for the purpose of establishing the Reference Net
Working Capital is attached to Section 2.5 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.
In addition, the parties acknowledge that (A) certain current liabilities of
the Company and its Subsidiaries have historically been incurred and, in some
instances, paid by Seller on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (B)
any such current liabilities that were outstanding as of the date hereof have
been accrued as current liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
reflected on Section 2.5 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, and (C) to the
extent that as of the close of business on the Closing Date, Seller shall have
current liabilities that were incurred on behalf of the Company or any
Subsidiary thereof that have not been paid prior to such date and time, then
(x) if Seller is the obligor with respect thereto (and therefore liable to pay
the amounts owed to the Person entitled to receipt of such payment), then no
amounts in respect thereof shall be accrued as a "Current Liability" for
purposes of this Agreement, or (y) if the Company or any Subsidiary thereof is
the obligor with respect thereto (and therefore liable to pay the amounts owed
to the Person entitled to receipt of such payment), then all amounts in
respect thereof shall be accrued as a "Current Liability" for purposes of this
Agreement, notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement (including
this Section 2.5) to the contrary. At the Closing, Purchaser shall receive an
itemization of any such liabilities referenced in this Section 2.5(a)(C)(x) or
(y), including identification of the obligor with respect to such liabilities,
and certified by the Certifying Officer (the "Current Liability Certificate").

  

  

(b) For the purpose of any purchase price allocation required under Section
1060 or any other provision of the Code, both Purchaser and Seller agree that
the portion of the purchase price that will be allocated to (i) property,
plant and equipment, (ii) accounts receivable and (iii) inventory shall be
equal to their book values (the "Allocation Methodology"). Purchaser and
Seller agree (A) to be bound by the Allocation Methodology established in
accordance with this Section 2.5(b), (B) to act in accordance with the
Allocation Methodology in the filing of all Tax Returns (including, without
limitation, filing Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 (and any supplemental or
amended Form 8594) with their U.S. federal income Tax Returns for the taxable
year that includes the Closing Date) and in the course of any Tax audit, Tax
examination or Tax litigation relating thereto (and to cooperate in the
preparation of any such filings), and (C) to take no position and cause any of
their Affiliates to take no position inconsistent with the Allocation
Methodology for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required to do so pursuant to a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.

  

  

Section 2.6. Covered Proceeding.

  

  

(a) Following the Closing, Seller (or a designee thereof) shall, at the sole
expense of Seller, continue to have sole control and authority with respect to
the negotiations in respect of, and the prosecution, defense and/or settlement
of (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any decision to settle), each
Covered Proceeding, in each case for and on behalf of the Company and any
Affiliate thereof (such Affiliate of the Company as existing immediately prior
to the Closing).

  

  

(b) In connection with the foregoing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries following the Closing)
to use their commercially reasonable efforts to, (i) cooperate with Seller in
the negotiations in respect of, and the prosecution, defense or settlement of,
each Covered Proceeding, including by executing or causing the Company or any
Subsidiary thereof to execute such documents or instruments as may be
reasonably required in connection therewith, and (ii) furnish such records,
information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings,
hearings, trials and appeals, as may be reasonably requested by Seller in
connection therewith; provided that Seller shall reimburse Purchaser and its
Affiliates for all third party, out-of-pocket and reasonable fees and expenses
incurred by any of them following the Closing in connection with Purchaser's
compliance with this Section 2.6(b).

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Purchaser agrees that
following the Closing and until a final non-appealable award, judgment,
resolution or settlement in respect of the Covered Proceeding shall be issued
or entered into or agreed to in writing (for the avoidance of doubt, such
resolution or settlement requiring the prior written consent of Seller, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Purchaser
shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries following the Closing) not to take any action or omit to take any
action that would be reasonably likely to (i) reduce or otherwise adversely
affect in any way (including in respect of timing of payment) any amounts
alleged to be payable to the Company or any Subsidiary thereof in respect of
any Covered Proceeding or (ii) otherwise have an adverse effect on the outcome
of any Covered Proceeding.

  

  

(d) In the event that Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof (including, after the
Closing Date, the Company or any Subsidiary thereof) receives a payment or any
other proceeds from any Person in respect of any Covered Proceeding, whether
due to any settlement, judgment or other resolution thereof, Purchaser shall,
or shall cause an Affiliate thereof to, (i) pay (promptly (and, in any event,
within five (5) Business Days) following the receipt thereof by Purchaser or
any Affiliate thereof) to Seller an amount in cash equal to the entire amount
of such payment or such other proceeds and (ii) provide written notice to
Seller promptly following the receipt thereof and shall thereafter provide to
Seller any additional information that it may reasonably request in connection
therewith (provided that the provision of any such additional information to
Seller shall not necessitate any unreasonable effort or expense on the part of
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, and any such reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection therewith shall be reimbursed by Seller or its
Affiliates, including the out-of-pocket costs and expenses associated with the
transmittal of proceeds referenced herein). Any payment under this Section 2.6
shall be paid to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
bank account or accounts designated in writing by Seller to Purchaser. The
parties acknowledge that Seller will be treated as retaining ownership for
income Tax purposes of each Covered Proceeding and will report the receipt of
the payments described herein as income (net of appropriate deductions, if
any) for Tax and financial reporting purposes. Purchaser and Seller agree not
to take any position, including, without limitation, for federal, state,
foreign or local Tax purposes, that is inconsistent with the intent expressed
in this Section 2.6.

  

  

Section 2.7. Mosaic Arbitration.

  

  

(a) Following the Closing, Seller (or a designee thereof) shall, at the sole
expense of Seller, continue to have sole control and authority with respect to
the negotiations in respect of, and the prosecution, defense and/or settlement
of (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any decision to settle), the Mosaic
Arbitration, in each case for and on behalf of the Company and any Affiliate
thereof (such Affiliate of the Company as existing immediately prior to the
Closing).

  

  

(b) In connection with the foregoing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries following the Closing)
to use their commercially reasonable efforts to, (i) cooperate with Seller in
the negotiations in respect of, and the prosecution, defense or settlement of,
the Mosaic Arbitration, including by executing or causing the Company or any
Subsidiary thereof to execute such documents or instruments as may be
reasonably required in connection therewith, and (ii) furnish such records,
information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings,
hearings, trials and appeals, as may be reasonably requested by Seller in
connection therewith; provided that Seller shall reimburse Purchaser and the
Company for all third party, out-of-pocket and other fees and expenses
incurred by any of them following the Closing in connection with Purchaser's
compliance with this Section 2.7(b).

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Purchaser agrees that
following the Closing and until a final non-appealable arbitration award,
resolution or settlement in respect of the Mosaic Arbitration shall be issued
or entered into or agreed to in writing (for the avoidance of doubt, such
resolution or settlement requiring the prior written consent of Seller),
Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Company and
its Subsidiaries following the Closing) not to, amend, restate, waive any
right with respect to, or otherwise modify the Mosaic Contract (including
pursuant to any Alternative Mosaic Agreement) or otherwise take or omit to
take any other action, in each case without the prior written consent of
Seller, if such amendment, restatement, waiver, modification (including the
terms of any Alternative Mosaic Agreement) or other action or omission would
be reasonably likely to (i) reduce or otherwise adversely affect in any way
(including in respect of timing of payment), any accrued and unpaid dead
freight alleged to be payable by Mosaic to the Company or any Subsidiary
thereof in respect of any period ending prior to the Closing Date or (ii)
otherwise have an adverse effect on the outcome of the Mosaic Arbitration.

  

  

(d) In the event that Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof (including, after the
Closing Date, the Company or any Subsidiary thereof) receives a payment from
Mosaic for dead freight that has accrued in respect of any period ending prior
to the Closing Date (including any payment of dead freight in connection with
the resolution of the Mosaic Arbitration), or any other payment or
reimbursement from Mosaic in connection with the Mosaic Arbitration, including
in respect of legal fees and expenses incurred or paid by Seller, the Company
or any of their respective Affiliates, Purchaser shall, or shall cause an
Affiliate thereof to, pay (promptly (and, in any event, within five (5)
Business Days) following the receipt thereof by Purchaser or any Affiliate
thereof) to Seller an amount in cash equal to the entire amount of such dead
freight payment in respect of any period ending prior to the Closing Date
together with any other payments or reimbursements received by Purchaser or
any Affiliate thereof in connection with the Mosaic Arbitration, including any
legal fees or expenses that are so paid or reimbursed. Any payment under this
Section 2.7(d) shall be paid to Seller by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the bank account or accounts designated in writing by
Seller to Purchaser. The parties acknowledge that Seller will be treated as
retaining ownership for income Tax purposes of the Mosaic Arbitration (but
only to the extent of any dead freight payment in respect of any period ending
prior to the Closing Date and any legal fees or expenses paid or reimbursed to
the Company or any Subsidiary thereof by Mosaic) and will report the receipt
of the payments described herein as income (net of appropriate deductions, if
any) for Tax and financial reporting purposes. Purchaser and Seller agree not
to take any position, including, without limitation, for federal, state,

Seller with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pending under

been paid and Seller (as it relates to the Company or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable) is in compliance in all material respects with the terms and
conditions of such Insurance Policies. None of the Company or its Subsidiaries

another Person (collectively, the "Company Leases"), and each leased or
subleased parcel of real property in which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a tenant, subtenant or occupant thereunder (the "Leased Real
Property"). The Company Leases contain the entire agreement between the

Subsidiary affecting the Leased Real Property.

otherwise disposed of since the Balance Sheet Date or is sold or otherwise
disposed of in accordance with, or as contemplated by, the terms set forth
herein or the other Transaction Documents. All the tangible personal property
purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company and its Subsidiaries since the

Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of all material (a) Patents, (b)
Trademark applications and registrations and (c) Copyright applications and
registrations, in each case owned by any of the Company or its Subsidiaries as
of the date hereof. To the Knowledge of Seller, (i) the conduct of the
Business as currently conducted does not materially infringe or otherwise
materially violate any Person's Intellectual Property rights, and there is no
such claim pending or threatened in writing against any of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, and (ii) no Person is materially infringing or otherwise
materially violating any Company Intellectual Property right owned by any of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, and no such claims are pending or threatened

effect as of the date hereof pursuant to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries makes, provides or receives material payments or material
services to or from Seller or any Subsidiary thereof other than the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. Neither Seller nor any Affiliate thereof (other than
the Company or any Subsidiary thereof) owns any of the assets or properties
used by the Company and its Subsidiaries in the operation of the Business.

  

  

Section 3.20. Significant Customers and Significant Suppliers. Section 3.20 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and correct list of the names
of the top ten (10) customers and suppliers of the Business (measured by, in
the case of customers of the Business, the aggregate amount of revenue derived
by the Company and its Subsidiaries from such customers and, in the case of
suppliers of the Business, the aggregate dollar volume of purchases made by
the Company and its Subsidiaries from such suppliers) during the eight month
period ended July 31, 2012 (the "Significant Customers" and "Significant
Suppliers," respectively). None of the Significant Customers or Significant
Suppliers have informed the Company or any Subsidiary thereof (or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives) prior to the date hereof that any
such Significant Customer or Significant Supplier intends to terminate or
materially reduce its obligations to or business relationship with the Company
and/or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

  

Section 3.21. Vessels.

  

  

(a) The Company or the applicable Subsidiary, as the case may be, has good,
valid and marketable title to each Vessel that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries purports to own, free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than
Permitted Encumbrances).

  

  

(b) Except as set forth on Section 3.21(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,

or placed under foreign registry, (v) such Vessel holds in full force and
effect all material certificates, licenses, permits and rights required for
operation in the manner vessels of its kind are being operated in the
geographical area in which such Vessel is presently being operated, and (vi)
with respect to any Vessel which is classed, such Vessel has all appropriate
ABS classifications or an equivalent classification with another
classification society as of the date of this Agreement required under
applicable Law, and except as set forth in Section 3.21(b) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules, free in all material respects of any conditions or
recommendations affecting class or affecting the validity of, or restricting,
the Vessel's Certificate of Inspection issued by the United States Coast
Guard, provided that no representation or warranty included in this Section
3.21(b)(vi) is made with respect to any Vessel that is laid up.

  

  

Section 3.22. Brokers' Fees. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor
or other Person, other than Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith
Incorporated, is entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or
other similar fee or commission in connection with this Agreement or the

Section 3.23. SEC Documents. Each Qualifying SEC Report (a) at the time filed,
complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 and the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as the case may be,
and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to
such Qualifying SEC Report and (b) did not at the time it was filed (or if
amended or superseded by a filing or amendment prior to the date of this
Agreement, then at the time of such filing or amendment) contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the
consolidated financial statements included in the Qualifying SEC Reports
complied at the time it was filed as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, was prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in
the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly presented in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of Seller and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER

  

  

Purchaser represents and warrants to Seller as follows:

  

  

Section 4.1. Organizational Status. Purchaser is duly incorporated or
organized and validly existing under the Laws of its governing jurisdiction
and (a) has all requisite corporate or other entity power and authority to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted and (b) is duly qualified
to do business in each of the jurisdictions in which the ownership, operation
or leasing of its properties and assets and the conduct of its business
requires it to be so qualified, except where the failure to have such power
and authority or to be so qualified would not reasonably be expected to
materially impair or delay Purchaser's ability to perform its obligations
under this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

  

  

Section 4.2. Authorization. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents by Purchaser, and the consummation by
Purchaser of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and the
performance by Purchaser of its obligations hereunder and thereunder have been
duly and validly authorized by all requisite corporate or other similar
organizational action on the part of Purchaser. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by Purchaser and (assuming due authorization, execution
and delivery by Seller) this Agreement constitutes, and the other Transaction
Documents, when executed and delivered by Purchaser (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties thereto) will
constitute, a valid and binding obligation of Purchaser, enforceable against
Purchaser in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other
similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally or by
general equitable principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law).

  

  

Section 4.3. No Conflict. Assuming all Governmental Filings and waiting
periods described in or contemplated by Section 4.4 have been obtained or
made, or have expired, the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents by Purchaser and the consummation by Purchaser of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not (a) violate any
applicable Law to which any of Purchaser or its Affiliates are subject, (b)
except as set forth on Section 4.3 of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, conflict with, result in a violation
or breach of, or constitute a default under, result in the acceleration of,
create in any party the right to accelerate, terminate or cancel any Contract
to which Purchaser or its Affiliates is a party or by which Purchaser or its
Affiliates is bound or to which the assets of Purchaser or its Affiliates are
subject, or (c) violate the Organizational Documents of any of Purchaser or
its Affiliates, other than, in the case of clauses (a) and (b) above, any such
violations, defaults, conflicts, breaches, accelerations or rights that would
not reasonably be expected to materially impair or delay Purchaser's ability
to perform its obligations under this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

  

  

Section 4.4. Government Filings. No Governmental Filings are required to be
obtained or made by any of Purchaser or its Affiliates in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents by
Purchaser or the consummation by Purchaser of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby (collectively, the "Purchaser Governmental Filings"), except
(a) compliance with and filings under the HSR Act, (b) compliance with and
filings under the Exchange Act, and (c) such other Governmental Filings, the
failure of which to be obtained or made would not reasonably be expected to
materially impair or delay Purchaser's ability to perform its obligations
under this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

  

  

Section 4.5. Legal Proceedings. There are no Actions pending or, to the
knowledge of Purchaser, threatened against any of Purchaser or its Affiliates,
which (a) if adversely determined, would reasonably be expected to materially
impair or delay Purchaser's ability to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, or (b) challenge the validity or
enforceability of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or seek to
enjoin or prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby. Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates is subject to any
Governmental Order that would reasonably be expected to materially impair or
delay Purchaser's ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or
the other Transaction Documents or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby.

  

  

Section 4.6. Funding.

  

  

(a) Purchaser has delivered to Seller, as of the date of this Agreement, true,
complete and correct copies of executed commitment letters, dated as of
September 28, 2012 (collectively, the "Commitment Letter", provided that, for
purposes of this Agreement, the Commitment Letter shall also include, after
the date hereof, to the extent alternative financing from alternative
financial institutions is obtained in accordance with this Agreement, any such
alternative financing), from each of Regions Bank and DNB Bank ASA (the "Debt
Commitment Parties"; the Debt Commitment Parties, together with to the extent
alternative financing from alternative financial institutions is obtained in
accordance with this Agreement, any such alternative financial institutions
collectively, the "Debt Financing Sources") pursuant to which the Debt
Commitment Parties (or Debt Financing Sources, as applicable) have agreed,
subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to provide or cause to be
provided to Parent or a Subsidiary thereof the debt amounts set forth therein
(the "Debt Financing" which includes, to the extent alternative financing from
alternative financial institutions is obtained in accordance with this
Agreement, any such alternative financing). The Commitment Letter is in full
force and effect as of the date of this Agreement, and is the legal, valid and
binding obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of Purchaser, the other
parties thereto. As of the date hereof, no amendment or modification of the
Commitment Letter has been or made and the respective commitments contained in
the Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any
respect. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in
connection with the Commitment Letter that are payable on or prior to the date
hereof. As of the date of this Agreement, except as set forth on Section 4.6
of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, neither Parent nor Purchaser has any
reasonable basis to believe that Parent will be unable to satisfy on a timely
basis any term or condition of Closing to be satisfied by it in the Commitment
Letter on or prior to the Closing Date. As of the date hereof, no event has
occurred which would result in any breach or violation of or constitute a
default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a
default) by Parent under the Commitment Letter. There are no conditions
precedent (including any condition precedent regarding the consummation of any
transaction other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement)
related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the
Debt Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter. As
of the date hereof, there are no side letters or other agreements, contracts
or arrangements related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the
full amount of the Debt Financing other than as expressly set forth in or
contemplated by the Commitment Letter. The obligations of Purchaser under this
Agreement are not contingent in any respect upon the funding of the amounts
contemplated to be funded pursuant to the Commitment Letter. Purchaser's
obligations under this Agreement are not subject to any condition regarding
Purchaser's, its Affiliates' (including Parent) or any other Person's ability
to obtain financing for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.

  

  

(b) At the Closing, assuming the satisfaction of the closing conditions in
Section 6.1 and Section 6.2, (i) the available cash that Parent shall make
available to Purchaser together with the net proceeds from the Debt Financing
will in the aggregate be sufficient for Purchaser to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents on the Closing Date, including payment of the Closing Consideration,
the Closing Escrow Amount, and all fees and expenses incurred by Parent or
Purchaser in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, and (ii) Parent shall have sufficient letter
of credit availability under its revolving credit facility to enable it to
caused to be issued the letters of credit required to be issued pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement in connection with the Closing.

  

  

Section 4.7. Solvency. Neither Parent nor Purchaser is entering into the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future
creditors of Purchaser, Parent, the Company or any of the Subsidiaries of the
foregoing Persons. To the knowledge of Purchaser, based on information
available to Purchaser as of the date of this Agreement, immediately after
giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents, including the Debt Financing, and the payment of the
Closing Consideration, the Closing Escrow Amount, and all fees and expenses
incurred by Parent and Purchaser in connection with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, assuming satisfaction of the
conditions to Purchaser's obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, each of
Purchaser, Parent, the Company and the Subsidiaries of all of the foregoing
Persons (i) as of such date will be able to pay its respective debts as they
become due and shall own property having a fair saleable value greater than
the amounts required to pay its respective debts (including a reasonable
estimate of the amount of all contingent liabilities) as they become absolute
and mature; and (ii) shall not have, as of such date, unreasonably small
capital to carry on its respective business.

  

  

Section 4.8. Acquisition for Investment. Purchaser has such knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating
the merits and risks of Purchaser's purchase of the Interests. Purchaser
confirms that it can bear the economic risk of its investment in the Interests
and can afford to lose its entire investment in the Interests, has been
furnished any and all materials relating to Purchaser's purchase of the
Interests that it has requested, and Seller has provided Purchaser the
opportunity to ask questions of the officers and management employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and to acquire additional information about the
business and financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
Purchaser is acquiring the Interests for investment and not with a view toward
or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof, or with any present
intention of distributing or selling such Interests. Purchaser agrees that the
Interests may not be sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged,
hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without qualification under applicable
securities Laws, except pursuant to an exemption from such qualification
available under such securities Laws. Purchaser is an "accredited investor" as
defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act.

  

  

Section 4.9. Brokers' Fees. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or
other Person, other than DNB Capital Markets, Inc. is entitled to any
broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or other similar fee or commission in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby based
upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates.

  

  

Section 4.10. Parent Guarantee. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Purchaser has delivered to Seller the Parent Guarantee duly
executed by Parent. The Parent Guarantee is valid and in full force and effect
and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Parent, enforceable in
accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws
relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally or by general equitable
principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at Law), and Parent has, and will have, sufficient
assets to satisfy any and all obligations thereunder.

  

  

Section 4.11. No Reliance. Purchaser acknowledges that it has conducted to its
satisfaction an independent investigation of the financial condition,
liabilities, results of operations and projected operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and the nature and condition of their respective properties
and assets and the Business and, in making the determination to proceed with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, has relied solely on the results of its own independent
investigation and the representations and warranties expressly made by Seller
in this Article III or in the certificate delivered by Seller pursuant to
Section 6.2(d). Purchaser acknowledges that, other than as set forth in
Article III hereof or in the certificate delivered by Seller pursuant to
pursuant to Section 6.2(d), none of Seller, the Company, the Subsidiaries of
the Company or any of their respective Representatives makes or has made any
representation or warranty, either express or implied, (i) as to the accuracy
or completeness of any of the information provided or made available to
Purchaser or any of its Representatives prior to the execution of this
Agreement or (ii) with respect to any projections, forecasts, estimates, plans
or budgets of future revenues, expenses or expenditures, future results of
operations (or any component thereof), future cash flows (or any component
thereof) or future financial condition (or any component thereof) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries heretofore or hereafter delivered to or made
available to Purchaser or any of its Representatives. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, neither Seller, the Company, the Subsidiaries of
the Company nor any of their respective Representatives has made, and shall
not be deemed to have made, any representations or warranties in the materials
(other than as expressly set forth in Article III of this Agreement or in the
certificate delivered by Seller pursuant to Section 6.2(d)) relating to the
Business, assets or liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries made
available to Purchaser, including due diligence materials, memorandum or
similar materials, or in the Electronic Data Room or any presentation of the
Business of the Company (or its Subsidiaries) or others, or in any other form
or manner, in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and no
statement contained in any such materials or made in any such presentation
shall be deemed a representation or warranty hereunder or otherwise or deemed
to be relied upon by Purchaser in executing, delivering and performing this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. It is understood that any cost estimates,
projections or other predictions, any data, any financial information or any
memoranda or offering materials or presentations, including any offering
memorandum or similar materials made available to Purchaser and its
Representatives, are not and shall not be deemed to be or to include
representations or warranties of Seller, the Company, the Subsidiaries of the
Company or any of their respective Representatives, and are not and shall not
be deemed to be relied upon by Purchaser in executing, delivering and
performing this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

expenditures or repairs shall be required with respect to any Vessel that is
laid up, and (ii) if any such maintenance or capital expenditures or repairs
are so deferred or not made, then this covenant shall nonetheless be deemed
complied with for all purposes hereof, but the amount of money that would be
been expended by the Company or any Subsidiary thereof in connection therewith
shall reduce, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, the Closing Consideration;

  

  

(l) voluntarily cancel or reduce any of its insurance coverage;

  

  

(m) agree or otherwise commit to take any of the actions set forth in the
foregoing subsections (a) through (l) of this Section 5.1.

  

  

(n) Subject in all cases to Seller's compliance with this Section 5.1, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give Purchaser, directly or indirectly, the
right to control or direct the operations of the Company or any Subsidiary
thereof prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, nothing shall limit or restrict any actions or activities of the
Company or any Subsidiary thereof in respect of any Action that may arise or
be commenced between Seller, any parent company of Seller, the Company or any
Subsidiary thereof, on the one hand, and Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof
(including Parent), on the other hand.

  

  

Section 5.2. Employment Matters.

  

  

(a) Except with respect to compensatory and employee benefits that may arise
pursuant to or under the Company Plans identified in Sections 3.14(a)(A)(23),
3.14(a)(B)(2) and 3.14(a)(C) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, during the one
(1) year period following the Closing, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, provide to each employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries who is employed at the Closing (each, a "Company Employee"), for
so long as the Company Employee remains so employed during such period,
compensation and employee benefits that, with respect to each such employee,
are not materially less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation and
benefits provided to such employee under the Company Plans immediately prior
to the Closing.

  

  

(b) Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide each Company
Employee who incurs a termination of employment during the one (1) year period
following the Closing with severance payments and severance benefits that are
no less favorable than those to which such Company Employee would have been
entitled under the severance pay policy that is described in Section 5.2(b) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, assuming that a determination was made by the
appropriate Person to provide the default or recommended level of benefits set
forth therein; provided however, that neither Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates shall be obligated to comply with this Section 5.2(b) with respect
to any Company Employee to the extent that, as a result of the nature of the
termination of employee, the severance policy described on Section 5.2(d) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule entitles the Company to withhold, delay,
qualify or forfeit (or other any related action) such payments.

  

  

(c) Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates, as applicable, to give
Company Employees full credit for such Company Employees' service with the
Company and its Affiliates for purposes of eligibility, vesting, and
determination of the level of benefits (including for purposes of vacation and
severance), but not for purposes of benefit accruals, under any benefit plans
maintained by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in which a Company Employee
participates, to the same extent recognized by the Company (or any Affiliate
thereof) immediately prior to the Closing; provided, however, that such
service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service.

  

  

(d) Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates, as applicable, to (i)
waive any preexisting condition limitations otherwise applicable to Company
Employees and their eligible dependents under any plan of Purchaser or any
Affiliate of Purchaser that provides health benefits in which Company
Employees may be eligible to participate following the Closing, other than any
limitations that were in effect with respect to such Company Employees as of
the Closing under the analogous Company Plan, (ii) honor any deductibles, co-
payments, and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by the Company Employees and
their eligible dependents under the health plans in which they participated
immediately prior to the Closing during the portion of the calendar year prior
to the Closing in satisfying any deductibles, co-payments, or out-of-pocket
maximums under health plans of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in which
they are eligible to participate after the Closing in the same plan year in
which such deductibles, co-payments, or out-of-pocket maximums were incurred
and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability
requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a Company Employee and his
eligible dependents on or after the Closing, in each case to the extent that
such Company Employee or eligible dependent had satisfied any similar
limitation or requirement under an analogous Company Plan prior to the
Closing.

  

  

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2, express or implied, is intended to
confer upon any Company Employee any right to continued employment for any
period or continued receipt of any specific employee benefit, or shall
constitute an amendment to or any other modification of any Company Plan.
Further, this Section 5.2 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the
benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section
5.2, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section
5.2.

  

  

(f) At or prior to the Closing, Seller shall make all required matching,
retirement and profit-sharing contributions to the United Maritime Group
401(k) Savings and Retirement Plan due as of the Closing with respect to the
Company's employees who are eligible for such contributions.

  

  

Section 5.3. Publicity. Purchaser and Seller agree that no public release or
public announcement of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be issued or made by any
party hereto or any of their respective Affiliates without the prior written
consent of Purchaser and Seller, except (a) such release or announcement as
may be required by Law or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange upon
which the securities of Purchaser, Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates are listed, in which case the party required to issue or make the
release or announcement shall allow (or cause its Affiliate to allow) the
other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance or the making thereof (but in no case shall any delay
in the party commenting on such release or announcement restrict the ability
of such other party from making the same if, in its good faith judgment, the
failure to publish such release would be materially detrimental to its
business, operations, or cause it to become in material breach or default of
or under applicable Law), (b) Purchaser, Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates may timely disclose this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents
and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby to the extent required
pursuant to applicable securities Laws, including the Exchange Act, or
Contracts requiring any such Person to make filings with the SEC, (c) that
Seller shall be permitted to make, or cause the Company to make, announcements
from time to time to the respective employees, customers, suppliers and other
business relations of Seller, the Company and their respective Affiliates
(including in connection with seeking the consent or approval of any Person
pursuant to any Contract to which Seller, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound) and otherwise as Seller
may reasonably determine is necessary to comply (or cause the Company or any
other Subsidiary of Seller to comply) with applicable Law or the requirements
of any Contract to which Seller or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound, (d) for such announcements or
releases required to be made to comply with Section 5.6, (e) that nothing
contained herein shall limit or restrict the right of Seller, Purchaser or any
of their respective Affiliates in respect of any Action that may arise or be
commenced between Seller, any parent company of Seller or the Company, on the
one hand, and Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof, on the other hand, and (f)
that nothing shall limit or restrict the right of Seller, Purchaser or any of
their respective Affiliates to make internal announcements to their employees,
so long as such announcements are in compliance with the terms and conditions
of the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

Section 5.4. Confidentiality. The parties acknowledge and agree that the
Confidentiality Agreement between Seller and International Shipholding
Corporation, dated November 23, 2011 (the "Confidentiality Agreement") shall
remain in full force and effect in accordance with the terms set forth
therein, and that any and all material and information provided by or on
behalf of Seller pursuant to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document,
including any information provided pursuant to Section 5.5, shall be subject
to the terms set forth therein. For the avoidance of doubt, if this Agreement
is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as provided in Section 7.2.

  

  

Section 5.5. Access to Information. Subject to the terms set forth in Section
5.4 and this Section 5.5, Seller shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries
to afford Purchaser and its Representatives reasonable access, during normal
business hours and upon reasonable notice, to the assets, properties, offices
and other facilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to their books
and records, and shall furnish Purchaser with available financial, operating
and other data and information with respect to the business, assets and
properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Purchaser may reasonably
request, including access to such available information or other available
documentation as may be necessary for Purchaser and its Affiliates to maintain
compliance with the Exchange Act. In exercising its rights hereunder,
Purchaser shall (and shall cause each of its Representatives to) use its
respective commercially reasonable efforts to conduct itself so as not to
interfere in the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
prior to Closing. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that any contact by
Purchaser and its Representatives with officers, employees, customers or
agents of the Company and its Subsidiaries hereunder shall be arranged and
supervised by representatives of Seller or any designee thereof, and that
unless Seller otherwise provides its prior written consent, Purchaser shall
not, and shall cause its Representatives not to, contact or discuss with any
officer, employee, customer or agent or other business relation of the Company
or any Subsidiary thereof any matters pertaining to the Company or any
Subsidiary thereof, any of their respective businesses or operations or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction Document.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, neither
Seller nor any of its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries)
shall be required to disclose to Purchaser or any agent or Representative
thereof any information (a) relating to any sale or divestiture process
conducted by Seller for the Company, any Subsidiary thereof or the Business or
Seller's (or its Representatives') evaluation of the Company, any Subsidiary
thereof or the Business in connection therewith, including projections,
financial information or other information relating thereto, or (b) if doing
so could in the reasonable judgment of Seller violate any Contract or Law to
which Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries) is a party or to which it is subject or which it believes in
good faith could result in a loss of the ability to successfully assert a
claim of privilege (including the attorney-client and work-product
privileges), it being understood and agreed that Seller may elect to limit, or
cause the Company or any Subsidiary thereof to limit, disclosure of any
information to certain Persons designated as a "clean team" by Purchaser
(which Persons must be reasonably acceptable to Seller). In addition,
notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, without
the prior written consent of Seller, none of Purchaser or its Representatives
shall have any right to perform or conduct, or cause to be performed or
conducted, any environmental sampling or testing at, in, on or underneath the
Real Property.

  

  

Section 5.6. Filings, Authorizations and Consents.

  

  

(a) Seller and Purchaser shall, as promptly as practicable (and, in any event,
within seven (7) Business Days following the date of this Agreement), cause to
be filed (including by causing the applicable Affiliate thereof to file) with
the applicable Governmental Entity the notification and report form pursuant
to the HSR Act required for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents. Seller and Purchaser shall, as promptly
as practicable, comply, and cause any applicable Affiliate thereof to comply,
with any request for additional information and documents pursuant to the HSR
Act. Seller and Purchaser shall inform, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to inform, the other promptly of any communication made by or on
behalf of such party (or any Affiliate thereof) to (including permitting the
other party to review such communication in advance), but in all cases, only
to the extent such written communications and summaries of oral communications
are customarily exchanged by parties submitting notifications under the HSR
Act, or received from, such Governmental Entity and shall furnish to the other
such information and assistance as the other may reasonably request in
connection with its preparation of any filing, submission or other act that is
necessary or advisable under the HSR Act, but in all cases, only to the extent
such filing or written materials are customarily exchanged by parties
submitting notifications under the HSR Act. Seller and Purchaser shall keep,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates to keep, each other timely
apprised of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or
requests for additional information from such Governmental Entity, and shall
comply, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to comply, promptly with
any such inquiry or request. Neither party shall agree, or permit any
Affiliate thereof to agree, to participate in any meeting, whether in person
or telephonically, with any Governmental Entity in respect of any such
filings, investigation or other inquiries unless it consults with the other
party in advance, and to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity,
gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat.

  

  

(b) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
antitrust, competition or other Law or in connection with any Purchaser
Governmental Filings that may be asserted (or threatened to be asserted) by
any Governmental Entity so as to enable the parties to expeditiously close the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents on the terms set forth herein, provided that such efforts shall not
require Purchaser to commit to or effect (or causing its Affiliates to commit
to or effect), by consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise, the
sale, divestiture or disposition of such of its (or its Affiliates) assets or
businesses, or of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof or their respective
businesses to be acquired pursuant to this Agreement. In addition, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to the proviso in the
foregoing sentence, Purchaser and Seller agree to take promptly, and cause
their respective Affiliates to take promptly, any and all steps necessary to
attempt to vacate or lift any Governmental Order or other restraint or
limitation imposed by any Governmental Entity (or threatened to be imposed by
any Governmental Entity) that would have the effect of, or be reasonably
likely to have the effect of, making the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents illegal or otherwise prohibiting
or delaying the consummation of such transactions.

  

  

(c) Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with one another, and cause their
Affiliates to so cooperate, in determining whether any action by or in respect
of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity (excluding the actions and filings
described in subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 5.6) is required or
reasonably appropriate, or any action, consent, approval or waiver from any
party to any Company Contract is required or reasonably appropriate, in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement, in taking such
actions or making any such filings, the parties shall furnish such
information, and cause their Affiliates to furnish such information, as may be
required in connection therewith (but in all cases, only to the extent such
information is customarily furnished or exchanged by parties regarding such
action by or in respect of, or filing with, such Governmental Entity) and
timely seek to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers.

  

  

Section 5.7. Director and Officer Liability; Indemnification.

  

  

(a) Subject to (and without limiting) Section 5.7(c), from and after the
Closing and prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing, Purchaser
shall not permit the Company or any Subsidiary thereof to amend (whether by
merger, dissolution, liquidation or otherwise) the Organizational Documents of
the Company or any Subsidiary thereof as in effect at the Closing in a manner
that would materially diminish the indemnification and contribution rights and
the provisions contained therein regarding the elimination or limitation of
liability, in each case of the current and former officers, directors,
managing members and members of the Company and its Subsidiaries thereunder
and any other Persons entitled to indemnification, contribution or liability
limitation thereunder (collectively, the "Company Indemnitees"), in respect of
acts or omissions (or alleged acts or omissions) occurring at or prior to the
Closing, including in respect of any acts or omissions (or alleged acts or
omissions) taken or not taken in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby; provided that notwithstanding
anything contained in this Section 5.7 to the contrary (but otherwise assuming
compliance by Purchaser), in no event shall the covenants and agreements made
by Purchaser herein be deemed to limit or otherwise restrict its ability to
merge, consolidate, dissolve or liquidate the Company or any Subsidiary
following the Closing.

  

  

(b) Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall purchase an extended reporting
period endorsement (the "Tail Insurance Policy") under Seller's existing
directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage (including employment
practices and fiduciary liability insurance) for the benefit of the Company
Indemnitees that shall provide such Persons with coverage for six (6) years
following the Closing of not less than the existing coverage and having other
terms no less favorable to the insured Persons thereunder than the directors'
and officers' liability insurance coverage presently maintained by Seller for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date. Following the
Closing, Purchaser shall cause the Tail Insurance Policy to remain in full
force and effect and shall not, and shall not cause or permit any Affiliate
thereof to, amend, waive, modify or otherwise alter the terms thereof, except
as may be required by applicable Law.

  

  

(c) If the Company or any Subsidiary thereof or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Company or any such Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations of such Person that are set forth in this Section 5.7.

  

  

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.7 will survive the Closing and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each of the
Company Indemnitees and their respective successors, representatives and
heirs, and their rights under this Section 5.7 are in addition to, and will
not be deemed to be exclusive of, any other rights to which any such Person is
entitled, whether pursuant to applicable Law, agreement or otherwise.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if, at any time
prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing, any Company Indemnitee
delivers to Purchaser or the Company a written notice asserting a claim for
indemnification under any of the provisions set forth in this Section 5.7 or
any of the documents referred to herein, then the claim asserted in such
notice (and the related indemnification obligations provided for hereunder or
in any such document referred to herein) shall survive the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Closing until such time as such claim is fully and finally
resolved.

  

  

Section 5.8. Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Further Assurances. Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions herein provided each of the parties agrees
to use, and to cause their respective Affiliates to use, its or their
commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, to
do or cause to be done and to assist and cooperate with the other party in
doing all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, including: (a) the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the
obligations of any of the parties set forth herein; (b) the obtaining of
applicable consents, waivers or approvals of any Governmental Entities or
third parties; (c) the defending of any Actions challenging this Agreement or
the other Transaction Documents or the performance of the obligations
hereunder or thereunder; and (d) the execution and delivery of such
instruments, and the taking of such other actions, whether at or after the
Closing, as the other party may reasonably require in order to carry out the
intent of this Agreement (including the provision of access to such
information (including financial information and support therefore) of Seller,
and/or the historical operations of the Business on the one hand, or
Purchaser, on the other hand, to enable either party to satisfy reporting
requirements under applicable Law (including the Exchange Act)).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Seller, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates shall be obligated to make any payments or otherwise pay
any consideration to any third party, or agree to modify the terms of any
Contract, in each case to obtain any applicable consent, waiver or approval.

  

  

Section 5.9. Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns required to
be filed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date. Seller shall cause the Company
or the applicable Subsidiary thereof to file all such Tax Returns described in
the preceding sentence and shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes shown as
due on such Tax Returns.

  

  

(b) Seller shall have the right to control the conduct of any audit or
administrative or judicial proceeding with respect to any Taxes of, or any Tax
Return required to be filed by, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date; provided,
however, that Seller shall not compromise or settle any such audit or
proceeding without obtaining Purchaser's prior written consent (which consent
may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if it would
reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse effect on Purchaser.

  

  

(c) Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other party's request) the provision of records and
information reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other
proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Purchaser and Seller shall (i) retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company or its Subsidiaries relating
to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until expiration of
the statute of limitations (taking into account any extensions thereof) of the
respective taxable periods and (ii) give the other party reasonable written
notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and
records and, if the other party so requests, shall allow the requesting party
to take possession of such books and records.

  

  

(d) Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
the Company and its Subsidiaries) shall, without the prior written consent of
Seller, (i) make or change any Tax election affecting a taxable period ending
on or before the Closing Date of Seller or any of its Affiliates (including,
before the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries), (ii) amend, refile or
otherwise modify (or grant an extension of any applicable statute of
limitations with respect to) any Tax Return prepared by Seller or any of its
Affiliates (including, before the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries)
relating to a taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date or (iii)
take any action that results in any increased Tax liability (including a
reduction in a refund) or reduction of any Tax asset of any of the Company or
its Subsidiaries (or Seller or any of its Affiliates) in respect of a taxable
period ending on or before the Closing Date.

  

  

(e) If a refund of Taxes (to the extent not reflected on the Final Closing
Balance Sheet) (the "Refund") is received by or credited to the account of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of any taxable period ending on
or before the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause such recipient to pay the
amount of the Refund to Seller within five (5) Business Days of the receipt
thereof and shall provide written notice to Seller promptly following the
receipt thereof and shall thereafter provide to Seller any additional
information that it may reasonably request in connection therewith.

  

  

Section 5.10. Letters of Credit. As soon as reasonably practicable following
the request of Seller made after the date hereof, Purchaser shall obtain and
deliver to the beneficiary of each letter of credit that is issued in whole or
in part for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as listed on
Section 5.10 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, a substitute letter of credit
to replace in all respects, to the extent it relates to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, each such letter of credit (each, a "Substitute Letter of
Credit"), with each Substitute Letter of Credit (a) being issued by a bank or
financial institution that is reasonably acceptable to the beneficiary thereof
(and, if there are requirements as to the issuer thereof set forth in any
agreement to which the Company or any Subsidiary thereof is a party or that
arise pursuant to applicable Law, such Substitute Letter of Credit must comply
with such requirements), (b) not being effective until the Closing, (c) having
a face amount equal to the amount set forth on Section 5.10 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, and (d) containing terms and conditions that are
substantially similar to the terms and conditions that are set forth in the
letter of credit that it is intended to replace (in whole or in part) and
otherwise containing terms and conditions that are reasonably acceptable to
the beneficiary thereof. Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from the beneficiary of each letter
of credit to be replaced (in whole or in part) pursuant to the terms hereof
and deliver to Seller a full and unconditional release, effective as of the
Closing, of each such letter of credit (or portions thereof) being so replaced
and of all of the obligations of Seller or any Affiliate thereof (excluding,
following the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) with respect to such
letter of credit or the portion thereof being replaced pursuant to the terms
hereof (which release shall be reasonably acceptable to Sellers) (each, a
"Letter of Credit Release"). In the event Purchaser has not, as of the
Closing, obtained and delivered a Letter of Credit Release in respect of all
of the letters of credit (or portions thereof) being replaced in accordance
with the preceding sentence (each such letter of credit (or portion thereof),
an "Outstanding Seller Letter of Credit"), (i) Purchaser shall, and shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts
to do so following the Closing and shall indemnify and hold harmless each of
Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) from
and against any and all Losses incurred by Seller or any of its Affiliates
(other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) arising out of or relating to
such letter(s) of credit, and (ii) without limitation of the foregoing,
Purchaser shall deliver to Seller at the Closing a letter of credit in respect
of each Outstanding Seller Letter of Credit in the substantially the form
attached as Exhibit G hereto that (A) is issued by an Eligible Bank, (B) has a
stated term that does not end prior to the date that is thirty (30) days after
the stated term of the related Outstanding Seller Letter of Credit, and (C)
has a face amount equal to one hundred ten percent (110%) of the face amount
of the relate Outstanding Seller Letter of Credit (each such letter of credit
delivered to Seller, a "Back to Back Letter of Credit").

  

  

Section 5.11. TECO Agreement.

  

  

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the request of Seller made
after the date hereof, Purchaser shall deliver the TECO Performance Letter to
Seller and Tampa Electric, which shall not be effective until the Closing.
Without limitation of any of the other terms set forth in this Agreement,
including in this Section 5.11, (i) Purchaser shall make such changes to the
TECO Performance Letter as Tampa Electric may reasonably request and shall
otherwise take or cause to be taken such other actions in respect of the TECO
Agreement (including in respect of Purchaser's or the Company's (or its
Subsidiaries') obligations thereunder) as may reasonably be requested by
Seller or Tampa Electric in connection with the purchase by Purchaser of the
Interests, and (ii) Purchaser shall comply, and cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to comply, with all of the Company's, its Subsidiary's or
Purchaser's respective obligations (if any) now or hereafter existing under
the terms of the TECO Agreement (including without limitation any obligation
of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof to maintain any insurance applicable
to the Company or any Subsidiary thereof or the business or operations thereof
that is required pursuant to the terms of the TECO Agreement).

  

  

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable following the request of Seller made
after the date hereof, Purchaser shall obtain and deliver (or cause to be
delivered) to Tampa Electric a letter of credit, substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit H (subject to such changes thereto as Tampa
Electric may reasonably request to be made thereto), with a face amount equal
to $6,000,000, it being understood and agreed that such letter of credit shall
be delivered pursuant to Section 22.1 of the TECO Agreement and shall satisfy
and comply with the requirements of a "Letter of Credit" under the terms of
the TECO Agreement (including in respect of the minimum credit rating of the
issuer thereof as set forth in the definition of "Letter of Credit" in the
TECO Agreement) and otherwise comply with all of the requirements of the TECO
Agreement, including in respect of the period of time during which such letter
of credit shall remain outstanding and the expiration date thereof (the "TECO
Letter of Credit"); provided, however, that the TECO Letter of Credit shall
not be effective until the Closing shall have occurred. In the event that at
any time following the Closing, the TECO Letter of Credit shall be drawn upon,
then Purchaser shall cause the face amount of such letter of credit to be
increased, or shall cause an additional letter of credit that complies with
the terms set forth in the immediately preceding sentence and the TECO
Agreement, and that is substantially identical to the TECO Letter of Credit
obtained and delivered to Tampa Electric in connection with the Closing to be
delivered to Tampa Electric, such that the aggregate face amount of all
letters of credit delivered to and held by Tampa Electric (after giving effect
to any draws on letters of credit previously delivered to Tampa Electric by or
on behalf of Purchaser) under the TECO Agreement shall be no less than
$6,000,000.

  

  

(c) From and after the date hereof and prior to the Closing, Purchaser and
Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, subject (in the
case of Seller and its Affiliates) to the terms set forth in the last sentence
of Section 5.8, use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
from Tampa Electric and deliver to Seller a full and unconditional release,
effective as of the Closing, of all of the obligations and liabilities of
Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) with
respect to (i) the TECO Letter of Credit (including any obligation to increase
the face amount thereof or deliver a supplemental letter of credit), or (ii)
the obligations and liabilities of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof
pursuant to the TECO Agreement, including any obligation of Seller to cause
the Company and its Subsidiaries to perform their respective obligations
thereunder or be liable to Tampa Electric for any breach or non-compliance by
the Company or any Subsidiary thereof with the terms set forth therein (which
release shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to Seller) (the "TECO
Release"). In furtherance of the foregoing, if requested by Seller or Tampa
Electric, Purchaser shall (or shall cause an Affiliate thereof designated by
Seller or Tampa Electric to), effective at the Closing, agree to assume and be
liable and responsible for (through the execution of a Contract containing
terms and conditions that are reasonably acceptable to Seller and Tampa
Electric) any and all of the obligations and liabilities of Seller with
respect to the TECO Letter of Credit (including any obligation to increase the
face amount thereof or deliver a supplemental letter of credit) and under the
terms of the TECO Agreement (including any obligation of Seller to cause the
Company or any Subsidiary thereof to perform their respective obligations
thereunder or be liable to Tampa Electric for any breach or non-compliance by
the Company or any Subsidiary thereof with the terms set forth therein), but
only to the extent that such obligations and liabilities relate to the Company
or any Subsidiary thereof, and specifically excluding any obligations or
liabilities of Seller under the TECO Agreement that relate to any former
Subsidiaries of Seller thereunder that are not the Company or any Subsidiary
thereof (the obligations so assumed, the "TECO Assumed Obligations"). In the
event Purchaser and Seller have not, as of the Closing, obtained the TECO
Release, (i) Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to do so
following the Closing, including by agreeing to assume (in accordance with the
terms set forth in the immediately preceding sentence) the TECO Assumed
Obligations through the execution of a Contract containing terms and
conditions that are reasonably acceptable to Seller and Tampa Electric, (ii)
Purchaser shall not permit, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries
not to permit, the TECO Agreement to be amended, supplemented, modified,
renewed or extended in a manner that increases or extends, or that is
reasonably likely to increase or extend, the obligations of Seller or any
Affiliate thereof thereunder, without the prior written consent of Seller, and
(iii) Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to,
indemnify and hold harmless each of Seller and its Affiliates (other than the
Company and its Subsidiaries) from and against any and all Losses incurred by
Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company or any Subsidiary
thereof) arising out of or relating to the TECO Letter of Credit or the
obligations or liabilities of the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to the
TECO Agreement, including in the event of any Letter of Credit Default (as
defined in the TECO Agreement) or in the event of any requirement of Seller to
reinstate the TECO Letter of Credit pursuant to the terms of the TECO
Agreement.

  

  

Section 5.12. Release of Guarantees. From and after the date hereof and prior
to the Closing, Purchaser and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, subject (in the case of Seller and its Affiliates) to the terms
set forth in the last sentence of Section 5.8, use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from each beneficiary of a Guarantee
and deliver to Seller a full and unconditional release, effective as of the
Closing, of all of the obligations and liabilities of Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Company) with respect to each such Guarantee (which
release shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to Seller and Purchaser) (the
"Guarantee Release"). In furtherance of the foregoing, if requested by Seller
or any beneficiary of a Guaranty, Purchaser shall (or shall cause an Affiliate
thereof designated by Seller or any such beneficiary to), effective at the
Closing, (a) agree to assume and be liable and responsible for (through the
execution of a Contract containing terms and conditions that are reasonably
acceptable to Seller and such beneficiary) any and all of the obligations and
liabilities of Seller or any Affiliate thereof with respect to any Guarantee,
including any obligation of Seller or any such Affiliate to cause the Company
to perform its obligations under any Contract that are guaranteed by Seller or
any Affiliate thereof and be liable to such beneficiary for any breach or non-
compliance by the Company with the terms set forth therein (the obligations so
assumed, the "Guaranteed Assumed Obligations"), and/or (b) deliver to the
beneficiary of any Guarantee such additional credit support or enhancement
(including for example a letter of credit) as such beneficiary may request in
connection with agreeing to provide a Guarantee Release. In the event
Purchaser and Seller have not, as of the Closing, obtained a Guarantee Release
with respect to each Guarantee, (i) Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to do so following the Closing, including by agreeing to
assume (in accordance with the terms set forth in the immediately preceding
sentence) the Guaranteed Assumed Obligations through the execution of a
Contract containing terms and conditions that are reasonably acceptable to
Seller and the beneficiary of the applicable Guarantee and/or delivering a
letter of credit, in each case as further provided in the immediately
preceding sentence, (ii) Purchaser shall not permit, and shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries not to permit, any Contract to which such
Guarantee relates to be amended, supplemented, modified, renewed or extended
in a manner that increases or extends, or that is reasonably likely to
increase or extend, the obligations of Seller or any Affiliate thereunder,
without the prior written consent of Seller, and (iii) Purchaser shall, and
shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, indemnify and hold harmless
each of Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) from and against any and all Losses incurred by Seller or any of
its Affiliates (other than the Company or its Subsidiaries) arising out of or
relating to any such Guarantee.

  

  

Section 5.13. Support Services. Purchaser acknowledges that the Company and
its Subsidiaries currently receive (or have received in the past) from Seller
or its Affiliates certain corporate and other services and support, including
general and administrative services, audit services, legal services, human
resources services, tax services, finance services, cash management services,
information technology services and support and insurance and facilities-
related support (collectively, the "Support Services"). Purchaser acknowledges
that, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the Support Services
shall cease as of the Closing, and all agreements and arrangements in respect
thereof shall terminate as of the Closing, with no further obligation of any
party thereto.

  

  

Section 5.14. Insurance. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that all insurance
coverage for the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Business under policies of
Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) shall
terminate as of the Closing, and no claims may be brought thereunder by
Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiaries from and after the Closing under or
with respect to any such insurance or the policies relating thereto; provided,
however, that nothing in this Section 5.13 shall in any way affect the right
of the Company or its Subsidiaries to be covered by, and make claims under,
any such policy that is an occurrence-based policy for events or circumstances
occurring with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to Closing if
permitted under such policy, provided that such claims shall be at the
Company's (or its Subsidiaries') sole cost and expense (including any
applicable retentions or deductibles in connection with such claims and any
fees or other costs or expenses incurred in connection with the collection
thereof); provided further, however, that in the event any occurrence-based
insurer shall make such payment on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary
thereof to Seller or an Affiliate of Seller (other than the Company or any
Subsidiary thereof) in connection with such pre-Closing losses, Seller shall
promptly remit such occurrence-based policy recoveries, if applicable, to the
Company or the applicable Subsidiary thereof.

  

  

Section 5.15. Financing.

  

  

(a) Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Debt
Financing as promptly as practicable on the terms and conditions described in
the Commitment Letter, including using commercially reasonable efforts to seek
to enforce (including through litigation) its rights under the Commitment
Letter in the event of a breach thereof by the Debt Financing Sources
thereunder, and using commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) maintain in
effect the Commitment Letter, (ii) negotiate definitive agreements with
respect to the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions contained in the
Commitment Letter so that such agreements are in effect as promptly as
practicable but in any event no later than the Closing, (iii) satisfy on a
timely basis all conditions applicable to Purchaser in the Commitment Letter
that are within its control (including by consummating the Debt Financing
pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letter), (iv) at the request of Seller
and if a decree of specific performance by a court of competent jurisdiction
is granted ordering the consummation of the Closing pursuant to Section 9.14
of this Agreement, fully enforce the obligations of the lenders (and the
rights of Purchaser) under the Commitment Letter, including the filing of one
or more lawsuits against the committing parties to fully enforce such lender's
obligations (and the rights of Purchaser) thereunder, and (v) cause the
lenders and any other persons providing the Debt Financing under the
Commitment Letter to fund the Debt Financing at Closing. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Purchaser shall give Seller prompt notice of (i)
any breach by any party to the Commitment Letter of which Purchaser become
aware, (ii) the receipt of any written notice or other written communication
from any Debt Financing Source with respect to any breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to the Commitment Letter, (iii) any
material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the
Commitment Letter or any definitive documents related to the Debt Financing
and (iv) if for any reason Purchaser believes in good faith that it will not
be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms, in
the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Commitment Letter or the
definitive documents relating thereto. As soon as reasonably practicable, but
in any event within five (5) days of the date Seller delivers Purchaser a
written request, Purchaser shall provide any information reasonably requested
by Seller relating to the circumstances in the foregoing sentence.

  

  

(b) Purchaser shall not release or consent to the termination of the
obligations of the lenders under the Commitment Letter, except for assignments
and replacements of an individual lender under the terms of or in connection
with the syndication of the Debt Financing or as otherwise expressly
contemplated by the Commitment Letter, provided that such assignments or
replacements would not prevent, delay or impair the availability of the Debt
Financing under the Commitment Letter or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. Purchaser
shall promptly deliver to Seller copies of any such amendment, modification or
replacement. Subject to the foregoing limitations, in the event that any
portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable in the manner or from the
sources contemplated in the Commitment Letter, Purchaser shall (i) promptly
notify Seller of such unavailability and the reasons therefor and (ii) use its
commercially reasonable efforts to arrange and obtain, and to negotiate and
enter into definitive agreements with respect to, alternative financing from
alternative financial institutions in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents upon conditions not materially less favorable to Purchaser than
those in the Commitment Letter (including as to economic terms, flex
provisions and funding conditions), as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event (and in any event no later than the Closing).
Purchaser shall furnish Seller with complete, correct and executed copies of
any definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (including any
alternative financing agreement) promptly upon their execution and shall keep
Seller reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange and
consummate the Debt Financing.

  

  

(c) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that neither the obtaining of the Debt
Financing or any alternative financing is a condition to the Closing, and
without limiting the terms set forth in Section 7.2, reaffirms its obligation
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and
independently of the availability of the Debt Financing or any alternative
financing, subject to the applicable conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and
Section 6.2.

  

  

Section 5.16. Financing Assistance.

  

  

(a) In the period between the date hereof and the Closing Date, upon the
request of Purchaser, Seller shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries, and
their respective officers, directors, managers, employees, accountants,
consultants, legal counsel, agents and other representatives, at Purchaser's
sole expense, to cooperate in connection with the arrangement and obtaining of
the Debt Financing, including (i) providing to Purchaser and the Debt
Financing Sources from time to time information regarding the Company and its
industry reasonably requested by them, to the extent such information is
reasonably available to the Company and reasonably necessary in order to
consummate the arrangement and the borrowings of loans contemplated by the
Debt Financing, (ii) participating in a reasonable number of meetings,
presentations and due diligence sessions with prospective lenders and sessions
with rating agencies in connection with the Debt Financing, (iii) assisting
with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, offering
and syndication documents, business projections and similar marketing
documents reasonably and customarily required in connection with the Debt
Financing (provided, that Purchaser shall be solely responsible for the
preparation of any pro forma financial statements contained therein), (iv)
executing and delivering, as of the Closing, any guarantees, pledge and
security documents, other definitive financing documents, or other
certificates or documents contemplated by the Commitment Letter and hedging
agreements as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser and otherwise
reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral. However, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement (including this Section
5.16), nothing in this Agreement shall require any cooperation to the extent
that it would (i) require (A) Seller to waive or amend any terms of this
Agreement, (B) the board of directors (or similar managing body) of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action, or (C) the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or representatives, as applicable, to agree to pay any
commitment, financing or other fees or reimburse any expenses prior to the
Closing or to approve the execution or delivery of any document or certificate
in connection with the Debt Financing (and no officer of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries who is not an officer of the Company upon the Closing shall
be obligated to execute or deliver any document or certificate in connection
with the Debt Financing and no counsel for the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be obligated to deliver any opinion in
connection with the Debt Financing), (ii) require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to obtain or provide audited financial statements for any period,
(iii) unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business or operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, (iv) require the Company or its Subsidiaries to
take any action that would conflict with or violate the organizational
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Laws or would
result in a violation or breach of, or default under, any contract or
agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or (v)
result in any officer or director of the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries incurring any personal liability with respect to any matters
relating to the Debt Financing; and provided, further, that, irrespective of
the above, no obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any
certificate, document or instrument (other than the authorization letters
referred to above) shall be effective until the Closing and neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action under
any certificate, document or instrument that is not contingent upon the
Closing (including entry into any agreement that is effective before the
Closing) or that would be effective prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 5.16 to the contrary, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee
or incur any other liability or commitment in connection with the Debt
Financing prior to the Closing.

  

  

(b) Purchaser shall, promptly upon request by Seller or the Company or
promptly after termination of this Agreement, reimburse Seller for all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and costs incurred by Seller, the Company
and their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the performance of
Seller's obligations under this Section 5.16. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall not, prior to the Closing, be obligated to incur
any liability or commitment to any person under any financing (including the
Debt Financing) that Purchaser may raise in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents or any
cooperation provided by this Section 5.16 and that Purchaser shall indemnify
and hold harmless Seller, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries and
their respective officers, directors, employees, Affiliates and/or agents from
an against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with the Debt Financing and any
information utilized in connection therewith. .

  

  

Section 5.17. Notice by Seller. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
promptly provide notice to Purchaser of any fact or condition which becomes
known to Seller that, absent cure, would be reasonably likely to prevent the
condition to Closing set forth in Section 6.2(a) from being satisfied;
provided, however, that (i) the failure to provide any such notice shall not
affect (A) the obligations of the parties to effect the Closing if all of the
conditions to Closing set forth in this Agreement shall have been satisfied or
waived (assuming, for these purposes, that the failure to provide such notice
had not occurred) (B) the rights of the parties to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with Section 7.1 or (C) any of the indemnification provisions under
Article VIII, and (ii) no such notice will be deemed to have cured any breach
of any representation or warranty or affect any right or remedy of Purchaser
under this Agreement.

  

  

Section 5.18. Notice by Purchaser. Prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
promptly provide notice to Seller of any fact or condition which becomes known
to Purchaser that, absent cure, would be reasonably likely to prevent the
condition to Closing set forth in Section 6.3(a) from being satisfied;
provided, however, that (i) the failure to provide any such notice shall not
affect (A) the obligations of the parties to effect the Closing if all of the
conditions to Closing set forth in this Agreement shall have been satisfied or
waived (assuming, for these purposes, that the failure to provide such notice
had not occurred) (B) the rights of the parties to terminate this Agreement in
Section 7.1 or (C) any of the indemnification provisions under Article VIII,
and (ii) no such notice will be deemed to have cured any breach of any
representation or warranty or affect any right or remedy of Seller under this
Agreement.

  

  

Section 5.19. Exclusivity.

  

  

(a) During the period (the "Exclusivity Period") beginning on the date hereof
and terminating on the Closing Date, Seller will negotiate exclusively with
Parent, Purchaser and their respective Representatives with respect to the
sale of the Interests (or any similar transaction which may result in a change
of control or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Company or its
Subsidiaries) and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents, and Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates
(and its and their respective Subsidiaries, directors, officers, agents and
other Representatives) not to, directly or indirectly (i) knowingly solicit,
initiate, facilitate or encourage (including by furnishing information) the
making by any Person (other than Parent, Purchaser and their respective
Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue,
participate or engage in or otherwise be associated with discussions or
negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal or furnish or disclose or
provide access to information to any Person (other than Parent, Purchaser and
its Representatives) with respect to or in furtherance of any Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) execute or enter into any contract or any other arrangement
(including any term sheet, letter of intent or similar document, whether or
not binding) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse
or recommend or propose to approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition
Proposal or any contract or other arrangement relating to any Acquisition
Proposal, or (v) resolve, authorize or propose to agree to do any of the
foregoing actions referenced in this Section 5.19(a)(i)-(iv); provided,
however, that Purchaser hereby acknowledges that prior to the date of this
Agreement, Seller has provided information relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries and the Business and has afforded access to, and engaged in
discussions with, other Persons in connection with Acquisition Proposals and
that such information, access and discussions could reasonably enable another
Person to form a basis for an Acquisition Proposal without any breach by
Seller of this Section 5.19(a). Seller further agrees, and agrees to cause its
Affiliates (and its and their respective subsidiaries, directors, officers,
agents and other Representatives) (x) to immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with all other Persons
conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal,
and (y) not to grant any waiver or release under any confidentiality,
standstill or similar contract or arrangement with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 5.19(a), at any time during
the Exclusivity Period, the governing body of Seller shall be permitted to
authorize, cause or permit Seller to (i) engage in those actions described in
Section 5.19(a)(i)-(v), and (ii) terminate this Agreement; provided that (1)
such actions are taken solely in response to a Superior Offer, (2) governing
body of Seller, acting in good faith (after consultation with and taking into
account the advice of its outside counsel) determines that it is required to
engage in discussions with the applicable third party concerning such Superior
Offer in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to Seller and the Company
or their respective members under applicable Law, and (3) such actions are
conditioned on the execution of a customary letter of intent or similar
agreement with such Person. Seller represents that neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, agents and other Representatives
is currently party to or bound by any agreement with respect to any such
transaction described in this Section 5.19(b)(ii)(1)-(3).

  

  

(c) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Seller pursuant to Section
5.19(b), then Seller shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Purchaser a fee (in
United States currency) in an amount equal to 7.5% of the Base Purchase Price
(the "Termination Fee"). The Termination Fee shall be paid by Seller
concurrently with the termination of this Agreement by wire transfer of
immediately available cash funds to an account designated by Purchaser.
Purchaser's right to receive payment of the Termination Fee from Seller
pursuant to this Section 5.19 (subject to the terms and conditions of this
Section 5.19) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Purchaser against
Seller or any of its members, partners, members, directors, officers, or
agents for any loss, damage or injury suffered as a result of the failure of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents to be consummated.

  

  

Section 5.20. Subject Vessel. Between the date hereof and the Closing, Seller
or its Affiliates shall consummate (or shall have caused the consummation of,
as applicable) a transfer (whether by sale, dividend or otherwise) of the
Subject Vessel from the Company to Seller or one of its Affiliates (other than
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries). If, following the Closing (and
assuming satisfaction of the first sentence of this Section 5.20), Seller
proposes to sell the Subject Vessel for cash to any Person that is primarily
engaged, or any of whose Affiliates are primarily engaged, in the business of
operating any bulk cargo marine transportation business in the Gulf of Mexico
that is competitive with the business operated by the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the Closing (a "Competitive Party"), then at the time the
Seller determines appropriate Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a notice of
the proposed sale (the "ROFR Notice") in a manner provided in Section 9.2,
which ROFR Notice shall include the material terms and conditions of such
proposed transfer and the aggregate purchase price to be paid in such proposed
sale. Purchaser may exercise its right of first refusal pursuant to this
Section 5.20 at any time prior to the expiration of the five day period
following the date of delivery of the ROFR Notice to the Purchaser (the "Offer
Period") by delivery of written notice (the "ROFR Exercise Notice") thereof to
the Seller, which notice shall set forth the proposed closing date for the
purchase of the Subject Vessel, which proposed closing date shall not be
earlier than five (5) Business Days and not later than ten (10) Business Days
following the delivery of the ROFR Exercise Notice. If, upon the expiration of
the Offer Period, the Purchaser has not delivered a ROFR Exercise Notice to
Seller it shall be deemed to have declined its right to acquire the Subject
Vessel and Seller shall be free to sell the Subject Vessel to any Person so
long as the purchase price paid by such Person is not less than ninety percent
(90%) of the purchase price set forth in the ROFR Notice. The delivery of a
ROFR Exercise Notice shall constitute an irrevocable offer to purchase the
Subject Vessel on the terms described in the ROFR Notice.

Section 7.1. Termination of Agreement. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the Closing Date as follows:

  

  

(a) by mutual written consent of Purchaser and Seller;

  

  

(b) by the written notice of Seller to Purchaser if the Closing shall not have
occurred on or before December 31, 2012 (such date, the "Initial Outside
Date", and the Initial Outside Date as it may be extended in accordance with
the terms set forth in this Section 7.1(b), the "Outside Date"); provided,
however, that (i) if the condition to Closing set forth in Section 6.1(b)
shall not have been satisfied on or before the Initial Outside Date, but all
other conditions set forth in Article VI hereof would be satisfied if the
Closing Date were to occur on the Initial Outside Date, then the Initial

extended until the three (3) month anniversary of the Initial Outside Date
(or, if such day is not a Business Day, on the first Business Day thereafter),
and (ii) if the condition to Closing set forth in Section 6.1(b) shall not

upon the mutual written agreement of Purchaser and Seller, it being understood
that, without the prior written consent of Purchaser and Seller, in no event
shall the Outside Date be extended to a date that is later than the thirteen
(13) month anniversary of the date of this Agreement (or, if such day is not a
Business Day, the first Business Day thereafter); provided, however, that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b) shall not be
available to Seller if the failure of Seller to fulfill or perform any
obligation, agreement or covenant under this Agreement shall have been the
cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or
prior to such date;

  

  

(c) by the written notice of Purchaser to Seller if the Closing shall not have
occurred on or before the Outside Date; provided, however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(c) shall not be available to
Purchaser if the failure of Purchaser to fulfill or perform any obligation,
agreement or covenant under this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or
shall have resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to
such date;

  

  

(d) by Seller or Purchaser, by written notice to the other, if there shall be
a Law in effect making illegal the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, or there shall be a final and non-appealable Governmental
Order in effect prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this Section 7.1(d) shall not be available to such party if the failure of
such party to fulfill or perform any obligation, agreement or covenant under
this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, such
Law or Governmental Order;

  

  

(e) by Purchaser if there shall have been (x) a breach of any of the
representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Article III of this
Agreement (and such breach has not been waived by Purchaser), which breach
would cause the condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) not to be satisfied, or
(y) a breach of any of the covenants or agreements of Seller set forth in this
Agreement (and such breach has not been waived by Purchaser), which breach
would cause the condition set forth in Section 6.2(b) not to be satisfied, but
only (in the case of clauses (x) and (y) immediately above), if such breach is
not cured on or before the earlier to occur of (1) thirty (30) days after
receipt by Seller of written notice thereof from Purchaser, and (2) the
Outside Date;

  

  

(f) by Seller if (i) (A) Purchaser has failed to consummate the Closing when
required pursuant to Section 2.2 of this Agreement, (B) Seller has provided
Purchaser with written notice of such failure and (C) Purchaser has failed to
consummate the Closing within two (2) Business Days of receipt of such notice
described in the immediately preceding clause (B), (ii) there shall have been
(x) a breach of any of the representations and warranties of Purchaser set
forth in Article IV of this Agreement (and such breach has not been waived by
Seller), which breach would cause the condition set forth in Section 6.3(a)
not to be satisfied, or (y) a breach of any of the covenants or agreements on
the part of Purchaser set forth in this Agreement (and such breach has not
been waived by Seller), which breach would cause the condition set forth in
Section 6.3(b) not to be satisfied, but only (in the case of clauses (x) and
(y) immediately above), if such breach is not cured on or before the earlier
to occur of (1) thirty (30) days after receipt by Purchaser of written notice
thereof from Seller, and (2) the Outside Date, or (iii) if (A) Purchaser has
failed to deposit an additional $5,550,000 in immediately available funds into
the Signing Date Escrow Account if and to the extent required by the second
sentence of Section 2.4 hereof, (B) Seller has provided Purchaser with written
notice of such failure and (C) Purchaser has failed to make such deposit
within two (2) Business Days of receipt of such notice described in the
immediately preceding clause (B); or

  

  

(g) by Seller pursuant to and in accordance with Section 5.19(b).

  

  

Section 7.2. Effect of Termination.

  

  

(a) In the event of the valid termination of this Agreement by any party
pursuant to Section 7.1 (other than Section 7.1(a)), written notice thereof
shall forthwith be given by the terminating party to the other party, and this
Agreement shall thereupon terminate and become void and have no effect, the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be abandoned without further action by
the parties and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of
Seller or Purchaser to any other party hereto; provided, however, that (i)
Section 5.3, Section 5.4, Section 5.16(b), this Section 7.2 and Article IX and
the Confidentiality Agreement shall expressly survive the termination of this
Agreement, (ii) termination of this Agreement shall have no effect on the
Parent Guarantee, which shall remain in full force and effect with respect to
Purchaser's obligations and liabilities hereunder following the termination of
this Agreement, and (iii) no party hereto shall be relieved of any liability
or obligation arising from, out of or in connection with any willful breach of
this Agreement by such party prior to the time of such termination. For
purposes of this Agreement, "willful breach" shall mean a breach that is a
consequence of an omission by, or act undertaken by or caused by, the
breaching party with the knowledge that the omission or taking or causing of
such act would, or would reasonably be expected to, cause a breach of this
Agreement.

  

  

(b) Purchaser agrees that, if this Agreement shall have been validly
terminated by Seller pursuant to Section 7.1(f)(i) or Section 7.1(f)(iii),
then Purchaser shall pay to Seller a fee of $11,100,000 (the "Reverse
Termination Fee"), plus any expenses due pursuant to Section 5.16(b), such
payment to be effected by the delivery of written instructions (which
instructions shall be delivered within three Business Days (3) following the
delivery of notice of termination under this Agreement) by all necessary
parties to the Escrow Agent under the Signing Date Escrow Agreement directing
the Escrow Agent to deliver the entire Signing Date Escrow Amount to Seller by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as may be
designated by Seller, and if any further amounts are owed to Seller pursuant
to this Section 7.2(b) (after giving effect to any disbursements made pursuant
to the Signing Date Escrow Agreement), such amounts shall be paid by Purchaser
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as may be
designated by Seller. The parties acknowledge and agree that the payment of
the Reverse Termination Fee shall not limit or otherwise affect any other
rights or remedies of Seller (whether arising under or pursuant to this
Agreement, at law, in equity or otherwise) as a result of the willful breach
of this Agreement by Parent and/or Purchaser. Without limiting the foregoing,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Seller may pursue
the remedies permitted pursuant to and in accordance with Section 9.14.

  

  

(c) Each of Purchaser and Seller acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 7.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Subject to Seller's rights pursuant to Section 9.14, and without
limiting the obligations and liabilities under the Confidentiality Agreement
and except in the case of the willful breach of this Agreement or the
Transaction Documents by Parent and/or Purchaser, Seller's right to receive
payment of the Reverse Termination Fee from Purchaser pursuant to this Section
7.2 (or from Parent pursuant to the Parent Guarantee) shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of Seller against Purchaser or any of its stockholders,
partners, members, directors, officers, Debt Financing Sources or agents for
any loss, damage or injury suffered as a result of the failure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents to be consummated, and upon receipt of the Reverse Termination Fee
in accordance with this Section 7.2 (and except in the case of willful breach
of this Agreement or any breach of the Confidentiality Agreement), none of
Purchaser, Parent or any of their respective stockholders, partners, members,
directors, officers or agents, or any of its Affiliates or any Debt Financing
Source shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby; provided, that, upon such payment, the
provisions of this Section 7.2 and Article IX shall remain in full force and
effect and survive any termination of this Agreement in accordance with their
terms.

  

  

Section 7.3. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by a
written agreement executed and delivered by duly authorized officers of the
parties hereto. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except as
provided in the immediately preceding sentence and any purported amendment
effected in a manner which does not comply with this Section 7.3 shall be
void.

  

  

Section 7.4. Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Closing, Seller may
(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of Purchaser contained herein, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of Purchaser contained herein or in any
document, certificate or writing delivered by Purchaser pursuant hereto, or
(c) waive compliance by Purchaser with any of the agreements or conditions
contained herein. At any time prior to the Closing, Purchaser may (i) extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Seller
contained herein, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of Seller contained herein or in any document, certificate or
writing delivered by Seller pursuant hereto, or (iii) waive compliance by
Seller with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of either party hereto to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of
such party. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, the
failure of any party to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not
constitute a waiver of such rights.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

ARTICLE VIII.

  

  


 

  

  

INDEMNIFICATION

  

  

Section 8.1. Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. The
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of Seller contained in
this Agreement or in the certificate delivered by Seller pursuant to Section
6.2(d) shall survive the Closing until the twelve (12) month anniversary of
the Closing Date (the "Release Date"). The representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements of Purchaser contained in this Agreement or in the
certificate delivered by Purchaser pursuant to Section 6.3(c) shall survive
the Closing until the Release Date. Notwithstanding anything contained herein
to the contrary, the parties hereto hereby acknowledge and agree that any
claim (and only such claim, but not the related representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements) for indemnification in respect of any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein that is made
in writing in accordance with the terms of this Article VIII on or prior to
the applicable Release Date or survival date as specified herein shall survive
the Release Date or survival date as specified herein (or, if applicable, such
later time) until the final resolution thereof.

  

  

Section 8.2. General Indemnification.

  

  

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this Article VIII, from and after the
Closing, Purchaser and its Affiliates, including, following the Closing, the
Company and its Subsidiaries (each, a "Purchaser Indemnitee"), shall be
indemnified and held harmless solely out of the Closing Escrow Amount from any
Losses suffered or paid by any Purchaser Indemnitee (regardless of whether or
not such Losses relate to any third party claim) as a result or arising out of
(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in Article III
or the certificate delivered by Seller pursuant to Section 6.2(d), or (ii) any
breach by Seller of any of the covenants or agreements made by Seller in this
Agreement or the Transaction Documents that are required to be performed by
Seller after the Closing.

  

  

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Article VIII, from and after the
Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall after the Closing, cause the Company to,
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates (each, a "Seller
Indemnitee") from any Losses suffered or paid by any Seller Indemnitee
(regardless of whether or not such Losses relate to any third party claim) as
a result or arising out of (i) any breach of any representation or warranty
made by Purchaser in Article IV or in the certificate delivered by Purchaser
pursuant to Section 6.3(c), (ii) any breach by Purchaser of any of the
covenants or agreements made by Purchaser in this Agreement or the Transaction
Documents that are required to be performed by Purchaser after the Closing, or
(iii) any claim or Action brought or threatened to be brought against any
Seller Indemnitee at any time on or after the Closing Date relating to actions
taken by Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof, including the Company or its
Subsidiaries, from and after the Closing.

  

  

Section 8.3. Third Party Claims.

  

  

(a) If a claim, action, suit or proceeding by a Person who is not a party
hereto or an Affiliate thereof (a "Third Party Claim") is made against any
Person entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2 (an "Indemnified
Party"), and if such Person intends to seek indemnity with respect thereto
under this Article VIII, such Indemnified Party shall promptly give written
notice setting forth in reasonable detail the allegations set forth in such
Third Party Claim ("Notice of Claim") to the party hereto obligated to
indemnify such Indemnified Party (such notified party, the "Responsible
Party"); provided, however, that the failure to give such Notice of Claim
shall not relieve the Responsible Party of its obligations hereunder, except
to the extent that the Responsible Party is actually prejudiced thereby. The
Responsible Party shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice to
assume the conduct and control, at the expense of the Responsible Party, of
the settlement or defense thereof, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate
with the Responsible Party in connection therewith; provided, however, that
the Responsible Party shall permit the Indemnified Party to participate in
such settlement or defense through counsel chosen by such Indemnified Party
(the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by such Indemnified
Party). Any such assumption of the conduct and control of the settlement or
defense shall not be deemed to be an admission by the Responsible Party that
the Third Party Claim is within the scope of the Responsible Party's
indemnification obligations hereunder and shall not be deemed an assumption of
liability and Losses by the Responsible Party with respect to such Third Party
Claim. If the Responsible Party elects not to assume the conduct and control
of the settlement or defense of such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified
Party shall (i) permit the Responsible Party to participate in such settlement
or defense through counsel chosen by such Responsible Party (the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be borne by such Responsible Party), and (ii)
otherwise defend such claim diligently, in good faith and in a commercially
reasonable manner. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
whether or not the Responsible Party shall have assumed the conduct or control
of the defense or settlement of a Third Party Claim, no Indemnified Party
shall admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge,
any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Responsible
Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.
Notwithstanding any right of the Responsible Party to assume the conduct and
control of the settlement and defense of any Third Party Claim hereunder, the
Responsible Party shall not settle any Third Party Claim, consent to the entry
of any judgment of such Third Party Claim or otherwise resolve such Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, unless the
terms of such settlement, judgment or other resolution involves solely the
payment of monetary damages that are subject to indemnification pursuant to
the terms set forth in this Article VIII; provided, however, that if the
Indemnified Party shall not consent to any settlement, compromise or other
resolution proposed by the Responsible Party, then the Responsible Party's
indemnification obligation (if any) pursuant to this Article VIII with respect
to the Third Party Claim subject thereto shall in no event exceed the amount
that would be required to be paid in such proposed settlement, compromise or
other resolution of such Third Party Claim.

  

  

(b) All of the parties hereto shall reasonably cooperate in the defense or
prosecution of any Third Party Claim in respect of which indemnity may be
sought hereunder and each of Purchaser and Seller (or a duly authorized
representative of such party) shall (and shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to) furnish such records, information and testimony, and attend
such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may
be reasonably requested in connection therewith; provided, however, that (i)
at the request of any party disclosing confidential information in connection
with such cooperation, the parties shall enter into a mutually agreeable
confidentiality agreement for such purpose, and (ii) no Person shall be
required to disclose information if the disclosure thereof would be reasonably
likely to result in the loss of the attorney-client privilege.

  

  

Section 8.4. Limitations on Indemnification. The rights of Purchaser
Indemnitees and Seller Indemnitees to indemnification pursuant to the
provisions of this Article VIII are subject to the following limitations:

  

  

(a) the Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover any Losses
pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) until the total amount of Losses which the
Purchaser Indemnitees would be entitled to recover under Section 8.2(a)(i)
with respect to any and all claims for indemnification thereunder, but for
this Section 8.4(a), exceeds $800,000 (the "Deductible"), and once the
Deductible has been exceeded, the Purchaser Indemnitees shall only be entitled
to recover Losses in excess of the Deductible; provided, however, that the
Deductible shall not apply to Losses suffered or paid by any Purchaser
Indemnitee as a result of the breach of any representation or warranty made by
Seller in Section 3.2, Section 3.3, Section 3.5(a) or Section 3.12, it being
agreed that, in such circumstances, the applicable Purchaser Indemnitee shall,
subject to the other limitations set forth in this Article VIII, be entitled
to be indemnified and held harmless from the first dollar of such Losses;

  

  

(b) the Seller Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover any Losses
pursuant to Section 8.2(b)(i) until the total amount of Losses which the
Seller Indemnitees would be entitled to recover under Section 8.2(b)(i) with
respect to any and all claims for indemnification thereunder, but for this
Section 8.4(b), exceeds the Deductible, and once the Deductible has been
exceeded, the Seller Indemnitees shall only be entitled to recover Losses in
excess of the Deductible, provided, however, that the Deductible shall not
apply to Losses suffered or paid by any Seller Indemnitee as a result of the
breach of any representation or warranty made by Purchaser in Section 4.2,
Section 4.6, Section 4.7 or Section 4.8, it being agreed that, in such
circumstances, the applicable Seller Indemnitee shall, subject to the other
limitations set forth in this Article VIII, be entitled to be indemnified and
held harmless from the first dollar of such Losses;

  

  

(c) neither the Purchaser Indemnitees nor Seller Indemnitees shall be entitled
to recover for any particular Loss (including any series of related Losses)
pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) or Section 8.2(b)(i), respectively, unless such
Loss (including any series of related Losses) equals or exceeds $10,000, and
any such Loss (including any series of related Losses) below such threshold
shall not be counted for purposes of determining whether the Deductible has
been exceeded, provided that if such Loss (including any series of related
Losses) exceeds such threshold then the applicable Purchaser Indemnitees or
the Seller Indemnitees, as the case may be, shall be entitled to recover the
full amount of such Loss (including any series of related Losses), subject to
(and limited by) the other terms set forth in this Article VIII;

  

  

(d) except in case of fraud, the sole and exclusive source of recovery in
respect of any indemnification claim made by any Purchaser Indemnitee pursuant
to this Article VIII shall be the Closing Escrow Amount, and in no event shall
(i) Seller or any Affiliate thereof or any other Person have any direct
liability or obligation in respect of any such indemnification claim, or (ii)
the Purchaser Indemnitees be entitled to recover any Losses in respect of any
indemnification claim made pursuant to this Article VIII from any source other
than the Closing Escrow Account or in an aggregate amount in excess of the
Closing Escrow Amount on deposit in the Closing Escrow Account as of any
applicable date of determination, it being agreed that on the date (if any)
that the Closing Escrow Amount is reduced to zero (0) for any reason
(including due to the release of the Closing Escrow Amount from the Closing
Escrow Account in accordance with the terms of the Closing Escrow Agreement),
the Purchaser Indemnitees shall have no further rights to indemnification
pursuant to this Article VIII;

  

  

(e) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or
otherwise, the Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to be indemnified
or held harmless under this Agreement (including pursuant to a claim of breach
of representation or warranty) for any Taxes (or Losses relating to Taxes) (i)
incurred in any tax period other than any tax period ending on or before the
Closing Date, (ii) attributable or relating to transactions outside of the
ordinary course of business that occur on the Closing Date after the Closing
and not contemplated by this Agreement or to actions related to debt incurred
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii)
which are Transfer Taxes for which Purchaser is responsible pursuant to
Section 9.4, or (iv) for the existence or non-existence of any Tax attribute;

  

  

(f) the maximum Losses indemnifiable pursuant to Section 8.2(b) shall be an
amount equal to $6,660,000, except in the case of a breach of any of the
covenants set forth in Sections 5.10, 5.11 and 5.12, with respect to which the
limitation on liability set forth in this clause (f) shall not apply;

  

  

(g) the amount of any and all Losses shall be determined net of (i) any
amounts recovered by the Purchaser Indemnitees or Seller Indemnitees, as
applicable, under insurance policies or from other collateral sources (such as
contractual indemnities of any Person which are contained outside of this
Agreement) with respect to such Losses, and (ii) any Tax benefits realizable
with respect to such Losses;

  

  

(h) the Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Article VIII for any Loss to the extent that such Loss was
included in the computation of Net Working Capital; and

  

  

(i) in any case where a Purchaser Indemnitee recovers, under insurance
policies or from other collateral sources, any amount in respect of a matter
for which such Purchaser Indemnitee was indemnified pursuant to this Article
VIII, such Purchaser Indemnitee shall promptly pay over to the Escrow Agent
for re-inclusion in the Closing Escrow Account the amount so recovered (after
deducting therefrom the amount of any reasonable out-of-pocket, third-party
expenses incurred by such Purchaser Indemnitee in procuring such recovery),
but not in excess of the sum of (A) any amount previously so paid out of the
Closing Escrow Amount to or on behalf of such Purchaser Indemnitee in respect
of such matter and (B) any amount expended by Seller or any Seller Indemnitee
in pursuing or defending any claim arising out of such matter; provided,
however, that if such recovery is made after the Release Date, such amounts
shall be paid directly to Seller; provided further, however, that if, as of
the Release Date, there shall be claims pending against the Escrow Amount,
then only the amount that is so recovered that is in excess of the aggregate
amount of all such pending claims shall be paid to Seller and the balance
shall promptly paid over to the Escrow Agent for re-inclusion in the Closing
Escrow Account in accordance with the terms set forth herein.

  

  

Section 8.5. Treatment of Indemnity Payments. All payments made out of the
Escrow Amount to or for the benefit of Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to this
Article VIII shall be treated as adjustments to the Closing Consideration for
Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law, and such agreed treatment
shall govern for purposes of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 8.6. Exclusive Remedy. Without limitation of any rights of Seller or
any Affiliate thereof under the Parent Guarantee, except for the right of a
party hereto to pursue specific performance pursuant to Section 9.14 (and
without limitation of any such right) and subject to and without limitation of
the rights of the parties pursuant to Article II, from and after the Closing
the rights to indemnification (if any) set forth in this Article VIII shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties in respect of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement (including in
respect of any breach thereof) or otherwise relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or any other matter relating to any of the
Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing, the operation of their
respective businesses prior to the Closing, or any other transaction or state
of facts involving the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing,
except for such Actions against the other party for fraud or willful breach of
this Agreement.

THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE

Section 9.13. Jurisdiction and Venue. Each of the parties hereto (a) submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in
Delaware, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) agrees that all claims
in respect of such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined
exclusively in any such court, and (c) agrees not to bring any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other court.
Each of the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety
or other security that might be required of the other party with respect
thereto. Each party hereto agrees that service of summons and complaint or any
other process that might be served in any action or proceeding may be made on
such party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be
served at the address of the party and in the manner provided for the giving
of notices in Section 9.2. Nothing in this Section 9.13, however, shall affect
the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by

action or proceeding so brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each of the
parties agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the
Debt Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, but not limited to any
dispute arising out of or reliant in any way to the Commitment Letter or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than the federal and New York State
courts located in the City of New York, Borough of Manhattan (and appellate
courts thereof).

  

  

Section 9.14. Specific Performance.

  

  

(a) The parties hereby agree that irreparable damage for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in
the event that any provision of this Agreement or any of the Transaction
Documents (including failing to take such actions as are required of it
hereunder or thereunder to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby) is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is
otherwise breached or threatened to be breached. Accordingly, the parties
agree that, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance
with Section 7.1 and, to the extent applicable, subject to the specific
requirements set forth in Section 9.14(b), each party shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, or any other appropriate form of specific
performance or equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of competent
jurisdiction in accordance with Section 9.13, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled under the terms of this Agreement at
law or in equity (and each party hereby waives any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond or other collateral in connection with such
remedy).

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding Section 9.14(a) above, the right of Seller to obtain an
injunction, or other appropriate form of specific performance or equitable
relief, in each case, solely with respect to causing Purchaser to the effect
and consummate the Closing and purchase the Interests as contemplated hereby
shall be subject only to the requirements that (i) all of the conditions
precedent to Purchaser's obligations in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 have been
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions assuming a Closing would occur), (ii) Purchaser fails to complete
the Closing within the time period required by Section 2.2, (iii) the Debt
Financing (including, in the case alternative financing has been obtained in
accordance with Section 5.15 for the Debt Financing, such alternative
financing) has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Closing
shall occur, and (iv) Seller has confirmed to Purchaser in writing that if the
Debt Financing were funded, it would take such actions that are within its
control to cause the Closing to occur. For the avoidance of doubt, while
Seller may pursue both (x) an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief to the extent permitted by this Section 9.14(b) and (y) the
payment of the Reverse Termination Fee to the extent permitted by Section 7.2
(and Seller's pursuit of a remedy pursuant to this Section 9.14 shall in no
way preclude Seller from pursuing payment of the Reverse Termination Fee and
vice versa), under no circumstances shall Seller be permitted or entitled to
receive both such grant of an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief and payment of the Reverse Termination Fee.

  

  

(c) Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief when expressly
available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis that the other
parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any party seeking
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or
to enforce compliance with this Agreement when expressly available pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with any such order or injunction.

  

  

Section 9.15. Waiver of Conflicts. Recognizing that Willkie Farr and Gallagher
LLP and The Miller Law Firm, PLLC have acted as legal counsel to Seller,
certain of Seller's Affiliates and direct and indirect equity holders
(including Greenstreet Equity Partners, LLC and its Affiliates), and the
Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing, and that Willkie Farr and
Gallagher LLP and The Miller Law Firm, PLLC intend to act as legal counsel to
Seller and certain of Seller's Affiliates and direct and indirect equity
holders (including Greenstreet Equity Partners, LLC and its Affiliates) after
the Closing, Purchaser hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees to cause
its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries) to waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection with
Willkie Farr and Gallagher LLP and/or The Miller Law Firm, PLLC representing any
of Seller and/or Seller's Affiliates or direct and indirect equity holders
(including Greenstreet Equity Partners, LLC and its Affiliates) after the
Closing as such representation may relate to Purchaser, the Company and its
Subsidiaries or the transactions contemplated herein or the other Transaction
Documents. In addition, all communications involving attorney-client
confidences between any of Seller or Seller's Affiliates or direct or indirect
equity holders (including Greenstreet Equity Partners, LLC and its Affiliates)
in the course of the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Transaction Documents shall
be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to Seller and
such Affiliates and direct and indirect equity holders (and not Purchaser or
its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries)). Accordingly, neither Purchaser nor, following the Closing, the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries shall have access to any such communications,
or to the files of Willkie Farr and Gallagher LLP or The Miller Law Firm, PLLC
relating to such engagement, whether or not the Closing shall have occurred.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing,
(i) Seller and its applicable Affiliates and direct and indirect equity
holders (including Greenstreet Equity Partners, LLC and its Affiliates) shall
be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to such
engagement, and none of Purchaser or its Affiliates (including, following the
Closing, the Company and/or its Subsidiaries) shall be a holder thereof, (ii)
to the extent that files of Willkie Farr and Gallagher LLP or The Miller Law
Firm, PLLC in respect of such engagement constitute property of the client,
only Seller and/or Seller's applicable Affiliates and direct and indirect
equity holders (including Greenstreet Equity Partners, LLC and its Affiliates)
shall hold such property rights and (iii) Willkie Farr and Gallagher LLP and The
Miller Law Firm, PLLC shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any
such attorney-client communications or files to Purchaser or its Affiliates
(including, following the Closing, the Company and/or its Subsidiaries) by
reason of any attorney-client relationship between Willkie Farr and Gallagher
LLP or The Miller Law Firm, PLLC and Seller or the Company or any Subsidiary
thereof or otherwise.

  

  

Section 9.16. Time of Essence. With regard to all dates and time periods set
forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.
