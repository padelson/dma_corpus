(a) Prior to or on the date that is ninety (90) days after the Closing Date,
the Buyer Representative shall prepare and deliver or cause to be prepared and
delivered to the Seller Representative a statement (the " _Adjustment
Statement_ ") that shall set forth the Buyers good faith calculation of the
Net Working Capital as of December 31, 2012 for each of the Portfolio
Companies, based on the Company Financial Statements (updated to include
information from and including the Financial Statement Date through December
31, 2012) and consistent with the methodology for each of the Portfolio
Companies set forth on _Schedule 1.1(e)_ (collectively, the " _Closing Net
Working Capital_ "). The Buyers calculation of the Closing Net Working
Capital shall be determined in accordance with GAAP applied using the
accounting principles, practices and methods that were used in the preparation
of the Company Financial Statements and consistent with the methodology for
each of the Portfolio Companies set forth on _Schedule 1.1(e)_.

 



 

(b) After receipt of the Adjustment Statement, the Seller Representative shall
have thirty (30) days to review the factual basis, mathematical calculations
and accounting methods used therein. On or prior to the thirtieth (30th) day
after receipt of the Adjustment Statement, the Seller Representative shall
deliver written notice to the Buyer Representative specifying any disputed
items (the " _Initial Reconciliation Disputes_ ") and the basis therefor and
amount thereof. If the Seller Representative fails to notify the Buyer
Representative of any Initial Reconciliation Disputes on or prior to the
thirtieth (30th) day after receipt of the Adjustment Statement, then all
calculations and valuations of the Closing Net Working Capital set forth on
the Adjustment Statement shall be deemed accepted by the Seller Representative
and the Sellers and shall be final, binding, conclusive and nonappealable for
all purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) If the Seller Representative notifies the Buyer Representative of any
Initial Reconciliation Disputes in accordance with _Section 2.6(b)_, then the
Buyer Representative and the Seller Representative shall, over the fifteen
(15) days following the date of such notice (the " _Resolution Period_ "),
attempt in good faith to resolve the Initial Reconciliation Disputes, and any
written resolution by them as to any disputed item shall be final, binding,
conclusive and nonappealable for all purposes of this Agreement. If, at the
conclusion of the Resolution Period, the Buyer Representative and the Seller
Representative have not reached an agreement on the disputed items, then all
Initial Reconciliation Disputes then remaining in dispute (the " _Final
Reconciliation Disputes_ ") shall be submitted by the Seller Representative
and the Buyer Representative to an Independent Auditor upon which the Buyer
Representative and the Seller Representative shall reasonably agree prior to
expiration of the Resolution Period. All fees and expenses

 



      
 

 



 

relating to the work, if any, to be performed by such Independent Auditor
pursuant to this _Section 2.6_ shall be borne by the Sellers, on the one
hand, and by the Buyers, on the other hand, based upon the percentage that the
amount not ultimately awarded to such Transaction Parties by such Independent
Auditor bears to the amount actually contested by such Transaction Parties in
the Final Reconciliation Disputes. Except as provided in the preceding
sentence, all other costs and expenses incurred by the Transaction Parties in
connection with resolving any Final Reconciliation Disputes hereunder before
such Independent Auditor shall be borne by the Transaction Party incurring
such cost and expense. With respect to each disputed line item of the Closing
Net Working Capital, such Independent Auditors final determination, if not in
accordance with the position of either the Seller Representative, on the one
hand, or the Buyer Representative, on the other hand, will not be in excess of
the higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts advocated by the Buyer
Representative in its calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital or the
corresponding amounts claimed by the Seller Representative in the initial
notice of any Initial Reconciliation Disputes delivered by the Seller
Representative pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)_. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Independent Auditor shall not review any line item or make any determination
with respect to any matter other than the Final Reconciliation Disputes. The
Transaction Parties shall instruct the Independent Auditor to render its
reasoned written decision, acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator, as
soon as practicable but in no event later than sixty (60) days after its
engagement (which engagement shall be made no later than ten (10) Business
Days after the end of the Resolution Period). Such decision shall be
determined in accordance with GAAP applied using the accounting principles,
practices and methods that were used in the preparation of the Company
Financial Statements and consistent with the methodology for each of the
Portfolio Companies set forth on _Schedule 1.1(e)_ , shall be set forth in a
written statement delivered to the Seller Representative and the Buyer
Representative and shall be final, binding, conclusive and nonappealable for
all purposes hereunder. Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, no
Party may assert that any award issued by the Independent Auditor is
unenforceable because it has not been timely rendered. The term "Final
Adjustment Statement" shall mean the definitive Adjustment Statement setting
forth the final determination of the Closing Net Working Capital (the " _Final
Closing Net Working Capital_ ") and resulting from (i) agreement by the Seller
Representative and the Buyer Representative during the Resolution Period or
otherwise, (ii) a deemed acceptance pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)_ or (iii) the
determination by an Independent Auditor in accordance with this _Section
2.6(c)_.

 



 

(d) If the Final Closing Net Working Capital is greater than the Estimated
Closing Net Working Capital, then the Buyers shall pay to the Sellers an
amount equal to such excess in the manner set forth in _Section 2.6(f)_.
Conversely, if the Final Closing Net Working Capital is less than the
Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, then the Sellers shall pay to the
Buyers an amount equal to such difference in the manner set forth in _Section
2.6(f)_.

 



 

(e) For purposes of calculating Closing Net Working Capital and without
limiting the provisions of _Section 2.6(a)_ and the generality of _Section
6.2_, during the period of any dispute contemplated in this _Section 2.6_,
the Buyers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, provide the Seller
Representative and its Representatives with

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable access to the relevant Books and Records, facilities and employees,
and their accountants work papers, schedules and other supporting data during
normal business hours as may be reasonably requested by the Seller
Representative.

 



 

(f) Any payment required pursuant to _Section 2.6(d)_ shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, in Dollars, to the account or
accounts designated by the Seller Representative or the Buyer Representative,
as the case may be, within five (5) Business Days after the Final Adjustment
Statement is determined by (i) agreement by the Seller Representative and the
Buyer Representative during the Resolution Period or otherwise, (ii) a deemed
acceptance pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)_ or (iii) the determination by an
Independent Auditor in accordance with _Section 2.6(c)_. Payments due
pursuant to _Section 2.6(d)_ shall be paid to the applicable Parties together
with interest on the amount owed at a rate of interest equal to LIBOR
(determined, as applicable, at the Closing Date and at the end of each 30-day
period thereafter) plus two percent (2%) thereon (such interest accruing for
the period commencing on, and including, the Closing Date and continuing
until, and excluding, the date of payment).

Organizational Documents of any of the Buyers;

 



 

(b) violate any Law applicable to any of the Buyers or require any filing
with, consent, approval or authorization of, or notice to, any Governmental

(c) require any consent under, constitute (with or without notice or lapse of
time or both) a default under, result in any breach or violation of, or give
any Person any rights of termination, acceleration or cancellation of, any
Contract to which any of the Buyers or any of their respective assets,
properties or businesses is bound;

 



 

except, with respect to clauses (b) and (c), for such violations, defaults,
terminations, accelerations, cancellations, conflicts, breaches or defaults,
or failures to make any such filing, obtain any such consent, approval or
authorization, or provide any such notice, which would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
ability of any of the Buyers to perform its obligations hereunder or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Financial Ability; Solvency_. At Closing, the Buyers will have
sufficient immediately available funds to pay in cash the amount of the
Purchase Price and to consummate all of the transactions contemplated to occur
at Closing.

 



 

Section 5.5 _Investment Representation_.

 



 

(a) The Buyers are acquiring the Interests for their own account as an
investment and not with a view towards any unlawful public distribution
thereof, including to sell, transfer or otherwise distribute all or any part
thereof to any other Person in any transaction that would constitute a
"distribution" within the meaning of the Securities Act. The Buyers
acknowledge that they can bear the economic risk of their investment in the
Interests, and are capable of evaluating the merits and risks or an investment
in all of the Interests. The Buyers understand and acknowledge that neither
the offer nor sale of the Interests has or will have been registered pursuant
to the Securities Act or any applicable state securities Laws or any other
applicable securities Laws, that all of the Interests will be characterized as
"restricted securities" under federal securities Laws and that, under such
Laws and applicable regulations, none of the Interests can be sold or
otherwise disposed of without registration under the Securities Act or an
exemption thereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Each of the Buyers acknowledges that (i) it has been afforded access to
and the opportunity to inspect the Facilities and other due diligence items
made available by the Sellers with respect to the Portfolio Companies, (ii) it
has received materials that it deems necessary to make its determination
whether to proceed with the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) it is

Sellers or any Affiliate of the Sellers, whether in writing or orally, other
than the express representations and warranties of the Sellers in this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Broker s Fees_. No broker, finder, investment banker or other
Person is entitled to any brokerage fee, finders fee or other commission in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of any of the Buyers or any of their
Affiliates.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Litigation_. There is no Litigation pending or, to the Knowledge
of any of the Buyers, threatened, that seeks to prevent the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or that would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
ability of each of the Buyers to perform its obligations hereunder or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Regulatory Status_. The Buyers are not public utility holding
companies within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005
or, if the Buyers are public utility holding companies, each of the Buyers is
a public utility holding company solely by virtue of its ownership in exempt
wholesale generators, foreign utility companies or qualifying facilities. The
Buyers are not public utilities within the meaning of the Federal Power Act.

 



 

Section 5.9 _HSR Act Matters_. The Ultimate Parent Entities (UPEs) of the
Buyers, as defined under 16 C.F.R. § 801.1(a)(3), which were newly formed for
purposes of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, do not satisfy
the thresholds described in 15 U.S.C. § 18a(a)(2)(B)(ii).

terminated pursuant to Section 10.1, each of the Sellers shall afford (and
shall cause their Affiliates and the Portfolio Companies to afford) to the
Buyers and their authorized Representatives reasonable access, during normal
business hours, to the properties (including the Facilities), books, contracts
and records of the Sellers and the Portfolio Companies with respect to the
Business, and to the appropriate officers and employees of the Sellers and
their Affiliates, in each case, as reasonably requested by the Buyer
Representative; _provided_ , _however_ , that such access shall only be upon
reasonable advance written notice to the Seller Representative and shall not
unreasonably disrupt personnel or operations of the Business and shall be at
the Buyers sole cost and expense and shall not include any invasive sampling
of any environmental media without the prior written consent of the Seller

or delayed. During the Interim Period, each of the Buyers and each of the
Sellers shall cooperate to allow the Buyers and their authorized
Representatives to visit the Facilities during normal business hours and
confirm the presence of the spare parts and equipment at the Facilities.
Knowledge acquired by the Buyers in exercising their right to access pursuant
to this _Section 6.2_ shall not affect the Buyers right to claim
indemnification in accordance with _Section 9.2(a)(i)_. To the extent the
Buyers, in exercising their rights of access pursuant to this _Section 6.2_,
obtain any third-party reports in connection with any invasive sampling, the
Buyers shall promptly provide copies of such reports to the Seller
Representative.

 



 

(b) The Buyers shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller

Indemnified Parties, as a result of, in respect of, or arising out of any
injury to any Person or property resulting from or relating to the activities
of the Buyer Representative or its Representatives under this _Section 6.2_,
other than Losses resulting from or arising out of the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of such Seller Indemnified Party or the discovery of
conditions or defects by the Seller Indemnified Parties that already existed
on or with respect to the assets or properties of the Portfolio Companies at
the time of access by the Buyers (excluding any exacerbation of any such
condition or defect caused by any of the Buyers or their Representatives).

 



     

 



 

Section 6.3 _Confidentiality; Public Announcements_.

 



 

(a) The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are hereby incorporated by
reference, and subject to _Section 6.3(b)_ and _Section 6.3(c)_ of this
Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms until the Closing, when it shall be
automatically terminated. From and after the Closing, each of the Sellers
shall, and shall cause each of their Affiliates to, (i) treat and hold as
confidential any information concerning the business and affairs (including
know-how and trade secrets) of the Portfolio Companies (the " _Confidential
Information_ "), except (A) as expressly permitted hereunder, (B) to the
extent such information comes into the public domain after the Closing through
no fault of any of the Sellers, any of their Affiliates or any Person to whom
any of the Sellers released or disclosed such information, or (C) to the
extent such information was or becomes available to any of the Sellers or any
of their Affiliates after the Closing Date on a non-confidential basis from a
source other than one of the Portfolio Companies or any of the Buyers or their
Affiliates, (ii) refrain from using any of the Confidential Information other
than to prepare Taxes and pursue rights under this Agreement, and (iii)
deliver promptly to the Buyer Representative or destroy, at the request and
option of the Buyer Representative, all tangible embodiments of the
Confidential Information that are in the possession or under the control of
any of the Sellers or any of their Affiliates, and shall certify such delivery
or destruction upon request in a written certificate given by an officer of
each of the Sellers. Each of the Sellers and their Affiliates acknowledges and
agrees that the Confidential Information is the property of the Portfolio
Companies; _provided_ that the Sellers may retain one copy of the Confidential
Information that it shall treat as confidential pursuant to the terms of this
_Section 6.3_. In the event that any of the Sellers or their Affiliates is
requested or required (by oral question or request for information or
documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil
investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Confidential
Information, such Person shall notify the Buyer Representative promptly of the
request or requirement so that the Buyer Representative may seek an
appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this
_Section 6.3_. If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a
waiver hereunder, such Person is, on the advice of counsel, compelled to
disclose any Confidential Information to any Governmental Authority or else
stand liable for contempt, such Person may disclose such Confidential
Information to the tribunal; _provided_ that the Sellers shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at the expense and request of the
Buyers or the Portfolio Companies, an order or other assurance that
confidential treatment shall be accorded to such portion of the Confidential
Information required to be disclosed as the Buyers or the Portfolio Companies
shall designate.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Seller Representative, the Sellers, or any of
their Affiliates may file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(the " _SEC_ ") any summary or other information regarding this Agreement in
any Form 8-K or other SEC filing provided that the Seller Representative, the
Sellers or any of their Affiliates provide the Buyer Representative a
reasonable opportunity to review and provide comments thereon, and any of the
Seller Representative, the Sellers, or any of their Affiliates may, if

 



      
 

 



 

required by Form 8-K, Form 10-Q or Form 10-K, file this Agreement (and any
exhibits hereto) as an exhibit to such Form 8-K, Form 10-Q or Form 10-K, as
applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Disclosure Schedules to this
Agreement shall not be filed with the SEC unless such filing is required by
the SEC.

 



 

(c) Without giving at least five (5) Business Days prior notice and obtaining
the prior written approval of the Seller Representative (in the case of a
release or statement by any Buyer) or the Buyer Representative (in the case of
a release or statement by any Seller), no Party will issue, or permit any
agent or Affiliate of such Party to issue, any press releases or otherwise
make, cause or allow any agent or Affiliate of such Party to make, any public
statements with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby or use the name of any Seller or Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates (whether in connection with this transaction or otherwise), except
when such release or statement is deemed in good faith by the releasing Party
to be required by Applicable Law or under the applicable rules and regulations
of a stock exchange or market on which the securities of the releasing Party
or any of its Affiliates are listed. In each case to which such exception
applies, the releasing Party will use its reasonable efforts to provide a copy
of such release or statement to the non-releasing Party prior to issuing such
release or statement and incorporate any reasonable changes which are
suggested by the Buyer Representative or the Seller Representative, as
applicable.

 



 

Section 6.4 _Third-Party Approvals_. From the date hereof through the Closing
Date, each of the Buyers and the Sellers shall, and shall each cause their
respective Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all of
the Buyer Approvals, Portfolio Company Approvals and Seller Approvals, and
maintain such approvals in full force and effect once obtained.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, none
of the Buyers or any of their Affiliates shall be obligated to make any
payments or otherwise pay any consideration to any Person, to commence or
participate in any Litigation or to offer or grant any accommodation to any
Third Party in connection with any such Buyer Approvals, Portfolio Company
Approvals or Seller Approvals. Each Transaction Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the reasonable requests of
any other Transaction Party in seeking to obtain as promptly as practicable
all such Buyer Approvals, Portfolio Company Approvals or Seller Approvals.
Neither the Sellers nor the Buyers shall take, or cause to be taken, any
action that they are aware or should reasonably be aware would have the effect
of delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any such Buyer Approvals,
Portfolio Company Approvals or Seller Approvals.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Closing Conditions; Regulatory Filings_. From the date of this
Agreement until the Closing, each of the Buyers and the Sellers shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to take such actions as are necessary to expeditiously satisfy the
closing conditions set forth in this Agreement and to cause the Closing to
occur, as promptly as practicable, including to: (a) make or cause to be made
the filings required of such Transaction Party or any of its Affiliates under
any Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, all

practicable, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after the date
hereof, and to pay any fees due from it in connection with such filings, (b)
cooperate with

 



      
 

 



 

the other Parties and furnish all information in such Transaction Partys
possession or in the possession of such Transaction Partys Affiliates that is
necessary in connection with any other Transaction Partys filings, (c) use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the expiration of the notice or
waiting periods under the HSR Act, if applicable, and any other Laws with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as is
reasonably practicable, (d) promptly inform the other Parties of any
communication from or to, and any proposed understanding or agreement with,
any Governmental Authority in respect of such filings, and permit the other
Transaction Parties to review in advance any proposed communication by such
Transaction Party or its Affiliates to any Governmental Authority, (e) consult
and cooperate with the other Transaction Parties in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments and
opinions made or submitted by or on behalf of any Transaction Party or its
Affiliates in connection with all meetings, actions and proceedings with
Governmental Authorities relating to such filings, (f) comply, promptly as is
reasonably practicable, with any requests received by such Transaction Party
or any of its Affiliates for additional information, documents or other
materials in connection with such filings, (g) use commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve any objections as may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
(h) use commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any action or
proceeding instituted (or threatened in writing to be instituted) by any
Governmental Authority challenging the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as being in violation of any Law. In connection with filings to be
made and actions taken under the HSR Act, if any, the Buyers, on the one hand,
and the Sellers, on the other hand, shall each bear half of the filing fees
with respect thereto; provided, however, each Transaction Party shall bear its
own attorneys fees and expenses otherwise incurred in connection with any
filings, including as a result of any investigation or Litigation initiated by
the Department of Justice Antitrust Division or the Federal Trade Commission.
None of the Transaction Parties to this Agreement shall agree to participate
in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings,
investigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the other Transaction
Parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority, gives the other Transaction Parties the opportunity to attend and
participate at such meeting. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, (i)
prior to transmitting any material to any Governmental Authority or members of
its staff, each Transaction Party shall permit counsel for the other
Transaction Parties a reasonable opportunity to review and provide comments
thereon, and consider in good faith the views of the other Transaction Parties
in connection with, any proposed written communication to any Governmental
Authority (or members of their respective staffs) to the extent permitted by
Law, and (ii) the Transaction Parties will provide each other with copies of
all correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of their
representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of
its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that each Transaction
Party may redact from any filings provided to the other Transaction Parties
hereunder, and shall not be required to provide any materials or information
hereunder, to the extent such filings, materials or information relate solely
to the redacting Transaction Party and not to the Portfolio Companies or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement, no Transaction Party or its Affiliates will have any obligation to
resolve any objections of any Governmental Authority to the transactions
contemplated hereby, to agree to any divestitures of the assets, properties or
rights of the Portfolio Companies, such Transaction

 



      
 

 



 

Party or any Affiliates of either of the foregoing, or to enter into any "hold
separate" or similar agreements or agree to any other changes to the business,
operations or activities of such Party or any of its Affiliates.

 



 

Section 6.6 _No Solicitation_. During the Interim Period, each of the Sellers
shall not and shall cause their Affiliates and officers, directors and
employees not to, and each of the Sellers shall direct and use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause their and their Affiliates other
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit, entertain
or negotiate, enter into an agreement with respect to, or provide nonpublic or
confidential information to facilitate, any proposal or offer with respect to
any sale, redemption, disposition, reorganization, exchange, consolidation or
similar transaction directly or indirectly involving the Portfolio Companies,
or any purchase of any voting or other securities or partnership interests of
the Portfolio Companies in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions, or any combination of the foregoing.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Update Information_. Prior to the Closing, the Buyer
Representative, on the one hand, and the Seller Representative, on the other
hand, shall give the other Party prompt written notice of any development that
is reasonably likely to result in a failure of a condition to the Closing.
From time to time prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall supplement or amend
the Disclosure Schedules hereto with respect to any matter (regardless of
whether such matter arose prior to, on or after the date hereof) if necessary
to remedy any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of any of the
Sellers (each a " _Schedule Supplement_ "); _provided_ that, except as
specifically provided in this Section 6.7, no Schedule Supplement shall be
deemed to be incorporated into or to supplement, amend or modify the
Disclosure Schedules. In the event the Sellers notify the Buyer Representative
that such event, development or occurrence which is the subject of the
Schedule Supplement arose after the date of this Agreement and was not the
result of a breach of this Agreement by the Sellers and constitutes or relates
to something that has had a Material Adverse Effect, then the Buyers shall
have the right to terminate this Agreement for failure to satisfy the closing
condition set forth in _Section 8.2(b)_; _provided_ , that if the Buyers have
the right to, but do not elect to terminate this Agreement and the Closing
occurs, then (i) the Buyers shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived any
right to terminate this Agreement with respect to the matters specifically set
forth in such Schedule Supplement that constituted or otherwise had a Material
Adverse Effect, (ii) such Schedule Supplement shall be deemed to be
incorporated into and to supplement, amend and modify the Disclosure
Schedules, and (iii) the Buyers shall have irrevocably waived their rights to
indemnification under _Section 9.2_ solely with respect to the matters
specifically set forth in such Schedule Supplement. For purposes of clarity,
the Buyers and the Sellers acknowledge and agree that any Schedule Supplement
that reflects an event, development or underlying occurrence that either (A)
occurred prior to the execution of this Agreement and should have been set
forth on the Disclosure Schedules as of the execution of this Agreement or (B)
that does not give the Buyers the right to terminate the Agreement for failure
to satisfy the closing condition set forth in _Section 8.2(b)_ shall be
deemed to have been provided for information purposes only and shall not be
deemed to cure any breach of this Agreement or affect the conditions to
Closing or indemnification rights set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Permits_. Each Transaction Party shall promptly provide all
notices and otherwise take all commercially reasonable actions required to
transfer or reissue the Permits set

 



      
 

 



 

forth on _Schedule 6.8_ , which constitute all of the Permits (including
Environmental Permits) that need to be transferred or reissued so that the
Portfolio Companies can operate the Business upon the Closing in a manner
consistent with the Portfolio Companies past practices during 2011 and 2012.
Each Transaction Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effect any
such transfer or reissuance, including cooperating with the other Transaction
Parties and furnishing all information in such Transaction Partys possession
that is necessary in connection therewith.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Survey and Title_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Sellers shall cause to be procured and delivered to the
Portfolio Companies and the Buyers as soon as reasonably practicable following
the execution of this Agreement one or more plats of survey prepared and
certified in accordance with (i) the Florida minimum technical standards for
surveying and mapping and (ii) the Minimum Standard Detail for ALTA/ACSM Land

the Real Property Agreements and the plant improvements located on the Real
Property and the real property subject to the Real Property Agreements. The
Sellers, on the one hand, and the Buyers, on the other hand, shall each bear
fifty percent (50%) of any costs and expenses associated with the preparation
and delivery of such surveys.

 



 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, each of the Sellers shall cause a commitment for title insurance
for each of the Portfolio Companies to be issued by a nationally recognized
title company reasonably acceptable to the Buyers, addressing the status of
title of the Real Property and the Real Property Agreements described on
_Schedule 6.9_ for the Applicable Portfolio Company. Such commitments for
title insurance (i) shall be subject to no condition to the issuance of title
policies thereunder other than payment of the initial premium, (ii) shall
include endorsements for survey coverage, access, contiguity and such other
endorsements as may be reasonably requested by the Buyers, and (iii) shall
include a nonimputation endorsement for matters known to the Sellers with the
Sellers providing, or causing to be provided, to the title company the
necessary owner affidavits and nonimputation indemnity required to provide
nonimputation coverage to the Buyers under the applicable owners title
insurance policies. The Buyers on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other
hand, shall each bear half of the costs, expenses and premiums associated with
procuring an owners title insurance policy for each of the Portfolio Companies
in an amount to be mutually agreed upon by the Parties (and in the aggregate
for all Portfolio Companies in an amount equal to the Base Purchase Price)
issued pursuant to such commitments for title insurance or otherwise.

 



 

Section 6.10 _Applicable Agreements_. The Buyers recognize that certain
Affiliates of the Portfolio Companies have provided credit support with
respect to the Portfolio Companies or the Facilities in satisfaction of the
credit support obligations under the Applicable Agreements, all of which
support obligations that are outstanding as of the date hereof being set forth
on _Schedule 6.10_. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Buyers shall, or
shall cause their Affiliates to, provide replacement credit support on behalf
of the Portfolio Companies with respect to such Applicable Agreements, all on
terms and conditions required pursuant to the respective

 



      
 

 



 

Applicable Agreement and reasonably acceptable to the counterparty to such
Applicable Agreement; _provided_ , that, if any counterparty to such
Applicable Agreement has not accepted the Buyers replacement credit support,
then the Buyers shall have the right to extend the Outside Date as provided
for in _Section 10.1_. The Buyers shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) provide to the Seller Representative, on or prior to the
Closing Date, written evidence of acceptance of such replacement credit
support by the counterparty to such Applicable Agreement in exchange for the
existing credit support and (ii) provide to the Seller Representative, on or
prior to the Closing Date, evidence of arrangements for the prompt return of
the existing credit support to the Seller Representative. The Sellers shall,
and shall cause their Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
assist and cooperate with the Buyers in interacting with the applicable
counterparties for the purpose of the Buyers, or their Affiliates, providing
the replacement credit support on behalf of the Portfolio Companies with
respect to any of the Applicable Agreements.

 



 

Section 6.11 _Off-Site Assets_. Each of the Sellers shall deliver or cause to
be delivered to the Facilities prior to the Closing Date all spare parts,
equipment, inventory and other assets allocated for use by the Facilities that
are not located at the Facilities, other than any spare parts, equipment,
inventory and other assets that may be under the custody and control of a
third party service provider for purposes of storage, repair or maintenance;
_provided_ , that such assets are held by such third party service provider
for the benefit of, and use by, the Facilities.

 



 

Section 6.12 _Reserved_.

 



 

Section 6.13 _Records_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
Closing Date, but in no event more than ten (10) days after the Closing Date,
the Seller Representative shall deliver to the Buyer Representative or cause
to be present at the Facilities, all Books and Records; _provided_ , _however_
, that each of the Sellers shall cause all NERC Documentation required to be
maintained in respect of the Facilities to be present at the Facilities on the
Closing Date.

 



 

Section 6.14 _Insurance_. Each of the Sellers shall, and shall cause their
Affiliates to, maintain or cause to be maintained in full force and effect the
insurance policies described on _Schedule 4.12_ until the Closing Date. All
such insurance coverage shall be terminated as of the Closing Date. The Buyers
shall be solely responsible for providing insurance to the Portfolio Companies
for any claims related to events or occurrences after the Closing Date. Upon
the Closing, the Buyers shall be entitled to any cash recoveries received by
ATP, its Affiliates or the Portfolio Companies with respect to any of the
Portfolio Companies after the date of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.15 _Casualty_.

 



 

(a) If any assets or properties of the Portfolio Companies are damaged or
destroyed by any casualty loss event or events after the date hereof and prior
to the Closing Date, and the total cost of restoring such damaged or destroyed
assets or properties to a condition reasonably comparable to their prior
condition (such costs with respect to such assets or properties, along with
all expected lost revenues of the Portfolio Companies associated with such
casualty loss constituting capacity payments under the

 



      
 

 



 

Revenue Agreements, after giving effect to any Third-Party insurance coverage
under which the insurer has accepted the claim for such costs, the "
_Restoration Cost_ ") is greater than Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000)
but does not exceed ten percent (10%) of the Base Purchase Price and such
restoration can be made without material uninsured impairment to the Business,
the Seller Representative may elect, by written notice to the Buyer
Representative delivered before the Outside Date, to:

 



 

(i) reduce the amount of the Purchase Price by the estimated Restoration Cost
(as determined by the Seller Representative and reasonably confirmed by the
Buyer Representative; _provided_ that the Buyers or the Portfolio Companies
receive the benefit of all insurance proceeds taken into account in
determining the Restoration Cost, or such amounts are added back to determine
the estimated Restoration Cost), or

 



 

(ii) restore such damaged or destroyed assets or properties to a condition
equivalent to their prior condition.

 



 

If the Seller Representative makes the election contemplated by _Section
6.15(a)(i)_, then, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in _Article VIII_, the Closing shall occur on or before the Outside
Date and the Purchase Price shall be so reduced. If the Seller Representative
makes the election contemplated by _Section 6.15(a)(ii)_, then, subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_, the
Closing shall occur on or before the Outside Date. If the Seller
Representative does not make either such election before the Outside Date,
then any Transaction Party may terminate this Agreement by written notice to
the other Parties.

 



 

(b) If the Restoration Cost is in excess of ten percent (10%) of the Base
Purchase Price or such restoration cannot be made without material uninsured
impairment to the Business, the Seller Representative may elect, by written
notice to the Buyer Representative delivered promptly after determining the
Restoration Cost to:

 



 

(i) reduce the amount of the Purchase Price by the estimated Restoration Cost
(as determined by the Seller Representative and reasonably confirmed by the
Buyer Representative; _provided_ that the Buyers or the Portfolio Companies
receive the benefit of all insurance proceeds taken into account in
determining the Restoration Cost, or such amounts are added back to determine
the estimated Restoration Cost), or

 



 

(ii) restore such damaged or destroyed assets or properties to a condition
equivalent to their prior condition.

 



 

If the Seller Representative makes the election contemplated by _Section
6.15(b)(i)_, then, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in _Article VIII_, the Closing shall occur on or before the Outside
Date and the Purchase Price shall be so reduced; _provided_ that the Buyers
may terminate this Agreement, by written notice to the Seller Representative,
within thirty (30) days of receipt by the Buyer Representative of the Seller
Representatives notice regarding such election. If the Seller Representative
makes the election contemplated by _Section 6.15(b)(ii)_, the

 



      
 

 



 

Closing shall occur on or before the Outside Date, subject to the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_. If the Seller
Representative does not elect either option within thirty (30) days after the

then it shall promptly, but not less than ten (10) Business Days after receipt
of the Seller Representatives calculation, deliver written notice to the
Seller Representative setting forth the Buyer Representatives calculation of
the Restoration Costs. If the Buyer Representative fails to timely deliver
such notice, then the Seller Representatives calculation of the Restoration
Costs shall be deemed final, binding and conclusive for all purposes of this
Agreement. If the Buyer Representative so notifies the Seller Representative
in accordance with this _Section 6.15(d)_, then the Buyer Representative and
the Seller Representative shall, over the next ten (10) Business Days, attempt
in good faith to resolve the disputed calculations, and any written resolution
by them as to the agreed calculation of the Restoration Costs shall be deemed
final, binding and conclusive for all purposes of this Agreement. If, at the
conclusion of the ten (10) Business Day resolution period, the Buyer
Representative and the Seller Representative have not agreed on the
calculation of Restoration Costs, then the Restoration Costs shall be
estimated by a qualified firm reasonably acceptable to the Buyer
Representative and the Seller Representative. Subject to the limitations set
forth in _Section 10.1(f)_, the Outside Date shall be extended on a day-for-
day basis while the procedures set forth in this _Section 6.15(d)_ are
followed.

 



 

Section 6.16 _Condemnation_.

 



 

(a) If any of the assets or properties of the Portfolio Companies are taken or
noticed for taking by a condemnation event after the date hereof and prior to
the Closing Date and such assets or properties have a condemnation value (such

condemnation proceeds awarded to the Portfolio Companies for such condemnation
event, the " _Condemnation Value_ ") greater than Five Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($500,000) but not in excess of ten percent (10%) of the Base Purchase
Price, any Transaction Party may elect, by written notice to the other
Transaction Parties delivered before the Outside Date, to reduce the amount of
the Purchase Price by the estimated Condemnation Value (as determined by the
Seller Representative and reasonably confirmed by the Buyer Representative).
If any Transaction Party makes the election contemplated by the foregoing
sentence, then, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in _Article VIII_, the Closing shall occur on or before the Outside
Date and the Purchase Price shall be so reduced. If

 



      
 

 



 

none of the Transaction Parties makes such election before the Outside Date,
then any Transaction Party may terminate this Agreement by written notice to
the other Parties.

 



 

(b) If the Condemnation Value is in excess of ten percent (10%) of the Base
Purchase Price, the Seller Representative may elect, by written notice to the
Buyer Representative delivered before the Outside Date, to:

 



 

(i) reduce the amount of the Purchase Price by the estimated Condemnation
Value (as determined by the Seller Representative and reasonably confirmed by
the Buyer Representative), or

 



 

(ii) terminate this Agreement.

 



 

If the Seller Representative makes the election contemplated by _Section
6.16(b)(i)_, then, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in _Article VIII_, the Closing shall occur on or before the Outside
Date and the Purchase Price shall be so reduced; _provided_ that the Buyers
may terminate this Agreement, by written notice to the Seller Representative,
within thirty (30) days of receipt by the Buyer Representative of the Seller
Representatives notice regarding such election. If the Seller Representative
makes the election contemplated by _Section 6.16(b)(ii)_, then this Agreement
shall terminate.

 



 

(c) If the Condemnation Value is Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) or
less, then (i) neither the Buyers nor the Sellers shall have the right or
option to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 6.16_ and (ii) there
shall be no reduction in the amount of the Purchase Price as a direct result
thereof.

 



 

(d) If the Buyer Representative, in the exercise of reasonable judgment, does
not confirm the Seller Representatives calculation of the Condemnation Value,
then it shall promptly, but not less than five (5) Business Days after receipt
of the Seller Representatives calculation, deliver written notice to the
Seller Representative setting forth the Buyer Representatives calculation of
the Condemnation Value. If the Buyer Representative fails to timely deliver
such notice, then the Seller Representatives calculation of the Condemnation
Value shall be deemed final, binding and conclusive for all purposes of this
Agreement. If the Buyer Representative so notifies the Seller Representative
in accordance with this _Section 6.16(d)_, then the Buyer Representative and
the Seller Representative shall, over the next five (5) Business Days, attempt
in good faith to resolve the disputed calculations, and any written resolution
by them as to the agreed calculation of the Condemnation Value shall be deemed
final, binding and conclusive for all purposes of this Agreement. If, at the
conclusion of the five (5) Business Day resolution period, the Buyer
Representative and the Seller Representative have not agreed on the
calculation of Condemnation Value, then the Condemnation Value shall be
estimated by a qualified firm reasonably acceptable to the Buyer
Representative and the Seller Representative. Subject to the limitations set
forth in _Section 10.1(f)_, the Outside Date shall be extended on a day-for-
day basis while the procedures set forth in this _Section 6.16(d)_ are
followed.

 **ARTICLE VII 
TAX MATTERS**

 



 

Section 7.1 _Tax Returns_.

 



 

(a) The Seller Representative shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and
file, or cause to be filed, subject to the review and reasonable approval of
the Buyer Representative, all Tax Returns of the Portfolio Companies for all
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date (each such period a " _Pre-
Closing Tax Period_ ") that are required to be filed after the Closing Date.
The Sellers shall reimburse, or cause to be reimbursed, the Buyers for Taxes
of the Portfolio Companies with respect to all periods within fifteen (15)
days before payment by the Buyers and/or the Portfolio Companies of such
Taxes, but only to the extent that the Taxes were not taken into account in
the Final Adjustment Statement. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a
manner that is consistent with the past custom and practice of the Portfolio
Companies, except as required by a change in applicable Law.

 



 

(b) The Buyer Representative shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file,
or cause to be filed, subject to the review and reasonable approval of the
Seller Representative, any Tax Returns of the Portfolio Companies for Tax
periods which begin before the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date
(each such period a " _Straddle Period_ "). All such Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner that is consistent with the past custom and practice of
the Portfolio Companies, except as required by a change in applicable Law. The
Sellers shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Buyers, within fifteen (15)
days before the date on which Taxes are to be paid with respect to such
Straddle Periods, an amount equal to the portion of such Taxes that relates to
the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date. For purposes
of this _Section 7.1_ and _Section 9.2_, in the case of any Taxes that are
imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Straddle Period, the portion
of such Tax that relates to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date shall (x) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or
related to income, gains or receipts (including sales and use Taxes), or
employment or payroll Taxes, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the
entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of days in the Straddle Period ending on the date immediately prior to
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
entire Straddle Period, and (y) in the case of any Tax based upon or related
to income, gains or receipts (including sales and use Taxes), or employment or
payroll Taxes, be deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the
relevant Straddle Period ended on the date immediately prior to the Closing
Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations
shall be made in a manner consistent with reasonable prior practice of the
Portfolio Companies.

 



 

(c) The Buyer Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or
cause to be filed all other Tax Returns of the Portfolio Companies.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 7.2 _Cooperation_. The Buyer Representative and the Seller
Representative shall cooperate fully, and the Buyers shall cause the Portfolio
Companies to cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the
other Transaction Party, in connection with the preparation and filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to _Section 7.1_ and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding (each, a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") with respect to Taxes. Such
cooperation shall include access to, the retention and (upon the other Partys
request) the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant
to any such Tax Return or Tax Proceeding, and the making available of
employees on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Seller Representative
shall and shall cause the Sellers to, and the Buyers shall and shall cause the
Portfolio Companies to, retain all books and records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to the Portfolio Companies relating to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date until the later of six (6) years after the
Closing Date and the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations of
the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any Tax Authority. The Seller Representative
shall provide the Buyer Representative reasonable written notice prior to the
Sellers transferring, destroying or discarding any books and records, and, if
the Buyer Representative so requests, the Sellers shall allow the Buyer
Representative to take possession of such books and records at the Buyers
expense. The Buyers and the Sellers each agree, upon request, to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from any Tax Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.3 _Transfer Taxes_. All state and local transfer, sales, use, stamp,
registration or other similar Taxes, if any, resulting from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne and paid fifty percent (50%) by
the Buyers and fifty percent (50%) by the Sellers. The Buyer Representative
shall, at the Buyers expense, timely file any Tax Return or other document
with respect to such Taxes (and the Seller Representative and each of the
Sellers shall cooperate with respect thereto as necessary). The Buyers and the
Sellers shall cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the extent permissible
under applicable Law, the amount of any such Taxes.

 



 

Section 7.4 _Tax Proceedings_. The Buyer Representative shall inform the
Seller Representative of the commencement of any audit, examination or
proceeding (" _Tax Contest_ ") relating in whole or in part to Taxes for which
the Buyers may be entitled to indemnity from the Sellers hereunder. With
respect to any Tax Contest for which the Seller Representative acknowledges in
writing that the Sellers are liable under _Article IX_ for all Losses
relating thereto the Seller Representative shall be entitled to control, in
good faith, all proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Contest;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Seller Representative shall promptly
notify the Buyer Representative in writing of its intention to control such
Tax Contest, (ii) in the case of a Tax Contest relating to Taxes of the
Portfolio Companies for a Straddle Period, the Seller Representative and the
Buyer Representative shall jointly control all proceedings taken in connection
with any such Tax Contest and (iii) if any Tax Contest solely controlled by
the Seller Representative could reasonably be expected to have an adverse
effect on the Buyers, the Portfolio Companies, or any of their related Persons
in any Tax period beginning after the Closing Date, the Tax Contest shall not
be settled or resolved without the Buyer Representatives consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if notice is given to the Seller Representative
of the commencement of any Tax Contest and the Seller Representative does not,
within twenty (20)

 



      
 

 



 

Business Days after the Buyer Representatives notice is given, give notice to
the Buyer Representative of the Seller Representatives election to assume the
defense thereof (and in connection therewith, acknowledge in writing the
indemnification obligations hereunder of the Sellers), the Sellers shall be
bound by any determination made in such Tax Contest or any compromise or
settlement thereof effected by the Buyer Representative; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any Tax Contest solely controlled by the Buyer
Representative could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the
Sellers or any of their related Persons for any Tax period, the Tax Contest
shall not be settled or resolved without the Seller Representatives consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The
failure of the Buyer Representative to give reasonably prompt notice of any
Tax Contest shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the Sellers
obligations with respect thereto except to the extent that the Sellers can
demonstrate actual loss and prejudice as a result of such failure. The Buyers
and the Portfolio Companies shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
provide the Seller Representative with such assistance as may be reasonably
requested by the Seller Representative in connection with a Tax Contest
controlled solely or jointly by the Seller Representative. The Seller
Representative shall, and shall cause the Sellers and their Affiliates to, use
their commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Buyers with such
assistance as may reasonably be requested by the Buyers in connection with a
Tax Contest controlled solely or jointly by the Buyers.

 



 

Section 7.5 _Purchase Price Allocation_. The purchase and sale of the
Interests under this Agreement shall be treated for federal and all applicable
state and local income Tax purposes as a deemed sale of the assets of the
Portfolio Companies.

 



 

(a) The Purchase Price shall be allocated among the assets acquired by the
Buyers under this Agreement in accordance with an allocation schedule (the "
_Purchase Price Allocation Schedule_ ") agreed upon by the Buyer
Representative and the Seller Representative. The Buyer Representative shall
prepare the initial draft of the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule in the
manner required by Section 1060 of the Code and any other applicable Law and
shall deliver it to the Seller Representative at least fifteen (15) days
before the scheduled Closing Date (or such shorter period as the Parties may
mutually agree) for review and comment by the Sellers. The Transaction Parties
shall revise the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule to the extent necessary to
reflect any post-Closing payments or adjustments made under or in connection
with this Agreement and report any adjustments in accordance with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1060-1(c). In the case of any payment or adjustment
referred to in the preceding sentence, the Buyer Representative shall propose
a revised Purchase Price Allocation Schedule within forty-five (45) days after
the payment or adjustment (or such shorter period as the Parties may mutually
agree), and the Transaction Parties shall follow the procedures outlined in
_Section 7.5(b)_ with respect to review, dispute and resolution of such
revision.

 



 

(b) If the Transaction Parties are unable to agree upon the Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule within five (5) days before the scheduled Closing Date,
then either Transaction Party may refer the dispute to an Independent Auditor
and such Independent Auditor shall conclusively determine the Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule (including any valuations) in accordance with _Section
7.6_.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The Sellers and the Buyers shall each prepare, or cause to be prepared,
mutually acceptable and substantially identical IRS Forms 8594 consistent with
the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, which the Transaction Parties shall
use to report the transaction pursuant to this Agreement to the applicable Tax
Authorities; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Buyers cost for the assets
that they are deemed to acquire may differ from the total amount allocated
hereunder to reflect the inclusion in the total cost of items (for example,
capitalized acquisition costs) not included in the amount so allocated and
(ii) the amount realized by the Sellers or their Affiliates may differ from
the total amount allocated hereunder to reflect transaction costs that reduce
the amount realized for federal income tax purposes. Each Transaction Party
shall promptly provide the other Transaction Party with any other information
required to complete Form 8594. Neither Transaction Party, without the consent
of the other Transaction Party, shall take a position on any Tax Return, or
before any Tax Authority in connection with the examination of any Tax Return
or in any subsequent judicial proceeding, that is in any manner inconsistent
with the terms of the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule unless specifically
required by a determination of an applicable Tax Authority. The Transaction
Parties shall promptly advise each other of the existence of any Tax audit,
controversy or litigation related to any allocation under this _Section 7.5_.

 



 

Section 7.6 _Resolution of Disputed Purchase Price Allocation Schedule Items_.
The Independent Auditor reasonably agreed by the Transaction Parties pursuant
to _Section 7.5_ shall determine, if required by _Section 7.5_, any disputes
involving the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule (including any valuations)
(such disputed document or amount (a " _Disputed Item_ "), in accordance with
the following:

 



 

(a) The Independent Auditor shall be instructed to deliver to the Buyer
Representative and the Seller Representative a written determination of the
Disputed Item within ten (10) days from the date the matter is referred to it.

 



 

(b) The Independent Accountant may determine the issues in dispute with
respect to any Disputed Item following those procedures, consistent with the
provisions of this Agreement, that it deems appropriate in the circumstances
and with reference to the amounts in issue. The Transaction Parties do not
intend to impose any particular procedures upon such Independent Auditor, it
being the desire of the Transaction Parties that any such disagreement will be
resolved as expeditiously and inexpensively as reasonably practicable.

 



 

(c) The Independent Auditor shall have no liability to the Transaction Parties
in connection with its services, except for acts of bad faith, willful
misconduct or gross negligence, and the Transaction Parties shall provide
indemnification to the Independent Auditor as it may reasonably request.

 



 

(d) All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the
Independent Auditor pursuant to this _Section 7.6_ shall be borne equally by
the Sellers, on the one hand, and the Buyers, on the other hand.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 7.7 _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_. Any tax allocation,
indemnity, sharing or other similar agreement or arrangement, whether or not
written, that may have been entered into by the Sellers or any of their
Affiliates (other than the Portfolio Companies), on the one hand, and any of
the Portfolio Companies, on the other hand, shall be terminated as to the
Portfolio Companies as of the Closing Date, and no payments that are owed by
or to the Portfolio Companies pursuant thereto shall be payable thereafter.

 



 

Section 7.8 _Survival_. The covenants contained in this _Article VII_ shall
survive until sixty (60) days following the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations.

(b) Each of the representations and warranties of the Buyers contained in this

and as of such time (other than representations and warranties that speak as
of another specific date or time (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
representation or warranty specified herein as being made as of or through the
date of this Agreement), which need only be true and correct as of such date
or time), except to the extent that any and all failures of such

would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
Buyers ability to perform their obligations hereunder or to consummate the

(g) The Buyers shall have delivered to the Sellers a certificate, dated as of
the Closing Date, certifying that the conditions specified in _Section
8.3(b)_ and _Section 8.3(c)_ have been fulfilled.

 



 

Section 8.4 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. None of the Transaction
Parties may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in _Section 8.1_,
_Section 8.2_ or _Section 8.3_, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such
failure was caused by such Transaction Partys failure to act in good faith or
to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Closing to occur, as
required by _Section 6.5_.

covenant or agreement has been performed, plus ninety (90) days thereafter.

Losses attributable to such claim) is provided prior to the expiration of such
applicable Survival Period.

or relationships existing on or prior to the Closing Date or by agreements

(c) **THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.2_ SHALL BE
ENFORCEABLE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY PERSON (INCLUDING THE PERSON FROM WHOM
INDEMNIFICATION IS SOUGHT) ALLEGES OR PROVES THE SOLE, CONCURRENT,
CONTRIBUTORY OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE OF THE PERSON SEEKING INDEMNIFICATION
OR THE SOLE OR CONCURRENT STRICT LIABILITY IMPOSED UPON THE PERSON SEEKING
INDEMNIFICATION OR ANY OTHER PERSON**.

 



 

(d) The Transaction Parties have agreed upon a threshold (as provided in
_Section 9.4(a)_) and a deductible (as provided in _Section 9.4(b)_) as a
means of applying a materiality standard to the amount of any post-Closing
claim that (x) any Buyer Indemnified Party may have against any of the Sellers
resulting from a breach of a representation or warranty by any of the Sellers,
or (y) any Seller Indemnified Party may have against any of the Buyers
resulting from a breach of a representation or warranty by any of the Buyers.
Therefore, for purposes of (i) applying the post-closing indemnification
remedies provided in this _Article IX_, (ii) determining whether any breach
of a representation or warranty of any of the Sellers or Buyers, as
applicable, has occurred and (iii) calculating the amount any Losses relating
thereto, the Sellers or Buyers, as applicable, representations and
warranties shall be considered and applied without regard to any reference as
to materiality, materially, material respects, Material Adverse Effect or
similar materiality qualifiers set forth therein, except for _Section
4.11(c)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 9.2_ shall in no
respect modify the other provisions of this Agreement for purposes of
determining whether any conditions to Closing have been satisfied.

 



 

Section 9.3 _Indemnification Procedures_. Claims for indemnification under
this Agreement shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

 



 

(a) Any Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party claiming
indemnification under this Agreement (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") with respect
to any claim asserted against the Indemnified Party by a Third Party (a "
_Third-Party Claim_ ") in respect of any matter that is subject to
indemnification under _Section 9.2_ shall promptly (i) notify the other Party
(the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of the Third-Party Claim and (ii) transmit to
the Indemnifying Party a written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") describing in
reasonable detail the nature of the Third-Party Claim, a copy of all papers
served with respect to such Third-Party Claim (if any), the Indemnified
Partys best estimate of the amount of Losses attributable to the Third-Party
Claim and the basis of the Indemnified Partys request for indemnification
under this Agreement. Failure to timely provide such Claim Notice shall not
affect the right of the Indemnified Partys indemnification hereunder, except
to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such delay or
omission.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Following receipt of the Claim Notice, and unless (i) the control of the
defense by the Indemnifying Party would be inappropriate due to a conflict of
interest, (ii) such Third-Party Claim (or the facts or allegations related to
such Third-Party Claim) involves criminal allegations or seeks equitable or
injunctive relief, (iii) such Third-Party Claim, if adversely determined,
could reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the business or
reputation of the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates or (iv) such Third-Party
Claim, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected to result in
Losses exceeding the applicable limitations set forth in _Section 9.4(c)_,
the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to control the defense of the
Indemnified Party against such Third-Party Claim in accordance with the
following. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim
within five (5) Business Days following receipt of the Claim Notice, then the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend such Third-Party Claim with
counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party (who shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party), by all appropriate proceedings, to a
final conclusion or settlement at the discretion of the Indemnifying Party in
accordance with this _Section 9.3(b)_. The Indemnifying Party shall have full
control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or
settlement thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall
not enter into any settlement agreement without the written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _further_ , that such consent shall not
be required if (x) the settlement agreement contains a complete and
unconditional release by the Third Party asserting the Third-Party Claim of
the Indemnified Party, (y) the settlement agreement obligates the Indemnifying
Party to pay the full amount of any Losses attributable to the Indemnified
Party in connection with the Third-Party Claim, and (z) the settlement
agreement does not contain any direct or indirect requirements upon or
provisions for the Indemnified Party. If requested by the Indemnifying Party
the Indemnified Party agrees, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying
Party, to cooperate reasonably with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in
contesting any Third-Party Claim the defense of which is being controlled by
the Indemnifying Party pursuant hereto. The Indemnified Party may otherwise
participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Third-Party
Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 9.3(b)_,
and the Indemnified Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect
to such participation.

 



 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party (i) does not have the right to control the
defense of the Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)_ or (ii) does
not notify the Indemnified Party within five (5) Business Days following
receipt of the Claim Notice that the Indemnifying Party elects to defend the
Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)_, then the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to defend, and be reimbursed for its reasonable costs and
expenses in regard to the Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by the
Indemnified Party (who shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying
Party), by all appropriate proceedings. In such circumstances, the Indemnified
Party shall have full control of the defense of such Third-Party Claim. The
Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section
9.3(c)_, and the Indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with
respect to such participation.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article IX_, in the event that
an Indemnified Party determines that it has a claim for indemnifiable Losses
against an Indemnifying Party hereunder (other than as a result of a Third-
Party Claim), the Indemnified Party shall give written notice thereof to the
Indemnifying Party, specifying, in reasonable detail, the amount of such
claim, the nature and basis of the alleged breach or act giving rise to such
claim and all relevant facts and circumstances relating thereto. The
Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party with full access to its
books and records (and, if the Sellers are the Indemnifying Party, the
Portfolio Companies books and records) during normal business hours for the
purpose of allowing the Indemnifying Party a reasonable opportunity to verify
any such claim for indemnifiable Losses. The Indemnifying Party shall notify
the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days following its receipt of such
notice and granting of such access if the Indemnifying Party disputes its
liability to the Indemnified Party under this _Article IX_. If the
Indemnifying Party does not so notify the Indemnified Party, the claim
specified by the Indemnified Party in such notice shall be a liability of the
applicable Indemnifying Party under this _Article IX_, and the Indemnifying
Party shall pay the amount of such claim to the Indemnified Party on demand
or, in the case of any notice in which the amount of the claim (or any portion
of the claim) is estimated, on such later date when the amount of such claim
(or such portion of such claim) becomes finally determined. If the
Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its liability with respect to such
claim as provided above, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. Promptly following the
final determination of the amount of indemnifiable Losses to which the
Indemnified Party is entitled (whether determined in accordance with this
_Section 9.3(d)_ or by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Indemnifying
Party shall pay such indemnifiable Losses to the Indemnified Party by wire
transfer or certified check made payable to the order of the Indemnified
Party.

 



 

Section 9.4 _Limitations on Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary stated in this Agreement:

 



 

(a) a breach of any representation or warranty of any of the Sellers in this
Agreement (or in any certificate delivered in connection with this Agreement),
subject to the provisions of _Section 9.1_, in connection with any single
item or group of related items that results in Losses of less than Fifty
Thousand Dollars ($50,000) shall be deemed, for all purposes of this _Article
IX_ not to be a breach of such representation or warranty; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the limitation set forth in this _Section 9.4(a)_ shall not
apply to Losses arising from (i) any breach of any of the Sellers
representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.1_, _Section 3.2_,
_Section 3.5_, _Section 3.6_, _Section 4.1_, _Section 4.3_, and _Section
4.7_ (collectively, the " _Seller Fundamental Representations_ "), or _Section
4.11_ or (ii) the matters described in _Section 9.2(a)(ii)_, _(iii)_ , _(iv)_
, _(v)_ , _(vi)_ , _(vii)_ , or _(viii)_ ;

 



 

(b) the Sellers shall have no liability arising out of or relating to _Section
9.2(a)_ and the Buyers shall have no liability arising out of or relating to
_Section 9.2(b)_ except if the aggregate Losses actually incurred by the
Buyer Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties, as applicable,
exceed 0.75% of the Purchase Price respectively (and then, subject to _Section
9.4(c)_, only to the extent such aggregate Losses exceed such amount);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the limitation set forth in this _Section
9.4(b)_ shall not

 



      
 

 



 

apply to Losses arising from (i) any breach of any of the Sellers
representations and warranties contained in the Seller Fundamental
Representations or _Section 4.11_ (in the case of the Sellers), or _Section
5.1_, _Section 5.2_ or _Section 5.6_ (collectively, the " _Buyer Fundamental
Representations_ ") (in the case of the Buyers) or (ii) the matters described
in _Section 9.2(a)(ii)_, _(iii)_ , _(iv)_ , _(v)_ , _(vi)_ , _(vii)_ , or
_(viii)_ ;

 



 

(c) (i) neither the Sellers liability arising out of or relating to _Section
9.2(a)(i)_ (other than breaches of the Seller Fundamental Representations or
_Section 4.11_) nor the Buyers liability arising out of or relating to
_Section 9.2(b)(i)_ (other than breaches of the Buyer Fundamental
Representations) shall exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the Purchase Price,
(ii) the Sellers liability for breaches of the representations and warranties
contained in _Section 4.11_ shall not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the
Purchase Price, and (iii) neither the Sellers liability for breaches of any
of the Seller Fundamental Representations nor the Buyers liability for
breaches of any of the Buyer Fundamental Representations shall exceed the
Purchase Price; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall either the
Sellers aggregate liability or the Buyers aggregate liability for breaches
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement
exceed the Purchase Price; and

 



 

(d) the amount of any Losses subject to indemnification under this _Article
IX_ shall be reduced or reimbursed, as the case may be, by the amount of any
Third-Party insurance coverage the proceeds of which have been collected by
the Portfolio Companies with respect to any such Losses, or third-party
indemnity, third-party contribution or similar payments or other similar
recovery or offset actually realized, directly or indirectly, by the
Indemnified Party with respect to any such Losses, net of expenses paid to
third parties in procuring such contributions or recovery, including
materially increased premiums or deductibles, and net of any non-indemnifiable
amounts related to such claim (e.g., any amounts not recoverable as a result
of the limitations set forth in this _Article IX_), but such recoveries shall
not count against the caps, deductibles or other limitations described in this
_Section 9.4_. If a Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as
applicable, receives an amount under Third-Party insurance coverage or
receives or realizes, directly or indirectly, third party indemnity, third
party contribution or similar payments with respect to Losses that were the
subject of indemnification under this _Article IX_ at any time subsequent to
indemnification provided hereunder, then such Buyer Indemnified Party or
Seller Indemnified Party, as applicable, shall promptly reimburse the Buyers
or the Sellers, as applicable, to the extent of the amount received.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. The Transaction Parties agree to
treat all payments made pursuant to _Section 2.6(d)_ and this _Article IX_
as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Mitigation_. Each Indemnified Party shall use, and cause its
Affiliates to use, commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses that
may be subject to indemnification under this _Article IX_ upon becoming aware
of any event or circumstance that would be reasonably expected to, or does,
give rise to such Losses, solely to the extent that such Party would attempt
to mitigate such Losses in the ordinary course of business if such Party did

 



      
 

 



 

not have a right to indemnification hereunder; _provided_ , that such
obligation to mitigate on the part of the Buyers or the Portfolio Companies
(from and after the Closing Date) (i) shall not require the Buyers, the
Portfolio Companies or their respective Affiliates to take any action
inconsistent with the past practices of the Sellers and (ii) shall arise only
at such time as the Buyers management has actual knowledge of the event,
fact, circumstance or matter giving rise to such Losses.

 



 

Section 9.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing, and except in the
event of fraud or willful misconduct, the indemnification and remedies set
forth in this _Article IX_ shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedies
of the Transaction Parties with respect to any breach of representation or
warranty or non-performance, partial or total, of any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement (or in any certificate delivered in connection
herewith); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 9.7_ shall
prevent any Transaction Party from seeking injunctive or equitable relief in
pursuit of its indemnification claims under this _Article IX_; and _provided_
, _further_ , that in the event a Transaction Party should assert rights or
obligations in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
under any Law or cause of action not based on the interpretation or
application of this Agreement, the Parties agree that the provisions of this
_Article IX_ shall in all instances apply to such claim or cause of action.
Except with respect to claims identified above in this _Article IX_, and to
the extent allowed by applicable Law, each Transaction Party hereby waives,
releases, acquits and forever discharges the other Party and their respective
Affiliates and Representatives from any and all claims, actions, causes of
action, demands, rights, damages, costs, expenses, Losses or compensation
whatsoever, whether direct or indirect, known or unknown, foreseen or
unforeseen, that such Party may have following the Closing against the other
Transaction Parties and their respective Affiliates and Representatives with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.8 _Directors and Officer s Indemnification_. For a period of not
less than six (6) years after the Closing Date, the Buyers shall cause the
Organizational Documents of each Portfolio Company to contain provisions
substantially similar to the provisions concerning the exculpation,
indemnification, advancement of expenses to, and holding harmless of, all past
and present employees, officers or agents of such Portfolio Company for acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing as are contained in such
documents as of the date of execution of this Agreement, and the Buyers shall
cause each Portfolio Company to honor all such provisions, including making
any indemnification payments and expense advancement thereunder. In the event
that any indemnifiable claim is asserted or made within such six-year period,
all rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses in respect of such
claim shall continue to the extent currently permitted under the relevant
Portfolio Companys Organizational Documents until such claim is disposed of,
or all orders, injunctions, judgments, decrees, ruling, writs, assessments or
arbitration awards in connection with such claim are fully satisfied.

Section 10.1 _Termination_. Prior to the Closing, this Agreement may be

in a writing signed by each of the Buyer Representative and the Seller
Representative;

 



 

(b) by the Buyers (provided the Buyers are not then in material breach of any
of their obligations under this Agreement), if there has been a material
breach by (i) any of the Sellers of any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in _Section
8.1_ or _Section 8.2_ would not be satisfied as of the time of such
termination or (ii) ATP under the Seller Guaranty, and any such breach under
clauses (i) or (ii) is incapable of being cured or has not been cured by any
of the Sellers or ATP, as applicable, within twenty (20) days after written
notice thereof from the Buyers;

 



 

(c) by the Sellers (provided the Sellers are not then in material breach of
any of their obligations under this Agreement), if (i) there has been a
material breach by the Buyers of any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement (x) such that the conditions set forth in _Section
8.1_ or _Section 8.3_ would not be satisfied as of the time of such
termination and (y) such breach is incapable of being cured or has not been
cured by the Buyers within twenty (20) days after written notice thereof from
the Sellers, or (ii) each of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1_ and
_Section 8.2_ (other than those conditions that are to be satisfied at
Closing and the condition in _Section 8.2(j)_ that all conditions in the
Lender Consents and the Portfolio Company Lender Consents have been met solely
to the extent that such conditions are to be satisfied at Closing, though any
such conditions in _Section 8.2_ or in the Lender Consents and the Portfolio
Company Lender Consent are then able to be satisfied (A) solely by making
delivery thereof if the Closing were then to occur, and (B) as to _Section
8.2(j)_, assuming for the purposes of this Clause (B) only, that the Buyers
have or would have satisfied the conditions in _Section 8.3(f)_) are
satisfied and the Buyers fail to satisfy as of the Outside Date (as such date
may be extended pursuant to _Section 10.1(f)_) each of the conditions set
forth in _Section 8.3_ (other than the conditions in _Section 8.3(e)_ and
_Section 8.3(f)_ and the conditions that are to be satisfied at Closing,

delivered the replacement credit support contemplated in, and otherwise
satisfied the requirements of clauses (i) and (ii) of, _Section 6.10_) and
not otherwise waived in writing by the Sellers; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in any event, the Sellers cannot terminate under clause (ii) above based upon
the Buyers failure to pay the Purchase Price if the sole reason for such
failure to pay the Purchase Price is due to the Sellers failure to satisfy
the conditions in _Section 8.2(j)_ and the Buyers have delivered the
replacement credit support contemplated in, and otherwise satisfied the
requirements of clauses (i) and (ii) of, _Section 6.10._

 



 

(d) by either the Buyers or the Sellers if any Governmental Authority having
competent jurisdiction has issued a final and non-appealable order, decree,
ruling or injunction (other than a temporary restraining order) or taken any
other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 



     

 



 

(e) by either the Buyers or the Sellers in accordance with _Section 6.15_ or
_Section 6.16_, or as otherwise contemplated by _Section 6.15_ or _Section

Agreement shall not have been consummated as a result of the conditions set
forth in _Section 8.1(b)_ and _Section 8.1(c)_ failing to have been
satisfied and the Transaction Parties requesting such extension reasonably
believe(s) that the relevant approvals will be obtained during such extension
period; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Outside Date may be extended for a
period not to exceed sixty (60) days in the aggregate by the Sellers in the
event that a casualty loss event has occurred for which the Sellers has
elected to restore damaged or destroyed assets or properties pursuant to
_Section 6.15_ and has commenced and is reasonably pursuing restoration;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Outside Date may be extended for a period
not to exceed sixty (60) days in the aggregate by the Sellers in the event
that a condemnation event has occurred for which the Sellers are entitled to
make an election pursuant to _Section 6.16_ and have not yet done so;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Outside Date may be extended for a period
not to exceed sixty (60) days in the aggregate by the Buyers by written notice
to the Seller Representative if the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall not have been consummated solely as a result of the condition
set forth in _Section 8.3(f)_ failing to have been satisfied (but only to the
extent that the Buyers have delivered the replacement credit support
contemplated in, and otherwise satisfied the requirements of clauses (i) and
(ii) of, _Section 6.10_) and such conditions are not otherwise waived by the
Sellers, in which case the Buyers and the Sellers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the applicable counterparty to any Applicable
Agreement to provide a written evidence of acceptance; _provided_ , _further_
, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 10.1(f)_
shall not be available to any Seller on the one hand or any Buyer on the other
hand, if the failure of any Seller or Buyer, respectively, to fulfill any
obligation under this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have
resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to the Outside
Date.

 



 

Section 10.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) In the event of termination and abandonment of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 10.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and have
no effect, and the obligations of the Parties under this Agreement shall
terminate, except for the obligations set forth in this _Section 10.2(a)_ and
the provisions set forth in _Article XI_, each of which shall survive
termination of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if this
Agreement is validly terminated by the Buyers pursuant to _Section 10.1(b)_,
the Buyers shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available at Law or in
equity, and (ii) if this Agreement is validly terminated by the Sellers
pursuant to _Section 10.1(c)_, the Seller Representative, on behalf of the
Sellers, shall be entitled to draw under the Letter of Credit in the full
amount of $10,000,000, and such amount drawn under the Letter of Credit shall
constitute a termination fee paid by the Buyers to the Sellers. The Parties

 



      
 

 



 

acknowledge and agree that the termination fee provided under the Letter of
Credit is a reasonable determination of losses in the event of termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(c)_ and upon termination, none of
the Buyers shall have any other liability or obligation to any of the Sellers,
the Seller Representative or their Affiliates related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. In the event (i) the Parties are disputing
whether this Agreement has been validly terminated by the Sellers and the
Letter of Credit is set to expire within five (5) Business Days or (ii) the
Letter of Credit is set to expire within five (5) Business Days and such date
is prior to the Outside Date, as may be extended pursuant to _Section
10.1(f)_, then the Seller Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, may draw
under the Letter of Credit and hold such proceeds pending resolution of such
dispute in the case of clause (i), or until the earlier of the Closing Date or
termination of this Agreement in the case of clause (ii), whereupon any amount
of such proceeds to which the Sellers are not entitled shall be promptly
refunded to the Buyers; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyers shall have
the right to extend or replace the Letter of Credit at any time prior to its
expiration. Further, if termination of this Agreement occurs other than
pursuant to _Section 10.1(c)_, the Seller Representative shall deliver to the
Buyer Representative the Letter of Credit and written notice from the Sellers
confirming their consent to the termination of the Letter of Credit in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to the Buyer Representative.

 



 

(b) Except as otherwise provided by Law, no delay or forbearance by a Party in
the exercise or enforcement of any right or remedy hereunder shall be deemed a
waiver by such Party of its right hereunder to exercise or enforce such right
or remedy. For the avoidance of doubt, as an alternative to termination of
this Agreement pursuant to the provisions of _Section 10.1_ and the exercise
of any right or remedy pursuant to this _Section 10.2_, the Parties shall
have the right to seek specific performance pursuant to the provisions of
_Section 11.14_.

 



 

(c) No termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the
Parties contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations
shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.

power contemplated by this _Section 11.1_.

 



 

(b) The Seller Representative will not be liable for any act done or omitted

assets of the Seller Representative, acting in such capacity, for the
satisfaction of any obligations to be performed by any of the Sellers and the
Seller Representative will not look to the Buyers or, post-Closing, any of the
Portfolio Companies for any of the Sellers indemnification obligations

limit ATPs obligations or liabilities as a guarantor under the Seller
Guaranty. If the Seller Representative is dissolved or for any other reason

agree to appoint a new entity as the successor Seller Representative within
ten (10) Business Days of the dissolution or incapacity of the original Seller
Representative.

 



 

(c) The appointment of the Seller Representative is coupled with an interest
and may not be revoked in whole or in part. Such appointment shall be binding
upon the officers, directors, security holders, successors and assigns of each
of the Sellers. All decisions of the Seller Representative shall be final and
binding on all of the Sellers and no securityholder shall have the right to
object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. The Buyers shall be
entitled to rely upon, without independent investigation, any act, notice,
instruction or communication from the Seller Representative and any

 



      
 

 



 

document executed by the Seller Representative on behalf of any of the Sellers
and shall be fully protected in connection with any action or inaction taken
or omitted to be taken in reliance thereon.

instruments and consents on behalf of and as agent for each of the Buyers at
any time in connection with, and that may be necessary or appropriate to
accomplish the intent and implement the provisions of this Agreement. Without

to (i) interpret the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the documents
to be executed and delivered by the Buyers in connection herewith, (ii)
execute and deliver and receive deliveries of all agreements, certificates,

Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing, (v) give and receive
notices and communications, (vi) take all actions necessary or appropriate in
the judgment of the Buyer Representative on behalf of the Buyers in connection
with this Agreement, and (vii) make any determinations and settle any matters
in connection with the adjustments to the Purchase Price in _Section 2.5_ and
_Section 2.6_. By executing this Agreement, the Buyer Representative accepts
the appointment, authority and power contemplated by this _Section 11.2_.

 



 

(b) The Buyer Representative will not be liable for any act done or omitted
under this Agreement as Buyer Representative while acting at the direction of
the Buyers or otherwise in good faith, and any act taken or omitted to be

assets of the Buyer Representative, acting in such capacity, for the
satisfaction of any obligations to be performed by the any of the Buyers and
the Buyer Representative will not look to the Sellers for any of the Buyers
indemnification obligations hereunder. In performing any of its obligations
under this Agreement or any agreements or documents executed and delivered in

for any losses that such Person may incur as a result of any act, or failure
to act, by the Buyer Representative under this Agreement or any agreements or
documents executed and delivered in connection herewith, and the Buyer

losses, except to the extent that the actions or omissions of the Buyer
Representative were taken or omitted not at the direction of the Buyers or
otherwise in good faith. The limitation of liability and indemnification
provisions of this _Section 11.1(b)_ will survive the

 



      
 

 



 

termination of this Agreement. In the event the Buyer Representative
dissolves, is no longer an Affiliate of the Portfolio Companies or for any
other reason cannot fulfill the obligations set forth in this _Section 11.2_,
the Buyers agree to appoint a new entity as the successor Buyer Representative
within ten (10) Business Days of such event.

 



 

(c) The appointment of the Buyer Representative is coupled with an interest
and may not be revoked in whole or in part. Such appointment shall be binding
upon the officers, directors, security holders, successors and assigns of each
of the Buyers. All decisions of the Buyer Representative shall be final and
binding on all of the Buyers and no securityholder shall have the right to
object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. The Buyers shall be
entitled to rely upon, without independent investigation, any act, notice,
instruction or communication from the Buyer Representative and any document
executed by the Buyer Representative on behalf of any of the Buyers and shall
be fully protected in connection with any action or inaction taken or omitted
to be taken in reliance thereon.

Section 11.4 _Assignment_. No Party shall assign this Agreement or any part
hereof, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of
the other Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Buyers may, without
the prior written consent of the other Parties, assign their rights and
obligations under this Agreement in whole or in part to any one or more
Affiliates of the Buyers, but in no event shall such assignment relieve the
Buyers of any of their obligations under this Agreement, and (ii) each of the
Sellers may, without the prior written consent of the other Parties, assign
its rights and obligations under this Agreement in whole or in part to any one
or more Affiliates of such Seller, provided that any such Affiliate assumes
all of the obligations of such Seller under this Agreement and only if the
Seller Guarantor guarantees all obligations of such Affiliate under this
Agreement. Any attempted assignment in violation of this _Section 11.4_ shall
be void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective permitted successors
and assigns.

 



 

Section 11.5 _Rights of Third Parties_. Except for the provisions of _Article
IX_, which are intended to be enforceable by the Persons respectively referred
to therein, nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement is intended or
shall be construed to confer upon or give any Person, other than the Parties
and their permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.6 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, each Party shall
bear its own expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby whether or not such transactions shall be
consummated, including all fees of its legal counsel, financial advisors and
accountants.

 



 

Section 11.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Any facsimile or
electronic copies hereof or signatures hereon shall, for all purposes, be
deemed originals.

 



 

Section 11.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Disclosure
Schedules and exhibits to this Agreement), the Letter Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the Parties
and supersede any other agreements, whether written or oral, that may have
been made or entered into by or among any

 



      
 

 



 

of the Parties or any of their respective Affiliates relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby. No representations, warranties, covenants,
understandings or agreements, oral or otherwise, relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement exist between the Buyers or their Affiliates,
on the one hand, and the Sellers or their Affiliates, on the other hand,
except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or in any document delivered
at Closing.

 



 

Section 11.9 _Disclosure Schedules_. Unless the context otherwise requires,
all capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Schedules shall have the
respective meanings assigned to such terms in this Agreement. No reference to
or disclosure of any item or other matter in the Disclosure Schedules shall be
construed as an admission or indication that such item or other matter is
material or that such item or other matter is required to be referred to or
disclosed in the Disclosure Schedules. No disclosure in the Disclosure
Schedules relating to any possible breach or violation of any agreement or Law
shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or
violation exists or has actually occurred. The inclusion of any information in
the Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed to be an admission or
acknowledgment by the Sellers that in and of itself, such information is
material to or outside the ordinary course of the business of the Portfolio
Companies or is required to be disclosed on the Disclosure Schedules. Each
numbered Schedule in the Disclosure Schedules qualifies only the
correspondingly numbered representation, warranty or covenant to the extent
specified therein and such other representations, warranties or covenants to
the extent a matter in such numbered Schedule is disclosed in such a way as to
make its relevance to such other representation, warranty or covenant
reasonably apparent.

 



 

Section 11.10 _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended or supplemented at
any time by additional written agreements signed by each Party hereto, as may
mutually be determined by the Parties to be necessary, desirable or expedient
to further the purpose of this Agreement or to clarify the intention of the
Parties.

 



 

Section 11.11 _Publicity_. No Party or any Affiliate or Representative of such
Party shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or public
announcement or otherwise communicate with any news media in respect of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written
consent of the other Parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by Law or
applicable securities exchange rules and except with respect to customary
investor and analyst presentations, meetings and conference calls, in which
case, the Party issuing or publishing such press release or making such public
announcement shall provide, to the extent reasonably practicable, the other
Parties with a copy of such press release or public announcement (including
any slides or transcripts to be used in any investor or analyst presentation
or conference) in advance of its issuing or publishing such press release or
making such public announcement, as applicable.

 



 

Section 11.12 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any Law or as a matter of public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision contained herein is, to any extent, invalid or
unenforceable in any respect under the

 



      
 

 



 

Laws governing this Agreement, the Parties to this Agreement shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 



 

Section 11.13 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of New York (without regard to the conflict of laws
principles thereof). Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that any legal
action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be brought and determined in any state or federal
court in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, and each of the Parties
hereto irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts solely
in respect of any legal proceeding arising out of or related to this
Agreement. The Parties further agree that the Parties shall not bring suit
with respect to any disputes arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby in any court or jurisdiction other than the above
specified courts; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not limit
the rights of the Parties to obtain execution of judgment in any other
jurisdiction. The Parties further agree, to the extent permitted by Law, that
a final and unappealable judgment against a Party in any action or proceeding
contemplated above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other
jurisdiction within or outside the United States by suit on the judgment, a
certified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of
such judgment. The Parties agree that all judicial determinations or findings
by a state or federal court in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York
with respect to any matter under this Agreement shall be binding.

 



 

(b) To the extent that any Party hereto has or hereafter may acquire any
immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether
through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property,
each such Party hereby irrevocably (i) waives such immunity in respect of its
obligations with respect to this Agreement and (ii) submits to the personal
jurisdiction of any court described in this _Section 11.13_.

 



 

(c) THE PARTIES HERETO AGREE THAT THEY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION TO ENFORCE OR INTERPRET THE PROVISIONS OF THIS
AGREEMENT.

 



 

Section 11.14 _Specific Performance_. Each Party agrees that the other Parties
would suffer irreparable damage in the event that there has been a material
breach by such Party of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in
this Agreement and that any remedy at law for any such breach would be
inadequate. Accordingly, it is agreed that in the event of such a breach, the
non-breaching Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any state or federal
court in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, in addition to any
other remedies it may have at law or in equity.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 11.15 _No Consequential Damages_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE
CONTRARY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT OR AS PROVIDED FOR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE LAW,
NO PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT
LIABILITY, OTHER LAW OR OTHERWISE AND WHETHER OR NOT ARISING FROM ANY OTHER
PARTYS SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT;
_PROVIDED_ THAT THE FOREGOING SHALL NOT APPLY TO THIRD PARTY CLAIMS FOR WHICH
ONE PARTY IS OBLIGATED TO INDEMNIFY THE OTHER PARTY HEREUNDER.

 



 

[SIGNATURE PAGE FOLLOWS]

 



     

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
each Party as of the date first above written.

receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto
hereby agree as follows:

 



 

1. _Guaranty._

 



 

(a) For value received and in consideration of the transactions contemplated
by the Purchase and Sale Agreement and the Letter Agreement, Guarantor
absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees for the benefit of each
of the Beneficiaries and their permitted successors and assigns, the full and
prompt payment of all payment obligations of (i) the Sellers under the

the " ** _Guaranteed Obligations_** ") as and when the same shall become due
in accordance with the Purchase and Sale Agreement, the Letter Agreement and
the Transition Services Agreement, as applicable. Guarantor hereby agrees that
this Guaranty is an absolute guaranty of payment and is not a guaranty of
collection.

 



 

(b) Any and all payments by Guarantor hereunder shall be made free and clear
of, and without reduction for, any and all taxes, levies, imposts, deductions,
charges, withholdings, and all stamp or documentary taxes, excise taxes, ad
valorem taxes and other taxes, charges or levies which arise from the payment
of Guarantor hereunder.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary:

 



 

(i) Guarantor shall not be required to make a payment in respect of any
Guaranteed Obligation while the validity and existence of such Guaranteed
Obligation is being disputed in good faith by any Seller in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, the Letter
Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement, as applicable; and

 



 

(ii) Guarantors liability in respect of any Guaranteed Obligation shall not
exceed the liability of any Seller with respect to such Guaranteed Obligation
under the Purchase and Sale Agreement, the Letter Agreement or the Transition
Services Agreement, as applicable.

 



      
 

 



 

2. _Obligations Absolute and Unconditional._ Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations under this Guaranty shall be irrevocable, continuing, absolute, and unconditional, irrespective of, and the Guaranteed Obligations of Guarantor shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise effected by, and Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses to enforcement it may have (now in the future) by reason of:

 



 

(a) the illegality, lack of validity, enforceability, avoidance, or
subordination of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Purchase and Sale
Agreement, the Letter Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement;

 



 

(b) the absence of any attempt by, or on behalf of, any of the Beneficiaries,
to collect, or to take any other action to enforce, all or any part of the
Guaranteed Obligations whether from or against any Seller or any other Person;

 



 

(c) the election of any remedy available under the Purchase and Sale
Agreement, the Letter Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement or
applicable Laws by, or on behalf of, any of the Beneficiaries with respect to
all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations;

 



 

(d) the waiver, consent, extension, forbearance or granting of any indulgence
by, or on behalf of, any of the Beneficiaries, with respect to any provision
of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, the Letter Agreement or the Transition
Services Agreement;

 



 

(e) any change in the legal or beneficial ownership, or the existence or
structure as a partnership or other entity, of any Seller or any other Person
now or hereafter liable with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations
(including, without limitation, any consolidation or amalgamation with, any
merger with or into, or any transfer of all or substantially all the assets of
such Seller or such other Person to, another Person);

 



 

(f) the disallowance, under Section 502 of the Chapter 11 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code (the " ** _Bankruptcy Code_** "), of all or any portion of the
claims against any Seller held by any of the Beneficiaries, for payment of all
or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations;

 



 

(g) the operation of the automatic stay under Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy
Code with respect to any Seller; or

 



 

(h) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any other circumstance
whatsoever that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or
defense of a surety or guarantor.

 



 

3. _Enforcement; Application of Payments._ In the case of any failure by any Seller to pay any Guaranteed Obligation in accordance with the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, the Letter Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement, as applicable, Guarantor hereby agrees that, upon receipt of written notice from the Buyer Representative, on behalf of the Beneficiaries, of such failure, Guarantor will promptly make payment of such Guaranteed Obligations owing to the Beneficiaries to the Buyer Representative for the benefit of the Beneficiaries, without first proceeding against such Seller or any other Person. Any amounts

 



      
 

 



 

received by the Buyer Representative hereunder shall be applied to the
Guaranteed Obligations.

 



 

4. _Waivers and Acknowledgments._

 



 

(a) Guarantor unconditionally and irrevocably hereby waives any right to
revoke this Guaranty, diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of
claims with a court in the event of receivership or bankruptcy of any Seller
or any other Person (other than Guarantor to the extent required by the
Bankruptcy Code), protest or notice with respect to the Guaranteed
Obligations, all presentments, demands for performance, notices of
nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and notices
of acceptance of this Guaranty, and all other notices or demands whatsoever
(and shall not require that the same be made on any Seller as a condition
precedent to Guarantors obligations hereunder).

 



 

(b) The Beneficiaries and the Buyer Representative are hereby authorized,
without notice or demand and without affecting the liability of Guarantor
hereunder, from time to time, (i) to renew, extend, accelerate or otherwise
change the time for payment of, or other terms relating to, all or any part of
the Guaranteed Obligations, or to otherwise modify, amend or change the terms
of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, the Letter Agreement or the Transition
Services Agreement (including, in each case, the addition or substitution of
any Person now or hereafter liable with respect to any Guaranteed Obligation);
(ii) to accept partial payments on all or any part of the Guaranteed
Obligations; (iii) to take and hold security or collateral for the payment of
all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, this Guaranty, or any other
guaranties of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations; (iv) to exchange,
enforce, waive and release any such security or collateral; (v) to apply such
security or collateral and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as in
its discretion it may determine; and (vi) to settle, release, exchange,
enforce, waive, compromise or collect or otherwise liquidate all or any part
of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other guaranty of all or any part of the
Guaranteed Obligations, and any security or collateral for the Guaranteed
Obligations or for any such guaranty, irrespective of the effect on the
contribution or subrogation rights of Guarantor. Any of the foregoing may be
done in any manner, without affecting or impairing the obligations of
Guarantor hereunder.

 



 

5. _Reinstatement._ Guarantor further agrees that, to the extent that any Seller makes a payment or payments of Guaranteed Obligations to any of the Beneficiaries or to the Buyer Representative for the benefit of the Beneficiaries, which payment or payments of Guaranteed Obligations, or any part thereof are subsequently rescinded, invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or required to be repaid to such Seller, or its trustee, receiver or any other party, including, without limitation, Guarantor under any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then, to the extent of such payment or repayment, the part of the Guaranteed Obligations which has been paid, reduced or satisfied by such amount shall be reinstated and continued in full force and effect as of the time immediately preceding such initial payment, reduction or satisfaction.

 



 

6. _Subrogation._ Guarantor will not exercise any rights that it may acquire by way of subrogation under this Guaranty, by any payment made hereunder or otherwise, until all of the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been paid in full. If any amount shall be paid to Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time when all of the Guaranteed

 



      
 

 



 

Obligations shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall be held in
trust for the benefit of the Beneficiaries and shall forthwith be paid to the
Buyer Representative for the benefit of the Beneficiaries to be credited and
applied to such Guaranteed Obligations in accordance with the terms of the
Purchase and Sale Agreement, the Letter Agreement or the Transition Services
Agreement, as applicable. If (i) Guarantor shall make payment to the Buyer
Representative of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations and (ii) all
of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be paid in full, the Buyer Representative,
on behalf of the Beneficiaries, will, at Guarantors request and expense,
execute and deliver, or will cause to be executed and delivered, to Guarantor
appropriate documents, without recourse and without representation or
warranty, necessary to evidence the transfer by subrogation to Guarantor of an
interest in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from such payment by
Guarantor.

 



 

7. _Enforcement; Amendments; Waivers._ No delay on the part of any Beneficiary or the Buyer Representative in the exercise of any right or remedy arising under this Guaranty, the Purchase and Sale Agreement, the Letter Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement or otherwise with respect to all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations shall operate as a waiver thereof, and no single or partial exercise by any Beneficiary or the Buyer Representative of any such right or remedy shall preclude any further exercise thereof. No modification or waiver of any of the provisions of this Guaranty shall be binding upon the Beneficiaries, the Buyer Representative or Guarantor, except as expressly set forth in a writing duly signed and delivered by the Buyer Representative, on behalf of the Beneficiaries, and Guarantor.

Upon any such delegation and assumption of obligations, Guarantor shall be relieved of and fully discharged from all obligations hereunder, whether such obligations arose before or after such delegation and assumption.

 



 

11. _Governing Law._ This Guaranty shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York, without regard to any conflict of laws provisions thereof that would result in the application of the Law of another Jurisdiction.

agreements contained in this Agreement and in the Purchase Agreement, and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

 



      
 

 



 

1. _Term and Services_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall become effective as of the date hereof, except for
the provisions of Sections 1(b), 1(c) (other than the last sentence thereof,
which shall become effective as of the date hereof), 2, 3(a), 3(b), 4(a), 4(b)
and 7 of this Agreement, which shall become effective as of the Closing Date,
unless otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, and, unless sooner

(the " ** _Service Period_** "), (i) Service Provider shall provide to the
Buyers and each of the Portfolio Companies the Services, and (ii) APH, Funding
and TOS shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Caithness to

End Date, as defined below) and the Caithness Administrative Services to the
Facilities pursuant to the Administrative Services Agreement, as applicable.

 



 

(c) From and after the Closing Date, each of the Sellers, the Seller
Representative and APH hereby waives, on behalf of each of the Sellers and any
of their Affiliates party thereto, any obligations of Caithness set forth in
the Caithness Operative Agreements with respect to confidentiality (including

to provide information to the Buyers relating to any services that Caithness
has performed under the Caithness Operative Agreements for the Portfolio
Companies or the Facilities. Following the Closing Date, each of the Sellers,
the Seller Representative and APH shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to have Caithness and its Affiliates provide to the Buyers as soon as

Portfolio Companies or the Facilities under the Caithness Operative

End Date_**")), and Caithness shall not be liable for failure to perform any
Caithness Services for which such Books and Records would be required and are
not available to Caithness as a result of its obligation to turn over such
books and records to the Buyers. From and after the Closing Date, each of the
Sellers, the Seller Representative and APH agrees to provide and agrees that
Caithness may provide, and hereby waives any restrictions set forth in the
Caithness Operative Agreements that would restrict Caithness from providing
information relating to any services that Caithness has performed under the
Caithness Operative Agreements for the Portfolio Companies or the Facilities.
At all times from the date hereof until the end of the Service Period or, if
earlier, the Applicable OandM Services End Date, the Sellers and APH shall, and
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause Caithness to, grant
the Buyers access to the employees of Caithness or its Affiliates performing

for the purpose of interviewing, making offers and otherwise transitioning
such employees to the Buyers or the Buyers selected service provider.

 



 

2. _Fees, Reimbursable Costs and Payment_.

 



 

(a) _Fees_. The Buyers shall pay, or cause the Portfolio Companies to pay, to
the Seller Representative, a flat fee of $2,500 per Service Month (as
hereinafter defined) for each Service Month following the Closing Date (the "
** _Fees_** "). As used herein, the term " ** _Service Month_** " shall mean
the thirty (30) day period beginning on the Closing Date and each successive
thirty (30) day period thereafter until the end of the Service Period. If, due
to early termination of this Agreement, a Service Month is less than thirty
(30) days, the Fees with respect to such Service Month shall be payable on a
pro rata basis based on the number of days in such Service Month.

 



 

(b) _Reimbursable Costs_. The Buyers shall pay, or cause the Portfolio
Companies to pay, (i) to the Seller Representative, the reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses actually incurred by Service Provider during each
Service Month related to the Services provided to the Buyers or the Portfolio
Companies, and (ii) to Caithness, (x) all amounts due and owing to Caithness
from or on behalf of the Sellers, APH, TOS, Funding, the Portfolio Companies
or the Buyers pursuant to the Caithness Side Letter, including without
limitation pursuant to Section 3, Section 5, Section 6 and Section 7 thereof,
except for that amount identified in Section 6.d. of the Caithness Side Letter
payable to Caithness to cover a portion of Mr. Collins severance benefits,
the amount of any liabilities of the Sellers, APH, TOS, Funding or any of
their Affiliates related to or arising out of the breach of their obligations
under the Caithness Operative Agreements or claims made by the Buyers or their
Affiliates in connection with the Caithness Services and $25,000 of that
amount identified in Section 7 of the Caithness Side Letter payable to
Caithness for services provided by Caithness to the Sellers outside the scope
of the Caithness Services, and (y) the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses actually incurred by Caithness during such Service Month related to
the Caithness Services provided to the Buyers or the Portfolio Companies,
including (1) any costs, fees and expenses arising pursuant to the Caithness
Operative Agreements (to extent not duplicative of (x) above), and (2) such
costs arising out of and including the transfer of connectivity and
information technology infrastructure (including the procurement system, work
management system and inventory system, but not including any such
connectivity or infrastructure provided by the Buyers) used to perform the
Services or the Caithness Services (the " ** _Reimbursable Costs_** "),
accompanied by commercially reasonable documentation supporting the
Reimbursable Costs. The Reimbursable Costs shall be due and payable in
accordance with _Section 2(c)_ below. The Seller Representative shall provide
advance written notice to the Buyers if Service Provider engages any third
party to help provide Services or Caithness engages any third party to help
provide Caithness Services, in each case where the costs and expenses of such
third party would constitute Reimbursable Costs.

 



 

(c) _Payment_. Within five (5) days after the end of each Service Month, the
Seller Representative shall submit to the Buyer Representative a written
invoice relating to the Fees and the Reimbursable Costs. The Buyers shall pay,
or cause the Portfolio Companies to pay, within thirty (30) days following the
date of receipt of such invoice, all invoiced amounts related to the Services

Date), comply with (x) as may be provided under the OandM Agreements or the
Caithness Operative Agreements, as applicable, the written instructions and
policies of any of the Buyers, the Portfolio Companies or the Buyer
Representative which have been provided to the Seller Representative and (y)
any applicable Permits and Laws relating to the Services or the Caithness

APH shall not, and shall cause each of TOS and Funding not to, terminate
pursuant to the Caithness Operative Agreements the provision by Caithness of
any of the Caithness Services to the Facilities unless such termination is
requested in writing by the Buyer Representative. APH shall, and shall cause
each of TOS and Funding to, copy the Buyer Representative on, or promptly
provide the Buyer Representative with copies of, any correspondence regarding
the foregoing that it or they may have with Caithness. The Buyers acknowledge

actions contemplated in this Agreement relating to Caithness and the Caithness
Services.

Administrative Services, as applicable, shall not reduce the fees payable to
Caithness hereunder and under the

 



      
 

 



 

Caithness Operative Agreements during the Service Period; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that, in the event of any termination of the Caithness OandM

Agreement.

 



 

5. _Employee Transfer_.

 



 

(a) The Buyers (or an entity designated by the Buyers) (the " ** _New O andM
Provider_**") shall offer employment to each of the employees of Caithness
Generation Services, LLC (" ** _CGS_** ") as set forth on __Exhibit A__ to
the Caithness Side Letter (the " ** _Employees_** ") no later than thirty (30)
days, or such longer notice period required by law, prior to the first to
occur of (i) the Applicable OandM Services End Date and (ii) the Services End
Date (as defined in the Caithness Side Letter) (as to each such respective
Employee, the " ** _Transfer Date_** "), with annual compensation and benefits
that are, in the aggregate, substantially similar to each such respective
Employees compensation and benefits as of the date of this Agreement on an
overall economic basis; _provided_ , that the Buyers (or an entity designed by
the Buyers) shall have no obligation to offer employment, to any Employee set
forth on __Exhibit A__ to the Caithness Side Letter who (A) has engaged in
gross negligence, gross incompetence or willful misconduct in the performance
of his or her duties, (B) has willfully engaged in conduct that is injurious
to the Portfolio Companies (monetarily or otherwise), (C) has failed to adhere

service provider) or (G) is on long-term disability; _provided_ , that with
respect to any Employee on short-term disability, the Buyers offer of
employment to such Employee may be conditioned upon their return to regular
employment prior to the Applicable OandM Services End Date. The parties hereby
acknowledge that the Buyers will perform background checks on the Employees
and, if any issue arises with respect to any Employee in connection with such
background check, the Buyers will consider such issue in good faith in
conjunction with the Sellers. Upon such consideration, if the Buyers decide
not to hire such Employee, the Sellers shall pay to Caithness the amount
contemplated in clause (ii) below of this Section 5(a) with respect to such
Employee. Each Employee who accepts such offer (the " ** _Transferred
Employees_** ") shall be transferred to the New OandM Provider effective not
later than the Transfer Date applicable to such Employee. The Buyers agree and
acknowledge that any Employee who is not made an offer, does not accept such
offer or is otherwise not transferred to the New OandM Provider shall be
terminated by CGS as of the Applicable OandM Services End Date (as defined in
the Caithness Side Letter) (" ** _Terminated Employees_** "). Buyers agree and
acknowledge that if the Buyers do not offer employment to an Employee in
accordance with the terms of this paragraph (each such Employee, a " ** _Non-
Offer Employee_** "), then CGS shall notify each such Employee no later than
thirty (30) days, or such longer notice period required by law, prior to the
date such Non-Offer Employees employment shall be terminated in accordance
with the terms of the Caithness Side Letter. In such case, the Buyers shall
(i) continue to pay, or cause to be paid to, Caithness an amount representing
pay and benefits for each Non-Offer Employee through the date that such Non-
Offer Employees employment is terminated in accordance with the terms of the
Caithness Side Letter; and (ii) shall pay, or cause to be paid to, Caithness
an amount for each Non-Offer Employee equal to the product of (x) one week of
pay and benefits for each such Non-Offer Employee, and (y) the number of years
of service of such Non-Offer Employee, in each instance of (i) and (ii), in
readily available funds, on the date such Non-Offer Employees employment is
terminated in accordance with the terms of the Caithness Side Letter.
__Exhibit A__ to the Caithness Side Letter sets forth a list of all employees
who provide services to the Facilities pursuant to the Caithness Operative
Agreements.

 



 

(b) From the date of this Agreement though the Services End Date (as defined
in the Caithness Side Letter), each of the Sellers and APH shall, and shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause Caithness to, only incur
compensation, severance, benefits costs and related payroll costs relating to
the Employees, Transferred Employees and Terminated Employees that are in the
ordinary course of business and consistent with the Sellers, APHs and
Caithness past practices with respect to the Employees, and the Sellers and
APH shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause Caithness to seek
any consents of APH, TOS or Funding required under the Caithness Operative
Agreements; provided, that, other than the severance for Non-Offer Employees
from Caithness described in Section 6.a(ii) of the Caithness Side Letter, the
Seller and APH shall not, and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
to cause Caithness not to, incur any severance costs, retention bonus costs or
any related costs, in the case of the Sellers and APH, without the prior
written consent of the Buyer Representative, and in the case of Caithness,
without the prior written consent of APH, TOS or Funding. The Buyers shall pay
to Caithness all compensation, severance, benefit costs and related payroll
costs relating to the Employees, Transferred Employees and Terminated
Employees, including but not limited to all pre-Transfer Date costs and any
post-termination costs, solely to the extent such costs are incurred in
accordance with the terms of the Caithness Side Letter, and the Buyers shall

 



      
 

 



 

indemnify Service Provider from and against such costs and any Losses relating
to such Employees, Transferred Employees and Terminated Employees.

 



 

(c) The Buyers acknowledge and agree that Service Provider shall not be deemed
to be in violation of this Agreement if Service Provider is unable to cause
Caithness to provide the Caithness Services under this Agreement consistent
with past practices as a result of any Employee resigning his or her
employment prior to the Transfer Date; _provided_ , that neither Service
Provider nor Caithness shall have caused or induced such Employee to resign.

 



 

(d) The Buyers, or an entity designated by the Buyers, shall consider hiring
Kevin Collins, an employee of Caithness Corporation, with compensation and
benefits for Mr. Collins that are, in the aggregate, substantially similar to
his current compensation and benefits. The parties acknowledge that the Buyers
shall not have an obligation to make such an offer, or hire, Mr. Collins.

 



 

6. _Relationships Among the Parties_. Service Provider shall be an independent contractor with respect to the Services it provides hereunder. Nothing in this Agreement shall cause the relationship between Service Provider, on the one hand, and the Buyers, the Portfolio Companies and the Buyer Representative, on the other hand, to be deemed to constitute an agency, partnership or joint venture, or to cause any of Service Provider, the Buyers, the Portfolio Companies or the Buyer Representative to be treated as a co-employer with respect to employees, or to cause any of the Sellers or APH or any of their Affiliates to have any burdens or obligations of ownership or similar responsibilities with respect to the Facilities after the Closing. None of the Sellers, APH, any of their or its Affiliates or any of their respective officers or employees shall have any right, power or authority to make any warranty or representation on behalf of any of the Buyers or, after the Closing, the Portfolio Companies, contract for the Buyers or, after the Closing, the Portfolio Companies, or commit the Buyers or, after the Closing, the Portfolio Companies to any obligation or undertaking other than actions taken reasonably by the Sellers or APH in connection with an emergency situation of which any of the Sellers or APH notify the Buyer Representative within a reasonable time after its occurrence (and the Buyers or the Portfolio Companies shall indemnify the Sellers and APH for all reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket costs, expenses and liabilities incurred in connection with such emergency response).

(as defined below) arising from or in connection with (i) a breach of this
Agreement by the Buyers or, after the Closing, the Portfolio Companies or (ii)

breach of this Agreement by any of the Sellers, the Seller Representative, APH
or Service Provider, EVEN IF SUCH LOSSES ARISE OUT OF THE SOLE, JOINT OR

INDEMNIFIED PARTY, BUT EXCLUDING SUCH LOSSES TO THE EXTENT RESULTING FROM THE

OTHER SERVICE PROVIDER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT TO THE BUYER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES,
FOR ANY ACT, OMISSION OR OTHERWISE OF THE SELLERS, APH OR ANY OTHER SERVICE

THIS AGREEMENT), SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF FEES RECEIVED BY THE
SELLER REPRESENTATIVE PURSUANT TO SECTION 2(A) FOR THE SERVICES (EXCLUDING
PAYMENTS RECEIVED BY THE SELLER REPRESENTATIVE IN REIMBURSEMENT OF PAYMENTS
MADE OR TO BE MADE BY THE SELLERS AND APH TO CAITHNESS FOR THE CAITHNESS
SERVICES, VENDORS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES).

 



 

(e) _Waiver_. IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE TO ANOTHER PARTY FOR
SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE LOSSES, DAMAGES OR
