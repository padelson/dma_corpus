amounts as to which Freeport disagrees, and Freeport shall be deemed to have
agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Closing Report.

(c) If a notice of disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to Section

use their good faith efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or
amounts in order to determine, as may be required, the amount of Closing Cash
(which amount shall not be less than the amount thereof shown in Buyer's
calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.03(a) or more than the amount
thereof shown in Freeport's calculation delivered pursuant to Section
2.03(b)). If Buyer and Freeport are unable to reach such agreement during such

be borne equally by Buyer and Freeport.

(d) Buyer and Freeport agree that they will, and agree to cause their
respective independent accountants and the Company to, reasonably cooperate
and assist in the preparation of the Closing Report and the calculation of
Closing Cash, in the resolution of any amounts or items of dispute and the

exceeds Final Closing Cash, Freeport shall pay to Buyer, an amount equal to
70% of such excess. "Final Closing Cash" means the amount of Closing Cash (i)

performance by each of Buyer and Buyer Guarantor of each of the Transaction
Agreements to which it is or will be a party and the consummation by each of
Buyer and Buyer Guarantor of the transactions contemplated thereby are within
its corporate powers and, except for the required approval of Buyer
Guarantor's shareholders in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of Buyer and Buyer Guarantor. The
affirmative vote of the holders of 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of Buyer
Guarantor's capital stock, voting as a single class, is the only vote of the
holders of Buyer Guarantor's capital stock necessary in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Required
Shareholder Approval"). The shares of Buyer Guarantor held by Buyer
Guarantor's shareholders that delivered the Voting Commitment constitute 63.1%
of the outstanding shares of Buyer Guarantor. Each Transaction Agreement to
which Buyer or Buyer Guarantor is or will be a party constitutes, or will
constitute when executed, a valid and binding agreement of Buyer or Buyer
Guarantor, as applicable, enforceable against Buyer or Buyer Guarantor, as
applicable, in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by the Enforceability Exceptions.

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, the Buyer Guarantor's Board of
Directors has (i) unanimously determined that this Agreement and the

Buyer Guarantor's shareholders, (ii) unanimously approved, adopted and
declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and

Agreement by its shareholders.



Section 4.03. Governmental Authorization. The execution, delivery and
performance by each of Buyer and Buyer Guarantor of each of the Transaction
Agreements to which it is or will be a party and the consummation by Buyer and
Buyer Guarantor of the transactions contemplated thereby require no action by
or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority other than
Antitrust Laws with respect to the People's Republic of China, South Africa,
Turkey and Zambia, (b) the Required BMA Approval, (c) receipt of the Required
PRC Approvals and (d) any such action or filing as to which the failure to
make or obtain would not reasonably be expected to impair in any material
respect Buyer's or Buyer Guarantor's ability to perform its obligations under
any Transaction Agreement to which it is or will be a party.

Section 4.04. Noncontravention. The execution, delivery and performance by
each of Buyer and Buyer Guarantor of the Transaction Agreements to which it is
or will be a party and the consummation by Buyer and Buyer Guarantor of the
transactions contemplated thereby do not and will not (a) violate the
organizational documents of Buyer or Buyer Guarantor, (b) assuming compliance
with the matters referred to in Section 4.03, violate any Applicable Law or
authorization, approval, consent or waiver from a Governmental Authority, (c)
require any consent or other action by any Person under, constitute a default
under, or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration
of any right or obligation of either of Buyer or Buyer Guarantor or to a loss
of any benefit to which either of Buyer or Buyer Guarantor is entitled under
any provision of any Contract binding upon either Buyer or Buyer Guarantor
(whether after the filing of notice or the lapse of time or both) or (d)
result in the creation or imposition of any material Lien on any asset of
Buyer, with only such exceptions, in the case of clauses (b) through (d), as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
materially impair Buyer's or Buyer Guarantor's ability to perform its
obligations under the Transaction Agreements.

Section 4.05. Financing. Buyer has, and has delivered evidence to Freeport
that it has, sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other sources of
immediately available funds to enable it to make payment of the Purchase Price
and any other amounts to be paid by it hereunder.

Section 4.06. Purchase for Investment. Buyer is purchasing the Subject Shares
for investment for its own account and not with a view to, or for sale in
connection with, any distribution thereof. Buyer (either alone or together
with its advisors) has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its
investment in the Subject Shares and is capable of bearing the economic risks
of such investment.





Section 4.07. Litigation. There is no Proceeding pending against or, to the
knowledge of Buyer, threatened against or affecting Buyer before any
Governmental Authority or arbitrator which in any manner challenges or seeks
to prevent, enjoin, alter or materially delay the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Agreements.

Section 4.08. Finders' Fees. There is no investment banker, broker, finder or
other intermediary that has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf
of Buyer who might be entitled to any fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements.

Section 4.09. Inspections; No Other Representations. Except as expressly set
forth in Article 3, Buyer agrees to accept the Subject Shares and the Company
and its Subsidiaries in the condition they are in on the Closing Date based
upon its own inspection, examination and determination with respect thereto as
to all matters and without reliance upon any express or implied
representations or warranties of any nature made by or on behalf of or imputed
to Freeport. Except as provided in Article 3, Buyer acknowledges that neither

of its Affiliates. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer

business and operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) any
other information or documents made available to Buyer or its counsel,
accountants or advisors with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or their respective businesses or operations, except as set forth in Article
3. Except as provided in this Article 4, neither Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates, nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
stockholders, partners, members or representatives has made, or is making, any
representation or warranty whatsoever to Freeport or any of its Affiliates.

(a) From the date hereof until the first anniversary of the Closing or the
termination of this Agreement (and, in the case of all material written, oral
or other information obtained in confidence from Buyer in connection with any

as applicable), Freeport shall maintain in confidence, and will cause its
Affiliates and its and their respective representatives to maintain in
confidence all confidential or proprietary written, oral, or other information
obtained in confidence from Buyer in connection with this Agreement or the
other Transaction Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, except to the extent that such information (i) was previously known
on a nonconfidential basis by Freeport, (ii) is or becomes in the public
domain through no fault of Freeport, (iii) is later lawfully acquired by
Freeport from sources other than Buyer or (iv) is required to be disclosed by

administrative process or by other requirements of Applicable Law or a
national securities exchange, all confidential documents and information
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries provided to it pursuant to Section
6.02. Freeport will be liable for a breach by its representatives of such
confidentiality obligations. In the event Freeport is compelled to disclose by
judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of Applicable Law
or a national securities exchange, to the extent practicable, Freeport shall
give Buyer reasonable prior written notice (unless less time is required by
Applicable Law or the applicable rules or regulations of any securities
exchange or legal process) before disclosing any of the said confidential
documents and information and, in making such disclosures, Freeport shall, and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its representatives to,
disclose only that portion thereof required to be disclosed by the applicable
judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of Applicable Law
or a national securities exchange and, at Buyers' request, shall take
commercially reasonable steps, at Buyer's expense, to preserve the
confidentiality thereof, including supporting Buyer in obtaining protective
Orders.

Section 5.05. Intercompany Obligations. All Intercompany Obligations that are
outstanding as of the Closing shall be settled in the ordinary course of

cause the Company to transmit a notification to Tenke Holdings Ltd. of the
Transaction pursuant to Section 9.1 of the TFHL JVSA, which notification, when
received, shall constitute a 1st Offer (as such term is defined in the TFHL

ARTICLE 6 
COVENANTS OF BUYER

Buyer agrees that:

Section 6.01. Buyer Confidentiality. Any information provided by Freeport, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates and representatives to Buyer or
its Affiliates and representatives in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be subject to the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with
its terms until the Closing (at which time the parties agree it shall
terminate automatically and be of no further force and effect without any
further action required by either party thereto).

Section 6.02. Access. Buyer will cause the Company and its Subsidiaries, on
and after the Closing Date for a period of seven years, to afford promptly to
Freeport and its agents reasonable access to their properties, books, records,
employees and auditors to the extent necessary to permit Freeport to determine
any matter relating to its rights and obligations hereunder or to any period
ending on or before the Closing Date; provided that any such access by
Freeport shall not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of
Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries and shall be afforded after reasonable
advance notice. In addition, Buyer will cause the Company after the Closing
Date to provide financial information to Freeport with respect to the fiscal
quarter and month or portions thereof ending on or prior to the Closing Date,
in a manner and within a time period consistent with the Company's and its
Subsidiaries' past practice, in order to enable Freeport to satisfy its
financial reporting obligations with respect to such pre-Closing periods.

Section 6.03. Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation; Nonassertion of
Attorney-Client Privilege. (a) Buyer waives and will not assert, and agrees to
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to waive and not to assert, any
conflict of interest arising out of or relating to the representation, after
the Closing (the "Post-Closing Representation"), of Freeport or any of its
Affiliates or any shareholder, officer, employee or director of any of them or
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (any such Person, a "Designated
Person") in any matter



involving the Transaction Agreements or any other Contracts or transactions
contemplated thereby, by any legal counsel currently representing Freeport,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Transaction
Agreements or any other Contracts or transactions contemplated thereby (the
"Current Representation").

(b) Solely in connection with disputes with Freeport regarding the Transaction
Agreements or any other Contract or transactions contemplated thereby, Buyer
waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to waive and to not assert, any attorney-client privilege with
respect to any communication between any legal counsel and any Designated
Person occurring during the Current Representation in connection with any
Post-Closing Representation, it being the intention of the parties hereto that
all such rights to such attorney-client privilege and to control such
attorney-client privilege shall be retained by Freeport; provided that the
foregoing waiver and acknowledgement of retention shall not extend to any
communication not involving the Transaction Agreements or any other Contracts
or transactions contemplated thereby, or to communications with any Person
other than the Designated Persons and their advisers.

Section 6.04. Right of First Offer. (a) If, following the Closing (but subject
to Section 6.06(a)), Buyer or one of its Affiliates desires to Transfer any
Subject Shares or other securities, in either case directly or indirectly
constituting a controlling interest in TFHL or TFM (or their respective
successors and assigns) (each a "Qualifying Transfer"), Buyer shall give
notice (an "Offer Notice") to Freeport that Buyer or its applicable Affiliate
desires to make such a Transfer and that sets forth the number and kind of
Subject Shares or other securities proposed to be Transferred by Buyer or its
applicable Affiliate (the "Offered Securities"), the cash price per share that
Buyer or its applicable Affiliate proposes to be paid for such Offered
Securities (the "Offer Price") and all other material terms sought by Buyer or
its applicable Affiliate.

(b) The giving of an Offer Notice to Freeport shall constitute an offer (the
"Offer") by Buyer or its applicable Affiliate to Transfer the Offered
Securities to Freeport for cash at the Offer Price and on the other terms set
forth in the Offer Notice. Freeport shall have a 45-day period (the "Offer
Period") in which to accept such Offer as to all, but not less than all, of
the Offered Securities by giving a notice of acceptance to Buyer prior to the
expiration of such Offer Period. If Freeport fails to so notify Buyer prior to
the expiration of the Offer Period (for the avoidance of doubt, an attempt to
accept an Offer under any material terms other than as set out in the Offer
Notice shall be deemed not to be an acceptance of such Offer), it shall be
deemed to have rejected such Offer.





(c) If Freeport elects to accept an Offer, Freeport shall purchase and pay, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Buyer, for all Offered Securities within 20 Business Days after the date on
which such Offer has been accepted; provided that, if the Transfer of such
Offered Securities is subject to any prior regulatory approval, subject to
Section 6.04(d)(iii), the time period during which such Transfer may be
consummated shall be extended until the expiration of five Business Days after
all such approvals shall have been received, or until a customary drop-dead
date has been reached under the terms of the definitive Contract governing
such Transfer.

(d) Upon the earlier to occur of (i) rejection of the Offer by Freeport, (ii)
the expiration of the Offer Period without Freeport accepting the Offer, (iii)
the failure to obtain any required consent or regulatory approval for the
purchase of all of the Offered Securities by Freeport or (iv) the expiration
of the applicable drop-dead date under the definitive Contract governing the
applicable Transfer, Buyer or its applicable Affiliate shall have a 180-day
period during which to effect a Transfer of any or all of the Offered
Securities on the same or more favorable (as to Buyer or its applicable
Affiliate) terms and conditions as were set forth in the Offer Notice at a
price in cash not less than the Offer Price; provided that, if the Transfer is
subject to regulatory approval, such 180-day period shall be extended until
the expiration of five Business Days after all such approvals shall have been
received, but in no event shall such period be extended for more than an
additional 90 days. If Buyer or its applicable Affiliate does not consummate
the Transfer of the Offered Securities in accordance with the foregoing time
limitations, then the right of Buyer or its applicable Affiliate to effect the
Transfer of such Offered Securities pursuant to this Section 6.04(d) shall
terminate and Buyer and its Affiliates shall again comply with the procedures
set forth in this Section 6.04 with respect to any proposed Qualifying
Transfer.

(e) The right of first offer granted to Freeport pursuant to this Section 6.04
shall be subject to any applicable right of first offer or similar right held
by a shareholder of TFHL or TFM, or its Affiliates, under the TFHL JVSA or TFM
Shareholders Agreement. From and after the date hereof, Buyer and its
Affiliates shall not, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries not to,
(i) enter into any new Contract or any other written or oral arrangement or
(ii) amend, modify or otherwise alter, or waive any material rights under, any
existing organizational document, Contract or any other similar written or
oral arrangement, in each case with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, including TFHL and TFM, in any manner that would adversely
affect the ability of Freeport to exercise its rights under this Section 6.04.

(f) In connection with Freeport's consideration of an Offer, Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Freeport's reasonable
requests, including by making the properties, books and records, and other
assets



relating to the Offered Securities reasonably available for inspection by
Freeport, establishing a physical or electronic data room including materials
customarily made available to potential acquirers in connection with sales
processes and making its officers and employees reasonably available for a
management presentation, due diligence calls and a site visit, in each case
subject to reasonable and customary confidentiality provisions.

(g) Any dispute between Freeport and Buyer as to what the Offer Price is for
any Offered Securities in any Qualifying Transfer shall be resolved by
determining such Offer Price in the same manner as Transaction Price is
determined pursuant to Section 6.06(c), which Section 6.06(c) shall apply,
mutatis mutandis, to such a dispute.

Section 6.05. TFHL JVSA. (a) If a shareholder (other than Buyer) in TFHL or
any of its Subsidiaries (the "Applicable Transferor") desires to Transfer any
securities directly or indirectly held by such Applicable Transferor in TFHL
or any of its Subsidiaries (or any of their respective successors) and (i)
such Transfer would result in a right of first offer, right of preemption or
other similar right in favor of Buyer or one of its Affiliates (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, TFHL) and (ii) Buyer or its applicable Affiliate
elects not to exercise its applicable right in full, then Buyer or its
applicable Affiliate shall offer such right of first offer, right of
preemption or other similar right to Freeport in accordance with this Section
6.05. As promptly as reasonably practicable following Buyer's or its
applicable Affiliates' receipt of notice with respect to the applicable right
of first offer, right of preemption or other similar right, Buyer shall give
notice (an "Election Notice") to Freeport of such applicable right, which
notice shall set forth the number and kind of securities proposed to be
Transferred by the Applicable Transferor, the cash price per share that the
Applicable Transferor proposes to be paid for such securities (the "Election
Price") and all other material terms sought by the Applicable Transferor.

(b) The giving of an Election Notice to Freeport shall, solely to the extent
that Buyer or its applicable Affiliate elects not to exercise its applicable
right in full (such securities with respect to which Buyer or such Affiliate
declines to exercise its right, the "Election Eligible Securities"),
constitute an offer (the "Election Offer") by Buyer or its applicable
Affiliate to exercise the applicable right of first offer, right of preemption
or other similar right on behalf of Freeport. Freeport shall have until the
end of the notice period set forth in the applicable shareholders agreement
(the "Election Offer Period") in which to accept such Election Offer with
respect to all or, to the extent permitted under the terms of the applicable
shareholders agreement, less than all of the Election Eligible Securities by
giving a notice of acceptance to Buyer prior to the expiration of such
Election Offer Period. If Freeport provides such a notice of acceptance, Buyer
shall immediately exercise its right to purchase the Election Eligible
Securities, if any,



at the Election Price from the Applicable Transferor in accordance with the
terms of the applicable shareholders agreement. If Freeport fails to notify
Buyer prior to the expiration of the Election Offer Period, it shall be deemed
to have declined such Election Offer.

(c) If Freeport elects to purchase Election Eligible Securities (such
purchased securities, the "Election Purchased Securities"), Freeport shall, or
shall cause one of its Affiliates to, purchase and pay (or provide Buyer with
the funds to purchase and pay) for the Election Purchased Securities on the
terms and at the time set forth in the Election Notice and in the applicable
shareholders agreement; provided that if Buyer or one of its Affiliates is the
purchaser of the Election Purchased Securities under the applicable purchase
agreement, Freeport and Buyer (or such Affiliate) shall enter into an
arrangement under which (i) Freeport shall obtain the benefit of all rights in
favor of Buyer (or such Affiliate) under the purchase agreement and (ii) Buyer
(or such Affiliate) shall assign to Freeport all right, title and interest to
the Election Purchased Securities immediately following the consummation of
the purchase by Buyer (or such Affiliate) (or, immediately following the time
at which the parties obtain all required regulatory approvals for such an
assignment, as determined by Freeport in its reasonable discretion).

(d) Anything in this Section 6.05 to the contrary notwithstanding, this
Section 6.05 shall not constitute an agreement to assign any Election
Purchased Securities or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder
or resulting therefrom if such assignment, without the consent of a third
party thereto, would constitute a breach or other contravention of the
applicable shareholders agreements to which such Election Purchased Securities
are subject or in any way adversely affect the rights of Freeport or Buyer
thereunder. Freeport and Buyer shall use their best efforts (but without any
payment of money by Freeport or Buyer) to obtain the consent of such
applicable third parties for the assignment of the Election Purchased
Securities to Freeport as Freeport may request. If such consent is not
obtained, or if an attempted assignment of the Election Purchased Securities
would be ineffective or would adversely affect the rights of Buyer thereunder
so that Freeport would not in fact receive all such rights, Buyer and Freeport
shall cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement under which Freeport would
obtain the benefits and assume the obligations thereunder, with Freeport
assuming Buyer's obligations and any and all rights of Buyer against a third
parties. Buyer shall promptly pay to Freeport when received all monies
received by Buyer with respect to any Election Purchased Securities or any
claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder.

(e) Freeport shall have the right in connection with its consideration of an
Election Offer to require Buyer to cooperate fully by taking all customary and
other actions reasonably requested by Freeport, including making the
properties,



books and records, and other assets relating to the Election Eligible
Securities reasonably available for inspection by Freeport, establishing a
physical or electronic data room including materials customarily made
available to potential acquirors in connection with sales processes and making
its officers and employees reasonably available for presentations, interviews
and other diligence activities, in each case subject to reasonable and
customary confidentiality provisions.

(f) From and after the date hereof, Buyer and its Affiliates shall not, and
shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries not to, (i) enter into any new
Contract or any other written or oral arrangement or (ii) amend, modify or
otherwise alter, or waive any material rights under, any existing
organizational document, Contract or any other similar written or oral
arrangement, in each case with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, including TFHL and TFM, in any manner that would adversely
affect the ability of Freeport to exercise its rights under this Section 6.05.

(g) Freeport shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, its Subsidiaries and
their respective representatives from and against any and all Damages arising
out of or in connection with the transactions contemplated in this Section
6.05.

Section 6.06. Certain Future Acquisitions and Dispositions.

(a) Neither Buyer nor any Affiliate of Buyer shall Transfer, or enter into any
agreement, arrangement or understanding to Transfer, the Subject Shares or any
Participating Interest (any such Transfer or the entry into any such
agreement, arrangement or understanding, a "Triggering Sale") at any time from
May 9, 2016 through the 18-month anniversary of the Closing Date (the
"Restricted Period"). Any Triggering Sale made after the date hereof during
the balance of the Restricted Period, shall be null and void ab initio.

(b) If, at any time from and after May 9, 2016 through the 18-month
anniversary of the Closing Date, any Person shall Transfer to Buyer or any of
its Affiliates, or Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall enter into any
agreement, arrangement or understanding providing for the Transfer to Buyer or
any of its Affiliates of, any Participating Interests (any such Transfer or
the entry into any such agreement, arrangement or understanding, a "Triggering
Purchase"), including by way of any Transfer of the Subject Shares or any
securities or interest in any Person that directly or indirectly holds
Participating Interests, at a Transaction Price that is higher than the Base
Price, then Buyer shall (i) contemporaneously notify Freeport of the
occurrence of such event and (ii) pay to Freeport an amount equal to (A) such
Transaction Price minus the Base Price, multiplied by (B) 70. Any payment
pursuant to this Section 6.06(b) shall be made on the later of (x) five
Business Days following the date on which such Triggering



Purchase is consummated and (y) the final determination of the Transaction
Price in accordance with Section 6.06(c).

(c) With respect to any Triggering Purchase, "Transaction Price" means the
purchase price per one percent Participating Interest paid or to be paid in
such Triggering Purchase. For a period of five Business Days following receipt
by Freeport of the Buyer notice referred to in Section 6.06(a) or Section
6.06(b) with respect to such Triggering Purchase, Freeport and Buyer shall
attempt in good faith to agree upon the Transaction Price. If Freeport and
Buyer are unable to so agree during such period, then Freeport and Buyer shall
each retain, at its own expense, a nationally recognized investment banking or
valuation firm (each, an "Appraiser") to determine the Transaction Price. Each
of the Appraisers shall submit to Freeport and the Buyer in writing its
determination of the Transaction Price not later than 30 days after the
expiration of such five Business Day period. If the Transaction Price
determined by the higher of the two appraisals is less than 110% of the
Transaction Price determined by the lower appraisal, the Transaction Price
shall be the average of the two appraisals. If the Transaction Price
determined by the higher of the two appraisals is greater than 110% of the
Transaction Price determined by the lower appraisal, a third Appraiser ("Third
Appraiser") shall promptly, and in event within two weeks of receipt of the
last written appraisal received from the first two Appraisers, be jointly
retained by Freeport and Buyer (with the fees and expenses of such Third
Appraiser to be shared equally by Freeport and Buyer) and such Third Appraiser
(i) shall review the valuations performed by the first two Appraisers and (ii)
shall select one of the Transaction Prices determined by the first two
Appraisers (and not any amount in-between). If a Third Appraiser is retained,
the Transaction Price selected by the Third Appraiser shall be the Transaction
Price for purposes of the applicable Triggering Purchase. Each of Freeport and
Buyer shall furnish to each Appraiser such financial, business and other
information as is reasonably necessary to allow it to perform the
determinations described in this Section 6.06(c), and Freeport and Buyer shall
each be entitled to furnish to each Appraiser such books, records, information
and analyses as it may deem relevant. The determination of the Transaction
Price in accordance with this Section 6.06(c) shall be final and binding upon
Freeport and Buyer.

(d) Buyer shall not and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to take any
action designed to undermine, circumvent or otherwise avoid the purpose or
provisions of this Section 6.06.







ARTICLE 7 
COVENANTS OF BUYER AND FREEPORT

Buyer and Freeport agree that:

Section 7.01. Reasonable Best Efforts; Further Assurances. (a) Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer and Freeport will use their
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary or desirable under Applicable Law to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements,
including (i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with any
Governmental Authority or other third party all documentation to effect all
necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions
of information, applications and other documents and (ii) obtaining and
maintaining all Permits and Orders required to be obtained from any
Governmental Authority or other third party that are necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements. Freeport and Buyer agree, and Freeport, prior to the Closing, and
Buyer, after the Closing, agree to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries, to
execute and deliver such other documents, certificates, Contracts and other
writings and to take such other actions as may be necessary or desirable in
order to consummate or implement expeditiously the transactions contemplated
by the Transaction Agreements.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Freeport
and Buyer shall provide, or cause to be provided, to any Governmental
Authority all information and documents required or requested by any such
Governmental Authority, including by (i) filing any notification and report
form and related material required under any Antitrust Law with respect to the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof, (ii) supplying as promptly as practicable
any additional information and documentary material that may be requested by

of Buyer, filing or otherwise submitting (to the extent not filed or submitted
prior to the date of this Agreement) with each applicable Governmental
Authority, all required documentation and information in respect of the
Required PRC Approvals in accordance with Section 7.03(d).

(c) The Parties acknowledge and agree that Buyer's obligations to use its
reasonable best efforts as set forth in this Section 7.01 shall include an
obligation of Buyer to (i) take, and cause its Affiliates to take, all actions
necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Applicable
Law so as to enable the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements prior to the End Date, including (A) committing to sell
or hold separate businesses, product lines or assets of Buyer or its
Affiliates



(including those of the Company), (B) otherwise taking or committing to take
actions that after the Closing Date would limit Buyer's or its Affiliates'
(including the Company's) freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to
retain or exercise rights of ownership or control with respect to, one or more
of the businesses, product lines or assets of Buyer or its Affiliates
(including the Company), (C) defending any action, suit or proceeding that
challenges any of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements
and (D) opposing any request for the entry of, and seeking to have dissolved,
vacated, lifted, altered, reversed or terminated, any order that could

hereby and (ii) not take any action (including the acquisition by it or any of
its Affiliates of any interest in any Person that derives revenues from
products, services or lines of business similar to the Company's products,
services or lines of business) if such action would make it more likely that
there would arise any impediments under any Applicable Law that may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements as promptly as reasonably
practicable.

(d) Each of Freeport and Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, cooperate reasonably with one another and keep the other party
reasonably informed of material matters relating to or in connection with the
taking of the actions contemplated by this Section 7.01, including (i)
affording one another the right to review any written materials to be
submitted to such Governmental Authority in advance of the submission thereof
and (ii) furnishing one another with copies of all written materials received
by or on behalf of such party from such Governmental Authority, in each case
to the extent permitted by Applicable Law. Subject to Applicable Law and the
attorney-client privilege, neither Buyer nor Freeport shall agree (or permit
any of their respective Affiliates to agree) to participate in any pre-
scheduled meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings,
investigation or other inquiry relating to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it consults with the other
party in advance (to the extent reasonably practicable to do so) and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party and its
outside counsel the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting,
other than any meeting (or the portion thereof) to the extent not relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 7.02. Certain Filings. Freeport and Buyer shall cooperate with one
another (i) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing
with, any Governmental Authority is required, or any actions, consents,
approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any material
Contracts, in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements and (ii) in taking such actions or
making any such filings,



furnishing information required in connection therewith and seeking timely to
obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers.

Section 7.03. Required PRC Approvals; Required Shareholder Approval.

(a) In furtherance and not in limitation of Section 7.01, Buyer shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to take all
necessary actions to obtain the Required PRC Approvals as soon as reasonably
practicable and, in any event, no later than the End Date.

(b) Buyer Guarantor shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable
best efforts to take all necessary actions to obtain the Required Shareholder
Approval as soon as reasonably practicable and, in any event, no later than
the End Date.

(c) Without prejudice to the obligations of Buyer pursuant to the foregoing
clause (a), Freeport shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide Buyer
and its Affiliates with all reasonable assistance and cooperation that is
reasonably necessary to obtain the Required PRC Approvals and Required
Shareholder Approval.

(d) Without limiting the generality of clause (a), in respect of the Required
PRC Approvals, Buyer shall:

(i) promptly and, (A) in the case of the initial application for the NDRC
Approval, within ten Business Days of the date of this Agreement, or (B) in
the case of initial filings with respect to the MOFCOM Anti-Monopoly Approval,
within forty-five days of the date of this Agreement, prepare and submit all
necessary applications, filings and notifications, and supply all necessary
information, for the purpose of seeking the Required PRC Approvals; and

(ii) promptly provide Freeport with copies of material correspondence and
copies of the Buyer's applications, filings and notifications relating to the
Required PRC Approvals (removing any confidential or commercially sensitive
information) and updates on any material developments regarding the Required
PRC Approvals.

(e) Without limiting Section 7.01, the parties hereto agree that all requests
and enquiries from any Governmental Authority with respect to the Required PRC
Approvals shall be dealt with promptly by the parties hereto and the parties
hereto shall promptly cooperate with and provide all necessary information and
assistance reasonably needed in that respect or required by such Governmental
Authority upon being requested to do so by another party hereto.



(f) Nothing in the foregoing clauses (c), (d) or (e) shall oblige a party to
provide any other party with any confidential or commercially sensitive
information relating to such first party, its Affiliates, or their respective
businesses, except to the extent reasonably required by Buyer in order to
obtain the Required PRC Approvals. In this respect, any commercially sensitive
information relating to the Seller Guarantor or its Affiliates (including the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries) will be communicated to the external
advisors that Buyer appoints for that purpose, subject to a written
undertaking, in a form reasonably acceptable to Freeport, that such
commercially sensitive information is not disclosed to Buyer until after
Closing, except for such information relating solely to the Seller Guarantor
or its Affiliates other than the Company or its Subsidiaries, which will not
be disclosed to Buyer by such advisors at any time.

(g) In respect of the Required Shareholder Approval, Buyer Guarantor shall, as
soon as reasonably practicable:

(i) and prior to the later of (A) 94 days after the date of this Agreement and
(B) 45 days following the delivery by Freeport of the Circular Requirements,
prepare and dispatch to Buyer Guarantor's shareholders a notice of meeting
that complies with Buyer Guarantor's constituent documents and any other
requirements relevant to convening a meeting of shareholders of Buyer
Guarantor for the purpose of approving the Transaction;

(ii) in such form as is required by Applicable Law or by the regulation of a
stock exchange on which its shares or debt securities are listed, issue to its
shareholders and not withdraw prior to the End Date a statement from Buyer
Guarantor's board of directors that such board of directors (A) unanimously
considers the entry into the Transaction to be in the best interests of
shareholders of Buyer Guarantor and (B) recommends that shareholders approve
the Transaction; and

(iii) no later than 46 days after the dispatch of the notice of meeting
pursuant to Section 7.03(g)(i), convene and hold a meeting of Buyer
Guarantor's shareholders at which a resolution is put to such shareholders
which, if passed, would result in the satisfaction of the Required Shareholder
Approval (the "Shareholders' Resolution").

(h) In addition to the notice of meeting required under Section 7.03(g), if
Buyer Guarantor is required by Applicable Law or the regulation of a stock
exchange on which its shares or debt securities are listed to make or send a
public communication or circular concerning the Transaction (a "Transaction
Communication"), then:



(i) such Transaction Communication shall contain the recommendation of the
board of directors referred to in Section 7.03(g)(ii) and be prepared and
dispatched to the shareholders of Buyer Guarantor at least fifteen days before
the date of the meeting to be held in accordance with Section 7.03(g); and

(ii) Freeport shall, to the maximum extent allowable pursuant to Applicable
Law and in a timeframe which allows Buyer Guarantor a reasonable amount of
time to comply with its covenants as to timing pursuant to this Section 7.03,
provide all reasonable assistance and cooperation that Buyer Guarantor
considers reasonably necessary to prepare such Transaction Communication
including, the provision of the Circular Requirements and allowing Buyer and
its representatives access to data and resource modelling of the mineral
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries in order to prepare any reports
required by Applicable Law or the regulation of the relevant stock exchange on
which its shares or debt securities are listed; provided that Freeport shall
not be deemed to be in breach of its obligations under this Section
7.03(h)(ii) as a result of any delay arising out of the preparation of the
items referred to in clause (ii) of the definition of Circular Requirements.

(i) Buyer shall give notice to Freeport of the satisfaction or, if applicable,
non-satisfaction, of the Required PRC Approvals and the Required Shareholder
Approval promptly and within two Business Days of becoming aware of the same.

(j) Buyer shall promptly, upon request by Freeport, reimburse Freeport for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by Freeport or any of its Affiliates in
connection with the cooperation of Freeport or any of its Affiliates
contemplated by this Section 7.03 and shall indemnify and hold harmless
Freeport, its Affiliates and their respective representatives from and against
any and all Damages suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the
matters described in this Section 7.03 and any information used in connection
therewith, and the foregoing obligations shall survive termination of this
Agreement.

Section 7.04. Notices of Certain Events. Each party shall promptly notify the
other party of:

(a) any material notice or other communication from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the

Freeport) in electronic form as promptly as practicable, but no later than the
close of business on May 10, 2016.

(b) Freeport may only draw on the Letter of Credit in the circumstances set
forth in the Letter of Credit.

Section 7.06. Public Announcements. The written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of Buyer and Freeport shall be
required before any party or any of such party's Affiliates issues any press
release or makes any public statement with respect to this Agreement, the
other Transaction Agreements or transactions contemplated hereby or thereby;
provided, however, that any such public disclosure required by Applicable Law
or any listing agreement with a national securities exchange may be made
without prior consent of Buyer and Freeport; provided, further, that, to the
extent practicable, the disclosing party shall consult with Buyer and Freeport
prior to making such public disclosure.

Section 7.07. Bank Accounts. Prior to the Closing, Freeport and Buyer shall
cooperate to obtain access, effective as of the Closing, for representatives
of Buyer or its Affiliates to the bank, savings, deposit or custodial accounts
and safe deposit boxes maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.





ARTICLE 8 
TAX MATTERS

Section 8.01. Tax Covenants. (i) Buyer covenants that it shall not, and it
shall cause its Affiliates to not, cause or permit TFHL and its Subsidiaries
that are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes
(collectively, the "Transferred CFCs") to take any action on the Closing Date
other than in the ordinary course of business, including but not limited to
the distribution of any dividend or the effectuation of any redemption, that
could give rise to any Tax liability or reduce any Tax Asset of the Seller
Group or give rise to any loss of the Seller Group under this Agreement, in
each case, for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and (ii) without limiting the
foregoing, for the period after Closing and through the close of each
Transferred CFC's respective taxable year (as defined in the Code) that
includes the Closing Date, the Buyer shall not cause or permit the Transferred
CFCs, as applicable, to engage in the following prohibited transactions:

(a) declare or pay a dividend;

(b) make or cause to be made any investment in U.S. property within the
meaning of Section 956 of the Code (which investment in U.S. property did not
exist as of the Closing); or

(c) conduct business outside the ordinary course or engage in any transaction
outside the ordinary course (in either case based upon each Transferred CFC's
historic activities) if such business or activities would reasonably be
expected to impact (i) the amount or character of Freeport's gross income
reportable under Section 1248 of the Code, (ii) the amount of Freeport's
associated deemed-paid foreign taxes within the meaning of Section 902 of the
Code that are associated with the Section 1248 inclusion or (iii) the amount
of Freeport's subpart F income within the meaning of Section 952 of the Code.

Section 8.02. Transfer Taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, all Transfer Taxes shall be borne 50% by Buyer and 50% by Freeport.
To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, Buyer will, at its own expense,
file all necessary Tax Returns with respect to all Transfer Taxes, and, if
required by Applicable Law, Freeport, the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and, where
necessary, file such Tax Returns.

Section 8.03. Cooperation on Tax Matters.

(a) Buyer and Freeport agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each
other, upon reasonable request (and at the requesting party's expense), as



promptly as practicable, such information and assistance relating to the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries (including access to books and records) as is
reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns (including any report
required pursuant to Section 6043A of the Code and all Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder), the making of any election relating to Taxes, the
preparation for any audit by any Taxing Authority and the prosecution or
defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax. The parties
agree to provide, upon reasonable request (and at the requesting party's
expense), updates as to the status of such claim, suit or proceeding.

(b) Buyer and Freeport shall (i) retain all books and records with respect to
Taxes pertaining to the Company and its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period for a period of at least seven years following the Closing Date and
abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing
Authority for all periods required by such Taxing Authority, and (ii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide the other party with at least 30
days' prior written notice before destroying any such books and records,
during which period the party receiving the notice can elect to take
possession, at its own expense, of such books and records. Freeport and Buyer
shall cooperate with each other fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party (and at the requesting party's expense), in the
conduct of any audit or other proceeding relating to Taxes involving the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries.

(c) Buyer and Freeport shall cooperate in good faith in determining the
potential applicability of Section 8.01 hereof to any transaction that occurs
on or after the Closing Date and, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Freeport shall provide Buyer with any information reasonably
required by Buyer in order to determine whether any such transaction may
reasonably be expected to have the effects described in Section 8.01(ii).

Section 8.04. Straddle Period. In the case of any taxable period that includes
(but does not end on) the Closing Date (a ''Straddle Period''), the amount of
any Taxes based on or measured by income, receipts, or payroll of the Company
and its Subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based
on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing
Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or other
pass-through entity in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries holds a
beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time) and the amount
of other Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period that
relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such
Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period. To
the extent permitted by



Applicable Law, the parties agree to cause the tax years of the Company and
its Subsidiaries to close as of the end of the day on the Closing Date.

Section 8.05. Tax Returns. Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
file or caused to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company and its
Subsidiaries that are filed after the Closing Date; provided, that, with
respect to TFHL and TFM, the preparation and filing of Tax Returns shall be
performed in accordance with the terms of the TFHL JVSA.

ARTICLE 9 
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Section 9.01. Continuing Employees. (a) As of the date of this Agreement, the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries is supported by four categories
of employees:

(i) The local employees employed by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company
(the "Local Continuing Employees");

(ii) The employees listed in Section 9.01(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, who are employed by an Affiliate of Freeport and seconded to the
Company and its Subsidiaries (the "International Continuing Employees");

(iii) The employees filling the roles listed in Section 9.01(a)(iii) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, who may be made available by an Affiliate of
Freeport to provide transition services to Buyer, the Company and their
Affiliates following the Closing pursuant to the Subcontractor Agreement (the
"Transition Service Employees"); and

(iv) The employees who are employed in the United States by an Affiliate of
Freeport and provide services with respect to the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (the "U.S. Employees").

(b) Transfer of Local Continuing Employees and International Continuing
Employees. Effective as of the termination of the Subcontractor Agreement (the
"Transfer Date"), the Local Continuing Employees who are employed by the
Company or a Company Subsidiary as of the Transfer Date shall continue in such
employment and the International Continuing Employees who are employed by an
Affiliate of Freeport as of the Transfer Date shall transfer their employment
to the Company or an appropriate Company Subsidiary. Buyer and Freeport shall,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, take all actions necessary to
effectuate the foregoing, including without limitation, the transfer of



such employees to the appropriate employers, payrolls and benefit platforms
and the extension of offers of employment or transfer on terms and conditions
substantially similar to those applicable to each such employee immediately
prior to the Closing Date and consistent with Section 9.01(d) below (each such
Local Continuing Employee and International Continuing Employee, a "Continuing
Employee"). As of the Transfer Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
cease to participate in any compensation plans, benefit plans, and employee
programs and coverages of Freeport and its Affiliates, and Continuing
Employees shall cease to participate or cease to accrue benefits, as
applicable, in the payroll, compensation plans, benefit plans and other
employee programs and coverages of the Freeport and its Affiliates and shall
commence to participate or accrue benefits, as applicable, in corresponding
payroll, compensation plans, benefit plans and employee programs and coverages
of Buyer and its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, those of the
Company and its Subsidiaries) consistent with Section 9.01(d) below.

(c) Transfer of Transition Service Employees and U.S. Employees. From and
after the date hereof, Buyer and its Affiliates (including, as of the Closing,
the Company and its Subsidiaries) may, at their discretion, offer employment
to any Transition Service Employee or U.S. Employee and Buyer and Freeport and
their respective Affiliates shall (i) not discourage, or engage in any actions
in bad faith that may discourage (including knowingly disparaging Buyer or any
of its Affiliates), any Transition Service Employees or U.S. Employees from
accepting any such offers and (ii) cooperate to take all actions necessary to
effectuate the appropriate transfer of employment of any such employee who
accepts any such offer of employment from Buyer and its Affiliates (each, a
"Discretionary Hire Employee"). As of the date of such transfer of each such
Discretionary Hire Employee, such Discretionary Hire Employee shall cease to
participate in the payroll, compensation plans, benefit plans and other
employee programs and coverages of the Freeport and its Affiliates and shall
commence and continue to participate in corresponding payroll, compensation
plans, benefit plans and employee programs and coverages of Buyer and its
Affiliates (including, following the Closing, those of the Company and its
Subsidiaries) consistent with Section 9.01(d) below.

(d) Terms of Employment of Employees. In addition to any obligation that Buyer
or its Affiliates may have under Applicable Law, for the period beginning on
the Closing Date and continuing through the later of the first anniversary of
the Closing Date and the termination of the Subcontractor Agreement (the
"Relevant Period"), Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company or another
appropriate Affiliate of Buyer to, provide to each Continuing Employees and
Discretionary Hire Employee (i) a base salary, wage and commission rate,
matching and nonelective employer contribution to 401(k) plans and an
incentive compensation opportunity that is no less favorable than the base
salary, wage and



commission rate, matching and nonelective contribution to 401(k) plans and
incentive compensation opportunity of each such Continuing Employee or
Discretionary Hire Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date (including,
an incentive that is reasonably equivalent in value and terms to any unvested
or unearned equity or cash-based incentives forfeited by such Continuing
Employee or Discretionary Hire Employee upon such employee's continuation or
transfer of employment hereunder; provided that any such forfeited equity
incentives may be replaced by cash-based incentives; provided, further, that
the terms of any such cash-based incentives may be modified as necessary to
comply with Applicable Law (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Code)
notwithstanding that such terms are not equivalent, but are as reasonably
equivalent in value as practicable to the affected employee) and (ii) employee
benefits (including any severance protections) that are, in terms of aggregate
value (in-kind or in cash), no less favorable than the benefits (including any
severance protections) provided by the Company and its Affiliates to each such
Continuing Employee or Discretionary Hire Employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date. Neither Buyer, the Company nor any of their respective
Affiliates shall terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee or
Discretionary Hire Employee during the Relevant Period (other than for just
cause). For this purpose, "just cause" means (i) an intentional act of fraud,
embezzlement or theft by the employee that occurs during or in the course of
such employee's employment and that, in each case, is materially injurious to
the Company or its Affiliates, (ii) intentional disclosure of confidential
information by the employee contrary to Company policies that have been
distributed to such employee prior to such disclosure; (iii) intentional
engagement by the employee during or in the course of such employee's
employment in any competitive activity which would constitute a breach of such
employee's duty of loyalty; (iv) the willful and continued failure by the
employee to substantially perform his or her duties (other than as a result of
incapacity due to physical or mental illness); or (v) willful conduct by the
employee that is demonstrably and materially injurious to the Company
monetarily.

(e) Transition Completion Bonus Program. Buyer shall or shall cause an
Affiliate of Buyer to pay to (i) each International Continuing Employee and
(ii) each Transition Service Employee and each U.S. Employee who, within
ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, receives and accepts, in writing,
an offer of employment from Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer (including, as of
the Closing, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) a bonus pursuant to the
terms set forth in Section 9.01(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the
"Transition Completion Bonuses"). Freeport shall promptly reimburse Buyer (or
its appropriate Affiliate) for the aggregate amount of such Transition
Completion Bonuses pursuant to the terms set forth in Section 9.01(e) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule up to a maximum aggregate reimbursement of
$4,000,000.





Section 9.02. Buyer Plans. In addition to any obligation Buyer or its
Affiliates may have under Applicable Law:

(a) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Buyer or its
Affiliates in which any Continuing Employee or Discretionary Hire Employee
becomes a participant, for all purposes, including for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, level of benefits, vesting and benefit accrual
(other than benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan of Buyer or
its Affiliates), each Continuing Employee and Discretionary Hire Employee's
service with Freeport, the Company and any of their respective Affiliates (as
well as service with any predecessor employer), and as summarized in the
schedule provided by Freeport to Buyer as of the Closing Date, shall be
treated as service with Buyer and its Affiliates; provided, however, that such
service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in any duplication of benefits.

(b) Buyer shall make reasonable efforts to waive, or shall cause its
Affiliates to make reasonable efforts to waive, any preexisting conditions,
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Buyer or any of its Affiliates in
which Continuing Employees or Discretionary Hire Employee (and their eligible
dependents) will be eligible to participate. Buyer shall recognize, or shall
cause its Affiliates to recognize, all co-payments, deductibles and similar
expenses and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by each Continuing Employee and
Discretionary Hire Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) prior to the
date of transfer for purposes of satisfying any analogous deductible and co-
payment limitations and out-of-pocket requirements under the relevant welfare
benefit plans in which such Continuing Employee or Discretionary Hire Employee
(and his or her eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and
after the date of transfer.

Section 9.03. No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Without limiting the generality of
Section 13.09, no provision of this Article 9, express or implied, (a) is
intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities
hereunder upon any Person (including, without limitation, any Continuing
Employees, Discretionary Hire Employees and any dependent or beneficiary
thereof) other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns, (b) shall constitute an amendment of, or an undertaking to amend, any
Company Plan or any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement maintained
by Freeport, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates, other than an
undertaking to amend any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement
maintained by Freeport, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates to
terminate the participation of the Company or its Subsidiaries in such plan or
terminate the participation of any Continuing Employees, Discretionary Hire
Employees and any dependent or beneficiary thereof in such plan in accordance
with this Article 9, or (c) is



intended to prevent Buyer or its Affiliates from amending or terminating any
Company Plan in accordance with its terms.

Closing, the Company, but not including TFHL or any of its Subsidiaries,
including TFM) and each of Buyer's and such Affiliates' respective directors,

incurred or suffered by any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, whether in

of such excess and (3) Freeport's maximum aggregate liability for all such

misrepresentation). For the purposes of this Section 11.02(a), any
qualifications or standards relating to materiality, Material Adverse Effect
or similar qualifications or standards contained in any representation or
warranty in this Agreement (other than with respect to the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.08, Section 3.09, Section 3.10, Section

Warranty Breach"), (ii) breach of covenant or agreement made or to be
performed by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement or (iii) Taxes for which Buyer

or similar qualifications or standards contained in any representation or
warranty in this Agreement shall be disregarded for purposes of determining
whether such representation or warranty was breached and, for the avoidance of
doubt, the amount of Damages with respect to such breach.

Section 11.03. Third Party Claim Procedures. (a) The party seeking
indemnification under Section 11.02 (the "Indemnified Party") agrees to give
prompt notice in writing (a "Claim Notice") to the party against whom
indemnity is to be sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of the assertion of any
claim or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding by any third party
("Third Party Claim") in respect of which indemnity may be sought under such
Section. The Claim Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such Third
Party Claim, the basis for indemnification and the amount claimed (taking into
account the information then available to the Indemnified Party and which
amount shall not be conclusive of the final amount of the Third Party Claim).
The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such
failure shall have adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party or the defense
available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days (or such lesser number of days
set forth in the Claim Notice as may be required by court proceeding in the
event of a litigated matter) after receipt of the Claim Notice (the "Notice
Period") to notify the Indemnified Party that it desires to defend the
Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim; it being understood that by
assuming the defense of a Third Party Claim the Indemnifying Party shall
acknowledge, based on the facts and circumstances then available and known and
the matters alleged, that it has an indemnity obligation with respect to such
Third Party Claim.



(c) In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party
within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
defend the Indemnified Party by appropriate proceedings and shall have the
sole power to direct and control such defense, with counsel of its own choice
at its expense. Once the Indemnifying Party has duly assumed the defense of a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to participate in any such defense and to employ separate counsel
of its choosing. The Indemnified Party's participation in any such defense
shall be at its expense except to the extent that (i) the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party are both named parties to the proceedings and the
Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that representation of both
parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential
conflict of interest, or (ii) the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of a
Third Party Claim after the Indemnifying Party has failed to diligently pursue
a Third Party Claim it has assumed, as provided in the first sentence of
Section 11.03(e).

(d) If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the defense of any
Third Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this Section 11.03, the
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) settle,
compromise or offer to settle or compromise any Third Party Claim on a basis
that would result in (i) the imposition of an Order that would restrict or
adversely affect the future activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party or
any of its Affiliates, (ii) a finding or admission of a violation of
Applicable Law or violation of the rights of any Person by the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates, (iii) a finding or admission that would have
an adverse effect on other claims made or threatened against the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates or (iv) any monetary liability of the
Indemnified Party that will not be promptly paid or reimbursed by the
Indemnifying Party.

(e) If the Indemnifying Party (i) elects not to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third Party Claim, whether by not giving the Indemnified Party
timely notice of its desire to so defend or otherwise, or (ii) after assuming
the defense of a Third Party Claim, fails to take reasonable steps necessary
to defend diligently such Third Party Claim within ten days after receiving
written notice from the Indemnified Party to the effect that the Indemnifying
Party has so failed, the Indemnified Party shall have the right but not the
obligation to assume its own defense; it being understood that, subject to the
other provisions of this Article 11, the Indemnified Party's right to
indemnification for a Third Party Claim shall not be adversely affected by
assuming the defense of such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party shall
assume the control of the defense of any Third Party Claim in accordance with
the provisions of this Section 11.03, the Indemnified Party shall not, without
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party



(which shall not be unreasonably withheld) settle, compromise or offer to
settle or compromise any Third Party Claim.

(f) Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and shall
furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith; it being understood
that the costs and expenses of the Indemnified Party relating thereto shall be
Damages to the extent provided in Section 11.02.

(g) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to avoid production of confidential information (consistent
with Applicable Law), and commercially reasonable efforts to cause all
communications among employees, counsel and others representing any party to a
Third Party Claim to be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client
or work-product privileges.

Section 11.04. Direct Claim Procedures. In the event an Indemnified Party has
a claim for indemnity under Section 11.02 against an Indemnifying Party that
does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees to promptly
deliver a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party. Such Claim Notice shall set
forth in reasonable detail such claim, the basis for indemnification and the
amount claimed (taking into account the information then available to the
Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the
extent such failure shall have adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party or
the defenses available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim.
The parties shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such
dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be
resolved by litigation in an appropriate court of jurisdiction determined
pursuant to Section 13.06.

Section 11.05. Calculation of Damages. (a) The amount of any Damages payable
under Section 11.02 by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of any amounts
actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance
policies or from any other Person alleged to be responsible therefor. Each
Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect any
amounts available under insurance coverage for any Damages payable under
Section 11.02. If, with respect to any indemnifiable Damages, the Indemnified
Party receives any amounts from a third party (including under applicable
insurance policies) subsequent to an indemnification payment by the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such Damages, then such Indemnified Party
shall, to the extent that the amounts received by the Indemnified Party are
duplicative of Damages paid by an Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party
in



relation to the applicable indemnification claim, promptly reimburse the
Indemnifying Party for such payment up to a maximum of the amount received by
the Indemnified Party, net of any expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party
in collecting such amount.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 11.02 for any (i)
Damages relating to any matter to the extent that (A) the Indemnified Party
had otherwise been compensated for such matter pursuant to the Purchase Price
adjustment under Section 2.04 or (B) there is included in the Financial
Statements a specific liability or reserve relating to such matter or (ii)
consequential, special, indirect or punitive Damages (except for punitive
Damages awarded against an Indemnified Party in a Third Party Claim) or
Damages for lost profits.

(d) Each Indemnified Party shall act in good faith and a commercially
reasonable manner to mitigate Damages they may pay, incur, suffer or sustain
hereunder for which indemnification is available hereunder.

Section 11.06. Environmental Procedures. Freeport shall not be liable under
this Agreement for, and none of Buyer or the other Buyer Indemnified Parties
shall be indemnified for, any Damages relating to (x) Environmental Matters or
(y) Specified Matters to the extent arising under or relating to Environmental
Laws or Hazardous Substances, in the case of each of (x) and (y) to the extent
such Damages: (i) arise out of any sampling, testing or other invasive
investigation of the air, soil, soil gas, surface water, groundwater, building
materials or other environmental media, or any disclosure, report or
communication relating to any Environmental Matter to any Governmental
Authority or other third party, unless such sampling, testing, investigation,
disclosure, report or communication is (A) required by Applicable Law, (B)
necessary to respond to any Third Party Claim against any of Buyer or its
Affiliates or (C) otherwise necessary for, and consistent with, the ordinary
course of the operation of the Business and not for the purpose of seeking
indemnification pursuant to this Article 11; or (ii) exceed those Damages that
must be incurred to satisfy, in a reasonably cost-effective manner, the
minimum requirements of a Governmental Authority pursuant to applicable
Environmental Law using acceptable risk-based approaches, engineering, use or
institutional controls or deed or other restrictions acceptable for similar
assets, provided that such risk based approaches, engineering control, or
deeds or other restrictions do not unreasonably interfere with the current
operation of the Business or, to the extent substantially similar to the
current operation of the Business, the future operation of the Business.

Section 11.07. Assignment of Claims. If the Indemnified Party receives any
payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages pursuant to
Section 11.02 and the Indemnified Party could have recovered all or a part of
such



Damages from a third party (a "Potential Contributor") based on the underlying
claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall
assign such of its rights to proceed against the Potential Contributor as are
necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from the Potential
Contributor the amount of such payment; provided that the Indemnified Party
shall not be required to assign any right to proceed against a Potential
Contributor if the Indemnified Party determines in its reasonable discretion
that such assignment would be materially detrimental to its reputation, future
business prospects or existing business.

Section 11.08. Exclusivity. Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement
and except in the case of fraud, willful misconduct or intentional
misrepresentation with respect to the representations and warranties in this
Agreement, effective as of the Closing, Buyer, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, waives any rights and claims Buyer or its Affiliates may have
against Freeport or its Affiliates, whether in law or in equity, relating to
the Company or its Subsidiaries, the Subject Shares or the transactions
contemplated hereby, including claims for contribution or other rights of
recovery arising out of or relating to any Environmental Law (whether now or
hereinafter in effect), claims for breach of contract, breach of
representation or warranty, negligent misrepresentation and all other claims
for breach of duty. Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement and
except in the case of fraud, willful misconduct or intentional
misrepresentation with respect to the representations and warranties in this
Agreement, after the Closing, Section 11.02 will provide the exclusive remedy
for any misrepresentation, breach of warranty, covenant or other agreement or
other claim arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, other than with respect to claims for equitable relief pursuant to
Section 13.16.

Section 11.09. Adjustment to the Purchase Price. Any amount paid by Freeport
or Buyer under this Article 11 will be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price.

liability of any party (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee,

party from liability for (i) fraud, willful misconduct or intentional
misrepresentation, or intentional breach of covenant or agreement made or to
be performed pursuant to this Agreement, including the willful or intentional
failure of either party to fulfill a condition to the performance of the
obligations of the other party, in each case that arose prior to such

unpaid Buyer Termination Fee or Seller Termination Fee, as applicable, costs
and expenses, at a rate per annum equal to 8% from the date such fee, cost or
expense was required to be paid to (but excluding) the payment date.

or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be

Section 13.06. Jurisdiction. (a) The parties hereto agree that any suit,

matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York or any New York State
court sitting in New York City, so long as one of such courts shall have
subject matter jurisdiction over such suit, action or proceeding, and that any
cause of action arising out of this Agreement shall be deemed to have arisen
from a transaction of business in the State of New York, and each of the
parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of
the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or
proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any
such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit,
action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 13.01 (or,
in the case of Buyer, Section 13.07) shall be deemed effective service of
process on such party.

Section 13.07. AGENT FOR SERVICE. EACH OF BUYER AND BUYER GUARANTOR HEREBY

MINING USA LTD. (THE "PROCESS AGENT"), WITH AN OFFICE AT 2122 E. HIGHLAND
AVE., SUITE 335, PHOENIX, ARIZONA 85016 AS ITS DESIGNEE, APPOINTEE AND AGENT
TO RECEIVE, FOR AND ON ITS BEHALF, SERVICE OF PROCESS IN SUCH JURISDICTION IN
ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER
AGREEMENT EXECUTED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, AND SUCH SERVICE SHALL
BE DEEMED COMPLETE UPON DELIVERY THEREOF TO THE PROCESS AGENT; PROVIDED THAT
IN THE CASE OF ANY SUCH SERVICE UPON THE PROCESS AGENT, THE PARTY EFFECTING
SUCH SERVICE SHALL ALSO DELIVER A COPY THEREOF TO EACH OTHER SUCH PARTY IN THE
MANNER PROVIDED IN SECTION 13.01 OF THIS AGREEMENT. EACH OF BUYER AND BUYER
GUARANTOR SHALL TAKE ALL SUCH ACTION AS MAY BE NECESSARY TO CONTINUE SAID
APPOINTMENT IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT OR TO APPOINT ANOTHER AGENT SO THAT BUYER
AND BUYER GUARANTOR WILL AT ALL TIMES HAVE AN AGENT FOR SERVICE OF PROCESS FOR
THE ABOVE PURPOSES IN THE UNITED STATES. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT
OF ANY PARTY TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY MANNER PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

Section 13.08. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

Section 13.09. Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries.

(a) This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which
shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and
hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective
when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by the
other party hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart
hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect
and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue
of any other oral or written agreement or other communication).

(b) No provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits,
remedies, obligations, or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

Section 13.10. Entire Agreement. The Transaction Agreements and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties



with respect to the subject matter thereof and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to
the subject matter thereof.

Section 13.11. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, (a) the remainder
of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party, and (b) such determination shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other
jurisdiction. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

Section 13.12. Disclosure Schedules. Freeport has set forth information on the
Company Disclosure Schedule in a section thereof that corresponds to the
section of this Agreement to which it relates. A matter set forth in one
section of the Company Disclosure Schedule need not be set forth in any other
section so long as its relevance to such other section of the Company
Disclosure Schedule or section of this Agreement is reasonably apparent on the
face of the information disclosed therein to the Person to which such
disclosure is being made. The parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the
Company Disclosure Schedule may include certain items and information solely
for informational purposes for the convenience of Buyer and (b) the disclosure
by Freeport of any matter in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be
deemed to constitute an acknowledgment by Freeport that the matter is required
to be disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or that the matter is material.

Section 13.13. Fulfillment of Obligations. Any obligation of any party to any
other party under this Agreement which obligation is performed, satisfied or
fulfilled completely by an Affiliate of such party, shall be deemed to have
been performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such party.

Section 13.14. Seller Guarantor. Seller Guarantor hereby jointly and
severally, absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to Buyer (i)
the full, complete and timely payment, subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, by Freeport of each and every payment obligation of Freeport, without
any set off, restriction, condition or deduction for or on account of any
counterclaim; and (ii) the due and punctual performance and observance by
Freeport of all of Freeport's obligations, commitments and undertakings
hereunder. If Freeport shall default



for any reason whatsoever on any such payment or performance obligations, then
Seller Guarantor shall unconditionally perform or cause to be performed and
satisfy or cause to be satisfied the performance or payment obligations
immediately upon notice from Buyer specifying the default so that the same
benefits shall be conferred on Buyer as would have been received if such
performance or payment obligations had been duly performed and satisfied by
Freeport. Buyer shall not be required to initiate legal proceedings against
Freeport or any other Person prior to or contemporaneously with proceeding
against Seller Guarantor. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Seller
Guarantor waives (1) any and all legal and equitable defenses available to a
guarantor (other than payment in full by Freeport) and (2) promptness,
diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest, order and any notices
hereunder, including any notice of any amendment of this Agreement or waiver
or other similar action granted pursuant to this Agreement and any notice of
acceptance. The guarantee set forth in this Section 13.14 shall be deemed a
continuing guarantee and shall remain in full force and effect until the
satisfaction in full of all payment and performance obligations of Freeport
hereunder, notwithstanding the winding-up, liquidation, dissolution, merger or
other incapacity or other restructuring of Freeport or any change in the
status, control or ownership of Freeport. The guarantee set forth in this
Section 13.14 is a primary guarantee of payment and not just of collection.

Section 13.15. Buyer Guarantor. Buyer Guarantor hereby absolutely,
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee to Freeport (i) the full, complete
and timely payment, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, by Buyer of
each and every payment obligation of Buyer, without any set off, restriction,
condition or deduction for or on account of any counterclaim; and (ii) the due
and punctual performance and observance by Buyer of all of Buyer's
obligations, commitments and undertakings hereunder. If Buyer shall default
for any reason whatsoever on any such payment or performance obligations, then
Buyer Guarantor shall unconditionally perform or cause to be performed and
satisfy or cause to be satisfied the performance or payment obligations
immediately upon notice from Freeport specifying the default so that the same
benefits shall be conferred on Freeport as would have been received if such
performance or payment obligations had been duly performed and satisfied by
Buyer. Freeport shall not be required to initiate legal proceedings against
Buyer or any other Person prior to or contemporaneously with proceeding
against Buyer Guarantor. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Buyer
Guarantor waives (i) any and all legal and equitable defenses available to a
guarantor (other than payment in full by Buyer) and (ii) promptness,
diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest, order and any notices
hereunder, including any notice of any amendment of this Agreement or waiver
or other similar action granted pursuant to this Agreement and any notice of
acceptance. The guarantee set forth in this Section 13.15 shall be deemed a
continuing guarantee and shall remain in full force and effect until the
satisfaction in full of all payment and performance obligations of Buyer



hereunder, notwithstanding the winding-up, liquidation, dissolution, merger or
other incapacity or other restructuring of Buyer or any change in the status,
control or ownership of Buyer. The guarantee set forth in this Section 13.15
is a primary guarantee of payment and not just of collection.

Section 13.16. Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York or any New York
State court sitting in New York City, in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity. Each party agrees to waive any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such
remedy, and not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to
assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy.
