receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby
agree as follows:

 



 

 **1.** ** ****PURCHASE PRICE; CLOSING**

 



 

1.1 _Purchase and Sale of Acquired Units; Payment of Closing Purchase Price_.
At the Closing and upon all of the terms and subject to all of the conditions
of this Agreement, Sellers will transfer, assign and convey, and Purchaser
will purchase and accept from Sellers, the Acquired Units, free and clear of
all Liens. The aggregate consideration for the Acquired Units

(c) the Estimated Company Party Transaction Expenses, if any; and

Such aggregate consideration as adjusted with respect to Estimated

foregoing clauses (a) through (d) is referred to as the " _Closing Purchase
Price_ " and the Closing Purchase Price, as further adjusted pursuant to
_Section 1.4(b)_ is referred to as the " _Purchase Price_." The Closing
Purchase Price and the Purchase Price shall be allocated to each of the
Sellers in accordance with the Consideration Waterfall attached to the Flow of
Funds Memorandum.

 



 

1.2 _Closing Payments_.

 



 

(a) At the Closing, in full payment for the Acquired Units, Purchaser will pay
to, or on behalf of, the Sellers, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, the Closing Purchase Price, minus (i) the Indemnity Escrow Amount by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an escrow account (the "
_Indemnity Escrow Account_ ") to be established by the Purchaser with United

account (the " _Working Capital Escrow Account_ ") to be established by the
Purchaser with the Escrow Agent, to be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to
the terms of the Escrow Agreement, (iii) the BCA Earnout Escrow Amount by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an escrow account (the " _BCA
Earnout Escrow Account_ ") to be established by the Purchaser with the Escrow
Agent, to be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement and (iv) the Seller Representative Fund; _provided_ , that, solely
with respect to Sellers who are makers of Seller Subscription Note(s), each
such Sellers respective portion of the Seller Subscription Notes Pay-off
Amount shall be withheld from such Sellers portion of the Closing Purchase
Price in full repayment of each such Sellers Seller Subscription Note(s), and
the Company shall distribute the Seller Subscription Notes Pay-off Amount to
the Sellers in accordance with the Consideration Waterfall.

 



 

(b) At the Closing, Purchaser will pay to the Company (or, in the case of the
Estimated Indebtedness Amount or Estimated Company Party Transaction Expenses,
such other party as directed by the Company in the Flow of Funds Memorandum),
and the Company will pay at Closing: (i) the Estimated Indebtedness Amount as
set forth in any payoff letters in respect of such Estimated Indebtedness
Amount, if any; (ii) the Redemption Payment Amount to be made to each of the
Preferred Unit Holders and the Junior Preferred Unit Holders; (iii) the

 



      
 

 



 

amount of the unpaid Estimated Company Party Transaction Expenses, if any; and
(iv) the Closing Bonus Payments (together with the Companys share of required
withholding Taxes).

 



 

(c) At the Closing, Purchaser also will pay to (i) the Escrow Agent the
Indemnity Escrow Amount, the Working Capital Escrow Amount and the BCA Earnout
Escrow Amount, plus any fees due to the Escrow Agent under the Escrow
Agreement; it being understood that one-half of any such fees shall be a
Company Party Transaction Expense and (ii) the Seller Representative the
Seller Representative Fund.

 



 

1.3 _Flow of Funds Memorandum_. Not later than three (3) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a flow
of funds memorandum certified by the Seller Representative and the Chief
Financial Officer of the Company containing the Companys good faith estimate
(including all calculations in reasonable detail) of: (a) the Net Working
Capital (" _Estimated Net Working Capital_ "), together with an estimated
unaudited balance sheet of the Company Parties on a consolidated basis as of
the Effective Time (" _Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet_ "); (b) the
Indebtedness Amount (the " _Estimated Indebtedness Amount_ ") together with a
listing of the individual accounts, their payees and the amounts due to each
in respect thereof and payoff letters from the Companys lenders with respect
to the Indebtedness to be paid at the Closing; (c) the Company Party
Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated Company Party Transaction Expenses_ ")
together with a listing of the individual accounts, their payees and amounts
due to each in respect thereof; (d) the Redemption Payment Amount due to each

the Closing Bonus Payments and each recipient thereof; and (f) based on the
foregoing, the amount of the Closing Purchase Price and the allocation of the
Closing Purchase Price allocated to the Sellers pursuant to the Consideration
Waterfall attached to the statement and prepared in a manner consistent with
the Estimated Consideration Waterfall (such statement, the " _Flow of Funds
Memorandum_ "). With respect to the Estimated Net Working Capital, the Flow of
Funds Memorandum will be prepared applying the definition of Net Working
Capital contained herein. These calculations will be used in connection with
the payments described in _Section 1.2_. The Flow of Funds Memorandum also
will contain wire instructions for all of the foregoing payments (or
instructions to pay certain amounts by check).

 



 

1.4 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) _Preliminary Purchase Price Adjustment_. The Closing Purchase Price will
be adjusted by the difference between the Estimated Net Working Capital and
Fourteen Million Dollars ($14,000,000) (the " _Target Net Working Capital_ ")
as follows: (i) if the Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds the Target Net
Working Capital, the Closing Purchase Price will be increased dollar-for-
dollar by the amount of such excess; and (ii) if the Estimated Net Working
Capital is less than the Target Net Working Capital, the Closing Purchase
Price will be decreased dollar-for-dollar by such shortfall. The Closing
Purchase Price will thereafter be subject to further adjustment as provided in
_Section 1.4(b)_.

 



 

(b) _Final Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 



 

(i) _Calculation of Adjustment_. The Closing Purchase Price, as adjusted
pursuant to _Section 1.4(a)_ shall be recalculated using the Final Net
Working Capital, the Final Company Party Transaction Expenses and the Final
Indebtedness

 



      
 

 



 

Amount (as so finally determined) in lieu of the Estimated Net Working
Capital, the Estimated Company Party Transaction Expenses and the Estimated
Indebtedness Amount. Any payment owed pursuant to this _Section 1.4(b)_ will
be paid within five (5) Business Days after the Final Net Working Capital,
Final Company Party Transaction Expenses and Final Indebtedness Amount are
agreed to by Seller Representative and Purchaser or are determined by the
Neutral Auditor in accordance with _Section 1.4(b)(iv)_.

 



 

(1) If (x) the result of the Closing Purchase Price as so recalculated
pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)_ is greater than (y) the Closing Purchase Price
set forth on the Flow of Funds Memorandum (such excess of (x) over (y), the "
_Surplus_ "), then Purchaser shall pay to the Seller Representative (for
distribution to the Sellers in accordance with the Consideration Waterfall) an
amount equal to the Surplus and instruct the Escrow Agent to release the
Working Capital Escrow Amount to the Seller Representative for further
distribution to the Sellers in accordance with the Consideration Waterfall.

 



 

(2) If (x) the result of the Closing Purchase Price as so recalculated
pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)_ is less than (y) the Closing Purchase Price set
forth on the Flow of Funds Memorandum (such deficit of (x) relative to (y),
the " _Deficit_ "), then the Seller Representative will execute such
documentation necessary to instruct the Escrow Agent to pay an amount equal to
the Deficit to the Purchaser first from the Working Capital Escrow Account (by
execution of joint written instructions, signed by the Purchaser and the
Seller Representative, releasing such amount to Purchaser) to an account
designated by Purchaser and any shortfall in the Working Capital Escrow
Account shall be paid to Purchaser first, from the Indemnity Escrow Account,
to the extent of such Indemnity Escrow Amount, and then by each Seller,
severally and not jointly, pro rata (calculated based on such Sellers
Indemnity Percentage). Any remaining funds from the Working Capital Escrow
Account after payment to the Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 1.4(b)_ shall
be paid to the Seller Representative (for distribution to the Sellers in
accordance with the Consideration Waterfall).

 



 

(ii) _Preparation of Closing Date Balance Sheet Statement_. As soon as
practicable, and in any event within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date,
the Purchaser will prepare and deliver to Seller Representative (A) a balance
sheet of the Company as of the Effective Time (" _Closing Date Balance Sheet_
"), (B) a statement (the " _Closing Date Statement_ ") setting forth, in
reasonable detail, Purchasers calculation of (1) the Net Working Capital (the
" _Proposed Net Working Capital_ "), (2) the Company Party Transaction
Expenses (the " _Proposed Final Company Party Transaction Expenses_ ") and (3)
the Indebtedness Amount (the " _Proposed Final Indebtedness Amount_ "). If the
amounts set forth on the Closing Date Statement differ from those set forth on
the Flow of Funds Memorandum, then the Closing Date Statement shall include a
statement showing (a) the specific line items in the Estimated Net Working
Capital, Estimated Company Party Transaction Expenses and Estimated
Indebtedness Amount

 



      
 

 



 

corresponding to such differences; (b) the amount of each such line-item
difference; and (c) in reasonable detail, the factual, contractual or
accounting basis for each such difference. The parties acknowledge that no
adjustments may be made to the Target Net Working Capital. With respect to the
Proposed Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Statement will be prepared
applying the definition of Net Working Capital contained herein.

 



 

(iii) _Review and Resolution Period_. After receipt of the Closing Date
Statement, Seller Representative will have thirty (30) days to review it. To
the extent reasonably required to complete its review of the Closing Date
Statement, Seller Representative will have reasonable access during normal
business hours to working papers related to the preparation of the Closing
Date Statement. Seller Representative will deliver to Purchaser either (i) a
written acknowledgement accepting Purchasers calculation of the Proposed Net
Working Capital, Proposed Final Company Party Transaction Expenses and the
Proposed Final Indebtedness Amount or (ii) a written report setting forth in
reasonable detail any proposed adjustments thereto, including in reasonable
detail, the actual, contractual or accounting basis for each such disagreement
(the " _Adjustment Report_ ") on or prior to the thirtieth (30th) day after
receipt of the Closing Date Statement. If Seller Representative fails to
deliver an Adjustment Report in such thirty (30)-day period, such failure
shall constitute the Sellers acceptance of the Purchasers calculation of
Proposed Net Working Capital, Proposed Final Company Party Transaction
Expenses and Proposed Final Indebtedness Amount and the Seller Representative
will have waived its right to contest the Closing Date Statement or any
amounts set forth therein. If Seller Representative delivers an Adjustment
Report to the Purchaser in such thirty (30) day period, the parties will,
within thirty (30) days following the date of delivery of such Adjustment
Report (the " _Resolution Period_ "), attempt to resolve their differences and
any written resolution by them as to any disputed amount will be final and
binding for all purposes under this Agreement.

 



 

(iv) _Dispute Resolution Procedure_. If at the conclusion of the Resolution
Period the parties have not reached an agreement on any objections with
respect to the Closing Date Statement, then the Purchaser or the Seller
Representative may require the other party to resolve such dispute by way of
the Dispute Resolution Procedure by providing notice to the other party of
such demand. The term " _Final Net Working Capital_ ", " _Final Company Party
Transaction Expenses_ " and " _Final Indebtedness Amount_ " will mean the
definitive Net Working Capital, Company Party Transaction Expenses and
Indebtedness Amount agreed to by Seller Representative and Purchaser in
accordance with _Section 1.4(b)(iii)_ or the definitive Net Working Capital,
Company Party Transaction Expenses and Indebtedness Amount resulting from the
determination made by the Neutral Auditor in accordance with the Dispute
Resolution Procedure.

 



 

1.5 _Form of Payments_. Except as expressly provided herein, all payments
under this Agreement will be made by delivery to the recipient by depositing,
by wire transfer, the required amount (in immediately available funds in
United States currency) in an account of the recipient, which account will be
designated by the recipient in writing at least three (3) Business Days prior
to the date of the required payment. Any amounts payable by any party under
this Agreement that are not paid on the date when due shall bear interest
after such date at

 



      
 

 



 

a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" as published in The Wall Street
Journal, Eastern Edition on the Closing Date, plus three percent (3%).

 



 

1.6 _Closing_.

 



 

(a) Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_ ,
the closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Closing_ ") will take place at the offices of Holland and Knight LLP in McLean,
Virginia on the first date that is (i) on or after the third Business Day
following the satisfaction of or waiver of all conditions to the obligations
of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (other than
conditions with respect to actions the respective parties will take at the
Closing itself) and (ii) the earlier of (A) April 1, 2015 and (B) April 15,
2015, that follows such satisfaction or waiver of conditions; provided, that
if the Closing has not occurred by April 15, 2015, the Closing shall take
place on the first date after April 15, 2015 that is on or after the third
Business Day following the satisfaction of or waiver of all conditions to the
obligations of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
(other than conditions with respect to actions the respective parties will
take at Closing itself), or such other date, time and place as the Purchaser
and the Seller Representative may agree (the " _Closing Date_ "). By mutual
agreement of the parties, the Closing may take place by conference call and
electronic (i.e., email/PDF) or facsimile delivery with exchange of original
signatures by overnight mail. To the extent permitted by Law and GAAP, for Tax
and accounting purposes, the parties will treat the Closing as being effective
at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the Closing Date (the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

(b) At the Closing, (i) the Seller Representative or the Company will deliver
to the Purchaser the various certificates, instruments, and documents referred
to in _Section 7.1_ and (ii) the Purchaser will deliver to the Company, the
Sellers, the Seller Representative and/or the applicable third parties the
various certificates, instruments, and documents referred to in _Section 7.2_.

 



 

1.7 _Amounts Withheld_. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold or
cause to be deducted and withheld from amounts otherwise payable to any Person
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to such payments under any provision of Law. The Parties
shall cooperate in good faith to ascertain prior to Closing whether Tax
withholding will be required from any payments due to the Sellers in their
capacity as such. Any amounts so deducted and withheld will be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

1.8 _Consent of Sellers_. Upon execution of this Agreement, each Seller
hereby irrevocably approves and consents to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and transactions contemplated hereby, including the sale and
transfer of the Acquired Units to Purchaser and admission of Purchaser as a
member of the Company at the Closing, and, effective as of the Closing, waives
and releases all rights of first refusal, tag along rights and other rights to
acquire or restrict the transfer of, and all Liens and rights to impose Liens
on, the Acquired Units, and all rights to object to, restrict, prohibit or
delay in any manner whatsoever any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and/or any of the terms and conditions hereof. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the Company LLC Agreement, effective as of the
Closing, the Sellers hereby waive any and all rights to receive any amounts
arising from or

 



      
 

 



 

otherwise related to their ownership of membership interests in the Company in
excess of the amounts payable to such holders under this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents, including any dividends payable to such holders
pursuant to the terms of the Company LLC Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, nothing contained in this Agreement (including this
_Section 1.8_ , _Section 5.14_ and _Section 13_ ) shall affect, limit or
impair the rights and remedies of any Seller that is a Lender Holder (as such
term is defined in the Company LLC Agreement) or any of its Affiliates solely
in its capacity as a lender to any Company Party pursuant to any agreement
under which a Company Party has borrowed money from any such Lender Holder or
any of its Affiliates.

 



 

1.9 _Prior Transaction Payments_. Upon the final determination of all Prior
Transaction Payments pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreements, if
the amount of Prior Transaction Payments included in the Final Indebtedness
Amount is greater than the aggregate amount of the finally determined Prior
Transaction Payments then, within five (5) Business Days of such final
determination Purchaser shall promptly pay to the Seller Representative for
further distribution to the Sellers the amount of any such difference.
Purchaser shall provide the Seller Representative a copy of all written
notices delivered by Purchaser or third parties in connection with the
calculation and final determination of any Prior Transaction Payment.
Additionally, Purchaser shall provide Seller Representative reasonable access
upon reasonable prior notice during normal business hours to working papers
related to the calculation and final determination of the Prior Transaction
Payments.

 



 

1.10 _BCA Earnout Escrow Account_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing, the Company shall in good faith and in
accordance with the BCA Purchase Agreement make a final determination of the
BCA Earnout, which shall be delivered to the Seller Representative at least
ten (10) Business Days prior to the presentation of the final determination to
the sellers under the BCA Purchase Agreement (the " _Review Period_ "). During
the Review Period, the Company shall consider in good faith any comments from
Seller Representative regarding the reasonable correctness of the Companys
calculation of the BCA Earnout. If within the Review Period, the Seller
Representative believes in good faith that the Companys final determination
of the BCA Earnout is not reasonably correct, then the Seller Representative
may deliver a written objection to the Companys determination (containing
reasonable detail regarding the basis for the Seller Representatives
objection) to the Company. After receipt of a written objection from the
Seller Representative, the Company may nevertheless pay the amount of the BCA
Earnout (as determined by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion) to
the sellers under the BCA Purchase Agreement. If the Seller Representative
does not deliver a written objection by the Review Period, then (i) the
Companys calculation of the BCA Earnout shall be deemed final and accepted by
the Sellers and (ii) the Seller Representative shall deliver the joint
instructions to the Escrow Agent as set forth in _Section 1.10(b)_.

 



 

(b) Following the final determination of the BCA Earnout and the expiration of
Review Period, if the Seller Representative has not delivered a written
objection in accordance with _Section 1.10(a)_ during the Review Period, the
Purchaser and the Seller Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow
Agent to distribute to the Company (for further payment to the sellers under
the BCA Purchase Agreement if not already paid by the Company pursuant to
_Section 1.10(a)_ ), an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the BCA Earnout
Escrow

 



      
 

 



 

Amount and (ii) the final amount of the BCA Earnout Amount; _provided_ , that
if the final amount of the BCA Earnout is less than the amount in the BCA
Earnout Escrow Account, the Escrow Agent shall distribute to the Seller
Representative for further distribution to the Sellers, in accordance with the
Consideration Waterfall, the amount of any such difference. The BCA Earnout
Escrow Amount shall be held in escrow by the Escrow Agent and only distributed
pursuant to a joint written instruction by Purchaser and the Seller
Representative or a final, non-appealable court order from a court of
competent jurisdiction.

 



 

 **2. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLERS**

 



 

Each Seller separately, and not jointly and severally, hereby represents and
warrants to Purchaser the following matters in this _Section 2_. These
representations and warranties, and the information set forth in the

organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its formation, and is qualified or registered to do business
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or operations would

consummate the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents or (b) adversely affect the ability of the Company to
conduct its business.

 



 

2.2 _Necessary Authority_. Such Seller has full power, authority and legal

performing its obligations hereunder or thereunder.

 



 

2.6 _Litigation; Compliance with Law_. There is no Claim or Order of any

2.7 _No Conflicts_. The execution, delivery and performance by such Seller of
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which such Seller is a
party, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein or therein
do not and will not (a) to the extent such Seller is not an individual,
violate such Sellers Charter or Governing Documents or other organizational
or constitutional documents of such Seller; (b) require such Seller to obtain
the consent or approvals of, or make any filing with, any Person or
Governmental Authority, except for the Required Statutory Approvals and
consents and approvals already obtained and notices or filings already made

Approvals, violate any applicable Law to which such Seller is subject; or (d)

any indebtedness of any Company Party under any Lease. The leasehold interest

Policy (except for the expiration of the RandW Insurance Policy in accordance

agreements) will (i) hire any employee of any Company Party, or (ii) solicit,

_Section 5.13_ shall not render this Agreement unenforceable as applied to any
one or more of the other areas or other restrictions herein.

 



 

(c) The parties acknowledge that the restrictions set forth in this _Section
5.13_ are necessary for the protection of Purchaser and its Affiliates and
that any breach thereof may cause such Persons irreparable damage, that such
Persons remedies at law in the event of such breach would be inadequate, and
that, accordingly, Purchaser shall be entitled to the issuance by a court of

other remedies that Purchaser may have in law or in equity.

limitations and conditions provided in this Agreement or such applicable
Transaction Document, (ii) any indemnification or similar obligations of the
Company Parties existing as of the date of this Agreement to any of the

arising prior to the Closing for employment or consulting compensation,

(ii) any non-fulfillment or breach by the Sellers or, prior to the Closing,
the Company, of any covenant or obligation applicable to it contained in this
Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents;

 



 

(iii) (A) any Company Party Transaction Expenses or Indebtedness not paid
prior to or at the Closing to the extent that such amounts are not reflected
in the calculation of Estimated Net Working Capital contained in the Flow of
Funds Memorandum, and (B) any other inaccuracy in the amounts reflected in the
Flow of Funds Memorandum;

 



 

(iv) the matter set forth on _Schedule 9.2(a)(iv)_ ; and

 



 

(v) payments made by the Purchaser or any Company Party in respect of any DandO
Obligations, to the extent not reimbursed or reimbursable by the Tail Policy.

 



 

(b) Subject to the provisions of this _Section 9_, from and after the
Closing, the Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller
Representative, the Sellers, and their respective Representatives from and
against any and all Losses incurred or sustained by such Persons, or any of
them, directly or indirectly, as a result of, or with respect to or in
connection with:

 



 

(i) any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty of the
Purchaser contained in this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents; or

 



 

(ii) any non-fulfillment or breach by Purchaser or (from and after the
Closing, the Company), of any covenant or obligation applicable to them
contained in this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, solely for purposes of this _Section 9.2_,
Transaction Documents shall not include the documents or agreements
contemplated by _Section 7.1(s)_ unless otherwise agreed in writing by the
parties.

 



 

9.3 _Indemnification Claims_.

 



 

(a) _Claims for Indemnification_. In order to seek indemnification under
_Section 9.2_, the party claiming indemnification (the " _Indemnified Party_
") shall deliver an Indemnity Claim Notice to the party from whom the
indemnification is sought (each, an " _Indemnifying Party_ " and collectively,
the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ") (which if the Indemnified Party is a Purchaser
Indemnified Party, such Indemnity Claim Notice shall specify in reasonable
detail the nature and good faith estimate based on information then available
to the Indemnified Party of the amount of any such Claim and be sent to the
Seller Representative and the Escrow Agent) at any time on or before 11:59
p.m. (ET) on the applicable Survival Date; _provided_ , that so long as such
Indemnity Claim Notice is given within such time period, the failure to
promptly provide such notice shall not affect the rights of such Indemnified
Parties to indemnification

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to this _Section 9_ except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
shall have been actually and materially prejudiced thereby. If the Indemnified
Party is a Purchaser Indemnified Party, then unless the Seller Representative
shall have delivered an Objection Notice pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)_, and
subject in all events to the limitations under this _Section 9_ (including
_Section 9.4_ hereof) the amount of the claim specified in the Indemnity
Claim Notice shall be paid to the Indemnified Party in accordance with
_Section 9.3(c)(iii)_.

 



 

(b) _Objections to Claims for Indemnification_. No payment shall be made under
_Section 9.3(a)_ if the Indemnifying Party shall object in a written
statement to the claim made in the Indemnity Claim Notice (an " _Objection
Notice_ "), and such Objection Notice shall have been delivered to the
Indemnified Party, and the Escrow Agent if the Indemnified Party is a
Purchaser Indemnified Party, prior to 11:59 p.m. (ET) on the twentieth (20th)
day after the Indemnifying Partys receipt of the Indemnity Claim Notice.

 



 

(c) _Resolution of Conflicts; Recourse_.

 



 

(i) If the Indemnifying Party delivers an Objection Notice in accordance with
_Section 9.3(b)_, Seller Representative and Purchaser shall attempt in good
faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each
of such claims. If the Indemnified Party is a Purchaser Indemnified Party and
if Seller Representative and Purchaser should so agree, joint written
instructions setting forth such agreement, including the amounts Seller
Representative and Purchaser agree should be released from the Indemnity
Escrow Account, shall be prepared and signed by both parties and furnished to
the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such joint
written instructions and make distributions from the Indemnity Escrow Account
in accordance with the terms thereof.

 



 

(ii) At any time following delivery of an Objection Notice pursuant to
_Section 9.3(b)_ or in the event of any dispute arising pursuant to _Section
9_, either Purchaser or the Seller Representative may pursue any and all legal
or equitable remedies available to them under applicable Law, and the Escrow
Agent shall only distribute funds thereafter pursuant to joint written
instructions as described in _Section 9.3(c)(i)_ or a final, non-appealable
court order from a court of competent jurisdiction

 



 

(iii) With respect to any Losses for which a Purchaser Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ or _Section 10.3(b)_,
(A) such Losses (in excess of the Threshold Amount, if applicable) shall be
satisfied first from the Indemnity Escrow Account to the extent of such
Indemnity Escrow Amount, (B) second, such Losses (in excess of the Threshold
Amount, if applicable, and the amount paid from Indemnity Escrow Account)
shall be satisfied from recoveries under the RandW Insurance Policy, to the
extent the Purchaser Indemnified Party obtains such recoveries after
exercising commercially reasonable efforts to seek and procure such
recoveries; _provided_ , that Purchaser shall have no obligation to seek
recovery under the RandW Insurance Policy if and to the extent that the RandW
Insurance Policy does not cover such Losses and (C) third, such Losses (in
excess of the Threshold Amount, if applicable, and the amount paid from the
Indemnity Escrow Account and the recoveries received under the RandW Insurance
Policy, if any, following the exercise of

 



      
 

 



 

the commercially reasonable efforts described in the immediately foregoing
clause (B)), shall be paid by each Seller, severally and not jointly, pro rata
(calculated based on such Sellers applicable Indemnity Percentage).

 



 

(iv) Any (A) Losses in excess of the Threshold Amount, if any, for which a
Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under _Section
9.2(a)(i)_ or _Section 10.3(b)_ that are not covered under the RandW Insurance
Policy according to its terms or (B) Losses under _Section 9.2(a)(ii)-(v)_,
shall be paid (i) first, from the Indemnity Escrow Account to the extent of
such Indemnity Escrow Amount and (ii) second, to the extent that the Indemnity
Escrow Account has been fully depleted, by each Seller, severally and not
jointly, pro rata (calculated based on such Sellers applicable Indemnity
Percentage).

 



 

(d) _Third-Party Claims_. In the event any Indemnified Party becomes aware of
a third party claim (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") which such Indemnified Party
reasonably believes may result in a demand for indemnification pursuant to
this _Section 9_ (it being understood and agreed that knowledge of employees
of the Company Parties as of the Closing with respect to facts or
circumstances prior to the Closing will not be imputed to Purchaser or its
Affiliates for this purpose), such Indemnified Party shall promptly provide
written notification (a " _Third Party Claim Notice_ ") to the Indemnifying
Party (which if the Indemnified Party is a Purchaser Indemnified Party, such
Third Party Claim Notice shall be sent to Seller Representative and the Escrow
Agent) of such claim after it becomes aware of such Third Party Claim
specifying the nature of such Third Party Claim and the amount or estimated
amount thereof, together with copies of all notices and documents (including
court papers) served on or received by such Indemnified Party, which notice
must be identified as a "Third Party Claim Notice"; _provided_ , that the
failure to promptly provide such notice shall not affect the rights of such
Indemnified Parties to indemnification pursuant to this _Section 9_ except to
the extent that the Indemnifying Party shall have been materially prejudiced
thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of a
Third Party Claim Notice to assume by written notice to the Indemnified Party
(which shall include the acknowledgement of the Indemnifying Party of its
obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party fully in respect of such Third
Party Claim in accordance with this Agreement and subject to the limitations
set forth in this _Section 9_ (including _Section 9.4_), as applicable), the
entire control of the defense, compromise or settlement of such claim or
demand (including the selection of counsel), subject to the right of the
Indemnified Party to participate (with counsel of its choice, but the fees and
expenses of such additional counsel shall solely be at the expense of the
Indemnified Party; _provided_ , that the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party, if based on the reasonable opinion
of counsel to the Indemnified Party, an actual conflict exists between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party in connection with such Third
Party Claim); and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Indemnifying Party will
not be entitled to control, and the Indemnified Party will be entitled to have
control over, the defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim (and the cost
of such defense and any Losses with respect to such Third Party Claim shall
constitute an amount for which the Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification hereunder) if (i) the Third Party Claim involves a criminal
proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation or a Fraud-Type
Claim, (ii) if the Third Party Claim seeks injunctive or equitable relief,
(iii) the Third Party Claim may result in suspension of debarment of Purchaser
or any Company Party by a Governmental Authority or (iv) the Third Party Claim
has reasonable

 



      
 

 



 

likelihood of resulting in Losses that, at the time of such Third Party Claim,
would exceed by more than twenty percent (20%) the aggregate amounts to which
such Indemnified Party is entitled with respect to such claim under _Section
9.4(b)_ below. The Indemnifying Party will not compromise or settle any such
action, suit, proceeding, claim or demand without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party, unless, after consultation with the Indemnified Party,
(x) such settlement is solely for the payment of money and does not impose any
injunctive or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party nor require any
admission or acknowledgement of liability or fault of the Indemnified Party,
(y) the Indemnifying Party makes such payment in full (irrespective of any
limitations contained herein) and (z) the Indemnified Party receives an
unconditional release from all liabilities and obligations with respect to
such matter, with prejudice. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the
defense of a Third Party Claim within thirty (30) days after receipt of the
Third Party Claim Notice (or ceases in good faith and with reasonable
diligence to continue the defense of such Third Party Claim), then the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to control of the defense, compromise
or settlement of such Third Party Claim (including the selection of counsel)
without waiving any right to indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement,
subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party to participate (with counsel of
its choice, but the fees and expenses of such additional counsel shall solely
be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party), and the Indemnified Party will
not compromise or settle any such action, suit, proceeding, claim or demand
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The party hereto
that is not conducting the defense shall provide the party conducting the
defense and its counsel with reasonable access during normal business hours to
such partys records and personnel relating to any Third Party Claim and shall
otherwise reasonably cooperate with the party conducting the defense in the
defense or settlement thereof.

 



 

9.4 _Thresholds and Limitations on Indemnity; Remedy_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of _Section 9_ to the contrary, except as
set forth in the second and third sentences of this _Section 9.4(a)_, a
Purchaser Indemnified Party may not recover any Losses under _Section
9.2(a)(i)_ unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses incurred by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties exceeds in the aggregate, One Million Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000) (the " _Threshold Amount_ "), in which
case, subject to the provisions of this _Section 9_ (including _Section
9.4(b)_), such Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover all
Losses so incurred in excess of the Threshold Amount. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision in _Section 9_ to the contrary, where the
aggregate amount of Losses related to any individual items or aggregated items
arising out of the same or similar facts, events or circumstances for which a
Purchaser Indemnified Party could otherwise seek indemnification under this
_Section 9_ does not exceed Twenty Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) (the "
_Minimum Claim Threshold_ "), such individual items or aggregated items shall
not count toward the Threshold Amount as Losses for purposes of, or otherwise
be subject to indemnification under this Agreement. The parties acknowledge
and agree that the foregoing limitations with respect to the Threshold Amount
and the Minimum Claim Threshold do not apply to Losses or claims arising out
of or relating to (i) an inaccuracy in or a breach of the Fundamental
Representations, (ii) Fraud-Type Claims, (iii) Taxes or Benefit Plans or (iv)
indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(ii)-(v)_.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) _Limitations on Indemnity_. Notwithstanding any provision of _Section 9_
or _Section 10.3(b)_ to the contrary, except as set forth in the second
sentence of this _Section 9.4(b)_ , with respect to Losses for which a
Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to
_Section 9.2(a)(i)_ and _Section 10.3(b)_ , the Sellers in the aggregate shall
not have liability pursuant to this Agreement in excess of an amount equal to
Twenty-Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($22,500,000) less any
amounts paid to any Purchaser Indemnified Party from the Indemnity Escrow
Account or pursuant to the RandW Insurance Policy with each Sellers liability
to be several, and not joint, pro rata based on such Sellers applicable
Indemnity Percentage (other than such amounts paid pursuant to the RandW
Insurance Policy in respect of an inaccuracy in or a breach of any Fundamental
Representation). The parties acknowledge and agree that the aggregate
liability limitation in the immediately foregoing sentence does not apply to
Losses or Claims arising out of or relating to (x) an inaccuracy in or a
breach of the Fundamental Representations, (y) Fraud-Type Claims or (z)
indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(ii)-(v)_. To the extent the
Sellers have indemnification obligations (1) in respect of matters described
in the immediately foregoing clauses (x)-(z) or (2) in excess of the Indemnity
Escrow Account that are not recovered by Purchaser under the RandW Insurance
Policy (after using commercially reasonable efforts to seek and procure such
recovery), the Sellers shall be severally, and not jointly, liable for any
indemnification obligations, pro rata (calculated based on such Sellers
Indemnity Percentage). In no event shall any Seller be liable for
indemnification hereunder in excess of such Sellers Indemnity Percentage of
the sum of the Purchase Price actually received plus the Included Redemption
Payment Amount. Notwithstanding any provision of _Section 9_ to the contrary,
the Sellers in the aggregate shall not have liability in respect of claims
related to this Agreement based on willful misconduct in excess of Twenty-Two
Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($22,500,000). Any Losses that are
subject to indemnification under both _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ and _Section
10.3(b)_ (or under Section _9.2(a)(ii)_ to the extent relating to obligations
under _Section 10.3(b)_ ) shall, for purposes of this _Section 9.4_ and
_Section 9.3_ , be treated as Losses under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_.

 



 

(c) If any Indemnified Party collects an amount in discharge of a claim in
respect of a Loss pursuant to this _Section 9_ and such Indemnified Party
and/or an Affiliate thereof subsequently recovers from a third party by way of
insurance (including under the RandW Insurance Policy but only to the extent
such claim is paid by Sellers pursuant to Section 9.3(c)(iii)(C)) or otherwise
such that the Indemnified Party has received an amount in connection therewith
in excess of its related Losses (such excess recovery, the " _Excess Recovery_
"), such Indemnified Party shall (or, as appropriate, shall cause an Affiliate
to) repay to the Indemnifying Party or Parties an amount equal to the Excess
Recovery less any costs or expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in
procuring the Excess Recovery, including the amount of any co-payment or
deductible and any increase in premiums arising from or relating to the
underlying claim (but no more than the amount paid by the Indemnifying Party
to the Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section 9_ ).

 



 

(d) In the event any Losses incurred by an Indemnified Party are covered by
insurance available to an Indemnified Party (other than the RandW Insurance
Policy which is addressed above), each Indemnified Party agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery under such insurance, but
shall not be required to commence litigation or other proceeding against any
insurer.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Any Losses for which any Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
under this _Section 9_ shall be determined without duplication of recovery by
reason of the state of facts giving rise to such Losses constituting a breach
of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

 



 

(f) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification
under this _Section 9_ with respect to any amount resulting in a claim to the
extent that such amount is reflected in the final determination of Final Net
Working Capital pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)_ hereof.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein shall give
rise to any right on the part of any party hereto, after the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, to rescind this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

9.5 _Indemnification Rights Remedies Exclusive_. From and after the Closing,
except for Fraud-Type Claims and the rights of the Purchaser under the RandW
Insurance Policy, the rights of the Indemnified Parties to indemnification
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
strictly limited to those contained in this _Section 9_ and _Section 10_ ,
and, such indemnification rights shall be the exclusive remedies of the
Indemnified Parties subsequent to the Closing Date with respect to any matter
in any way relating to this Agreement or arising in connection herewith.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 9.5_ shall not (i) interfere with
or impede the operation of the provisions of _Section 1_ providing for the
resolution of certain disputes relating to the Purchase Price between the
parties and/or by a Neutral Auditor in accordance with the Dispute Resolution
Procedure or (ii) limit the rights of the parties to specific performance in
accordance with _Section 11_.

 



 

9.6 _Tax Treatment_. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, all
indemnification payments will constitute adjustments to the Purchase Price for
all Tax purposes, to the extent permissible under applicable Tax law, and no
party will take any position inconsistent with such characterization.

 



 

9.7 _Mitigation_. In the event of any breach giving rise to an indemnification
obligation under this _Section 9_ , each party agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate any Loss, liability or damage resulting from
the related breach upon and after becoming aware of any event or condition
which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that are
indemnifiable hereunder (it being understood and agreed that knowledge of
employees of the Company Parties as of the Closing with respect to facts or
circumstances prior to the Closing will not be imputed to Purchaser or its
Affiliates for this purpose), including responding to such claims or
liabilities in the same manner as the applicable party would respond to such
claims or liabilities in the absence of indemnification provisions of this
Agreement; _provided_ , that this _Section 9.7_ shall not obligate any party
to file a lawsuit or initiate any other legal proceeding or action or disclose
any confidential information.

 



 

9.8 _No Contribution; Subrogation_. Subject to the DandO Obligations, no Seller
shall have any right of contribution against any Company Party, or any of
their respective, directors, officers or employees, with respect to any breach
by the Company or the Sellers or any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements. Upon making an indemnification

 



      
 

 



 

payment pursuant to this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party will, to the extent
of such payment, be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party against
any third party in respect of any claim (both third party claims and direct
claims) to which the payment related to the extent not otherwise subrogated to
the rights of the insurer of the RandW Insurance Policy; _provided_ , _however_
, that no Seller shall have any such right of subrogation against any then-
current customer, supplier or employee of any Company Party, and promptly
following the Indemnifying Partys request, the Indemnified Party will take
all commercially reasonable actions to accomplish the foregoing. For purposes
of clarity, in the event that a Purchaser Indemnified Party seeks payments
from Sellers, severally, pursuant to clause (C) of _Section 9.3(c)(iii)_ ,
then, upon Purchaser receiving a full indemnification payment pursuant to such
clause, the Sellers will be subrogated, to the extent of such Losses, to all
related rights and remedies of the Purchaser under such RandW Insurance Policy
with respect to such Losses, and promptly following the Seller
Representatives request, the Purchaser will take all commercially reasonable
actions in compliance with the terms of the RandW Insurance Policy to accomplish
the foregoing.

 

 ** **

 

 **10.** ** ****POST CLOSING MATTERS. Following the Closing Date, the parties
agree as follows:**

 



 

10.1 _Cooperation_. In case at any time after the Closing any further action
is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each of the parties
will take such further action (including the execution and delivery of such
further instruments and documents) as any other party reasonably may request,
all at the sole cost and expense of the requesting party (unless the
requesting party is entitled to indemnification therefor under _Section 9_
hereof).

 



 

10.2 _Litigation Support_. In the event and for so long as any party is
actively contesting or defending against any Claim in connection with (a) any
transaction contemplated under this Agreement or (b) any fact, situation,
circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event,
incident, action, failure to act or transaction that existed on or prior to
the Closing Date involving any Company Party, each of the other parties will
cooperate with such party and such partys counsel in the contest or defense,
make available their personnel, and provide such testimony and access to their
books and records as will be reasonably necessary in connection with the
contest or defense, all at the sole cost and expense of the contesting or
defending party (unless the contesting or defending party is entitled to
indemnification therefor under _Section 9_ hereof).

 



 

10.3 _Tax Matters_

 



 

(a) _Tax Allocation_. In the case of a Tax that is payable with respect to a
period that includes but does not end on the Closing Date (a " _Straddle
Period_ "), the portion of such Tax that is allocable to the portion of the
Straddle Period that ends as of the close of business on the Closing Date
shall:

 



 

(i) except as to Taxes described in _Section 10.3(a)(ii)_ , be determined
based on a "closing of the books" of the Company Parties as of the close of
business on the Closing Date; and

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) in the case of an _ad valorem_ Tax on real or personal property or a
franchise Tax not based on gross or net income, be determined by multiplying
the amount of such Tax for the entire period by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the taxable period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire taxable period.

 



 

For U.S. federal, state and local income Tax purposes, income of a Company
Party with respect to an interest in an entity that is classified as a
partnership for such purposes shall be determined as if the taxable year of
such partnership closed on the Closing Date. For purposes of this _Section
10.3_ , all Transaction Tax Deductions shall be treated as allocable to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period and all employment, payroll and other Taxes associated
with the payments giving rise to such Transaction Tax Deductions shall
likewise be treated as allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period

 



 

(b) _Sellers  Responsibility for Taxes_. Sellers, severally and not jointly,
shall be liable for, and shall indemnify Purchaser and the Company Parties
from and against liability for the following Taxes and any Losses incurred in
contesting or otherwise incurred in connection with any such Taxes: (i) Taxes
imposed on or with respect to any of the Company Parties with respect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period (including, with respect to a Straddle Period, Taxes
that are allocable, pursuant to _Section 10.3(a)_ , to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period); (ii) Taxes imposed on any of the Company Parties or for which any of
the Company Parties is liable pursuant to the Treasury Regulations under
Section 1502 of the Code (or corresponding provisions of state, local or
foreign Tax Law) that are attributable to the inclusion of such Company Party
in an Affiliated Group with any Person with respect to any Tax period or
portion of a Tax period on or before the Closing Date; (iii) Taxes imposed on
any Person other than a Company Party for which a Company Party is liable by
operation of Law or agreement with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period,
other than any such Taxes imposed under a lease, loan agreement or other
agreement entered into in the Ordinary Course of Business, the primary purpose
of which is not the indemnification of Taxes; and (iv) Transfer Taxes for
which Sellers are responsible pursuant to _Section 10.4(e)_ ; _provided_ ,
however, that Sellers shall not be liable for any Tax (or any related Losses)
if, and to the extent that, such Tax has been taken into account as a
liability in the determination of Final Net Working Capital or as a reduction
in the Base Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 1.1(d)_. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the obligations of Sellers with
respect to Taxes (and related Losses) pursuant to this _Section 10.3(b)_ shall
not terminate prior to the end of the sixtieth (60th) day following the
expiration of the statute of limitations applicable with respect to such
Taxes; _provided_ , however, that if, at any time prior to the end of such
sixtieth (60th) day following the expiration of the statute of limitations
applicable with respect to such Taxes, an Indemnity Claim Notice is delivered
alleging liability of Sellers for Taxes or Losses pursuant to this _Section
10.3(b)_ , then the claim asserted in such Indemnity Claim Notice shall
survive the Survival Date until such claim is fully and finally resolved. The
provisions of _Sections 9.4(b)  (g)_, _9.5_ , _9.6_ and _9.7_ shall apply
with respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Section
10.3(b)_.

 



 

(c) _Tax Returns_. Seller Representative, at the cost and expense of the
Sellers, will prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file all Tax Returns
required to be filed by or on behalf of the Company Parties after the Closing
Date which apply to periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date and
Purchaser, at its cost and expense, will prepare or cause to be

 



      
 

 



 

prepared and timely file all Tax Returns required to be filed by or on behalf
of the Company Parties, which apply to Straddle Periods. Such Tax Returns will
be prepared in a manner consistent with applicable Tax Laws and with the prior
practice of the Company Parties unless otherwise required by applicable Tax
Laws; _provided_ , however, that Purchaser will not waive any carryback of any
net operating loss, capital loss or credit on any such Straddle Period Tax
Return. A reasonable time prior to filing any Tax Return for a pre-Closing Tax
Period or Straddle Period (such reasonable time to be not fewer than twenty
(20) days prior to filing in the case of an income Tax Return), Purchaser or
Seller Representative, as the case may be, will deliver to Seller
Representative or Purchaser, as the case may be, such Tax Return, will permit
Seller Representative, or Purchaser, as the case may be, to review and comment
on each such Tax Return and will consider in good faith such revisions to such
Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by Seller Representative, or
Purchaser, as the case may be (provided that, in the case of a state or local
income Tax Return for a Straddle Period, prepared by Purchaser, Purchaser
shall make revisions reasonably requested by Seller Representative that impact
the Tax liability of Sellers) if received at least ten (10) days prior to
filing, in the case of income Tax Returns or, at least a reasonable period of
time prior to the due date of such Tax Returns in the case of other Tax
Returns. The Company Parties will be responsible for paying any Taxes shown as
due from the Company Parties on such Tax Returns, and, within five (5)
Business Days following such payment, (i) Sellers shall pay to Purchaser an
amount equal to the excess of (x) the amount of Taxes attributable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period (as determined, in the case of Straddle Periods, under
_Section 10.3(a)_ ) shown on any such Tax Return over (y) the amount of such
Taxes paid (whether as payments of estimated Tax or credits of prior years
Tax refunds or expressly taken into account as a liability reducing the Final
Net Working Capital) by the Company Parties on or before the Closing Date and
(ii) Purchaser shall pay to the Seller Representative an amount equal to the
excess of the amount in clause (y) over the amount described in clause (x)
above.

 



 

(d) _Allocation Statement_. Within forty-five (45) days after the
determination of the Final Net Working Capital, the Final Company Party
Transaction Expenses and the Final Indebtedness Amount pursuant to _Section
1.4(b)_ , Purchaser will deliver or cause to be delivered to Seller
Representative a statement containing the allocation of the Purchase Price
among the assets of the Company (the " _Allocation Statement_ "). The
Allocation Statement will be prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the
Code and any comparable provisions of Law, as appropriate. Seller
Representative will be entitled to review and comment on the Allocation
Statement, and Purchaser and Seller Representative shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve any disagreement between them regarding such Allocation
Statement. If Purchaser and Seller Representative agree on an Allocation
Statement, the parties (and their Affiliates) will report the allocation of
the total consideration among the assets of Company in a manner consistent
with the Allocation Statement and will act in accordance with the Allocation
Statement in the preparation and timely filing of all Tax Returns (including
filing Form 8594 with their respective federal income Tax Returns for the
taxable year that includes the Closing Date and any other forms or statements
required by the Code, Regulations, the Internal Revenue Service or any
applicable state or local Government Authority). However, nothing herein shall
require Purchaser and Seller Representative to agree on an Allocation
Statement.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _Contests_.

 



 

(i) After the Closing Date, Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller
Representative in writing of any written notice of a proposed adjustment or
Claim in an audit or administrative or judicial proceeding involving Purchaser
or any of the Company Parties which, if determined adversely to the taxpayer,
would be grounds for indemnification under this _Section 10.3_ ; _provided_ ,
however, that a failure or delay to give such notice will not affect
Purchasers right to indemnification thereunder except to the extent, if any,
that Sellers are materially prejudiced thereby.

 



 

(ii) In the case of an audit or administrative or judicial proceeding that
relates solely to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date,
_provided_ , that, Seller Representative acknowledges in writing its
obligation to indemnify Purchaser and the Company Parties (to the extent not
covered by the RandW Insurance Policy or Indemnity Escrow Account) amount of any
adjustment that may be made as a result of such audit or proceeding and,
_provided_ further, that such audit or proceeding does not seek criminal
penalties against any of the Company Parties or material equitable or other
non-monetary remedies against any of the Company Parties, Seller
Representative shall have the right at Seller Representatives expense to
participate in and control the conduct of such audit or proceeding. Subject to
the provisions and limitations set forth in the preceding sentence, Purchaser
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow Seller Representative,
at Seller Representatives expense, to control any portion of any other audit
or proceeding that relates to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing
Date. The Seller Representative shall keep Purchaser informed of the progress
of any such audit or proceeding (including the prompt provision to Purchaser
of all material correspondence, pleadings, protests, briefs and other
documents pertaining to such audit or proceeding), and Purchaser also may
participate in any such audit or proceeding at its expense. Seller
Representative shall not settle any such audit or proceeding without the
advance written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. If Seller Representative does not assume the
defense of any such audit or proceeding, the provisions of _Section
10.3(e)(iii)_ shall apply with respect thereto.

 



 

(iii) With respect to any other audit or proceeding not controlled by Seller
Representative, such audit or proceeding shall be controlled by Purchaser. If,
however, Sellers could be subject to any liability under this Agreement in
connection with any such audit or proceeding, Purchaser shall keep the Seller
Representative informed of the progress of any such audit or proceeding
(including the prompt provision to Seller Representative of all material
correspondence, pleadings, protests, briefs and other documents pertaining to
such audit or proceeding), Seller Representative may also participate in any
such audit or proceeding at its expense and Purchaser shall not settle any
such audit or proceeding without the advance written consent of Seller
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.

 



 

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this _Section 10.3(e)_ ,
and not those of _Section 9.3_ , shall apply in the case of any adjustment,
claim, controversy or administrative or judicial proceeding relating to Taxes.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) _Tax Refunds._ To the extent not included as an asset in the computation
of Final Net Working Capital and not attributable to the application of any
loss, deduction or credit attributable to any Tax period or portion of a
Straddle Period (determined in accordance with _Section 10.3(a)_ ) commencing
after the Closing Date, any Tax refund or Tax credit (including any interest
paid or credited with respect thereto) arising with respect to a Tax period or
portion of a Straddle Period (determined in accordance with _Section 10.3(a)_
) ending on or before the Closing Date shall be the property of the Sellers,
and if actually received by the Purchaser or a Company Party shall be paid
over to Seller Representative, less any reasonable costs or expenses incurred
in connection with obtaining and receiving such refund or credit and any Taxes
imposed with respect to the receipt of such refund or credit. The Purchaser
shall, if the Seller Representative so requests and at the Seller
Representatives expense, reasonably cooperate with the Seller Representative
in filing any amended returns or taking such other steps as may be necessary
for obtaining any refund or claiming any tax credits to which the Sellers are
entitled under this _Section 10.3(f)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
_Section 10.3(f)_ will not apply to the extent the Tax refund, Tax credit or
similar benefit would result in a related Tax detriment for Tax periods or
portions of Tax periods beginning after the Closing Date or if Purchaser is
advised by Purchasers Tax advisor that the claim for such Tax refund or
credit is not more-likely-than-not correct. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, if such Tax refund or credit is subsequently
repaid to, or recovered by, the relevant Taxing Authority, Sellers shall
promptly repay such amount to Purchaser. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing
herein shall give Sellers or Seller Representative any right to any Tax refund
or Tax credit arising in any Tax period or portion of a Tax period subsequent
to the Closing Date even if such Tax refund or Tax credit is attributable to
net operating losses, credits or other Tax attributes of a Company Party
existing or arising on or before the Closing Date. The Purchaser acknowledges
that ITEQ Holding Company and its subsidiaries have previously filed refund
claims for federal income taxes in the amount of One Million One Hundred
Seventy-three Thousand Three Hundred Dollars ($1,173,300) for 2011 and Two
Hundred Sixty-three Thousand Six Hundred Sixty-three Dollars ($263,663) for
2012 and for Virginia income taxes in the amount of Seventy-five Thousand
Eight Hundred Ninety-three Dollars ($75,893) for 2012 and that, subject to the
limitations set forth in this _Section 10.3(f)_ , Sellers are entitled to such
refunds promptly following their receipt by Purchaser or any Company Party.

 



 

(g) _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing agreements or
similar arrangements with respect to or involving the Company Parties shall be
terminated on or prior to the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date,
Purchaser and the Company Parties shall not be bound thereby or have any
liability thereunder for amounts due in respect of periods ending on or before
the Closing Date.

 



 

10.4 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser, Company and Seller Representative (at no expense to Seller
Representative or Sellers) shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other parties, in connection with the filing of
all Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
parties request) the provision of records and information that are reasonably
relevant to any such audit, Tax Return or other action and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided

 



      
 

 



 

hereunder. Purchaser and Company agree to (i) retain all books and records
with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company Parties relating to any
taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
statute of limitations of the relevant taxable periods (and any extension
thereof), and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with
any Governmental Authority, and (ii) give Seller Representative written notice
prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records
and, if Seller Representative so requests, Company and Purchaser shall allow
Seller Representative to take possession of such books and records.

 



 

(b) Except in connection with an audit resolved pursuant to _Section 10.3_
(including consistent correlative adjustments to Tax Returns for non-audited
taxable periods), neither Purchaser, the Company Parties nor any Affiliate
thereof may amend or modify a Tax Return of the Company Parties or, except as
otherwise provided in _Section 10.3_ , file or amend or revoke any Tax
election, including any election under Section 338 of the Code or similar
provisions of state, local or foreign law, of the Company Parties, in each
case, for a taxable period beginning prior to the Closing Date, without the
consent of Seller Representative (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), unless otherwise required to so under applicable Law.

 



 

(c) Purchaser and Seller Representative further agree, upon request, to use
their reasonable efforts (without expense to Seller Representative or Sellers)
to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or
any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax
that could be imposed (including with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby).

 



 

(d) Purchaser covenants that it will not and will not cause or permit any
Company Party or any Affiliate of Purchaser to take any action on the Closing
Date other than an action in the ordinary course of business or expressly
contemplated by this Agreement, including the distribution of any dividend or
the effectuation of any redemption which would result in any Tax liability to
Sellers.

 



 

(e) _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, Purchaser, on the one hand, and Sellers, severally, on the other,
shall each be liable for one half (1/2) of all sales, use, value added,
transfer and other similar Taxes (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser shall file all
necessary documentation and Tax Returns with respect to all Transfer Taxes.

 



 

 **11.** ** ****SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE**. Each of Purchaser, Sellers, Seller
Representative and the Company acknowledge that the other parties may be
irreparably harmed and that there may be no adequate remedy at law for any
violation by any of them of any of the covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that, in addition to, but not in lieu
of, any other remedies that may be available upon the breach of any such
covenants or agreements (including monetary damages and remedies under
_Section 9.2_ ), each party shall have the right to injunctive relief to
restrain a breach or threatened breach of, or otherwise to specific
performance of, the other parties covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement. Each party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that
the party seeking such injunction, specific

 



      
 

 



 

performance or other equitable relief has an adequate remedy at law or that
any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason
at law or equity. In the event that any party seeks an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, such party shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such injunction
or other order, decree, ruling or judgment.

 

 ** **

 

 **12.** ** ****PUBLIC STATEMENTS**. Prior to the Closing Date, none of
Purchaser, Sellers, Seller Representative or the Company, without the prior
written approval of the other parties will make any press release or other
public announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except to the extent required by Law (including as required in
connection with any Required Statutory Approvals) or a securities exchange
rule or financial reporting purposes, in which case the other party, to the
extent practicable, will be so advised and will be given an opportunity to
comment on such release or announcement.

 



 

 **13.** ** ****EXPENSES**. Except as expressly set forth herein, each party
shall bear its own legal and other fees and expenses incurred in connection
with its negotiating, executing and performing this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents, including any related investment banking broker or
finders fees with which any of them have contracted.

 



 

 **14.** ** ****AMENDMENT; BENEFIT AND ASSIGNABILITY**. This Agreement may be
amended only by the execution and delivery of a written instrument by or on
behalf of (a) prior to the Closing, all of the parties hereto and (b) after
the Closing, Purchaser and the Seller Representative (subject to _Section
25(a)(vi)_ ) and, with respect to any amendment of this _Section 14_ or
_Section 25_ , the Sellers. This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, and no other person or entity will have any right (whether
third party beneficiary or otherwise) hereunder. This Agreement may not be
assigned by any party without the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto in their sole discretion; _provided_ , that Purchaser may, without the
consent of the other parties, assign this Agreement and any or all rights or
obligations hereunder to any of its Affiliates or to any Person from which
Purchaser or its Affiliates has borrowed money (although such assignment shall
not relieve Purchaser of any of its obligations under this Agreement).

the contrary: (a) the failure of any party at any time to require performance

right thereafter to enforce the same; (b) no waiver by any party of any

deemed a part of this Agreement) and the Transaction Documents constitute the
entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof

between the parties (written or oral) with respect to the subject matter
hereof.

 



 

 **18.** ** ****COUNTERPARTS; ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE**. This Agreement may be

contained in this Agreement should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable
in any respect, the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining

be brought in any state court located in Fairfax County, Virginia or in the
United States District Court, Eastern District of Virginia (or in any court in
which appeal from such courts may be taken) (the " _Relevant Courts_ "), and
each party agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, or otherwise,
in any such action, suit or proceeding, any Claim that it is not subject
personally to the jurisdiction of such court, that the action, suit or
proceeding is

 



      
 

 



 

brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the action, suit or
proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may
not be enforced in or by such court, and hereby agrees not to challenge such
jurisdiction or venue by reason of any offsets or counterclaims in any such
action, suit or proceeding.

 

 ** **

 

 **21.** ** ****WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY**. THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE THE RIGHT ANY PARTY MAY HAVE TO
A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION BASED HEREON, OR ARISING OUT OF,
UNDER, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY AGREEMENT CONTEMPLATED TO
BE EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF
DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY IN
CONNECTION WITH SUCH AGREEMENTS.

 



 

 **22.** ** ****REPRESENTATION BY COUNSEL**.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding the fact that Holland and Knight, LLP (the " _Law Firm_ ")
has represented the Company, in connection with this Agreement and the Company
Parties in connection with matters other than the transactions that are the
subject of this Agreement prior to the Closing, the Law Firm will be permitted
in the future, after the Closing, to represent one or more of the Sellers, or
their respective equity holders, officers, directors, managers or trustees in
connection with matters in which such parties or their respective equity
holders, officers, directors, managers or trustees are adverse to the
Purchaser, any Company Party and/or their respective Affiliates, including any
disputes that such parties or their respective equity holders, officers,
directors, managers or trustees may hereafter may have against the Purchaser,
the Company Parties or any of their respective Affiliates in each case which
arise out of or relate to this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Each party hereto agrees to waive, in advance, any actual or potential
conflict of interest that may hereafter arise in connection with the Law
Firms future representation of any Seller and/or its respective Affiliates or
their respective equity holders, officers, directors, managers or trustees on
matters in which the interests of such party or their respective equity
holders, officers, directors, managers or trustees are adverse to the
interests of the Purchaser and/or Company Parties to the extent such matters
arise out of this Agreement or that are substantially related to this
Agreement.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding any legal requirement to the contrary, (i) all
confidential communications between any of the Law Firm and any of the
Sellers, the Company Parties and/or their respective Affiliates or their
respective equity holders, officers, directors, managers or trustees that
occurred in the context of the Law Firms representation of any Company Party
prior to the Closing with respect to matters that are related to the
negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated
herein will remain privileged as between the Law Firm and the Company Party
after the Closing and (ii) any attorney-client, work product or other
applicable privilege relating to the negotiation, documentation and
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that otherwise
would be available to any of the Sellers, any Company Party and/or their
respective Affiliates or their respective equity holders, officers, directors,
managers or trustees (such work product in clauses (i) and (ii), the "
_Privileged Communications_ ") will remain privileged and the Company Party
and

 



      
 

 



 

the Purchaser agree that the privilege in respect of the Privileged
Communications shall remain with the Sellers and not any Company Party
following the Effective Time such that, without limiting the Sellers right to
such privilege, the Sellers alone shall have and maintain the right to waive
the privilege. Each of the Purchaser, Sellers and the Company agree that if
any Company Party and its Affiliates or their respective equity holders,
officers or managers leave any emails and other documents (both electronic or
otherwise) that exclusively contain Privileged Communications on the Company
Partys servers or with the Company Party, such occurrence shall not
constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege or any other privilege
applicable to such documents.

otherwise requires: (i) words of the masculine or neuter gender will include
the masculine, neuter and/or feminine gender, and words in the singular number

modified, supplemented, codified or reenacted, in whole or in part, and in
effect from time to time, including rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder and including by succession of comparable successor Laws; (vi)
except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to the words
"Section," "Schedule" and "Exhibit" are intended to refer to Sections,

 **24.** ** ****EXHIBITS, APPENDICES AND COMPANY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES**. The
Exhibits, Appendices and Disclosure Schedules referenced in this Agreement are
a material part of this Agreement. Each Disclosure Schedule will be deemed

subsection of the Disclosure Schedules to which it specifically refers and to
such other sections or subsections to which it is reasonably apparent on the
face of such disclosure that it applies. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the inclusion of an item in such Disclosure
Schedules as an exception to a representation or warranty

 



      
 

 



 

will not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception
or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

 ** **

 

 **25.** ** ****SELLER REPRESENTATIVE.**

 



 

(a) The Sellers hereby irrevocably constitute and appoint, the Seller
Representative, as the true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact of the
Sellers with full powers of substitution to act in the name, place and stead
of the Sellers with respect to the performance on behalf of the Sellers under
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, as the same may be from time to
time amended, and to do or refrain from doing all such further acts and
things, and to execute all such documents on behalf of the Sellers as the
Seller Representative deems necessary or appropriate in connection with any of
the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, including:

 



 

(i) following the Closing, to agree upon or compromise any matter related to
any payments due after Closing under this Agreement including with respect to
any calculations thereof;

 



 

(ii) to direct the distribution of all or any portions of the Purchase Price
hereunder;

 



 

(iii) to act for the Sellers with respect to all indemnification matters
referred to in this Agreement, including the right to negotiate and compromise
on behalf of the Sellers any indemnification claim made by or against the
Sellers;

 



 

(iv) to act for the Sellers with respect to all post-Closing matters pursuant
to _Sections 9_ and _10_ or otherwise, including to enforce payment and
distribution, if any, of the Indemnity Escrow Amount, the Working Capital
Escrow Amount or the BCA Earnout Escrow Amount and any other amounts payable
to the Sellers, in each case to the extent of each of the Sellers respective
interests therein, and to make any withholding of Taxes that the Seller
Representative deems necessary;

 



 

(v) to cause to be distributed out of the Indemnity Escrow Amount or
otherwise: (A) the amounts payable to the Sellers in accordance with this
Agreement and the Consideration Waterfall (including any post-Closing
adjustments pursuant to _Section 1.4_ ) and (B) the amount of any judgment for
Losses awarded in favor of a Purchaser Indemnified Party, or any amounts
payable to a Purchaser Indemnified Party in respect of any agreement,
compromise or settlement of any claim for Losses agreed to by the Seller
Representative in its sole discretion;

 



 

(vi) to terminate, amend, or waive any provision of this Agreement; _provided
that_ any such action (A), if material to the rights and obligations of the
Sellers in the reasonable judgment of the Seller Representative, will be taken
in the same manner with respect to all the Sellers unless otherwise agreed by
each of the Sellers who is subject to any disparate treatment of a potentially
adverse nature and (B) will not impose any additional obligations (or increase
any existing obligations) on any Seller without such Sellers consent;

 



      
 

 



 

(vii) to employ and obtain at the expense of the Sellers the advice of legal
counsel, accountants and other professional advisors as the Seller
Representative, in his sole discretion, deems necessary or advisable in the
performance of his duties as the Seller Representative and to rely on their
advice and counsel;

 



 

(viii) to retain, subject to _Section 25(d)_ , a portion of the Purchase Price
in the amount of Four Hundred Thousand Dollars ($400,000) as a reserve against
the payment of expenses incurred in his capacity as the Seller Representative
(" _Seller Representative Fund_ ");

 



 

(ix) to incur and pay out of the Seller Representative Fund expenses,
including fees of brokers, attorneys and accountants incurred by the Seller
Representative pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby including
_Section 25(a)(vii)_ , and any other fees and expenses allocable or in any way
relating to such transaction or any indemnification claim, whether incurred
prior or subsequent to Closing;

 



 

(x) to sign any releases or other documents with respect to and dispute or
remedy arising under the Transaction Documents; and

 



 

(xi) to do or refrain from doing any further act or deed on behalf of the
Sellers which the Seller Representative deems necessary or appropriate in his
sole discretion relating to the subject matter of this Agreement as fully and
completely as any of the Seller could do if personally present and acting.

 



 

(b) The appointment of the Seller Representative will be deemed coupled with
an interest and will be irrevocable, and any other Person may conclusively and
absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon any actions of the Seller
Representative as the acts of the Sellers hereunder appointing the Seller
Representative in all matters referred to in this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document to which it is a party. All that the Seller
Representative will do or cause to be done by virtue of such Seller
Representatives appointment as Seller Representative of the Sellers is hereby
ratified and confirmed by each of the Sellers. The Seller Representative will
act for the Sellers appointing the Seller Representative on all of the matters
set forth in this Agreement in the manner the Seller Representative believes
to be in the best interest of the Sellers but the Seller Representative will
not be responsible to any of the Sellers for any loss or damage any of the
Sellers may suffer by reason of the performance by the Seller Representative
of such Seller Representatives duties under this Agreement, other than loss
or damage arising from willful misconduct in the performance of such Seller
Representatives duties under this Agreement.

 



 

(c) The Seller Representative is authorized to act on behalf of the Sellers
notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement among the Sellers and that any
Person may rely on any and all action taken by the Seller Representative under
this Agreement without liability to, or obligation to inquire of, any of the
Sellers. If the Seller Representative resigns or ceases to function in such
capacity for any reason whatsoever, then the successor Seller Representative
shall be the Person appointed by the Sellers that held a majority of the
Acquired Units, immediately prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_
, that if for any reason no successor has been appointed within thirty (30)
days, then any Seller holding more than ten

 



      
 

 



 

percent (10%) of the Acquired Units, immediately prior to the Closing Date,
will have the right to petition a court of competent jurisdiction for
appointment of a successor Seller Representative. The Sellers hereby jointly
and severally indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Representative from and
against any and all liability, loss, cost, damage or expense (including
attorneys fees) reasonably incurred or suffered as a result of the
performance of such Seller Representatives duties under this Agreement except
for any such liability arising out of the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Seller Representative.

 **26.** ** ****GUARANTY.**

 



 

(a) To induce the Company, the Sellers and the Seller Representative to enter
into this Agreement, Guarantor, intending to be legally bound, hereby
absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to Company, the Sellers
and the Seller Representative (the " _Guaranteed Parties_ ") the due and
timely payment and discharge (and not merely collection) of all payment
obligations of Purchaser under this Agreement (the " _Obligations_ ") when due
and payable (the " _Guarantee_ ").

 



 

(b) Guarantor hereby waives any rights it may have to require the Guaranteed
Parties to proceed first against or claim payment from the Purchaser before
enforcing the Obligations directly against Guarantor, with the intent that
Guarantor shall be liable to the Guaranteed Parties as a principal debtor on
the Obligations as if it had entered into all undertakings, agreements and
other obligations jointly and severally with the Purchaser. Guarantor agrees
that its obligations hereunder shall not be released or discharged, in whole
or in part, or otherwise affected by (i) the failure or delay on the part of
the Guaranteed Parties to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right
or remedy against the Purchaser; (ii) any change in the time, place or manner
of payment of any of the Obligations or any rescission, waiver, compromise,
consolidation or other amendment to or modification of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement (other than any waiver, amendment or modification
to any Obligation) made in accordance with the terms hereof or any other
agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any of
the Obligations; or (iii) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other
similar proceeding affecting the Purchaser or any other person now or
hereafter liable with respect to any of the Obligations or otherwise
interested in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(c) To the fullest extent permitted by Law, Guarantor hereby waives
promptness, diligence, notice of the acceptance of this Guarantee and of the
Obligations, presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-performance,
default, dishonor and protest, notice of any Obligations incurred and all
other notices of any kind (other than notices expressly required to be
provided to the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement), all defenses that may
be

 



      
 

 



 

available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium, or other similar Law
now or hereafter in effect, any right to require the marshalling of assets of
the Purchaser or any other person now or hereafter liable with respect to any
of the Obligations or otherwise interested in the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and all suretyship defenses. Guarantor acknowledges that it
will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that the Guarantee, including specifically
the waivers set forth in this _Section 26_ , are knowingly made in
contemplation of such benefits.

 



 

 **27.** ** ****SEVERAL LIABILITY. **Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein contained, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that (a) each Seller shall
only be liable severally, and not jointly, hereunder, and (b) no Seller shall
have any liability hereunder for the breach following the Closing by any other
Seller of the covenants set forth in _Section 5.6_ and _Section 5.13_
hereunder.

" _Dispute Resolution Procedure_ " means the procedure pursuant to which the
items in dispute under _Section 1.4(b)(iv)_ are referred by either the

practicable to the Neutral Auditor or, if such firm is unable to serve as the
Neutral Auditor, another mutually acceptable independent accounting firm.
Purchaser and the Seller Representative will jointly engage the Neutral
Auditor pursuant to a reasonable engagement letter with respect to the
determination to be made by the Neutral Auditor. All fees and expenses
relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Neutral Auditor will be
borne by Purchaser and the Sellers (or the Seller Representative on

      
 

 



 

behalf of the Sellers), respectively, in the proportion that the aggregate
dollar amount of the disputed items submitted to the Neutral Auditor by such
party that are unsuccessfully disputed by such party (as finally determined by
the Neutral Auditor) bears to the aggregate dollar amount of disputed items
submitted by Purchaser and the Seller Representative. By way of example and
not by way of limitation, if the Seller Representative seeks a $70,000 upward
adjustment and the Neutral Auditor determines that there should be a $40,000
upward adjustment, then the Seller Representative (on behalf of the Sellers)
will be responsible for three-sevenths (3/7th) of the fees and expenses and
the Purchaser will be responsible for four-sevenths (4/7th) of the fees and
expenses. Any such fees and expenses of the Neutral Auditor payable by the
Seller Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) will be payable first from
the Seller Representative Fund and then by the Sellers directly. Except as
provided in the preceding sentence, all other costs and expenses incurred by
the parties in connection with resolving any dispute hereunder before the
Neutral Auditor will be borne by the party incurring such cost and expense.
The Neutral Auditor will determine only those issues still in dispute at the
end of the Resolution Period and the Neutral Auditors determination will be
based upon and consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The
determination by the Neutral Auditor will be based solely on presentations
made, with respect to such disputed items, by Purchaser and Seller
Representative to the Neutral Auditor and not on the Neutral Auditors
independent review. Purchaser and Seller Representative will use their
commercially reasonable efforts to make their respective presentations as
promptly as practicable following submission to the Neutral Auditor of the
disputed items, and each such party will be entitled, as part of its
presentation, to respond to the presentation of the other party and any
questions and requests of the Neutral Auditor. In deciding any matter, the
