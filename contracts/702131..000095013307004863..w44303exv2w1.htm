licenses and other authorizations that are required pursuant to Environmental Laws for the
occupation of its facilities and the operation of its business, except, in each case, where the
failure to do so would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Under applicable Environmental Laws, no permit, license or other authorization is subject
to review, major modification, revision, rescission, public notice and comment or prior consent by
any Governmental Entity as a result of the consummation of the Transactions. Neither the Company
nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has received any written notice, claim, governmental request
for information, complaint, administrative or judicial order, or report or other information, and
to the knowledge of the Company none is pending or threatened, regarding any actual or alleged
material violation of Environmental Laws or any material liabilities or potential material
liabilities (whether accrued, absolute, contingent, unliquidated or otherwise), including any
material investigatory, remedial or corrective obligations, relating to any of them or their
currently or formerly owned, operated or leased facilities arising under Environmental Laws and, to
Company&#146;s knowledge, there are no conditions or occurrences with respect to any such facilities
that would reasonably be expected to lead to any such demands, complaints, claims, information
requests, orders or notices. There are no past, pending or, to the Company&#146;s knowledge, threatened
Environmental Claims against the Company or, to the Company&#146;s knowledge, any properties of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary. No Company or any Company Subsidiary has caused the Release of
any Hazardous Materials at or from any facility currently or formerly owned, operated or leased by
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries that is reportable under any Environmental Laws and
that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any liability or remediation obligation under any
such Environmental Laws. To the Company&#146;s knowledge, there are no underground storage tanks,
polychlorinated biphenyls, or asbestos-containing material located at any of the facilities
currently or formerly owned, operated or leased by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.
To the Company&#146;s knowledge, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has, in the
course of its business, sent or disposed of, otherwise had taken or transported, arranged for the
taking or disposal of (on behalf of itself, a customer or any other
Person) or in any other manner participated or been involved in the taking of or disposal or
Release of a Hazardous Material to or at a site that pursuant to any Environmental Laws, (i)&nbsp;has

Environmental Laws, or to pay for the costs of any such action at the site. Except as set forth in
<U>Section&nbsp;3.20</U> of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has entered into any contracts or other binding agreements pursuant to which it has
assumed any material obligations or liabilities of any third party under or pursuant to any
Environmental Laws or has agreed to indemnify, defend or hold harmless any third party for any
material liabilities, costs or claims arising under or pursuant to any Environmental Laws. To the
Company&#146;s knowledge, no Lien or &#147;superlien&#148; has been placed on any property currently owned,
leased, operated or used by the Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to the Federal
Comprehensive, Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 or any similar law.
Notwithstanding any other provision of
 this Agreement, this Section&nbsp;3.20 sets forth the sole and
exclusive representations and warranties of the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to
Environmental Laws, Hazardous Materials, Environmental Claims or other environmental matters.
