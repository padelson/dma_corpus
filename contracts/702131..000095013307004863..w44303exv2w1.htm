ARTICLE I 

   

THE OFFER AND THE MERGER  

  

 Section 1.1. The Offer. 

  

 (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Section 8.1 and none of the events set forth in paragraph (2)(iii) of Annex I shall exist or have occurred and be continuing, as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, on or prior to December 21, 2007) after the date of this Agreement, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer to purchase for cash all outstanding Shares at the Offer Price.

The obligation of Purchaser to accept for payment and pay for Shares (without interest) tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Purchaser, of each of the Offer Conditions. 

   

 (c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") that contains, among other things, the terms set forth in this Agreement, the Minimum Condition and the other conditions and requirements set forth in Annex I. Purchaser expressly reserves the right to (x) increase the Offer Price and (y) waive any Offer Conditions and make any other changes to the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless otherwise provided by this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the Offer Price, (ii) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) decrease the number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) impose 

  ##### 

  

    

conditions or requirements to the Offer that are different than or in addition
to the Offer Conditions, or amend or modify any of the Offer Conditions, in
either case in a manner that adversely affects or reasonably would be
expected to adversely affect the holders of Shares, (v)  change or waive the
Minimum Condition, or (vi) extend or otherwise change the expiration date
of the Offer other than as required or permitted by this Agreement. 

   

 (d) Unless extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight (New York City time) on the date that is 20 business days following the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of the Offer (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ") or, in the event the Initial Expiration Date has been extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the date to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or such later date to which the Initial Expiration Date has been extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, is referred to as the " _Expiration Date_ "). 

   

 (e) The Offer shall or may be extended from time to time, as the case may be, as follows: 

    

 (i) If on or prior to any then scheduled Expiration Date, all of the Offer Conditions (including the Minimum Condition and all other Offer Conditions) shall not have been satisfied, or waived by Parent or Purchaser if permitted hereunder, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to), at the request of the Company, extend the Offer for one or more successive periods of not more than 10 business days each in order to permit the satisfaction of such conditions, each until the earlier of (x) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 and (y) (A) the date that is 180 days after commencement of the Offer (the " _Initial Outside Date_ ") or (B) the date that is 270 days after commencement of the Offer in the event that the HSR Condition and/or the Governmental Approval Condition shall not have been satisfied, or waived by Parent or Purchaser if permitted hereunder, by the Initial Outside Date (the " _Extended Outside Date_ "); 

   

 (ii) Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, extend the Offer for one or more successive periods of not more than 10 business days each, if at any otherwise scheduled Expiration Date any of the Offer Conditions shall not have been satisfied, or waived by Parent or Purchaser if permitted hereunder, until the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1; and 

   

 (iii) Purchaser shall extend the Offer for any period or periods required by applicable law, rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the Securities or Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or its staff or NASDAQ or its staff. 

  

 (f) Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, provide for a "subsequent offering period" in accordance with Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act. In the event that more than 80% of the then outstanding Shares have been validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer following the Expiration Date, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to), at the request of the Company, provide for a "subsequent offering period" in accordance with Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act of at least 10 business days 

  ##### 

  

    

immediately following the Expiration Date; _provided_ , that Purchaser shall
not be required to make available such a "subsequent offering period" in the
event that, prior to the commencement of such "subsequent offering period,"
Parent, Purchaser and their respective related organizations (as defined in
Section 302A.011, Subd. 25 of the MBCA), in the aggregate, own more than 90%
of the outstanding Shares. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Offer, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser
to) accept for payment, and pay for, all Shares that are validly tendered and
not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer during such "subsequent offering period"
promptly after any such Shares are tendered during such "subsequent
offering period." The Offer Documents will provide for the possibility of a
"subsequent offering period" in a manner consistent with the terms of this
Section 1.1(f). 

   

 (g) Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except in the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1. 

   

 (h) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of such termination) terminate the Offer and shall not acquire any Shares pursuant to the Offer. 

   

 (i) On the date of the commencement of the Offer (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act), Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) file with the SEC, pursuant to Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act (" _Regulation M-A_"), a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_"). The Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits, the Offer to Purchase and a form of letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (collectively, together with any amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). Parent and Purchaser agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of the Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to correct promptly any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable law. Parent and Purchaser further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected (if applicable), to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of the Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents before they are filed with the SEC, and Parent and Purchaser shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. In addition, Parent and Purchaser shall provide the Company and its counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. Parent and Purchaser shall give the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses and shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. Parent and Purchaser agree to use all reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents 

  ##### 

  

    

of the Company Recommendation, as such Company Recommendation may be amended
and until such Company Recommendation may be withdrawn, in each case as
permitted by this Agreement. If Purchaser terminates or withdraws the Offer,
or this Agreement is terminated prior to the purchase of Shares in the Offer,
Purchaser shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository acting on
behalf of Purchaser to return, all tendered Shares to the registered holders
thereof. 

   

 (j) Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) timely file with the Commissioner of Commerce of the State of Minnesota a registration statement relating to the Offer required to be filed pursuant to Chapter 80B of the Minnesota Statutes and shall disseminate the registration statement as required by Chapter 80B of the Minnesota Statutes. The Company and Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) promptly file with the Commissioner of Commerce of the State of Minnesota all materials referred to in Section 80B.04 of the Minnesota Statutes. 

   

 (k) The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Common Stock), cash dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination or other like change with respect to Common Stock occurring on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Acceptance Time, if any.

The Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to correct promptly any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable law. The Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected (if applicable), to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC, and the Company shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, Purchaser and their counsel. In addition, the Company shall provide Parent, Purchaser and their counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the Companys receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. The Company shall give Parent, Purchaser and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses, and the Company shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, Purchaser and their

counsel. The Company agrees to use all reasonable best efforts to respond

 Section 1.3. Board of Directors. 

  

 (a) Upon Purchaser accepting for payment and paying for any Shares tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the " _Acceptance Time_ "), and at all times thereafter, subject to compliance with the provisions of the Company Governing Documents, applicable law and the applicable Marketplace Rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (the " _NASDAQ_ "), Purchaser shall be entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board of Directors as is equal to the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Company Board of Directors (after giving effect to the directors appointed as a result of designations by Purchaser pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by (ii) the percentage that the aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent, Purchaser and any of their affiliates bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding (disregarding any unvested and unexercisable Company Options, Company Tandem Option-SARs, RSUs, and Warrants and all other unvested rights to acquire shares of the Common Stock). As used in this Agreement, the term " _beneficial ownership_ " (and its correlative terms) shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act. The Company shall, upon any exercise of such right by Purchaser, take all such actions as are necessary or desirable to (A) appoint to the Company Board of Directors the individuals designated by Purchaser and permitted to be so designated by the first sentence of this Section 1.3(a), including promptly filling vacancies or newly created directorships on the Company Board of Directors, promptly increasing the size of the Company Board of Directors (including by action of the Company Board of Directors and by the amendment of the Company Bylaws, if necessary, so as to increase the size of the Company Board of Directors) and/or promptly securing the resignations of such number of its incumbent directors as are necessary or desirable to enable Purchasers designees to be so appointed to the Company Board of Directors, and (B) cause Purchasers designees to be so appointed at such 

  ##### 

  

    

time. The Company shall, upon Purchasers request following the Acceptance
Time, also cause Persons designated by Purchaser to constitute the same
percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Company Board
of Directors of the members of (I) each committee of the Company Board of
Directors, (II) each board of directors (or similar body) of each Company
Subsidiary, and (III) each committee (or similar body) of each such board of
directors (or similar body), in each case to the full extent permitted by the
provisions of the Company Governing Documents, applicable law and the NASDAQ
Marketplace Rules. From and after the Acceptance Time and until the
Effective Time, (1) Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that the composition of the Company Board of Directors
and each committee thereof is consistent with the requirements of Article
VIII of the Company Charter and (2) the Company shall take all
action necessary to elect to be treated as a "controlled company" as defined
by NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4350(c)(5) and make all necessary filings and
disclosures associated with such status. The Company shall promptly upon
execution of this Agreement take all actions required pursuant to Section
14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder in order to
fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3(a), including mailing to
shareholders (together with the Schedule 14D-9) the information required by
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder
to enable Purchasers designees to be appointed to the Company Board of
Directors. Purchaser shall supply the Company with information with respect
to Purchasers designees and Parents and Purchasers respective officers,
directors and affiliates to the extent required by Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The provisions of this
Section 1.3(a) are in addition to and shall not limit any rights that any of
Purchaser, Parent or any of their respective affiliates may have as a holder
or beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of applicable law with respect to
the election or appointment of directors or otherwise. 

   

 (b) In the event that Purchasers designees are appointed to the Company Board of Directors pursuant to Section 1.3(a), then, subject to the Company Governing Documents, until the Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Company Board of Directors to maintain at least such number of "independent directors," as defined by the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, as may be required by the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules or the federal securities laws, at least one of whom shall be an "audit committee financial expert," as defined in Item 401(h) of Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto (any such "independent directors" as of the date of this Agreement (and their successors as provided below), the " _Continuing Directors_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that if any Continuing Director is unable to serve due to death, disability or resignation, the Company, Purchaser and Parent shall take all necessary action (including creating a committee of the Company Board of Directors) so that the entire Company Board of Directors shall be entitled to appoint another Person or Persons to fill such vacancy or vacancies, and such Person or Persons thereafter shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for purposes of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that if a majority of the Continuing Directors then in office did not approve such Person or Persons, then such Person or Persons shall not be deemed to be a Continuing Director. If no Continuing Director then remains, the other directors shall appoint Persons to fill such vacancies and such Persons shall be deemed Continuing Directors for all purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Purchasers designees constitute a majority of the Company Board of Directors after the Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective Time, then the affirmative vote of a majority of the Continuing Directors and a majority of the directors who satisfy the requirements of the second sentence of Article VIII of the Company Charter shall (in addition to the approval rights 

  ##### 

   

    

of the Company Board of Directors or the shareholders of the Company as may be
required by the Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of the
Company, as amended (the " _Company Charter_ "), the Restated Bylaws of the
Company, as amended (the " _Company Bylaws_ ", and together with the Company
Charter, the " _Company Governing Documents_ ") or applicable law) be
required (i) for the Company to amend or terminate this Agreement, (ii)
to exercise or waive any of the Companys rights, benefits or remedies
hereunder or to take any action hereunder, or (iii) to amend the Company
Governing Documents, in each case if such action adversely affects, or
reasonably would be expected to adversely affect, the holders of Shares (other
than Parent or Purchaser); _provided_ , that Purchaser and Parent shall take
all actions as may be necessary to give effect to the foregoing. At all times
subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, the
Continuing Directors (including those directors deemed to be Continuing
Directors by virtue of this Section 1.3) shall, without any further action by
the Company or the Company Board of Directors, constitute a committee of the
Board of Directors (which committee of the Board of Directors has been
established as of the date of this Agreement by action of the Board of
Directors) and all actions contemplated by this Agreement to be taken by
the Continuing Directors or a designated percentage of the Continuing
Directors shall be taken, and shall be deemed to have been taken, by such
Continuing Directors acting as a committee of the Company Board of
Directors. 

   

 Section 1.4. The Top-Up Option. 

  

 (a) The Company hereby grants to Purchaser an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable only on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, to purchase that number of Shares (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of Shares that, when added to the number of Shares owned by Parent, Purchaser and their related organizations (as defined in Section 302A.011, Subd. 25 of the MBCA) at the time of such exercise, shall constitute one Share more than the number of Shares necessary for Purchaser to be merged with and into the Company pursuant to Section 302A.621 of the MBCA (a " _Short Form Merger_ "), at a price per Share equal to the Offer Price. 

   

 (b) The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable, in whole, but not in part, at any one time during the 10 business day period commencing on the business day after the later of the Acceptance Time or the expiration of the last "subsequent offering period" contemplated by Section 1.1(f);  _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable if (i) the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares would require shareholder approval under the rules of NASDAQ, (ii) the number of Top-Up Option Shares would exceed the number of authorized but unissued Shares or (iii) after issuance of Shares pursuant to the Top-Up Option, it will be insufficient to allow Purchaser to effect the Short Form Merger; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Top-Up Option shall terminate concurrently with the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1. 

   

 (c) In the event Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Purchaser shall so notify the Company in writing, and shall set forth in such notice (i) the number of Shares owned by Parent, Purchaser and their respective related organizations (as defined in Section 302A.011, Subd. 25 of the MBCA) immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares and (ii) the place and time, which shall be within five business days of the exercise of the Top-Up Option, for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares (the " _Top-Up_  

  ##### 

  

    

 _Closing_ "). The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of
such notice, notify Parent and Purchaser in writing of the number of Shares
then outstanding and the number of Top-Up Option Shares. At the Top-Up
Closing, Purchaser shall pay the Company the aggregate price required to be
paid for the Top-Up Option Shares by delivery of, at Purchasers option, (A)
immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account designated by the
Company, (B) a promissory note (the " _Note_ "), bearing interest at the 6
Month USD LIBOR Rate, and due six months after the Top-Up Closing, or (C) any
combination thereof, and the Company shall cause to be issued to Purchaser a
certificate representing the Top-Up Option Shares. 

   

 (d) Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that the Shares which Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the U.S. securities laws and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and Purchaser represent and warrant to the Company that Purchaser is, or will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited investor," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Purchaser agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Options Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Purchaser for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act).

The Merger shall become effective at the time the Articles of Merger are filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota or at such later date and time as is agreed upon by the parties hereto and specified in the Articles of Merger. The date and time at which the Merger shall become effective is referred to as the " _Effective Time_."

The Company shall cause all directors of the Company, other than those directors, if any, as shall be designated by Parent or Purchaser in writing prior to the Effective Time, to resign immediately before the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 1.9. Subsequent Actions. If at any time after the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall determine, in its sole discretion, that any deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments, assurances or other actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Purchaser acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger, or otherwise to carry out this Agreement and the Transactions, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Purchaser, all such deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of each such corporation or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise any and all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation, or otherwise to carry out this Agreement and the Transactions.

counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Proxy Statement promptly after the Companys receipt of such comments,
and any written or oral responses thereto. Parent, Purchaser and their

ARTICLE II 

   

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES  

  

 Section 2.1. Conversion of Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any securities of the Company or common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Common Stock_ "), the manner and basis of converting the Shares and the Purchaser Common Stock shall be as follows: 

  

 (a) Each share of Purchaser Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, which, together with the Shares owned by any Subsidiary of Parent (other than Purchaser), Purchaser or the Company as contemplated by Section 2.1(b), will constitute the only issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) All Shares that are owned by Parent and Purchaser (not held on behalf of third parties) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor, and all Shares owned by any Subsidiary of Parent (other than Purchaser), Purchaser or the Company shall remain outstanding and unaffected by the Merger. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) Each Share (other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and other than Dissenting Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, payable to the holder thereof in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). From and after the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate formerly representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.2, without interest thereon. 

   

 (d) The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately in the event the Company changes the number of Shares, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into the Common Stock), cash dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination or other like change with respect to the Common Stock occurring on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 Section 2.2. Exchange of Certificates. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company that is reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). At the Effective Time, Parent or Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid pursuant to this Agreement plus cash in an amount sufficient to pay holders of Company Options, Company Tandem Option-SARs, RSUs and Warrants in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (such cash being referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ , that such investment shall be in (i) direct obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America, (ii) obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for payment of all principal and interest, or (iii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of acquisition, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares, Company Options, Company Tandem Option-SARs, RSUs and Warrants; _provided_ , that no gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to the holders of Shares, Company Options, Company Tandem Option-SARs, RSUs or Warrants following the Effective Time and Parent shall promptly deposit additional cash into the Payment Fund in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to satisfy fully all such cash payment obligations. Earnings (including interest and other income) resulting from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Shares, Company Options, Company Tandem Option-SARs, RSUs or Warrants. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) The Paying Agent shall, within five business days following the Effective Time, mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") and whose Shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.1(c) into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such customary form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent in accordance with the terms of the letter of transmittal, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Such payment shall be made to the holder of record within five business days of receipt of a duly executed letter of transmittal by the Paying Agent and shall be made by either bank check or electronic wire transfer, at the option of the holder of record. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent to payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise shall be in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not required to be paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Section 2.2, without interest thereon. 

   

 (c) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by applicable law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 

   

 (d) At any time following six months after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall deliver to Parent any portion of the Payment Fund (including any proceeds of any investment thereof) made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed (or for which disbursement is pending) to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) and only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any holder of a 

  ##### 

  

    

Certificate for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall each be entitled to deduct and withhold from the relevant Merger Consideration, Offer Price or any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts that Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of applicable state, local or foreign law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

   

 (f) In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall make payment in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.1; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a written indemnity agreement reasonably satisfactory to Parent and, if reasonably deemed advisable by Parent, a bond in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

   

 Section 2.3. Dissenting Shares. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held of record or beneficially by a Person who has not voted in favor of approval and adoption of this Agreement and who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA (the " _Appraisal Rights_ "), shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration for such Dissenting Shares but instead shall be entitled to payment of the fair value (including interest determined in accordance with Section 302A.473 of the MBCA) of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the Appraisal Rights; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to dissent under the Appraisal Rights, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon. 

   

 (b)The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent and its counsel of any demands, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable law that are received by the Company for Appraisal Rights with respect to any Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in, and direct ( _provided_ , that such direction may not

no more information than would be required for a "stop-look-and-listen
communication" under Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act if such
provision was applicable, or (iii) other than in connection with or relating
to an Acquisition Proposal, otherwise disclosing any information to its
shareholders that the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith
(after consultation with the Companys legal counsel) that it is required to
disclose in order to act in a manner that is likely to be required to comply

announced to the public, such communication, statement or other disclosure
shall be deemed to be a Company Change in Recommendation and Parent shall
have the right to terminate this Agreement as set forth in Section 8.1. For
the avoidance of doubt, if a communication or statement covered by clause (i)
or (ii) above contains no more information than the information that is
required by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or would be
required if such provision was applicable, it shall not be deemed to be a
Company Change in Recommendation as long as prior to the close of business
on the tenth business day after such communication or statement the Company

adverse modification or amendment. 

   

 Section 5.4. Board Recommendation. 

  

 (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 5.4(c), the Company Board of Directors shall (i) recommend that the holders of Shares accept the Offer, tender their Shares to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer and, if approval and adoption of this Agreement is required under the MBCA, approve and adopt this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of the MBCA (the " _Company Recommendation_ "), and (ii) include the Company Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 and permit Parent and Purchaser to include the Company Recommendation in the Offer Documents. 

   

 (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 5.4(c), neither the Company Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw, qualify, modify or amend (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify, modify or amend) in any manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser (including by virtue of disclosure in the Schedule 14D-9 or any amendment thereto) the Company Recommendation, the approval by the Company Board of Directors of this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, or the approval by the Compensation Committee of the Company Compensation Arrangements as Employment Compensation Arrangements for purposes of satisfying the requirements of the

non-exclusive safe-harbor in accordance to Rule 14d-10(d)(2) promulgated
under the Exchange Act (a " _Company Change in Recommendation_ "). 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company Board of Directors may effect a Company Change in Recommendation at any time prior to, but not after, the Acceptance Time: 

    

 (i) If (A) the Company Board of Directors has received an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (that has not been withdrawn) that the Company Board of Directors (1) determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and such Superior Proposal shall not have arisen in connection with a breach by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective Representatives of the terms of Section 5.3(a), and (2) determines that such action is likely to be required in order for the directors to comply with their fiduciary duties under applicable law, and (B) the Company shall have provided to Parent a written notice (a " _Notice of Recommendation Change_ ") of its intention to make such Company Change in Recommendation (which notice shall not be deemed to be, in and of itself, a Company Change in Recommendation), specifying all information required under Section 5.3(c); _provided_ , _however_ , that no Company Change in Recommendation may be made until (x) after at least three business days following Parents receipt of the Notice of Recommendation Change and (y) after the Company has (and has caused its Representatives to have) negotiated in good faith with Parent and Purchaser to enable Parent and Purchaser to make a binding written offer that is at least as favorable to the Companys shareholders as the "Superior Proposal" such that the Acquisition Proposal of the other party no longer is a "Superior Proposal." In determining whether to make a Company Change in Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal or otherwise, the Company Board of Directors shall take into account, in addition to any other relevant information available to the Company Board of Directors, any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in any binding written offer and any other information provided by Parent in response to such notice. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 5.4, including with respect to the notice period referred to in this Section 5.4(c), _provided_ , that such notice period for such amendment shall be two business days from the time such amendment is provided to Parent. 

   

 (ii) Under the circumstances contemplated by clause (iii) of Section 5.3(d). 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company shall not be entitled to enter into any agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement as contemplated by Section 5.3(b) and other than an agreement with any of the Companys Representatives in their capacity as such) with respect to a Superior Proposal unless this Agreement has been or concurrently is being terminated pursuant to Section 8.1 and the Company shall have confirmed in writing its obligation to make the payment contemplated by Section 8.2(b) within the time period contemplated thereby.

to applicable law relating to exchange of information, each of the Company
and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective affiliates to, furnish to
the other party hereto all information necessary for any such application or

Prior to the consummation of the Offer, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, control and supervision over its own business operations. 

   

 (f) Nothing in this Agreement, including this Section 6.3, shall require, or be construed to require, Parent (i) to proffer to, or agree to, sell, divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise hold separate before or after the Effective Time, any assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest therein of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that are material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole (" _Company Material Businesses_ "), (ii) to consent to the sale, divestiture, lease, license, transfer or disposition by the Company or any Company Subsidiary of any Company Material Businesses or to consent to any agreement by Parent or the Company to take any of the foregoing actions, (iii) to proffer to, or agree to, sell, divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise hold separate before or after the Effective Time, any assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest therein of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary that are material to Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries taken as a whole (" _Parent Material Businesses_ "), (iv) to consent to the sale, divestiture, lease, license, transfer or disposition by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary of any Parent Material Businesses or to consent to any agreement by Parent to take any of the foregoing actions, or (v) or to agree to any material changes (including through a licensing arrangement) or material restrictions on, or other impairment of Parents ability to own or operate, any of the Company Material Businesses or Parent Material Businesses, or Parents ability to vote, transfer, receive dividends or otherwise exercise full ownership rights with respect to the capital stock of the Surviving Company.

 Section 6.5. Directors and Officers Insurance and Indemnification. 

  

 (a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor and fulfill in all respects, and the Surviving Corporation shall honor and fulfill in all respects, the indemnification obligations of the Company to the current and former directors, officers and employees of the Company determined as of the Effective Time (the " _Covered Persons_ ") to the fullest extent permissible under applicable provisions of the MBCA (i) under the Company Charter and Company Bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement and (ii) under the provisions of the MBCA, arising out of or relating to actions or omissions in their capacity as directors, officers or employees of the Company occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the Transactions;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until disposition of any and all such claims; and _provided_ , _further_ , that any determination required to be made with respect to whether an officers or directors conduct complies with the standards set forth under Minnesota law and the Company Governing Documents shall be made by special legal counsel (as defined in the MBCA) selected by the Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section 302A.521 of the MBCA. 

   

 (b) The Surviving Corporation shall advance expenses (including reasonable legal fees) incurred in the defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in respect of any matters subject to indemnification pursuant to Section 6.5(a) to the extent permitted by the applicable provisions of the MBCA; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Person to whom expenses are advanced undertakes to repay such advanced expenses if it ultimately is determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification. 

   ##### 

  

    

 (c) Any Covered Persons wishing to claim indemnification under Section 6.5(a), upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to such Covered Persons except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the indemnifying party, to the extent permitted under the MBCA. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), except to the extent otherwise provided by applicable law, (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and Parent and, the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such Covered Persons for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Covered Persons in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Parent or the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Covered Persons advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between Parent or the Surviving Corporation and the Covered Persons, the Covered Persons may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Covered Persons promptly as statements therefor are received; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this Section 6.5(c) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Covered Persons in any jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel for such Covered Persons would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; _provided_ , that the fewest number of counsels necessary to avoid conflicts of interest shall be used; (ii) the Covered Person will cooperate in the defense of any such matter, and (iii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without their prior written consent; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Covered Person if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final and nonappealable, that the indemnification of such Covered Person in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by law. 

   

 (d) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liability or limitation of liability of Covered Persons for periods prior to and including the Effective Time than are set forth, as of the date of this Agreement, in the Company Charter and Company Bylaws, as the case may be. 

   

 (e) The Company shall and, if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to, obtain and pay for "tail" insurance policies prior to the Effective Time, which policies shall provide the Covered Persons with directors and officers liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") coverage of equivalent amount and on no less favorable terms to the Covered Persons than that provided by the Companys current DandO Insurance for an aggregate period of at least six years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor their obligations thereunder. If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain and extend the existing DandO Insurance of the Company as of the date of this Agreement for a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time in respect 

    ##### 

  

    

of claims arising in whole or in part from facts or events that actually or
allegedly occurred on or before the Effective Time, including in connection
with the approval of this Agreement and the Transactions; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that Parent may substitute therefor policies of substantially
equivalent coverage and amounts containing terms no less favorable to the
Covered Persons than the existing DandO Insurance; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that if the existing DandO Insurance expires or is terminated or cancelled
during such period through no fault of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain substantially equivalent
DandO Insurance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in
no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to pay
aggregate annual premiums for DandO Insurance under this Section 6.5(e) in
excess of 200% of the aggregate annual premiums paid by the Company in
2006 for such purpose (the " _Base Premium_ "), and if Parent or the
Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the amount of insurance required by
this Section 6.5(e) for such aggregate annual premium, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall obtain as much DandO Insurance as can be
obtained for aggregate annual premiums not in excess of 200% of the Base
Premium. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such policies in
full force and effect, and continue to honor their obligations thereunder. 

   

 (f) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation, or any successor or assign of Parent or Surviving Corporation, (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity arising out of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its assets to any other Person, then and in each such case proper provision shall be made so that the continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, set forth in this Section 6.5. 

   

 (g) The Covered Persons (and their successors and heirs) are intended third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.5, and, from and after the Acceptance Time, this Section 6.5 shall not be amended in a manner that is adverse to the Covered Persons (including their successors and heirs) or terminated without the consent of the Covered Persons (including their successors and heirs). 

   

 Section 6.6. Section 16\. The Company Board of Directors shall, to the extent necessary, take appropriate action, prior to or as of the Effective Time, to exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, for purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the deemed disposition and cancellation of the Shares, the Company Options, the Company Tandem Options-SARs and RSUs in the Merger by applicable individuals. 

  

 Section 6.7. Obligations of Purchaser. Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 Section 6.8. Employee Benefits Matters. 

  

 (a) For a period of at least 12 months following the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) arrange for each employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary who becomes 

   ##### 

  

   

an employee of Eisai US (or an employee of any Parent Subsidiary or affiliate
(including by remaining an employee of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary)), within a reasonable period of time after the Effective Time, to
be eligible for a base salary and other compensation at a rate no less
favorable in the aggregate than such employee was receiving immediately prior
to the Acceptance Time, and (ii) arrange for the participants in the Benefit
Plans (the " _Benefit Plan_   _Participants_ ") who become employees of Eisai
US (or employees of any Parent Subsidiary or affiliate (including by
remaining employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary)), within
a reasonable period of time after the Effective Time (including all
dependents), subject to the limitations and restrictions of the Benefit
Plans, to be eligible for benefits comparable in the aggregate to those
available to such employees (or dependents) immediately prior to the
Acceptance Time and to be treated in a manner so as to avoid any
discontinuation of coverage;  _provided_ , that nothing in this Section
6.8(a) shall require Parent or Eisai US to offer any particular Benefit Plan
Participant any particular benefit. Each Benefit Plan Participant shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable law, applicable Tax requirements and the
terms of any applicable employee benefit plans, and subject to any applicable
break in service or similar rule, receive credit for purposes of eligibility
to participate, matching contributions, benefit accrual and vesting under
Eisai US employee benefit plans for years of service with the Company prior
to the Effective Time, except for benefits accrued under defined benefit
pension plans, for purposes of qualified early retirement benefit, or to the
extent it would otherwise result in a duplication of benefits. If applicable
and permitted by the relevant Benefit Plan, Parent shall cause any and all
pre-existing condition limitations (or actively-at-work or similar
limitations), eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any Eisai US employee benefit plans to be waived with
respect to such Benefit Plan Participants and their eligible dependents and
shall provide them with credit for any co-payments, deductibles or offsets
(or similar payments) made during the plan year that includes the Effective
Time for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket, or
similar requirements under any Eisai US employee benefit plans in which they
are eligible to participate after the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall (1) be treated as an
amendment of any particular Benefit Plan, (2) give any third party any right
to enforce the provisions of this Section 6.8 or (3) obligate Parent, Eisai
US, the Surviving Corporation or any of their affiliates to (A) maintain
any particular Benefit Plan or (B) retain the employment of any particular
employee. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent shall also cause the Surviving Corporation to perform the Companys obligations under the change in control and other agreements between the Company and certain of its officers and employees unless any such officer or employee agrees otherwise in writing. 

   

 (c) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall amend any standard or general severance policy, plan, program or other arrangement of the Company to clarify that such policy, plan program or other arrangement shall not apply, and no severance payments or benefits pursuant to such policy, plan, program or other arrangement will be payable to any employee of the Company subject to any agreements that provide payments or benefits upon termination following a change in control of the Company. 

   

 Section 6.9. Termination of 401(k) Plan. If Parent requests, by written notice to the Company no later than seven days prior to the Effective Time, that the Company terminate any

the Code (each such Benefit Plan, a " _401(k) Plan_ "), the Company Board of
Directors shall adopt resolutions terminating, effective at the Effective
Time, any such 401(k) Plan. At the Closing, the Company shall provide Parent
with executed resolutions of the Company Board of Directors authorizing
such termination. 

   

 Section 6.10. Rule 14d-10(d). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company (acting through the Compensation Committee) shall use reasonable best efforts to take all such steps as may be required to cause each agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries with any of its officers, directors or employees pursuant to which consideration is paid to such officer, director or employee to be approved as an Employment Compensation Arrangement and to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe-harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

  

 Section 6.11. Stock Exchange De-listing and De-registration. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable laws and rules and policies of the NASDAQ to enable the de-listing by the Surviving Corporation of the Shares from the NASDAQ and the deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 6.12. Other Actions by the Company. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board of Directors shall take all necessary action to cause the Rights to cease to be exercisable, effective immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, without payment of any consideration in respect thereof.

delivered under the circumstances upon the reasonable request of Parent, (iv)

the Company customarily prepares such statements in the ordinary course of

require such cooperation to the extent it would unreasonably interfere with
the business or operations of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or
require the Company to agree to pay any fees, reimburse any expenses or give
any indemnities prior to the Effective Time for which it is not reimbursed or
indemnified under this Agreement or to the extent any third parties who are
provided information about the Company in connection with the Financing
Commitment are unwilling to provide a customary confidentiality agreement for
the benefit of the Company or any other Person. Parent shall, promptly upon
request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation at the request of Parent and
indemnify the Company for any loss incurred by the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries arising therefrom (other than arising from information

Company shall not be required to provide any information or take any actions
under this Section 6.13 if the Company in good faith determines that
providing such information or taking such actions is reasonably likely to
adversely affect the Companys or any other Persons attorney client
privilege.

 (i) all Shares then outstanding, _plus_  

   

 (ii) all Shares issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any Company Options, Company Tandem Option-SARs, RSUs, Warrants, or other rights to acquire Shares then outstanding that are vested and exercisable, convertible and exchangeable as of any then scheduled Expiration Date or that would be vested and exercisable, convertible or exchangeable (including after giving effect to the acceleration of any vesting or exercisability, convertibility or exchangeability that may occur as a result of the Offer) at any time following the then scheduled Expiration Date assuming that the holder of such Company Options, Company Tandem Option-SARs, RSUs, Warrants or other rights satisfies the vesting or exercisability, convertibility or exchangeability conditions applicable thereto during such time period (collectively, the " _Minimum Condition_ "). 

  

 (2) Furthermore, Purchaser shall not be obligated to accept for payment, and, subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC (including Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act), shall not be obligated to pay for, or may delay the acceptance for payment of or payment for, any validly tendered Shares pursuant to the Offer (and not theretofore accepted for payment or paid for), if: 

    

 (i) any waiting period under the HSR Act applicable to the Transactions has not expired or terminated prior to the termination or expiration of the Offer at or prior to any then scheduled Expiration Date (the " _HSR Condition_ "); 

   

 (ii) any other Required Approvals shall not have been obtained or any waiting period (or extension thereof) shall not have lapsed, expired or terminated, either unconditionally or on terms satisfactory to Parent, in each case, at or prior to any then scheduled Expiration Date (collectively, the " _Governmental Approval Condition_ "); or 

   

 (iii) upon the expiration of the Offer and before acceptance of any such Shares for payment, any of the following events or conditions has occurred or exists and is continuing at the scheduled Expiration Date, regardless of the circumstances giving rise to such events or conditions: 

   ##### 

  

   

 (a) there shall be any statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order or injunction enacted, entered, enforced, promulgated or deemed applicable pursuant to an authoritative interpretation by or on behalf of a Governmental Entity to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions, or any injunction shall have been issued and be in effect, by any United States federal or state court that prohibits, restrains or enjoins the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or that otherwise has the effect of making the acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer or the consummation of the Merger illegal; 

   

 (b) any of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in the Merger Agreement that (i) are not made as of a specific date are not true and correct as of the date of the Merger Agreement and as of the Acceptance Time, as though made on and as of the Acceptance Time, and (ii) are made as of a specific date are not true and correct as of such date, in each case, except where (A) the failure of such representations and warranties (other than the representations or warranties in Sections 3.2 (Capitalization), 3.3 (Authorization; Validity or Agreement; Company Action); 3.4 (Board Approvals) and 3.22 (Actions Under Rights Plan; Takeover Statutes)) to be true and correct (disregarding, for this purpose, any limitation as to "materiality", "Company Material Adverse Effect" set forth in such representations or warranties) to be true and correct has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect and (B) the failure of the representations or warranties in Sections 3.2 (Capitalization), 3.3 (Authorization; Validity or Agreement; Company Action); 3.4 (Board Approvals) and 3.22 (Actions Under Rights Plan; Takeover Statutes) to be true and correct is not, individually or in the aggregate, a failure to be true and correct in any material respect ; 

   

 (c) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform or to comply with, in any material respect, any obligation, agreement or covenant to be performed or complied with by it under the Merger Agreement prior to the expiration of the Offer (or, in the case of Section 6.1, shall have knowingly and intentionally breached or failed in any material respect to perform or comply with such Section 6.1) and such breach or failure, if curable, shall not have been cured prior to the expiration of the Offer; 

   

 (d) the Company shall have failed to deliver to Parent a certificate, dated as of the Expiration Date, signed by the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of the Company and certifying as to the satisfaction by the Company of the conditions specified in clause (2)(iii)(b) of this Annex I and clause (2)(iii)(c) of this Annex I; 

   

 (e) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms; 

   

 (f) there shall have occurred and be continuing (i) any general suspension of, or limitation on trading in securities on NASDAQ (other than a

as a result of a specified increase or decrease in a market index), (ii) a
declaration of a banking moratorium or any suspension of payments in respect
of banks in the United States generally or in the State of New York, or (iii)

on the extension of credit by banks or other lending institutions; or 

   

 (g) there shall have occurred any Company Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 As used in this Annex I and the Merger Agreement, the term " _Required Approvals_ " shall mean any approval, consent or expiration or termination of a waiting period required by applicable law in a Significant Jurisdiction, the failure of which to obtain (x) would reasonably be expected to result in material limitation on the ownership or operation by Parent or its affiliates of the properties, assets or business of Parent, its affiliates or the Surviving Corporation or (y) would subject Parent or its affiliates to the payment of a material fine or penalty. The other capitalized terms used and not defined in this Annex I shall have the meanings set forth in the agreement to which this Annex I is attached, except that the term " _Merger Agreement_ " shall be deemed to refer to the agreement to which this Annex I is attached.

 _SHAREHOLDERS_  

   

 _Section 1.01 Place of Meetings_. Each meeting of the shareholders shall be held at the principal executive office of the Corporation or at such other place as may be designated by the Board of Directors. Any meeting called by or at the demand of a shareholder or shareholders shall be held in the county where the principal executive office of the Corporation is located. The Board of Directors may determine that a meeting of the shareholders shall not be held at a physical place, but instead solely by means of remote communication. Participation by remote communication constitutes presence at the meeting. 

  

 _Section 1.02 Regular Meetings_. Regular meetings of the shareholders may be held on an annual or other less frequent basis as determined by the Board of Directors; provided, however, that if a regular meeting has not been held during the immediately preceding 15 months, a shareholder or shareholders holding three percent or more of the voting power of all shares entitled to vote may demand a regular meeting of shareholders by written demand given to the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer of the Corporation. At each regular meeting the shareholders shall elect qualified successors for directors who serve for an indefinite term or whose terms have expired or are due to expire within six months after the date of the meeting and may transact any other business. 

  

 _Section 1.03 Special Meetings_. A special meeting of the shareholders may be called for any purpose or purposes at any time by the Chief Executive Officer, by the Chief Financial Officer, by the Board of Directors or any two or more members thereof, or by one or more shareholders holding not less than ten percent of the voting power of all shares of the Corporation entitled to vote (except that a special meeting for the purpose of considering any action to directly or indirectly effect a business combination, including any action to change or otherwise affect the composition of the Board of Directors for that purpose, must be called by shareholders holding not less than twenty-five percent of all shares of the Corporation entitled to vote), who shall demand such special meeting by written notice given to the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer of the Corporation specifying the purposes of such meeting. 

  

 _Section 1.04 Meetings Held Upon Shareholder Demand_. Within 30 days after receipt of a demand by the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer from any shareholder or shareholders entitled to call a meeting of the shareholders, it shall be the duty of the Board of Directors of the Corporation to cause a special or regular meeting of shareholders, as the case may be, to be duly called and held on notice no later than 90 days after receipt of such demand. If the Board of Directors fails to cause such a meeting to be called and held as required by this Section 1.04, the shareholder or shareholders making the demand may call the meeting by giving notice as provided in Section 1.06 hereof at the expense of the Corporation. 

   ##### 

  

  

 _Section 1.05 Adjournments_. Any meeting of the shareholders may be adjourned from time to time to another date, time and place. If any meeting of the shareholders is so adjourned, no notice as to such adjourned meeting need be given if the date, time and place at which the meeting will be reconvened are announced at the time of adjournment and the adjourned meeting is held not more than 120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting. 

  

 _Section 1.06 Notice of Meetings_. Unless otherwise required by law, written notice of each meeting of the shareholders, stating the date, time, and place and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes, shall be given at least 10 days and not more than 60 days before the meeting to every holder of shares entitled to vote at such meeting except as specified in Section 1.05 or as otherwise permitted by law. Notice may be given to a shareholder by means of electronic communication if the requirements of Minnesota Statutes Section 302A.436, Subdivision 5, as amended from time to time, are met. The business transacted at a special meeting of shareholders is limited to the purposes stated in the notice of the meeting. 

  

 _Section 1.07 Waiver of Notice_. A shareholder may waive notice of the date, time, place, or purpose of a meeting of shareholders. A waiver of notice by a shareholder entitled to notice is effective whether given before, at, or after the meeting, and whether given in writing, orally, by authenticated electronic communication, or by attendance. Attendance by a shareholder at a meeting, including attendance by means of remote communication, is a waiver of notice of that meeting, unless the shareholder objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened, or objects before a vote on an item of business because the item may not lawfully be considered at that meeting and does not participate in the consideration of the item at that meeting. 

  

 _Section 1.08 Voting Rights_. Subdivision 1. A shareholder shall have one vote for each share held which is entitled to vote. Except as otherwise required by law, a holder of shares entitled to vote may vote any portion of the shares in any way the shareholder chooses. If a shareholder votes without designating the proportion or number of shares voted in a particular way, the shareholder is deemed to have voted all of the shares in that way. 

  

 Subdivision 2. The Board of Directors (or an officer of the Corporation, if authorized by the Board of Directors) may fix a date not more than 60 days before the date of a meeting of shareholders as the date for the determination of the holders of shares entitled to notice of and entitled to vote at the meeting. When a date is so fixed, only shareholders on that date are entitled to notice of and permitted to vote at that meeting of shareholders. 

  

 _Section 1.09 Proxies_. A shareholder may cast or authorize the casting of a vote by (a) filing a written appointment of a proxy, signed by the shareholder, with an officer of the Corporation at or before the meeting at which the appointment is to be effective, or (b) by telephonic transmission or authenticated electronic communication, whether or not accompanied by written instructions of the shareholder, of an appointment of a proxy with the Corporation or the Corporations duly authorized agent at or before the meeting at which the appointment is to be effective. The telephonic transmission or authenticated electronic communication must set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the appointment was 

   ##### 

  

 

authorized by the shareholder. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication, or other
reproduction of the original of either the writing or transmission may be
used in lieu of the original, provided that it is a complete and legible
reproduction of the entire original. 

   

 _Section 1.10 Quorum_. The holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote at a shareholders meeting are a quorum for the transaction of business. If a quorum is present when a duly called or held meeting is convened, the shareholders present may continue to transact business until adjournment, even though the withdrawal of a number of the shareholders originally present leaves less than the proportion or number otherwise required for a quorum. 

  

 _Section 1.11 Acts of Shareholders_. Subdivision 1. Except for the election of directors or as otherwise required by law or specified in the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation, the shareholders shall take action by the affirmative vote of the holders of the greater of (a) a majority of the voting power of the shares present and entitled to vote on that item of business or (b) a majority of the voting power of the minimum number of shares entitled to vote that would constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at a duly held meeting of shareholders. Directors are elected by a plurality of the voting power of the shares present and entitled to vote on the election of directors at a meeting at which a quorum is present. 

  

 Subdivision 2. A shareholder voting by proxy authorized to vote on less than all items of business considered at the meeting shall be considered to be present and entitled to vote only with respect to those items of business for which the proxy has authority to vote. A proxy who is given authority by a shareholder who abstains with respect to an item of business shall be considered to have authority to vote on that item of business. 

  

 _Section 1.12 Action Without a Meeting_. Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the shareholders of the Corporation may be taken without a meeting by written action signed, or consented to by authenticated electronic communication, by all of the shareholders entitled to vote on that action. The written action is effective when it has been signed, or consented to by authenticated electronic communication, by the required shareholders, unless a different effective time is provided in the written action. If written action is permitted to be taken, and is taken, by less than all shareholders, then all shareholders must be notified of its text and effective time within five days after its effective time.

Each person elected to fill a vacancy shall hold office until a qualified successor is elected by the shareholders at the next regular meeting or at any special meeting duly called for that purpose. 

  

 _Section 2.04 Place of Meetings_. Each meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held at the principal executive office of the Corporation or at such other place as may be designated from time to time by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may determine that a meeting of the Board of Directors not be held at a physical place, but instead solely by means of remote communication through which the directors may participate with each other during the meeting. 

  

 _Section 2.05 Regular Meetings_. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors for the election of officers and the transaction of any other business shall be held without notice at the place of and immediately after each regular meeting of the shareholders. 

  

 _Section 2.06 Special Meetings_. A special meeting of the Board of Directors may be called for any purpose or purposes at any time by any member of the Board of Directors by giving not less than two days notice to all directors of the date, time and place of the meeting, provided that when notice is mailed, at least four days notice shall be given. The notice need not state the purpose of the meeting. 

  

 _Section 2.07 Waiver of Notice; Previously Scheduled Meetings_. Subdivision 1. A director of the Corporation may waive notice of the date, time and place of a meeting of the Board of Directors. A waiver of notice by a director entitled to notice is effective whether given before, at or after the meeting, and whether given in writing, orally, by authenticated electronic communication, or by attendance. Attendance by a director at a meeting is a waiver of notice of that meeting, unless the director objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and thereafter does not participate in the meeting. 

  

 Subdivision 2. If the day or date, time and place of a Board of Directors meeting have been provided herein or announced at a previous meeting of the Board of Directors, no notice is required. Notice of an adjourned meeting need not be given other than by announcement at the meeting at which adjournment is taken of the date, time and place at which the meeting will be reconvened. 

  

 _Section 2.08 Quorum_. The presence of a majority of the directors currently holding office shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. In the absence of a quorum, a majority of the directors present may adjourn a meeting from time to time without further notice until a quorum is present. If a quorum is present when a duly called or held meeting is convened, the directors present may continue to transact business until adjournment, 

   ##### 

  

 

even though the withdrawal of a number of the directors originally present
leaves less than the proportion or number otherwise required for a quorum. 

   

 _Section 2.09 Acts of Board of Directors_. Except as otherwise required by law or specified in the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation, the Board of Directors shall take action by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present at a duly held meeting. 

  

 _Section 2.10 Participation by Remote Communication_. A director may participate in a Board of Directors meeting by conference telephone, or, if authorized by the Board of Directors, by any other means of remote communication through which the director, other directors so participating, and all directors physically present at the meeting may participate with each other during the meeting. A director so participating is deemed present at the meeting. 

  

 _Section 2.11 Absent Directors_. A director of the Corporation may give advance written consent or opposition to a proposal to be acted on at a Board of Directors meeting. If the director is not present at the meeting, consent or opposition to a proposal does not constitute presence for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum, but consent or opposition shall be counted as a vote in favor of or against the proposal and shall be entered in the minutes or other record of action at the meeting, if the proposal acted on at the meeting is substantially the same or has substantially the same effect as the proposal to which the director has consented or objected. 

  

 _Section 2.12 Action Without a Meeting_. An action required or permitted to be taken at a Board of Directors meeting may be taken without a meeting by written action signed, or consented to by authenticated electronic communication, by all of the directors. Any action, other than an action requiring shareholder approval if the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation so provide, may be taken by written action signed, or consented to by authenticated electronic communication, by the number of directors that would be required to take the same action at a meeting of the Board of Directors at which all directors were present. The written action is effective when signed, or consented to by authenticated electronic communication, by the required number of directors, unless a different effective time is provided in the written action. If written action is permitted to be taken, and is taken, by less than all directors, then all directors shall be notified immediately of its text and effective date.

A resolution approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of Directors may establish committees having the authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business of the Corporation only to the extent provided in the resolutions.

 Subdivision 2. A committee shall consist of one or more natural persons, who need not be directors, appointed by affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present at a duly held Board of Directors meeting. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Subdivision 3. Section 2.04 and Sections 2.06 to 2.12 hereof shall apply to committees and members of committees to the same extent as those sections apply to the Board of the Directors and directors. 

  

 Subdivision 4. Minutes, if any, of committee meetings shall be made available upon request to members of the committee and to any director. 

  

 Subdivision 5. Unless otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation or the resolution of the Board of Directors establishing the committee, a committee may create one or more subcommittees, each consisting of one or more members of the committee, and may delegate to a subcommittee any or all of the authority of the committee. In these Bylaws, unless the language or context clearly indicates that a different meaning is intended, any reference to a committee is deemed to include a subcommittee, and any reference to a committee member is deemed to include a subcommittee member.

A certificate representing shares issued by the Corporation shall, if the Corporation is authorized to issue shares of more than one class or series, set forth upon the face or back of the certificate, or shall state that the Corporation will furnish to any shareholder upon request and without charge, a full statement of the designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights of the shares of each class or series authorized to be issued, so far as they have been determined, and the authority of the Board of Directors to determine the relative rights and preferences of subsequent classes or series. 

  

 Subdivision 4. The Corporation may determine that some or all of any or all classes and series of the shares of the Corporation will be uncertificated shares. Any such determination shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until the certificate is surrendered to the Corporation. 

  

 _Section 5.02 Declaration of Dividends and Other Distributions_. The Board of Directors shall have the authority to declare dividends and other distributions upon the shares of the Corporation to the extent permitted by law. 

  

 _Section 5.03 Transfer of Shares_. Shares of the Corporation may be transferred only on the books of the Corporation by the holder thereof, in person or by such persons attorney. In the case of certificated shares, shares shall be transferred only upon surrender and cancellation of certificates for a like number of shares. The Board of Directors, however, may appoint one or more transfer agents and registrars to maintain the share records of the Corporation and to effect transfers of shares. 

  

 _Section 5.04 Record Date_. The Board of Directors may fix a time, not exceeding 60 days preceding the date fixed for the payment of any dividend or other distribution, as a record date for the determination of the shareholders entitled to receive payment of such dividend or other distribution, and in such case only shareholders of record on the date so fixed shall be entitled to receive payment of such dividend or other distribution, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the Corporation after any record date so fixed. 

  

 _MISCELLANEOUS_  

   

 _Section 6.01 Execution of Instruments_. Subdivision 1. All deeds, mortgages, bonds, checks, contracts and other instruments pertaining to the business and affairs of the Corporation shall be signed on behalf of the Corporation by the Chief Executive Officer, or the President, or 

   ##### 

  

 

any Vice President, or by such other person or persons as may be designated
from time to time by the Board of Directors. 

   

 Subdivision 2. If a document must be executed by persons holding different offices or functions and one person holds such offices or exercises such functions, that person may execute the document in more than one capacity if the document indicates each such capacity. 

  

 _Section 6.02 Advances_. The Corporation may advance money to its directors, officers or employees to cover expenses that can reasonably be anticipated to be incurred by them in the performance of their duties and for which they would be entitled to reimbursement in the absence of an advance. 

  

 _Section 6.03 Corporate Seal_. The Corporation shall have no seal. 

  

 _Section 6.04 Fiscal Year_. The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be determined by the Board of Directors. 

  

 _Section 6.05 Amendments_.
