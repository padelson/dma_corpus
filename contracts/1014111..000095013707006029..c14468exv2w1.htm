product specifications provided by TDK for inclusion as Attachment C to the Quality Guidelines (as
defined in the Trademark License Agreement) and believes that they are acceptable except to the
extent that they refer to standards or specifications that are not performance or quality-related
or that rely on equipment or tools that are unique to TDK, such as: (a)&nbsp;the use of TDK-specific
testing apparatus (including fixtures) that Imation does not have direct access to (possible
example &#147;TDK proprietary defect tester&#148;); (b)&nbsp;the use of reference tapes for evaluating the
performance of recording characteristics that Imation does not have access to; (c)&nbsp;recitations of
specific packaging materials or configurations that are not required for product performance; and
(d)&nbsp;recitations of product components and materials that are not specifically required for
performance or format interchange (e.g., internal components of a tape reel). Between the date
hereof and Closing, Imation shall complete its review and the parties shall reasonably agree to the
final form of these product specifications, which shall then be included in Attachment C to the
Quality Guidelines.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 3%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <U>Generally</U>. From the date of execution of this Agreement until the
Closing, neither party shall issue any press release (or make any other public
announcement) related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without
prior written approval of the other party hereto, except as may be necessary, in the
opinion of counsel to the party seeking to make disclosure, to comply with the
requirements of applicable Law, including the applicable rules of any securities market
or exchange on which such party is listed. The parties shall seek in good faith to
coordinate all announcements and communications with each party&#146;s employees, customers
and suppliers.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 3%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <U>SEC Filings</U>. Imation acknowledges that the Trademark License
Agreement as well as certain other Ancillary Agreements contain information that TDK
views as commercially sensitive terms and agrees that (i)&nbsp;Imation will consult in good
faith with TDK prior to filing such documents concerning the question of whether
confidential treatment should be requested and, (ii)&nbsp;with respect to the Trademark
License Agreement, shall initially file the agreement in a form reasonably agreed
between the parties hereto and request confidential treatment for all portions of the
Trademark License Agreement highlighted therein.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.2 <U>Expenses</U>. Except as otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement, TDK and
Imation shall each pay all of their own expenses with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including legal, accounting, investment banking and consulting fees and expenses
incurred in negotiating, executing and delivering this Agreement and the other agreements,
exhibits, documents and instruments contemplated by this Agreement (whether the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or not); <I>provided, however</I>, that the parties will
share equally any filing fees for filings under Competition Laws.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.3 <U>Amendment and Waiver</U>. No provision of this agreement may be amended, and no
breach of any provision hereof may be waived, except in a writing executed by the party against
which such action is sought to be enforced. Neither the failure nor any delay by any Person in
exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of such
right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege
shall preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of
any other right, power or privilege. In addition, no course of dealing between or among any
Persons having any interest in this Agreement shall be deemed effective to modify or amend any part
of this Agreement or any rights or obligations of any Person under or by reason of this Agreement.
The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative.

property interest must withhold tax if the transferor is a foreign person. For U.S. tax purposes
(including Section&nbsp;1445), the owner of a disregarded entity (which has legal title to a U.S. real
property interest under local law) will be the transferor of the property and not the disregarded
entity. To inform the transferee that withholding of tax is not required upon the disposition of a
U.S. real property interest by TDK Electronics Corporation (&#147;<I>TEC</I>&#148;), the undersigned hereby
certifies under penalties of perjury the following on behalf of TEC;

in any manner whatsoever other than as expressly authorized in the quality control guidelines for
the Licensed Trademarks (&#147;<B>Quality Guidelines</B>&#148;), including guidelines regarding how each Licensed
Trademark is used, presented and displayed (&#147;<B>Display</B>&#148;). The Quality Guidelines shall consist of
two elements: guidelines related to Display (such guidelines shall be contained in a &#147;<B>Logo

the Licensed Trademark (such guidelines shall be contained in a &#147;<B>Quality Manual</B>&#148;). The initial
Quality Guidelines are attached as <U>Exhibit&nbsp;H</U>. Licensee shall promptly cure any breach of

time to comply with Updates (as defined below), including a reasonable amount of time to exhaust
existing inventories of Promotional Material, packaging, and Licensed Product, except that Licensee
shall not have rights to exhaust existing inventories if such inventories are in material
noncompliance with the previous Quality Guidelines or if the existing Licensed Products (or use or
distribution thereof) would violate any applicable law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this <U>Section&nbsp;3.1</U>, if Licensee purchases products covered by the Supply Agreement from
third parties as permitted under the terms of the Supply Agreement, Licensee shall not be in breach
of provisions of the Quality Manual to the extent that such Quality Manual refers to standards or
specifications that are not performance or quality-related specifications (e.g., the use of
Licensor dye #25 in describing a color or other requirements for the product not tied to the
performance of the product), provided that Licensee shall comply with the Logo Manual. Licensor
may reasonably update such Quality Guidelines (&#147;<B>Updates</B>&#148;) from time to time to reflect, among other

parties regarding the quality of specific Licensed Products, providing Licensor with names and
addresses of vendors and suppliers producing Licensed Products or components thereof to be sold

Promotional Material, and Licensee shall promptly comply, upon written notice to Licensee if the
condition of such Licensed Product or Promotional Material could reasonably be expected to
materially and adversely affect Licensor&#146;s business or reputation. For the avoidance of doubt, if
there is a reasonable basis for believing that a product poses a danger to person or property, such

affect Licensor&#146;s business or reputation. Further, Licensor shall have the right to request a
product recall if there is a reasonable basis for believing that the product or category of
products poses a danger to person or property, and Licensee shall promptly comply upon written
notice of such request. If Licensee wishes to resume sale of a product, Licensor shall have the
right to approve such resumption.

event within five (5)&nbsp;days, after Licensee&#146;s receipt from a Designated Entity of any unsolicited
oral or written offer with respect to a transaction which could constitute a Change of Control
transaction with respect to Licensee (a &#147;<B>Sale Transaction</B>&#148;), Licensee shall notify Licensor in
writing of such offer, and if the offer is in writing, provide a copy thereof. For the avoidance
of doubt, such notice must identify the Designated Entity and contain all material terms of the
Sale Transaction other than customary standard provisions. Promptly upon Licensee&#146;s agreement in
principle on the terms of any such Sale Transaction, Licensee shall provide Licensor with written
notice (the &#147;<B>Offer Notice</B>&#148;) setting forth (i)&nbsp;the price, material terms and conditions of the
proposed Sale Transaction, including the identity of the Designated Entity making the offer; and
(ii)&nbsp;a copy of any written proposal, term sheet, letter of intent or other agreement relating to
the proposed Sale Transaction. Licensor will have thirty (30)&nbsp;Business Days from the date of the
Offer Notice (the &#147;<B>Notice Period</B>&#148;) to agree to acquire Licensee (or, if less than a full
acquisition is contemplated in the Offer Notice, elect to pursue the transaction described
therein), for the price and upon the terms and conditions specified in the Offer Notice, by giving
written notice (an &#147;<B>Acceptance Notice</B>&#148;) to Licensee. If Licensor fails to provide an Acceptance
Notice within the Notice Period, Licensee will have sixty (60)&nbsp;days after the end of the Notice
Period to execute a definitive agreement with the Designated Entity specified in the Offer Notice
on terms and conditions no more favorable to the counter-party than the terms and conditions set
forth in the relevant Other Notice. In the event Licensee does not so execute a definitive
agreement within such period, Licensee may not thereafter enter into any binding agreement with
respect to a Change in Control transaction with such Designated Entity without first offering such
opportunity to Licensor in the manner provided in this <U>Section&nbsp;5.4(a)</U>. If Licensor
provides an Acceptance Notice within the Notice Period but no definitive agreement is reached
between Licensor and Licensee within ninety (90)&nbsp;days after the date of the Acceptance Notice,
Licensee shall have the right to restart the negotiations with the Designated Entity on the terms
originally set out in the Offer Notice, but in no event may Licensee execute a definitive agreement
with such Designated Entity on terms and conditions more favorable to such entity than those set
forth in the Offer Notice. In the event that, during the pendency of the negotiations pursuant to
an Acceptance Notice, Licensee receives a further offer from the Designated Entity that it
considers superior to the initial offer, Licensee may elect to pursue that offer, in which case the
process provided in this <U>Section&nbsp;5.4(a)</U> shall be restarted and Licensee shall delver a new
Offer Notice to Licensor.

the jurisdiction of the entity, purpose of the addition, and direct and indirect ownership interest
of such entity and Licensor shall have the right to approve or disapprove such request, but shall

whether an entity is wholly-owned for purposes of the foregoing, the parties will disregard a de

such shares in connection with the due formation of the entity, or to qualify as a director, in

such shares (i)&nbsp;holds no more shares than is required by such statute, (ii)&nbsp;does not have the power
or authority to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such entity,
whether through the ownership of securities, by contract or otherwise, except director nominees may
have such rights to the extent they can exercise them solely in accordance with the directions of
Licensee, and (iii)&nbsp;shall only be disregarded for so long as such legal requirement exists and for
as long thereafter, up to a maximum of three (3)&nbsp;months as may reasonably be necessary for Licensee
to acquire the shares held by such nominee.

regarding communications from third parties regarding the quality of specific Licensed Products,
providing Licensee or Licensor with names and addresses of vendors and suppliers producing Licensed

(the &#147;<B>Forfeiture Date</B>&#148;), the Investor shall have the right to designate one employee or director of
TDK or any Affiliate of TDK as a nominee to stand for election as a director of the Company (the

Company shall increase the size of the Board by one member and fill the resulting vacancy in
accordance with the Company&#146;s bylaws by designating the Investor Nominee as a director of the Class
whose term will expire at the next annual meeting of stockholders. Thereafter, the Board shall
recommend to the Company&#146;s stockholders to vote to elect the Investor Nominee at the next
stockholders&#146; meeting and at each subsequent stockholders&#146; meeting at which directors of that Class
are elected. The foregoing nomination right will be subject to the Company&#146;s generally applicable
policies with respect to the qualification of Board nominees under the Company&#146;s Corporate
Governance Guidelines, as may be amended from time to time (the &#147;<B>Board Qualifications</B>&#148;); <I>provided</I>,
that (i)&nbsp;in the event that a proposed Investor Nominee is rejected by the Board&#146;s Nominating and
Governance Committee, (A)&nbsp;the Board will not nominate any person not designated by the Investor to
stand for election in place of the rejected Investor Nominee and (B)&nbsp;the Investor shall have the
right to nominate a replacement candidate, until such time as an Investor Nominee that meets the
Board Qualifications is put forward by the Investor, and (ii)&nbsp;the Company shall not revise or amend

directors to the same degree as other members of the Board, and may be removed for cause under

Additional Securities, notify the Investor in writing of such proposed issuance specifying, to the
extent practicable, the purchase price or a range for the purchase price, if any, for, and the

Securities to the Investor in the amounts set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;2.1(c)</U>, upon the terms and

conditions, and shall provide a supplemental notice, adding the missing terms, to the Investor as
soon as they are known to the Company, and in no event later than ten (10)&nbsp;Business Days prior to
such issuance. For purposes of calculating the number of Additional Securities issued pursuant to
this <U>Section&nbsp;2.1(a)</U>, such calculation shall include the maximum number of shares of Common
Stock and other Securities issuable upon the conversion or exercise of any convertible or
exchangeable Securities.

Preemptive Rights and including any related issuance resulting from the exercise of preemptive or
similar rights by any unrelated Person with respect to the same issuance that gave rise to the
exercise of the Preemptive Rights by the Investor), the Investor&#146;s Equity Interest after such

infringement of third party rights, to address safety issues or concerns, or to comply with

Category (the &#147;<I>New Product</I>&#148;), and (ii)&nbsp;it is commercially reasonable for TDK to supply the New
Product (for the avoidance of doubt, as of the Effective Date, it would not be commercially
reasonable for TDK to supply flash drives and cards, DVD discs, and HD DVD discs, although any of
these may change over time depending on the future direction of TDK), then TDK will have the
exclusive right of first negotiation and refusal to supply the New Product as follows: Imation
will in good faith and promptly notify TDK in writing of its intention to sell the New Product,
provide TDK with draft specifications for the New Product and consult with TDK with respect to the
intended market and specifications (the &#147;<I>New Product Specifications</I>&#148;) for the New Product and with
respect to other matters relating to its commercialization. Once Imation has completed the New
Product Specifications, Imation will deliver them to TDK, and (i)&nbsp;TDK will have the exclusive right
to elect whether to supply the New Product to Imation and will exercise such right as promptly as
commercially reasonable but not later than thirty (30)&nbsp;days after TDK&#146;s receipt of the New Product
Specifications; (ii)&nbsp;starting upon TDK&#146;s receipt of the New Product Specifications, the parties
then will negotiate in good faith and exclusively a price for the New Product that is competitive;
and (iii)&nbsp;TDK will provide a commercialization schedule that is competitive. If TDK elects not to
supply the New Product, the parties in good faith are unable to agree on such price for the New
Product within sixty (60)&nbsp;days after the date on which TDK received the New Product Specifications
or TDK does not provide a commercialization schedule that is competitive within sixty (60)&nbsp;days
after the date on which TDK received the New Product Specifications, then Imation may make other
arrangements for supply of such New Products. Otherwise, the New Product will become subject to
the supply and purchase commitments set forth in <I>Article&nbsp;2</I>. Nothing in this <I>Section&nbsp;3.3 </I>will
prevent either party from entering into a written joint development agreement with a third party to
develop a new product, and Imation shall not be required to buy a New Product from TDK if (i)&nbsp;joint
development of the specific New Product under such agreement requires at least a twelve (12)-month

by and between Imation Corp., a Delaware corporation (&#147;<U>Imation</U>&#148;), and TDK Corporation, a
Japanese corporation (&#147;<U>TDK</U>&#148;). Imation, on the one hand, and TDK, on the other hand, are
each referred to herein as a &#147;<U>Party</U>&#148; and, together, as the &#147;<U>Parties</U>.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Imation and TDK are parties to an Acquisition Agreement dated as of <U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U>, 2007

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, to facilitate Imation&#146;s operation of the Business (as defined in the Acquisition
Agreement) in an effective manner for a period of time after the closing of the transactions
contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement, TDK has agreed to provide to Imation certain services
for the periods and on the terms and conditions set forth herein; and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, it is a condition to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Acquisition
Agreement that Imation and TDK enter into this Agreement.

other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which is hereby acknowledged,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">1.1 <U>General</U>. During the Term, TDK shall, either directly or through its subsidiaries (each
a &#147;<U>TDK Subsidiary</U>&#148;), provide the services set forth in the statements (each a
&#147;<U>Statement of Work</U>&#148;) set out in <U>Attachment A</U> hereto (the &#147;<U>Services</U>&#148;) to
Imation or its subsidiaries (each an &#147;<U>Imation Subsidiary</U>&#148;) in accordance with the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the respective Statements of Work. Services will be
provided hereunder in Japan, ** and the U.S. (the &#147;<U>Service Locations</U>&#148;). The
Statements of Work set forth for each Service Location (i)&nbsp;the Services to be provided in such
Service Location, (ii)&nbsp;the applicable Service Providers and Service Recipients, and (iii)&nbsp;other
agreed terms with respect to Services in such Service Location. The Parties may, from time to
time, agree to additional Statements of Work to replace or supplement those set out in
<U>Attachment A</U> with respect to any Services. For the avoidance of doubt, no services other
than those set forth in <U>Attachment A</U> will be provided pursuant to this Agreement.

such Services, TDK or the TDK Subsidiary designated in the Statement of Work applicable to those
Services. Where a TDK Subsidiary is the Service Provider, TDK shall: (i)&nbsp;supervise the performance
of such Service Provider to ensure that the Service Provider complies with the obligations that
apply to Service Providers under this Agreement; (ii)&nbsp;impose on such Service Provider the same
confidentiality obligations that apply to TDK under this Agreement; and (iii)
