 (iii) In the event that the Average Share Price is less than eighty-seven percent (87%) of the Base Share Price, Imation shall also set forth in the Price Notice the Floor Share Number (as defined below), the scheduled Closing shall be postponed until the tenth (10th) Business Day after the Price Confirmation Date, and:

The Closing Date Balance Sheet shall include a determination of the Closing Date Working Capital Amount. 

   ##### 

  

   

" _Closing Date Working Capital Amount_ " means the Working Capital Amount
as determined in accordance with US GAAP, consistent with TDKs past
practices, reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet in Japanese yen and as
converted into Dollars using the average of the currency exchange rates
reported by the WSJ, or, if not reported thereby, as reported by any other
authoritative source, on each of the thirty (30) Trading Days preceding the
Closing Date. In connection with the preparation of the Closing Date Balance
Sheet, it is expected that Imations independent accountants will, within two
(2) days prior to and four (4) days after the Closing, take a
physical inventory of all product stocks other than those on consignment,
which inventory TDKs independent accountants shall be permitted to observe.
Subject to TDKs compliance with the standard "hold harmless" requirements of
Imations accountants, Imation shall make the workpapers and back-up
materials used in preparing the Closing Date Balance Sheet available to TDK
and its accountants and other representatives at reasonable times and upon

Date Balance Sheet and (ii) the resolution by Imation and TDK of any
objections to the Closing Date Balance Sheet.

If Imation and TDK do not reach a resolution of all objections within thirty (30) days after Imation has received the statement of objections, they shall submit the issues to Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (the " _Independent Accountants_ ") for resolution. The Independent Accountants shall be directed to determine, in accordance with US GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of the TDK Financial Statements, the amounts to be included in the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Working Capital Amount. The parties shall provide to the Independent Accountants, within twenty (20) Business Days after its retention, a definitive statement of the position of each party with respect to each unresolved objection and shall advise the Independent Accountants that the parties accept the accounting firm as the appropriate Person to interpret this Agreement for all purposes relevant to the resolution of the unresolved objections. Imation shall provide the Independent Accountants access to the books, records and, subject to compliance with the standard "hold harmless" requirements of Imations accountants, the work papers of Imations accountants. The parties shall request the Independent Accountants to carry out a review of the unresolved objections and prepare a written statement of its determination regarding each unresolved objection together with its calculation of the Closing Date Working Capital Amount and the Excess Working Capital Amount or the Working Capital Shortfall Amount, as the case may be, based on its resolution of the parties objections (the " _Independent Accountant s Determination_") within thirty (30) days. The Independent Accountants Determination shall be set forth in writing and shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (c) If Imation and TDK submit any unresolved objections to the Independent Accountants for resolution as provided in Section 1.7(b), (i) each of the parties shall bear its own costs and expenses and (ii) the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants shall be borne equally by the parties. 

   

 (d) Within seven (7) days after the date on which the Closing Date Working Capital Amount shall have been finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.7: 

   

 (i) If the Closing Date Working Capital Amount exceeds the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital Amount (the amount of such excess, the " _Excess Working Capital Amount_ "), Imation shall pay to TDK an amount equal to the Excess Working Capital Amount; and 

   

 (ii) If the Closing Date Working Capital Amount is less than the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital Amount (the amount of such shortfall, the " _Working Capital Shortfall Amount_ "), TDK shall pay to Imation an amount equal to the Working Capital Shortfall Amount. 

   

 (e) All payments to be made to Imation or TDK pursuant to Section 1.7(d) shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds denominated in Dollars to the account designated by Imation or TDK, as applicable, and all such payments shall include simple interest thereon at a rate equal to one percent (1.00%) over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) for ninety (90) day Dollar deposits, accruing from the Closing Date to the date of payment. 

  

 1.8 _Earnout_. 

   

 (a) The amount of the earnout (the " _Earnout Amount_ ") shall be based on the Gross Margin (as defined below, the " _Gross Margin_ ") of the Business, calculated for the twelve (12)-month periods ending on each of December 31, 2008 (the " _FY08 Gross Margin_ "), December 31, 2009 (the " _FY09 Gross Margin_ ") and December 31, 2010 (the " _FY10 Gross Margin_ "). The Earnout Amount shall have a cumulative maximum amount of $70,000,000 and shall be determined and paid as follows: 

   

 (i) in the event that the sum of the FY08 Gross Margin and the FY09 Gross Margin (the " _Two-Year Cumulative Gross Margin_ ") shall exceed $235,000,000 (the " _First Earnout Threshold_ "), Imation shall pay to TDK a first tranche of the Earnout Amount (the " _First Earnout Tranche_ "), which shall be payable on or before the last Business Day in the month of March, 2010 in an amount equal to $10,000,000 plus the amount by which the Two-Year Cumulative Gross Margin exceeds the First Earnout Threshold, up to a maximum total for the First Earnout Tranche of $40,000,000; and 

   

 (ii) in the event that the sum of the FY08 Gross Margin, the FY09 Gross Margin and the FY10 Gross Margin (the " _Three-Year Cumulative Gross Margin_ ") shall exceed $375,000,000 (the " _Second Earnout Threshold_ "), Imation shall pay to TDK a second tranche of the Earnout Amount (the " _Second Earnout Tranche_ "), 

   ##### 

  

    

which shall be payable on or before the last Business Day in the month
of March, 2011 in the fixed amount of $30,000,000, regardless of the amount
of the First Earnout Tranche, if any. 

   

 (b) For purposes of this Section 1.8, "Gross Margin" shall mean the amount of Imations gross revenues recognized for the relevant periods from the sale of products bearing the TDK Brand, net of all discounts, rebates and returns, less the cost of goods sold with respect to such products, in each case as determined in accordance with US GAAP applied in a manner consistent with Imations accounting practices and policies in effect for the relevant periods. 

   

 (c) Imation shall provide to TDK, no later than March 31 of each year beginning with 2009 and ending with 2011, a report setting forth the amounts of the FY08 Gross Margin, the FY09 Gross Margin and the FY10 Gross Margin, respectively, as determined by Imation and explaining in reasonable detail the way in which such determination was made (including a breakdown of the sales of, and details of the cost allocations to, specific products bearing the TDK Brand), together with payment of any amounts then due under this Section 1.8, which payments shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by TDK. TDK shall have the right, at any time within ninety (90) days after its receipt of the report, to cause TDKs independent accounting firm to conduct a review of the books and records of Imation to the extent necessary for the verification of those amounts, and Imation shall provide access for such accountants to the relevant books and records at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice. 

   

 (d) For the avoidance of doubt, following the Closing, Imation shall not be obligated to operate the Business in a manner intended to achieve or maximize the Earnout Amount, but shall operate the Business in good faith, in the best interests of its stockholders, disregarding the achievement or anticipated amount of the Earnout Amount. 

   

 (e) Upon the consummation of any transaction constituting a Change of Control with respect to Imation: 

   

 (i) prior to January 1, 2010, the cumulative maximum Earnout Amount of $70,000,000 shall become and be due and payable to TDK, and shall be paid promptly, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after consummation of the transaction constituting such Change of Control, to TDK by wire transfer of immediately available funds; and 

   

 (ii) prior to January 1, 2011, the Second Earnout Tranche of $30,000,000, plus the amount of any sums remaining due and payable in respect of the First Earnout Tranche, shall become and be forthwith due and payable to TDK, and shall be promptly paid to TDK by wire transfer of immediately available funds. 

  

 1.9 _Legends and Transfer of Imation Shares_. Each certificate representing Imation Shares will be imprinted with a legend substantially in the following form: 

   ##### 

  

   

 _The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be transferred without
registration or an exemption therefor._  

 

Subject to the provisions of the Investor Rights Agreement, if, as and
whenever TDK intends to transfer any of the Imation Shares, otherwise than
pursuant to an registration statement filed in compliance with the Securities
Act, it first must furnish Imation with a written opinion
reasonably satisfactory to Imation in form and substance from counsel
reasonably satisfactory to Imation to the effect that TDK may transfer such
Imation Shares without registration under the Securities Act. In the event
that TDK should transfer any of its shares to an Affiliate, it shall cause
the Affiliate to comply with this Section 1.9. 

   

 1.10 _Consents_. TDK will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, prior to Closing, all Consents required for the transfer of the Acquired Assets. In the event that any Required Consent has not been obtained as of the Closing and that Imation, in its sole discretion, elects to waive the closing condition set forth in Section 8.1(d), then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 1.1, Section 1.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement: 

   

 (a) with respect to any Acquired Contract, Governmental Authorization or other item included in the Acquired Assets with respect to which such Required Consent is not obtained (each, a " _Restricted Asset_ "), Imation may elect to either: 

   

 (i) exclude such Restricted Asset from the Acquired Assets, in which event, unless and until the applicable Required Consent is obtained after the Closing, neither this Agreement nor any instrument delivered at the Closing shall constitute an assignment or transfer of such Restricted Asset or any interest arising thereunder or resulting therefrom; or 

   

 (ii) accept the assignment or transfer of such Restricted Asset notwithstanding the failure to obtain the applicable Required Consent, in which event such Restricted Asset shall be treated, for purposes of the determination of the Purchase Price, as if it had been transferred and assigned to Imation; 

   

 (b) with respect to any Restricted Asset that Imation has elected to exclude from the Acquired Assets pursuant to Section 1.10(a)(i), if the applicable Required Consent is obtained following the Closing Date, such Restricted Asset shall immediately be deemed to be included in the Acquired Assets, and an appropriate instrument of transfer substantially in the form that would have been used to convey such Restricted Asset pursuant to Section 1.7(b) had such Restricted Asset been acquired by Imation at the Closing and a copy of the Required Consent shall be promptly executed and delivered by and to the appropriate Persons; 

   

 (c) with respect to any Restricted Asset that Imation has elected to have transferred and assigned pursuant to Section 1.10(a)(ii), if the applicable Required Consent is subsequently obtained, a copy of such Required Consent shall be delivered to Imation and any instrument delivered at the Closing shall constitute an assignment 

   ##### 

  

    

or transfer of such Restricted Asset and all interests arising thereunder
or resulting therefrom in their entirety; and 

   

 (d) regardless of which election Imation makes pursuant to Section 1.10(a), TDK shall, for a period of up to six (6) months after the Closing, at Imations request, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any unobtained Required Consents as soon as reasonably practicable following Closing. 

  

 1.11 _Proration of Certain Items_. Except as provided in this Section 1.11, all property and ad valorem Taxes, leasehold rentals and other customarily proratable items relating to the Acquired Assets payable prior to or subsequent to the Closing Date and relating to a period of time both prior to and subsequent to the Closing Date shall be prorated as of the Closing between Imation and TDK, and the prorated portion due from the Relevant Entities, to the extent not previously paid, shall be reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet. If the actual amount of any such item is not known as of the Closing Date, such proration shall be based on the previous years assessment of such item and the parties shall adjust such proration and pay any underpayment or reimburse for any overpayment within thirty (30) days after the actual amount becomes known. 

  

 1.12 _Allocation_. Imation and TDK have agreed that the Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Acquired Assets and all other capitalized costs as set forth in Exhibit H, unless the parties agree otherwise prior to Closing.

items (i)-(iv) above. 

   

 (f) none of the Relevant Entities shall change any of its methods of accounting in effect on the Latest SCAandL Date, other than changes required by Local GAAP; 

   

 (g) none of the Relevant Entities shall cancel or terminate, or permit the cancellation or termination of, any insurance policy under which any of the Acquired Assets or Acquired Entities is insured or allow any of the coverage thereunder to lapse, unless simultaneously with such termination, cancellation or lapse replacement policies providing substantially similar coverage to the coverage under the canceled, terminated or lapsed policies for substantially similar premiums are in full force and effect; and 

   

 (h) none of the Relevant Entities shall make any increase in the compensation or benefits of any Active Employee except (i) in the Ordinary Course of Business, (ii) for such retention plans implemented by TDK or its Affiliates with respect to employees of the Relevant Entities as TDK deems appropriate in connection herewith, or (iii) as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement.

Until the Closing Date, TDK shall promptly notify Imation of any emergency or other change in the Ordinary Course of Business of the Relevant Entities or any Litigation that is commenced or, to the Knowledge of TDK, threatened as to the Business of the Relevant Entities and that, in each case, would be required to be listed on _Schedule 2.13 _had it occurred, or been commenced or threatened, prior to the date hereof. TDK shall promptly notify Imation in writing if it should discover on or before the Closing Date that any representation or warranty made by it in this Agreement was when made, has subsequently become or shall be on the Closing Date, untrue in any material respect. 

  

 4.3 _Access_. Through the Closing Date, TDK shall afford to Imation and its authorized representatives access at reasonable times, during normal business hours, and upon reasonable notice, to officers and other managerial employees of the Business. In addition, promptly after the date hereof, the parties shall form a joint team for the purpose of facilitating the effective and efficient post-Closing integration of the Business with a particular focus on (i) human resources and personnel matters, (ii) information technology matters, and (iii) management systems. Subject to applicable Law, including Competition Laws and Laws concerning the protection of personal information, and guidelines agreed by the parties to ensure compliance therewith, such integration team shall have access at reasonable times, during normal business hours, and upon reasonable notice, to Business information of the Relevant Entities reasonably relevant to its integration objectives.

   ##### 

  

  

 4.4 _Payment of Indebtedness_. TDK shall, prior to the Closing, cause each of the Acquired Entities to repay and discharge in full any and all such Indebtedness to which it may be subject; _provided_ , that, to the extent that repayment of any Acquired Entitys outstanding Indebtedness to TDK or its Affiliates would cause such Acquired Entity to lack sufficient cash to conduct its operations in the Ordinary Course of Business, TDK shall increase the capitalization of each such Acquired Entity to the extent necessary to enable such Indebtedness to be repaid or cancelled. All transactions between an Acquired Entity, on the one hand, and TDK or its Affiliates (other than Acquired Entities), on the other hand, that give rise to an account payable or receivable of an Acquired Entity that will remain outstanding as of the Closing, will reflect arms length terms between the parties thereto. To the extent that TDK believes there is a reasonable likelihood that any such debt payment would result in the insolvency of an Acquired Entity, TDK shall so inform Imation no fewer than fifteen (15) Business Days prior to Closing.

 4.7 _Required Consents and Authorizations_. TDK shall use its reasonable best efforts, in cooperation with Imation, to obtain as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, all Required Consents and Governmental Authorizations necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or that could, if not obtained, materially and adversely affect the conduct of the Business by the Relevant Entities as currently conducted, including those listed on _Schedule 8.1(d)_.

 (b) TDK shall promptly (and in no event later than three (3) Business Days after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry or indication of interest that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information) advise Imation orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry or indication of interest that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information relating to the Relevant Entities (including the identity of the Person making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest or request, and the terms thereof) that is made or submitted by any Person prior to the Closing Date. TDK shall keep Imation fully informed with respect to the status of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest or request and any modification or proposed modification thereto.

   ##### 

  

 

than fifteen (15) Business Days prior to Closing, and TDK may not complete
such removal or assumption without the consent of Imation, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (by more than five (5) Business
Days). 

   

 4.11 _Post-Closing Access and Cooperation_. 

   

 (a) For a period of three (3) years from and after the Closing Date, TDK shall afford to Imation, its accountants and counsel, during normal business hours, upon reasonable request and at the expense of Imation, access to the books and records of the Relevant Entities (other than TDK) not theretofore transferred to Imation. After the Closing Date, TDK shall hold all of the books and records of TDK pertaining to Acquired Assets and the Acquired Entities not theretofore transferred to Imation in accordance with TDKs retention policies in effect from time to time and, if it proposes at any time within three (3) years after the Closing Date to destroy or dispose of any such books and records, including any transfer to a third party (other than for storage purposes), it shall first offer in writing given at least sixty (60) days prior to such proposed destruction or disposition to transfer them to Imation at the sole expense of Imation. 

   

 (b) Following the Closing, TDK will provide Imations independent registered public accountants and other accounting representatives during normal business hours, upon reasonable request and at the expense of Imation, reasonable access to (and shall cause the other Selling Entities and TDKs independent auditors to provide Imations registered independent public accountants similar reasonable access to) such financial books and records of TDK and such Selling Entities with respect to the Business as may be necessary solely to allow Imations registered public accountants to meet reporting requirements applicable to Imation with respect to pre-Closing periods under the Exchange Act, provided that (i) Imation hereby expressly agrees that such information will be used solely to meet such reporting requirements and not for any other purpose, including in connection with any dispute between the parties concerning the terms hereof or any other Transaction Agreement, and (ii) as a condition to any such access, Imations registered public accountants or accounting representatives shall first agree to non-disclosure terms reasonably satisfactory to TDK (consistent with the reporting purposes of such access and the other terms hereof) and to any standard "hold harmless" requirements of TDKs accountants. 

  

 4.12 _Litigation Support_. In the event that and for so long as Imation is actively contesting or defending against any Litigation in connection with any fact or circumstance occurring on or prior to the Closing Date involving Acquired Assets, TDK shall cooperate in the contest or defense, and provide such testimony and access to its books and records, in each case solely as may be reasonably necessary in connection with the contest or defense. Such cooperation shall be provided at the cost and expense of Imation, except if and to the extent that Imation is entitled to indemnification therefor under Article X. 

  

 4.13 _Non-Solicitation_. During the period that commences on the Closing Date and ends on the third anniversary of the Closing Date, TDK shall not solicit for employment, or assist any 

   ##### 

  

 

third party in soliciting for employment, any of the Active Employees;
_provided, however_ , that the parties agree that nothing in this Section

solicitation for employment, (b) hiring any Active Employees who contact TDK
of their own accord, (c) soliciting any Active Employees whose employment is
terminated by Imation or (d) discussing employment terms of any kind with
Seconded Employees.

The foregoing obligations shall not apply to any Confidential Information that (i) is or subsequently becomes generally publicly known, other than as a direct or indirect result of the breach by TDK of this Agreement or of any Ancillary Agreement; (ii) subsequently comes lawfully into the possession of TDK, free from any obligation of confidentiality, from a third party that does not owe a duty or obligation of confidentiality to Imation; or (iii) is required to be disclosed by applicable Law, judgment or order of any Governmental Entity, or regulation of any securities exchange. 

   

 (b) TDK agrees that the agreements contained in this Section 4.14 are necessary to protect the legitimate interests of Imation and that any violation or breach of this Section 4.14 may result in irreparable injury to Imation for which no adequate remedy would exist at law. Accordingly, in addition to any relief at law that may be available to Imation for such violation or breach and regardless of any other provision contained in this Agreement, Imation may be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief restraining such violation or breach. 

   

 (c) In the event that TDK is requested or required (by oral question or request for information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Confidential Information, TDK shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, notify Imation promptly of the request or requirement prior to any disclosure so that Imation may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this 

   ##### 

  

    

Section 4.14. If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a
waiver from Imation, TDK believes that it should, on the advice of counsel,
disclose any Confidential Information, TDK may disclose the Confidential
Information; provided, however, that TDK shall, at the expense of Imation,
provide reasonable cooperation to Imation if Imation seeks to obtain, at the
expense of Imation, an order or other assurance that confidential treatment
shall be accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information required to
be disclosed as Imation designates. 

  

 4.15 _Assignment of Confidentiality Agreements_. To the extent permitted by such agreements, effective upon the Closing, TDK shall assign to Imation all right, title and interest of TDK in and to any confidentiality agreement to which TDK or any of its agents may be a party pertaining to the confidentiality of information relating to the Business. 

  

 4.16 _Covenant Not to Compete_.

 (c) TDK acknowledges that Imation has required that TDK make the agreements in this Section 4.16 as a condition to Imations consummation of the Transactions. TDK further acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in this Section 4.16 are reasonable (including with respect to duration, geographical area and scope) and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of Imation and that any 

   ##### 

  

    

violation or breach of this Section 4.16 will result in substantial
and irreparable harm to Imation. 

   

 (d) TDK agrees to cause its Subsidiaries to observe and comply with the provisions of this Section 4.16.

 4.17 _Compliance with Bulk Sales Laws_. If and to the extent reasonably and timely requested by Imation, TDK shall prior to Closing take such actions, including the giving of any notices and compliance with any waiting periods, as may be required under applicable Laws in the nature of "bulk sales" and other creditor notice laws in connection with Imations acquisition of the Acquired Assets and the Business.

Imation will use reasonable best efforts to assist TDK and its Affiliates in obtaining any such Consent that may be required.

VI. Additional Agreements 

   

 6.1 _Filings Under the HSR Act and Other Competition Laws_. 

   

 (a) Pursuant to, and without limiting the generality of, Section 4.7 and Section 5.2, TDK and Imation shall each, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) as promptly as practicable, but in any event within fourteen (14) calendar days of the date of this Agreement, make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement required under the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act or the Federal Trade Commission Act, and (ii) as promptly as practicable, but in any event within forty (40) calendar days of the date of this Agreement, make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement required under the analogous laws of the European Union, the Member States thereof, and any other federal, state or foreign law, regulation or decree designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (U.S. and non-U.S. laws collectively, " _Competition Laws_ "), as well as any other Laws applicable to the Relevant Entities, that are required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of TDK and Imation agrees that, during the term of this Agreement, it will not withdraw its filing under any of the Competition Laws without the written consent of the other party. Each of TDK and Imation agrees that it will not enter into any timing agreement with any Governmental Entity without the written consent of the other party. The parties agree that they will equally share the filing fees required under any of the Competition Laws. 

   

 (b) Subject to the terms hereof, TDK and Imation agree, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain as expeditiously as reasonably possible the termination of any waiting periods or any government clearances or approvals required for Closing under any Competition Law, to respond to any government requests for any information under any Competition Law, and to contest and resist any action, including any legislative, administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) (an " _Antitrust Order_ ") that restricts, prevents or prohibits under any Competition Law the consummation of the transactions contemplated by 

   ##### 

  

    

this Agreement; _provided, however_ , (i) that Imation shall have no
obligation under this Section 6.1 to dispose of, hold separately or make any
change in or to any portion of its business or assets (or in or to any
portion of the Business or the Acquired Assets) as a condition of such
governmental clearances or approvals and (ii) that each partys obligation to
contest and resist the entry of, and to have vacated or overturned, an
Antitrust Order restricting, preventing or prohibiting under any Competition
Law the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
cease on the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1
or sooner in the event such an Antitrust Order is entered by court of
initial jurisdiction. Each party hereto shall (i) give the other party hereto
prompt notice upon obtaining knowledge of the making or commencement of any
request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding by or before any
Governmental Entity with respect to any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) keep the other party hereto informed as to the status of
any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding, and
(iii) promptly inform the other party hereto of any communication to or from
the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, any
foreign competition authority or any other Governmental Entity regarding the
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties hereto

views of one another, in connection with, and provide to the other parties in
advance, any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in
connection with proceedings under or relating to any Competition Law. In
addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any
Law, each party hereto will permit authorized representatives of the other
party to be present at each meeting or telephone conference with
representatives of any Governmental Entity relating to any such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding and to have access to and
be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or
submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with any such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or other legal proceeding. 

  

 6.2 _Name of Acquired Entities_. Prior to or effective upon Closing, TDK shall change the name of each Acquired Entity to a name reasonably designated by Imation that does not include "TDK" or any derivative thereof. Following the Closing, neither any Acquired Entity nor any Acquiring Entity shall have a corporate name, or do business using a name, that includes as part of its name, "TDK" or any derivative thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Acquired Entity may continue to use its corporate name as of the date hereof for a period not to exceed six (6) months after Closing subject to compliance with the applicable license agreement between TDK and the relevant Acquired Entity and with the prior written consent of TDK. 

  

 6.3 _Additional Discussions Regarding Commercial Relationships_.

 6.4 _Transaction Structure_. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in Section 1.6, the Transaction will be structured substantially as contemplated in Exhibit I, provided that 

   ##### 

  

    

Imation will discuss and consider in good faith any adjustments to such
structure that TDK may reasonably request in order to avoid any adverse tax
or accounting consequences to TDK without impairing the tax or accounting
benefits of the transaction to Imation. Conversely, TDK will discuss and
consider in good faith any adjustments to such structure or actions that
Imation may reasonably request in order to remove cash from any of the
Acquired Entities prior to Closing without creating adverse tax or accounting
consequences for TDK. 

  

 6.5 _Payment of Transaction Taxes_. Other than as expressly addressed in the Trademark License Agreement, all sales, use, value added, transfer, stamp, documentary, filing, recording, registration, conveyance, license and other similar Taxes that arise from or are attributable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Income Taxes), and all recording or filing fees, notarial fees and other similar costs of Closing with respect to the purchase and sale of the Acquired Assets, or otherwise on account of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall be cumulated, regardless of which party bears such tax or fee in the first instance, and the total amount of such taxes and fees shall be borne equally by the parties. 

  

 6.6 _Licensed Mark_. Between the date hereof and Closing, the parties shall discuss in good faith the phrase "**," as well as its placement and sizing, as set forth in  _Exhibit A_ to the Trademark License Agreement, including whether an alternative phrase, placement or sizing could more fully achieve the parties respective goals thereunder, as well as up to one (1) alternative phrase for use on products other than Removable Recording Media Products. Upon any agreement between the parties with respect thereto, _Exhibit A_ to the Trademark License Agreement shall be revised to reflect such agreement, _provided, however_ , that, the parties shall not be obligated to agree to any changes and, absent any agreement, _Exhibit A_ shall remain as incorporated in the the form of the Trademark License Agreement attached hereto. 

  

 6.7 _Co-Branding_. Between the date hereof and Closing, the parties shall discuss in good faith the co-branding arrangements currently in effect with the respect to the TDK Brand in the Business, and the possibility of continuing some or all of these arrangements after Closing, as well as the terms and conditions on which any agreed arrangements will continue. 

  

 6.8 _Product Specifications_. Imation has made a preliminary review of certain sample product specifications provided by TDK for inclusion as Attachment C to the Quality Guidelines (as defined in the Trademark License Agreement) and believes that they are acceptable except to the extent that they refer to standards or specifications that are not performance or quality-related or that rely on equipment or tools that are unique to TDK, such as: (a) the use of TDK-specific testing apparatus (including fixtures) that Imation does not have direct access to (possible example "TDK proprietary defect tester"); (b) the use of reference tapes for evaluating the performance of recording characteristics that Imation does not have access to; (c) recitations of specific packaging materials or configurations that are not required for product performance; and (d) recitations of product components and materials that are not specifically required for performance or format interchange (e.g., internal components of a tape reel). Between the date hereof and Closing, Imation shall complete its review and the parties shall reasonably agree to the final form of these product specifications, which shall then be included in Attachment C to the Quality Guidelines.

From and after the Closing Date, for the periods specified in the Transition Service Agreement, TDK shall, and shall cause the following other Selling Entities to, provide Transition Services as follows (each of the below-referenced schedules to be agreed prior to Closing): 

   

 (a) _Japan_. TDK will provide services from its Nihonbashi Facility to TMK pursuant to one or more schedules to the Transition Services Agreement; 

   

 (b) **; 

   

 (c) _U.S_. TEC will provide services from its New York Facility and its Georgia Facility to Imation pursuant to one or more schedules to the Transition Services Agreement; and 

   

 (d) _Other Locations_.

Subject to Section 5.7 hereof **, services provided under the Transition
Services Agreement shall, in each of the above cases, be billed to Imation

at the service providers fully allocated cost for such services, including
without limitation (i) all compensation, benefit and other costs and expenses
incurred by or with respect to employees directly engaged in providing such
services, including (a) in respect of compensation, all applicable bonus
compensation, (b) in respect of benefits, all benefits under Plans, and (c)
in respect of costs and expenses, all costs for materials and for such items
as travel incurred in respect of the services, as well as a reasonable
allocation for space, maintenance, and facilities costs allocable to
employees engaged in providing services, as well as the actual cost of any
third party services used in providing the services, and (ii) similar
costs with respect to those directly engaged in the supervision of such
services. Service providers will also bill under the Transition Services
Agreement the actual cost of any services of third party providers. Imation
also agrees, with respect to services provided by TEC under the
Transition Services Agreement that it will use commercially reasonable
efforts to minimize its use of such services after Closing,

 7.3 _Japan Secondees_. 

   

 (a) _Secondment_. 

   

 (i) _Current TDK Secondees_. As of the Closing, subject to normal attrition prior to Closing: (i) the thirty-nine (39) Current Secondees shall be seconded to TMK until the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing (the " _Secondment Period_ "), and (ii) all other Business Employees of TDK shall be seconded to TMK for the Secondment Period (the " _Closing Secondees_ "), in each case in accordance with a secondment agreement in a form reasonably agreed between the parties hereto at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to Closing (the " _Secondment Agreement_ "). During the first three (3) months of the Secondment Period (the _"Assessment Period"_ ), Imation shall assess the performance of the Secondees and, if Imation reasonably determines based on such review that any Secondee is not required for the continuing operation of the Business, Imation may, during a period of one (1) month commencing ten (10) weeks after Closing (the " _Determination Period_ "), request, by written notice to TDK, that the SRC consider returning such Secondee to TDK. In the event that Imation wishes to call such a meeting, it shall (i) provide each SRC member with a statement in reasonable detail at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the relevant meeting identifying the affected Secondee and setting out the evaluation steps completed by Imation prior to requesting an SRC meeting, and the results thereof, and (ii) discuss in good faith with the SRC whether to return the Secondee in question to TDK (or a TDK Affiliate designated by TDK); _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, the return decision may be made in Imations discretion and the agreement of the SRC shall not be required for any such return. Any return decision shall be effective on the next following first (1st) or fifteenth (15th) day of the month following the SRC meeting called to discuss such return decision. 

   

 (ii) _Subsequent Review of Secondees_. If, after the Assessment Period, Imation believes in good faith that the services of a Secondee may no longer be required for the operation of the Business, Imation may request that the SRC review the circumstances of such Secondees employment, provided that it shall not do so for this purpose more than once in any six (6) month period. In any such case, Imation shall first (i) call a meeting of the SRC to discuss such Secondees

employment, (ii) provide each SRC member with a statement in reasonable
detail at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the relevant meeting
identifying the affected Secondee and setting out the evaluation steps
completed by Imation prior to requesting an SRC meeting, and the results
thereof, and (iii) discuss in good faith with the SRC whether to return the
Secondee in question to TDK (or a TDK Affiliate designated by TDK) and, if
so, the timing and terms of such return; _provided_ , that, for the avoidance
of doubt, any such return decision shall require the agreement of the SRC. 

   

 (iii) _Supervision_. The parties agree that, for the term of their secondment, the Secondees will be under the sole supervision and control of TMK, and that neither TDK nor any of its Affiliates shall be responsible to Imation, any of its Affiliates, or to any other Person, for any acts or omissions of any Secondee. 

   

 (b) _Secondee Information_. In connection with the secondments described in Section 7.3(a), TDK shall transfer or otherwise make available to Imation Japan such personal information with respect to Secondees as is agreed by the parties prior to the Closing consistent, and in accordance, with the Japanese Law Concerning the Protection of Personal Information (the " _PIPL_ "). During the Secondment Period, Imation Japan shall provide TDK with complete copies of all evaluations of Secondees, and shall further transfer or otherwise make available to TDK such personal information with respect to any Secondees who return to TDK (or a TDK Affiliate) during or at the end of the Secondment Term as is agreed by the parties prior to Closing consistent, and in accordance, with the PIPL. 

   

 (c) _Amendment of TDK s Existing Employment Terms_. Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Secondment Agreement to the contrary, TDK shall, in its sole discretion, have the right to modify any of its rules, regulations and policies, from time to time, including those relating to or otherwise governing the Secondees; _provided, however_ , that any such modification which either (i) is not consistently applied to Secondees and other employees of TDK, or (ii) results in Imation bearing material additional costs with respect to any Secondee (excluding annual salary increases consistent with past practice and bonuses paid in amounts, and on a timing, consistent with payments to other TDK employees) shall, prior to its application to Secondees, be subject to the prior written consent of Imation, such consent to not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

   

 (d) _Secondee Benefits_. Each Secondee shall remain eligible to participate during the Secondment Period in all insurance and other benefit programs made generally available by TDK from time to time to similarly situated TDK employees, and Imation shall promptly reimburse TDK for its costs for the foregoing in accordance with the Secondment Agreement. At Imations reasonable request, TDK shall provide reasonable documentation evidencing such costs. 

   

 (e) _Pre-Secondment Accruals_. All Liabilities with respect to Secondee benefits calculated with respect to any time period ending prior to the commencement of the Secondment Period for a Secondee under any benefit plan maintained or contributed to, or required to be maintained or contributed to, by TDK or for the benefit of such Secondee, 

   ##### 

  

    

including any Liabilities relating to unpaid salary, vacation days,
commissions, bonuses, allowances, subsidies, reimbursements, social insurance
payments, workers compensation contributions, or other payroll amounts,
together with all Taxes applicable thereto (other than income Taxes), shall
be for the account of TDK regardless of whether any such Liability is to be
paid to any Secondee at any time after the commencement of the Secondment
Period. 

   

 (f) _Post-Secondment Accruals_. All Liabilities with respect to Secondee benefits calculated with respect to any time period commencing on or after the commencement of the Secondment Period for a Secondee under any benefit plan maintained or contributed to, or required to be maintained or contributed to, by TDK or for the benefit of such Secondee, including any Liabilities relating to unpaid salary, vacation days, commissions, bonuses, allowances, subsidies, reimbursements, social insurance payments, workers compensation contributions, or other payroll amounts, together with all Taxes applicable thereto (other than income Taxes), shall be for the account of Imation and, if paid by TDK in the first instance, shall be promptly reimbursed by Imation to TDK; _provided, however_ , that nothing herein shall be construed as allocating to Imation costs resulting from any underfunding of any Plan prior to commencement of the Secondment Period. 

   

 (g) _Transfer of Secondees to Imation_. Imation may offer any Secondee permanent employment with Imation Japan as of the end of the Secondment Period (but not otherwise). 

  

 7.4 _Japan Transferred Employees_. Imation shall, and shall cause the Acquiring Entities or TMK to, offer to employ or continue the employment of each of the sixty-one (61) employees of TMK (each a " _TMK Regular Employee_ ") and shall, for a period of one (1) year following the Closing and subject to normal attrition and to employee acceptance of such offer, maintain the employment of such TMK Regular Employee at a level of compensation and benefits (including salary or wages, bonuses, incentive compensation, and employee benefits) that is substantially similar, in the aggregate, to that provided by TDK immediately prior to the Closing. The continued employment of such TMK Regular Employees after the end of such one (1)-year period will be at the discretion of Imation and will be "at will" employment, subject to the provisions of applicable Law and any Acquired Contracts. 

  

 7.5 _U.S. Employees_. 

   

 (a) _Closing Transferees_. With respect to each Business Employee of TEC employed at the Anaheim Facility as of Closing (each, an " _Anaheim Transferee_ ") and each other Business Employee of TEC whom the parties agree prior to the Closing shall be transferred to Imation or an Acquiring Entity (such employees, together with the Anaheim Transferees, the " _TEC Closing Transferees_ "), Imation shall, or shall cause the relevant Acquiring Entity to, make offers of employment to be effective as of 12:01 a.m. (in the respective workplace locations) on the first day after the Closing Date and contingent upon the Closing. Such offers to TEC Closing Transferees shall be sufficient to avoid triggering any notice obligation under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (the " _WARN Act_ "), or any similar statute, or other statutory severance obligations, with respect 

   ##### 

  

    

to affected employees. Imation shall, or shall cause the Acquiring Entities
to, offer to employ (or, as the case may be, continue the employment of) each
TEC Closing Transferee, and shall, subject to normal attrition and to
employee acceptance of such offer, maintain the employment of such employee
at a level of compensation and benefits (including salary or wages, bonuses,
incentive compensation, and employee benefits) that is substantially similar,
in the aggregate, to that provided immediately prior to the Closing. The
continued employment of such TEC Closing Transferees after Closing will be at
the discretion of Imation and will be "at will" employment, subject to the
provisions of applicable Law and any Acquired Contracts; _provided_ , that,
in the event that Imation or its Affiliates terminate the employment of any
TEC Closing Transferee within one (1) year after Closing, Imation shall
promptly notify TDK of such termination, identifying the terminated
employee, and provide such terminated employee with severance benefits in
accordance with TECs severance policy as in effect as of the date hereof;
_provided,_ that, if such TEC Closing Transferee is terminated after the
three (3) month anniversary of Closing and prior to the one (1) year
anniversary of Closing, TDK shall reimburse Imation for the amount by which
the severance benefit paid to such terminated employee in accordance with
TECs severance policy exceeds the amount that such terminated employee would
have been paid under Imations severance policy. 

   

 (b) _Post-Closing Transferees_. TEC shall provide the transition services set forth on one or more schedules to the Transition Services Agreement from the Closing Date until December 31, 2007 (the " _Transition Period_ "). During the Transition Period, in addition to the information provided to Imation pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, TDK shall provide Imation with such access to the continuing Business Employees of TEC (each a " _TEC Retained Employee_ "), to the extent consistent with applicable Law and TECs own generally applicable personnel policies, as may be reasonably necessary to allow Imation to evaluate the TEC Retained Employees in accordance with Imations generally applicable employment assessment procedures (the " _Assessment Procedures_ "). Subject to the last sentence of this Section 7.5(b), Imation may make offers of employment to any TEC Retained Employee at any time prior to the earlier of (i) the end of the Transition Period, and (ii) the termination of such employee by TEC. Any such offer will be in writing and will be copied to TEC. Each TEC Retained Employee who accepts such an offer shall thereafter transfer to Imation on a date reasonably agreed between Imation and TEC, and the scope of the Transition Services shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such transfer as of the date on which such transfer occurs (the " _TEC Transfer Date_ "). Imation shall maintain the employment of each such TEC Post-Closing Transferee for at least one (1) year after the TEC Transfer Date at a level of compensation and benefits (including salary or wages, bonuses, incentive compensation, and employee benefits) that is substantially similar, in the aggregate, to that provided immediately prior to the TEC Transfer Date. The continued employment of such TEC Retained Employees after the end of such one (1)-year period will be at the discretion of Imation and will be "at will" employment subject to the provisions of applicable Law and any Acquired Contracts. 

   

 (c) _Termination and Severance_. TEC shall retain the right to terminate any TEC Retained Employee at any time. TEC shall have the right to include within the costs billed to Imation under the Transition Services Agreement any severance amount paid by 

   ##### 

  

    

TEC to a TEC Retained Employee notified of termination during, or within
thirty (30) days after, the Transition Period, up to the amount that would
have been payable to such employee under Imations applicable plans if such
employee had been employed by Imation at the time of termination rather than
TEC (and, for the avoidance of doubt, crediting service accrued at the
Relevant Entities by such TEC Retained Employee for purposes of
such calculation). 

  

 7.6 _European Employees_. Imation shall, and shall cause the other Acquiring Entities to, offer to employ or continue the employment of the Business Employees of TME and TPL (the " _European Employees_ "), from and after Closing, at a level of compensation and benefits (including salary or wages, bonuses, incentive compensation, and employee benefits) that is substantially similar, in the aggregate, to that provided immediately prior to the Closing, and shall, subject to normal attrition and to employee acceptance of such offer, maintain the employment of such employees on such terms as and to the extent required by applicable Law (including the Transfer Regulations) or as a result of negotiation with applicable works councils and/or unions; _provided_ , that, subject to Imations and its Affiliates compliance with applicable Law and any Acquired Contracts, the continued employment of such European Employees will be at the discretion of Imation and will be "at will" employment. Imation shall undertake, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to undertake, all required notices to and negotiations with works councils and unions and shall comply with any applicable Transfer Regulations. In the event that Imation or any of its Affiliates terminates any European Employee within one (1) year after the Closing, Imation shall (i) pay or provide such European Employee the severance, outplacement and other benefits provided for under the applicable TDK Severance Plan and (ii) promptly notify TDK of such termination, identifying the terminated employee. 

  

 7.7 _APAC Employees_. Imation shall, and shall cause the other Acquiring Entities to, offer to employ or continue the employment, subject to normal attrition and to employee acceptance of such offer, of the Business Employees of TSP, TRH, and TAP (the " _APAC Employees_ "), from and after Closing, at a level of compensation and benefits (including salary or wages, bonuses, incentive compensation, and employee benefits) that is substantially similar, in the aggregate, to that provided by the Relevant Entities immediately prior to the Closing. The continued employment of such APAC Employees after Closing will be at the discretion of Imation and will be "at will" employment subject to the provisions of applicable Law and any Acquired Contracts. In the event that Imation or any of its Affiliates terminates any APAC Employee within one (1) year after the Closing, Imation shall (i) pay or provide such APAC Employee the severance, outplacement and other benefits provided for under the applicable TDK Severance Plan and (ii) promptly notify TDK of such termination, identifying the terminated employee. 

  

 7.8 _Employee Benefits Arrangements_. 

   

 (a) _U.S. Defined Benefit Plan_. As of the Closing, the TEC Closing Transferees shall, and as of the TEC Transfer Date the TEC Post-Closing Transferees (the TEC Closing Transferees and the TEC Post-Closing Transferees, collectively, the " _TEC Transferees_ ") shall, cease active participation in TDKs defined benefit pension plan for TEC Employees (the " _U.S. Pension Plan_ "). TDK shall take all actions required in order for all TEC Transferees with vested benefits under the U.S. Pension Plan to receive such benefits in accordance with the terms thereof. With the exception of any "eligible rollover 

   ##### 

  

    

distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) made at
the direction of TEC Transferees, no transfer of assets or liabilities
relating to the TEC Transferees from the U.S. Pension Plan shall be made to
any tax-qualified retirement plans maintained by Imation or any of its
Affiliates. 

   

 (b) _U.S. Flexible Spending Account_. As of the Closing Date, Imation shall establish flexible spending accounts for medical and dependent care expenses under a new or existing plan (an " _Imation FSA_ ") for each Transferred Employee who, on or prior to the Closing Date, is a participant in TDKs flexible spending account for medical and dependent care expenses (the " _TDK FSA_ ") or who elects to participate in the Imation FSA. Subject to Imation being provided all information reasonably necessary to permit the administrator of the Imation FSA to accommodate the inclusion of the Transferred Employees in the Imation FSA on the basis described herein, Imation will credit or debit, as applicable, effective as of the Closing Date for Closing Transferees, and as of the date of transfer or secondment to Imation or an Affiliate of Imation in the case of other Transferred Employees (such date, the " _Benefits Transfer Date_ "), the applicable account of each Transferred Employee under the Imation FSA with an amount equal to the balance of each such Transferred Employees account under the TDK FSA as of immediately prior to the Benefits Transfer Date. As soon as practicable after the expiration of the Transition Period, TDK will pay to Imation the net aggregate amount of the account balances credited under the Imation FSA, if such amount is positive, and Imation will pay to TDK the net aggregate amount of the account balances credited under the Imation FSA, if such amount is negative. No later than as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, TDK shall provide to Imation a complete and accurate listing of year-to-date contributions and reimbursements under the Imation FSA for the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs (such listing to be updated periodically to reflect any such information reported following the Closing Date through the expiration of the Transition Period). 

   

 (c) _Non-U.S. Pensions_. With respect to TDKs pension plans for Transferred Employees, subject to applicable Law, (i) if and to the extent that the transaction is a purchase of an Acquired Entity, assets and liabilities for pension benefits shall become the assets and liabilities of the relevant Acquiring Entity; and (ii) if and to the extent that the transaction is a purchase of assets from the Selling Entities, TDK shall retain all assets and liabilities under its plans (and, to the extent applicable, under the pension fund rules or insurance company contracts maintained to fund such plans), and shall make payments to Transferred Employees with vested rights thereunder in accordance with the terms of TDKs plans and applicable Law. 

   

 (d) _Medical, Dental, Disability and Life Insurance Benefits_. 

   

 (i) TDK shall be responsible in accordance with its applicable welfare plans in effect prior to the Closing Date for all medical and dental claims for expenses incurred prior to the applicable Benefits Transfer Date. Reimbursement of employees and their dependents for medical and dental expenses associated with such claims (including claims submitted on behalf of disabled employees and their dependents) shall be determined in accordance with the terms of TDKs medical and dental programs as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date. TDK shall

Transfer Date. Imation and its Affiliates shall be responsible for all
medical and dental claims for expenses incurred on and after the applicable
Benefits Transfer Date by Transferred Employees. 

   

 (ii) Imation and its Affiliates, or insurers with whom they shall have contracted for such insurance, shall be responsible for all claims by Transferred Employees and their dependents (including responsibility for post-retirement life insurance claims by Transferred Employees and their dependents) incurred after the applicable Benefits Transfer Date, under group life, travel and accident, and accidental death and dismemberment insurance policies.

 (iii) Imation and its Affiliates shall exercise reasonable efforts to cause to be waived any pre-existing condition limitation under the welfare plans applicable to Transferred Employees or their dependents if such condition would otherwise have been covered under the terms of TDKs welfare plans. In those countries in which health benefits are subject to co-payments or deductibles, the Imation and its Affiliates will exercise reasonable efforts to give or cause to be given full credit for all co-payments and deductibles satisfied prior to the Closing in the same plan year as if there had been a single continuous employer, and TDK will cooperate by providing, and causing its agents to provide, information to the Imation regarding co-payments and deductibles during that plan year. 

   

 (e) _Credited Service_. Imation shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, credit service accrued by Transferred Employees with, or otherwise recognized for benefit plan purposes by, the Relevant Entities as of the Closing for purposes of eligibility and vesting under its benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements (including under any applicable pension, 401(k), savings, medical, dental, life insurance, vacation, post-retirement health and life insurance, severance and separation pay plans).

For purposes of this Agreement, claims for benefits and the liabilities for such claims under the following plans and policies shall be deemed to be incurred as follows: (i) life, accidental death and dismemberment and business travel accident insurance benefits, upon the death or accident giving rise to such benefits; (ii) health, dental, prescription drug or other benefits that become payable during or in connection with any hospital confinement or confinement to a skilled nursing facility or similar facility, as of the date of occurrence of the accident or injury, or the inception of the illness, that is the cause of the hospital or other facility confinement and (iii) health, dental and/or prescription drug benefits not described in (ii), upon provision of such services, materials or supplies. For purposes of this Agreement, liabilities for premiums, contributions or similar purchase obligations to obtain coverage under welfare plans and insurance policies shall be deemed to be incurred as of the due date, without giving effect to any grace period for late payment. 

   ##### 

  

  

 7.9 _Workers Compensation_. TDK currently sponsors a program that provides workers compensation benefits for eligible Transferred Employees (the " _TDK Workers Compensation Program_ "). TDK shall be responsible for all claims for workers compensation benefits which are incurred prior to the applicable Benefits Transfer Date by Transferred Employees, and which are payable under the terms and conditions of TDK Workers Compensation Program. Effective as of the Closing Date, Imation shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, take all necessary and appropriate action to adopt a workers compensation program providing such workers compensation benefits as are required by Law for the Transferred Employees (the " _Imation Workers Compensation Program_ "). Such Imation Workers Compensation Program shall be responsible for all claims for benefits which are incurred after the applicable Benefits Transfer Date by Transferred Employees, and which are payable under the terms and conditions of the Imation Workers Compensation Program. For purposes of this Section 7.9, a claim for workers compensation benefits shall be deemed to be incurred when the event giving rise to the claim occurs.

TDK agrees to provide or cause to be provided any required notice under the WARN Act, and any similar statute, and otherwise to comply with such statute with respect to terminations, layoffs or similar events affecting the employees of TEC that occur prior to Closing; _provided_ , that Imation and the Acquiring Entities shall not effect, or attempt to effect, on the Closing Date any terminations, layoffs or similar events that could give rise to liabilities or obligations under the WARN Act or similar statute. With respect to any terminations, layoffs or similar events occurring after the Closing Date, Imation and its Affiliates shall have sole responsibility for providing any required notice under, and otherwise complying with, the WARN Act and any similar statute. 

  

 7.11 _Disclaimer_. Nothing herein shall be construed as a representation or guarantee by TDK that Business Employees will accept the offer of employment from any Acquiring Entities or will continue in employment with Imation or any Affiliate of Imation following the Closing.

   #####

extent Taxes are allocable to such Pre-Closing Period or Interim Period in
accordance with Section 10.2(e); 

   

 (ix) any claims arising out product failures, in speakers sold by TDK prior to Closing, under the "TAPEX" brand resulting from the same root cause as the failures which which caused TDK to initiate a voluntary recall of such products prior to the date hereof; and 

   

 (x) any claims with respect to the sale or purported sale by TME of the real property known as TDK House, located at Redhill, Surrey, England. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, TDK shall not be obligated under Section 10.2(a) above to indemnify as to the matters set forth in clause (i) above, and shall not have any Liability with respect to such matters: 

   

 (i) unless the aggregate of all Imation Losses exceeds on a cumulative basis $2,500,000 (the " _Basket Amount_ "), in which case Imation shall be entitled to recover the Imation Losses only to the extent of such excess; 

   

 (ii) to the extent that the aggregate of all of the Imation Losses exceeds $35,000,000 (the " _Indemnification Cap_ "); or 

   

 (iii) for any individual item where the loss, liability, cost or expense relating thereto is less than $150,000 (the " _De Minimis Amount_ "), provided, that such items may be aggregated for purposes of clause (i); 

 

 _provided_ , that the foregoing limits shall not apply to any indemnification
obligation of TDK arising out of, relating to or resulting from any
inaccuracy of the representations and warranties in any of Sections 2.1, 2.2,
2.3(a) or 2.4 hereof, or related certificates. 

    

 (c) If Imation has a claim for indemnification under this Section 10.2, Imation shall deliver to TDK one or more written notices of Imation Losses (each, an " _Imation Claim Notice_ "), on or before the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date, except for Imation Losses arising from a breach or inaccuracy in the representations and warranties made in Sections 2.11, 2.17 or 2.20(b), or for any of the matters described Section 10.2(a)(v), for which Imation may deliver an Imation Claim Notice prior to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. TDK shall have no Liability under this Section 10.2 except with respect to indemnification claims described in an Imation Claim Notice provided in accordance with the terms hereof and within the applicable time limits specified in the preceding sentence. Any Imation Claim Notice shall (i) expressly state that it constitutes an Imation Claim Notice under this Section 10.2(c), (ii) describe in reasonable detail the basis for such Imation Losses and the nature of the Imation Losses for which indemnification is sought, (iii) state the amount of the Imation Losses claimed if then known to Imation, and (iv) set forth Imations calculation thereof in reasonable detail. If the amount of Imation Losses is not known at the time of the submission of the Imation Claim Notice, then Imation shall provide a good faith estimate based upon the facts then 

   ##### 

  

    

known and shall submit an amended Imation Claim Notice promptly after the
amount thereof has become known to Imation. If TDK notifies Imation in
writing, within twenty (20) Business Days after its receipt of any Imation
Claim Notice, that TDK agrees to make the indemnification payment requested
therein, (A) upon such acceptance, the parties shall be deemed to have
settled all claims arising out of the facts and circumstances giving rise to
the applicable Imation Claim Notice, and (B) TDK shall pay the agreed amount
to Imation within twenty (20) Business Days after such acceptance. If TDK
disputes any aspect of an Imation Claim Notice, including the amount
or calculation of the Imation Losses claimed therein, or has not notified
Imation in writing of its election to pay such amount within twenty (20)
Business Days after its receipt of any Imation Claim Notice, such claims
shall be deemed a "Dispute" under the Trademark License Agreement and shall
be subject to the dispute resolution provisions of Section 5.3 thereof. If an
Imation Claim Notice does not state the amount of the Imation Losses claimed
because such amount is not known at the time of submission of the Imation
Claim Notice, such omission shall not preclude Imation from recovering
from TDK the actual amount of the Imation Losses resulting from the specific
matters described in such Imation Claim Notice if any such amount is provided
in an amended Imation Claim Notice submitted promptly after the amount
thereof shall have become known to Imation in accordance with the terms
hereof. In order to assert its right to indemnification under this Article X,
Imation shall not be required to provide any notice except as provided in
this Section 10.2(c). 

   

 (d) TDK shall pay to Imation the amount of any Imation Losses indemnifiable hereunder twenty (20) Business Days following the determination of TDKs liability for and the amount of such Imation Losses (whether such determination is made by agreement between Imation and TDK or by final adjudication). 

   

 (e) For purposes of this Article X, the parties hereto will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, elect with the relevant taxing authorities to treat for all purposes the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period of any Acquired Entity, and such period shall be treated as a " _Short Period_ " and a " _Pre-Closing Period_ " for purposes of this Agreement. In any case where applicable Law does not permit an Acquired Entity to treat the Closing Date as the last day of a Short Period, then for purposes of this Agreement, the portion of such Taxes that is attributable to the operations of such Acquired Entity for such Interim Period (as defined below) shall be (i) in the case of Taxes that are not based on income or gross receipts, the total amount of such Taxes for the period in question multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Interim Period, and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the entire period in question, and (ii) in the case of Taxes that are based on income or gross receipts, the Taxes that would be due with respect to the Interim Period, if such Interim Period were a Short Period. " _Interim Period_ " means with respect to any Taxes imposed on such Acquired Entity on a periodic basis for which the Closing Date is not the last day of a Short Period, the period of time beginning on the first day of the actual taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date and ending on and including the Closing Date. 

   ##### 

  

  

 10.3 _Indemnification by Imation_. 

   

 (a) Imation shall pay, indemnify, reimburse and hold harmless TDK from and against any and all Losses to the extent incurred by TDK as a result of, arising from or with respect to any of the following (such indemnified Losses are referred to herein as " _TDK Losses_ "): 

   

 (i) subject to Section 10.1, any inaccuracy in any representation or warranty by Imation contained herein, either at the date of this Agreement or on the Closing Date as though then made and as though the Closing Date had been substituted for the date of this Agreement, or in any Ancillary Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto or thereto, taking into account, for purposes of this Section 10.3(a)(i), any supplemental disclosures after the date of this Agreement by Imation; 

   

 (ii) any breach by Imation of, or any failure of any of the Acquiring Entities to perform or comply with, any of its obligations under or pursuant to this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements (including any failure to offer employment to Business Employees as provided in Article VII, in which case any costs of defense incurred by TDK pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(iv) shall be included within the indemnified amounts hereunder, so that, for the avoidance of doubt, TDK will be responsible in the first instance for addressing such employee claim, but TDKs costs for doing so will be fully indemnified by and recoverable from Imation); 

   

 (iii) any claim or cause of action asserted by any Person against any of the Selling Entities arising before, on or after the Closing Date out of or with respect to (A) the operations of the Acquired Entities, the Acquired Assets or the Business after the Closing Date (including, without limitation, any termination by an Acquiring Entity of any Acquired Contract or by an Acquired Entity of any Contract, or breach by an Acquiring Entity or an Acquired Entity of any term or condition thereof) or (B) Imations election to accept the assignment or transfer of any Restricted Asset pursuant to Section 1.10(a)(ii), except in either case for any claims with respect to which TDK is obligated to indemnify Imation under Section 10.2(a) hereof; and 

   

 (iv) any Assumed Liability, including any Liabilities of any of the Acquired Entities not required to be assumed by one of the Selling Entities prior to Closing pursuant to Section 4.10; 

 

 _provided,_ that TDK Losses shall not include any diminution in the value of
the Imation Shares by reason of any Losses sustained solely by Imation
separate from, and in addition to, any Losses sustained directly by TDK. 

    

 (b) _Limits_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Imation shall not be obligated under Section 10.3(a) above to indemnify or hold harmless TDK as 

   ##### 

  

    

to matters set forth in clause (i) above, and shall not have any Liability
with respect to such matters: 

   

 (i) unless the aggregate of all TDK Losses exceeds the Basket Amount, in which case TDK shall be entitled to recover the TDK Losses only to the extent of such excess; 

   

 (ii) to the extent that the aggregate of all of the TDK Losses exceeds the Indemnification Cap; or 

   

 (iii) for any individual item where the loss, liability, cost or expense relating thereto is less than the De Minimis Amount (provided, that such items may be aggregated for purposes of clause (b)(i)); 

   

 _provided_ , that the foregoing limits shall not apply to any indemnification
obligation of Imation arising out of, relating to or resulting from any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in any of
Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3(a) and 3.5 hereof, or related certificates. 

   

 (c) If TDK has a claim for indemnification under this Section 10.3 , TDK shall deliver to Imation one or more written notices of TDK Losses (each a " _TDK Claim Notice_ ") on or before the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date. Imation shall have no liability under this Section 10.3 except with respect to indemnification claims described in a TDK Claim Notice provided in accordance with the terms hereof and within the applicable time limits specified in the preceding sentence. Any TDK Claim Notice shall (i) expressly state that it constitutes a TDK Claim Notice under this Section 10.3(c), (ii) describe in reasonable detail the basis for such TDK Losses and the nature of the TDK Losses for which indemnification is sought, (iii) state the amount of the TDK Losses claimed if then known to TDK, and (iv) set forth TDKs calculation thereof in reasonable detail. If the amount of TDK Losses is not known at the time of the submission of the TDK Claim Notice, then TDK shall provide a good faith estimate based upon the facts then known and shall submit an amended TDK Claim Notice promptly after the amount thereof has become known to TDK. If Imation notifies TDK in writing, within twenty (20) Business Days after its receipt of any TDK Claim Notice, that Imation agrees to make the indemnification payment requested therein, (A) upon such acceptance, the parties shall be deemed to have settled all claims arising out of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the applicable TDK Claim Notice, and (B) Imation shall pay the agreed amount to TDK within twenty (20) Business Days after such acceptance. If Imation disputes any aspect of a TDK Claim Notice, including the amount or calculation of the TDK Losses claimed therein, or has not notified TDK in writing of its election to pay such amount within twenty (20) Business Days after its receipt of any TDK Claim Notice, such claims shall be deemed a "Dispute" under the Trademark License Agreement and shall be subject to the dispute resolution provisions of Section 5.3 thereof. If a TDK Claim Notice does not state the amount of the TDK Losses claimed because such amount is not known at the time of submission of the TDK Claim Notice, such omission shall not preclude TDK from recovering from Imation the 

   ##### 

  

    

actual amount of the TDK Losses resulting from the specific matters described
in such TDK Claim Notice if any such amount is provided in an amended TDK
Claim Notice submitted promptly after the amount thereof shall have become
known to TDK in accordance with the terms hereof. In order to assert its
right to indemnification under this Article X, TDK shall not be required to
provide any notice except as provided in this Section 10.3(c). 

   

 (d) Imation shall pay the amount of any TDK Losses to TDK within twenty (20) Business Days following the determination of Imations liability for and the amount of TDK Losses (whether such determination is made pursuant to the procedures set forth in this Section 10.3, by agreement between TDK and Imation or by final adjudication). 

  

 10.4 _Third-Party Action_. 

   

 (a) If any third party shall notify a party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") with respect to any matter which may give rise to a claim for indemnification against the other party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") under this Section 10.4 for Losses of the Indemnified Party arising from, relating to or constituting any Litigation instituted by any third party (any such third party action or proceeding being referred to as a " _Third-Party Action_ "), the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt written notice of the commencement of such Third-Party Action. The complaint or other papers pursuant to which the third party commenced such Third-Party Action shall be attached to such written notice. The failure to give prompt written notice shall not affect an Indemnified Partys right to indemnification unless such failure has materially and adversely affected the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend such Third-Party Action. 

   

 (b) The Indemnifying Party may participate in, and, to the extent the Indemnifying Party desires, at any time assume the defense of, such Third-Party Action with reputable attorneys retained by the Indemnifying Party and at the Indemnifying Partys expense. Upon and after notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such Third-Party Action, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party under this Article X for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall be entitled at any time, at its own cost and expense, to participate in the Indemnifying Partys conduct of such defense and to be represented by attorneys of its own choosing. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the Indemnifying Partys conduct of such defense to the extent reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party in the contest and defense of such Third-Party Action, including but not limited to providing reasonable access (upon reasonable notice) to the books, records and employees of the Indemnified Party if relevant to the defense of such Third-Party Action; provided, that such cooperation shall not unduly disrupt the operations of the business of the Indemnified Party or cause the Indemnified Party to waive any statutory or common law privileges, breach any confidentiality 

   ##### 

  

    

obligations owed to third parties or otherwise cause any confidential
information of the Indemnified Party to become public. 

   

 (c) If the Indemnifying Party does not elect to assume the defense of any Third-Party Action, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to conduct its own defense and to be represented by attorneys of its own choosing. For the avoidance of doubt, the costs and expenses of such defense shall be included in Losses indemnifiable in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this Article X. 

   

 (d) Neither the Indemnified Party nor the Indemnifying Party may concede, settle or compromise any Third-Party Action without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

  

 10.5 _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Each party hereto agrees that, with the exception of the equitable remedies provided for in Sections 4.14(b) and 4.16(c), its sole and exclusive remedy in respect of a breach by the other party of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation of such party hereunder, or in any certificate provided in accordance herewith, or with respect to any breach by the other party of any representation or warranty provided in any Ancillary Agreement, shall be the right to obtain indemnification as provided in this Article X, and all other rights and remedies in respect of such a breach or breaches (excluding any act or omission that constitutes fraud by either of the parties hereto) are hereby expressly forever waived and released. Each party hereto covenants not to institute any litigation or other proceeding with respect to any rights and remedies waived by such party under this Section 10.5.

 10.6 _Limitations on Indemnification_. The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this Article X shall be net of any amounts actually recovered or recoverable by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies with respect to such Loss and shall be (i) increased to take account of any net Tax cost incurred by the Indemnified Party arising from the receipt of indemnity payments hereunder (grossed up for such increase) and (ii) reduced to take account of (A) any net Tax benefit realized by the Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Loss, and (B) the extent to which any Losses recoverable pursuant to this Article X have been taken into account in the determination of the Closing Date Working Capital Amount (pursuant to Section 1.7) for purposes of calculating any adjustment to the Purchase Price. In computing the amount of any such Tax cost or Tax benefit, the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising from the receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder or the incurrence or payment of any indemnified Loss. Any indemnity payment hereunder shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price and the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to the relevant Acquired Asset for Tax purposes; _provided, however_ , that where, as a result of a final determination (which shall include the execution of a Form 870-AD or successor form) with respect to the Indemnified Party or any of its affiliates, an indemnity payment hereunder is treated as other than an adjustment to the Purchase Price, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to receive an additional indemnity payment in an amount equal to the excess of the indemnity payment that the Indemnified Party would have been entitled to receive if the indemnity payment had been 

   ##### 

  

    

treated for Tax purposes in the manner required by the final determination
over the indemnity payment actually received by such Indemnified Party as a

relevant Acquired Asset.

CERTIFICATE OF NON-FOREIGN STATUS 

   

 1\. Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code provides that a transferee of a U.S. real property interest must withhold tax if the transferor is a foreign person. For U.S. tax purposes (including Section 1445), the owner of a disregarded entity (which has legal title to a U.S. real property interest under local law) will be the transferor of the property and not the disregarded entity. To inform the transferee that withholding of tax is not required upon the disposition of a U.S. real property interest by TDK Electronics Corporation (" _TEC_ "), the undersigned hereby certifies under penalties of perjury the following on behalf of TEC; 

   

 a. TEC is not a foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust, or foreign estate (as those terms are defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the Treasury Regulations thereunder) or a nonresident alien for U.S. income tax purposes; 

  

 b. TEC is not a disregarded entity as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iii); 

  

 c. TEC U.S. employer identification number is __[ EIN of TEC] __ ; and 

  

 d. TECs office address is 901 Franklin Avenue, PO Box 9302, Garden City, New York, 11530-9302. 

  

 2\. TEC understands that this Certification may be disclosed to the Internal Revenue Service by the transferee and hereby consents to such disclosure, and TEC understands that any false statement contained herein could be punished by fine, imprisonment, or both. 

   

 3\. Under penalties of perjury I declare that I have examined this Certification and to the best of my knowledge and belief it is true, correct, and complete, and I further declare that I have authority to sign this Document on behalf of TEC.

 (a) Licensor shall provide a Link from a Licensor Site only to the extent that such site refers to Licensed Products as of the Effective Date (other than <tdk.de>, as to which no forward commitment is made, even if it refers to Licensed Products as of the Effective Date) and only for so long as Licensor elects in its discretion to maintain such Licensor Site. If the Licensor no longer maintains a Licensor Site, but is permitted by applicable law to own and control the URL associated with the discontinued site, Licensor shall redirect traffic to that URL to the notice page (described in subsection (c) below) and then to the Product Site, 

   

 (b) If Licensor displays any graphics or photographs next to Links to third party sites or to other locations within the Licensor site on the initial, top level URL display for a Licensor Site, then Licensor shall include a graphic or photograph next to the Link for to the Product Site. Licensee shall supply the graphic or photograph for the Link provided that Licensor shall have the right to reasonably approval any such graphic or photograph. 

   

 (c) The Link from the Licensor Sites (that are active websites) shall first redirect users to a notice page (identified by <www.tdk.co.jp/notice.html> and maintained and controlled by Licensor) that will notify users that they are being redirected using the following message: "You are being redirected to [Product Site]." The notice page shall redirect users to the website designated by the URL, <**> or to another site as mutually agreed by the parties (collectively, "Product Site"). The home page and each page of the Product Site that contains other legal notices shall contain the following statement: "The TDK [**] Logo is used under a trademark license from [Licensor.]" Each page of the site shall either identify Licensee or display Licensees standard copyright notice in Licensees name.

shall promptly notify Licensor in writing when it ceases to maintain a
Product Site and Licensor shall have the right to immediately terminate
Licensees license to use the corresponding URL at that time. 

   

 (e) Each Product Site shall be deemed to be "Promotional Material" for all purposes hereof, and shall be subject to the terms and conditions applicable to Promotional Material under this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Licensee shall (i) not display or use a Link in a manner that causes either the Licensor or a Product Site or any portion of its content to be associated with any advertising or sponsorship not part of such Sites; (ii) not display or use a Link in a manner that could cause confusion, mistake, or deception; (iii) display disclaimers on the Product Site pursuant to the Quality Guidelines; and (iv) maintain and enforce terms of use and other policies applicable to the Product Site that are commercially reasonable. 

   

 (f) At Licensors reasonable request, the Strategic Relationship Committee shall meet and consider in good faith what action, if any, should be taken (including modifications to the Product Site) in light of the frequency and history of any third party claims against Licensor or any of its Affiliates where a basis, in whole or in part, for involving Licensor relates in any way to the Product Site or any other Promotional Material. 

   

 2.3 Patent License. Licensor hereby grants to Licensee a royalty-free, non-transferable, nonsublicenseable (except as set forth in Section 2.4) non-exclusive license (not including manufacturing or have made rights) in the Territory under any patents of Licensor or its Affiliates that, as of the Effective Date, Licensor has the right to grant licenses without payments to third parties, for the marketing, distribution, or sales of Current Magnetic Tape Products and Current Optical Media Products which, in both cases, Licensor or Licensee has commercialized as of the Effective Date, provided that if Licensee or any of its Affiliates asserts a patent against Licensor or any of its Affiliates, the license shall terminate and further provided that Licensee and its Affiliates shall not sue Licensor or any of its Affiliates for damages arising before termination of the license. If the patent license terminates under this Agreement, it shall automatically terminate under the Ireland Agreement. 

  

 2.4 Sublicenses to Qualified Entities. Licensee shall have the right to grant sublicenses of its rights under _Sections 2.1, 2.2(c)(i) and (ii), and 2.3_ only to Qualified Entities, provided that Licensee shall only have the right to grant, at any point in time during the term of this Agreement, a single sublicense under Section 2.2(c)(i) to a wholly-owned Qualified Entity solely as necessary to allow such Qualified Entity to operate the Product Site on Licensees behalf and at Licensees direction. Prior to, and as a condition to the effectiveness of, any sublicense to a Qualified Entity pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Qualified Entity shall enter into an agreement that contains, at a minimum, the provisions in the form of attached _Exhibit G_ (a "Sublicense Agreement"), whereby the Qualified Entity (a) acknowledges receipt of a copy of this Agreement, (b) agrees to act in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (c) expressly confirms that Licensor is an intended third party beneficiary thereof. Licensee will promptly notify Licensor of the execution of each Sublicense Agreement,

and provide Licensor with a copy of such executed Sublicense Agreement. When
an entity ceases to be a Qualified Entity, the sublicense rights to that
entity shall immediately and automatically terminate without the further act
of any party. 

  

 2.5 Restrictions. As an express condition to, and in material consideration for, the licenses granted to Licensee hereunder, Licensee expressly agrees to the following restrictions as to its use of the Licensed Trademarks: 

  

 (a) Licensee shall not do anything inconsistent with Licensors ownership of the Licensed Trademarks. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Licensee shall not challenge the validity of any Licensed Trademark, Licensors ownership thereof, or the enforceability of Licensors rights therein. 

   

 (b) Licensee shall not use, reproduce or display (or authorize the use, reproduction or display of) the Licensed Trademarks in any manner whatsoever other than as expressly authorized by this Agreement. 

   

 (c) During the term and after any termination of this Agreement, Licensee shall not use any service mark, service name, trade name, trademark, design or logo that is confusingly similar to any Licensed Trademark or any element thereof, including any mark, word or design that incorporates the word "TDK" or the TDK diamond logo, or any mark, word, logo or design confusingly similar thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the term and after any termination of this Agreement, Licensee shall not use the word "TDK" or the TDK diamond logo in any corporate name or in any domain name, other than as permitted in Section 2.2. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that an element of a Licensed Trademark (but in no event a TDK Mark) is expressly disclaimed in a trademark registration (such as "mobile" in TDK MOBILE), Licensee shall not be prohibited from using such element in its own Trademarks by the terms hereof. 

   

 (d) Licensee shall not use any of the Licensed Trademarks together, or use any Licensed Trademark in combination with any other trademark, service mark, trade name, trading style, fictitious business name, name, character, symbol, design, likeness or literary or artistic material in a manner that create a unitary or combination Trademark without the prior written consent of Licensor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensee may use (i) any Licensed Trademarks together if Licensor has a general practice of using such Licensed Trademarks together and (ii) any Trademarks assigned to Licensee by Licensor pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement with the Licensed Trademarks, but not in a manner that might create a unitary or combination Trademark. 

   

 (e) For a period that runs for one (1) year prior to the expiration of the separate licenses for the Speaker Products and Headphone Products and for each RRM Product approved pursuant to  _Article IV_, and for a period that runs for one (1) year prior to the termination of the Agreement for the Core Products and Accessory Products, Licensee may Display one or more Licensee Trademarks on or in connection with the Licensed Products as part of a transition plan (which, at a minimum, includes provisions regarding how the Trademarks will be used together) mutually agreed by the parties, in advance of the applicable transition period, provided that such Display shall not create a unitary Trademark. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (f) Licensee shall not register any Licensed Trademark, and Licensor shall retain the exclusive right to apply for and obtain registrations for each Licensed Trademark throughout the Territory (although Licensee may request registrations, and make registrations in Licensors name, under certain circumstances, as set forth in _Section 2.7_). Licensee shall not register any domain name containing the word [TDK]. 

   

 (g) Licensee shall not assert any adverse claim against Licensor based upon Licensors use of any Licensed Trademark (other than a claim for breach of contract based on the exclusivity provisions of this Agreement or the non-competition provisions of the Acquisition Agreement). 

   

 2.6 Notice. In connection with the use of the Licensed Trademarks on packaging or Promotional Material for the Licensed Products, Licensee shall include a trademark notice in a form reading: "The [TDK [**] Logo] is a trademark of [Licensor]," except that Licensee may use the typed words "TDK Logo" instead of the actual logo where the notice would be too small to show the actual logo clearly or where the notice is embedded within other text. Further, with respect to any Licensed Product other than Core Products or Accessory Products, Licensee shall indicate when using a Licensed Trademark on packaging or Promotional Material for such product that "The [TDK [**] Logo] is used under a trademark license from [Licensor]," subject to the same exception as the previous sentence. Subject to _Section 2.2_, if a Licensed Trademark is used multiple times on or in packaging or Promotional Material, the notice and statement regarding licensed use need only be used for the first prominent use of the Licensed Trademark on or in such packaging or Promotional Material. 

  

 2.7 Filing, Maintenance, and Renewal. 

  

 (a) _Licensee Cooperation_ : Licensee agrees to reasonably cooperate with Licensors preparation and filing of any applications, renewals or other documentation necessary or useful to protect Licensors intellectual property rights in the Licensed Trademarks in the Territory. 

   

 (b) _Licensor Filing and Maintenance_ : Licensor shall have the primary right to determine whether to file or maintain registrations for any Licensed Trademarks. Licensor will give Licensee reasonable notice of its intention to abandon or otherwise fail to maintain or prosecute any registered Licensed Trademarks or application therefor in any country or class applicable to a Licensed Product in the Territory and allow Licensee an opportunity to prosecute or otherwise maintain such registrations for Licensed Trademarks for Licensed Products at Licensees expense, but in Licensors name. Licensee may request that Licensor file or maintain registrations for a Licensed Trademark for a country or class applicable to a Licensed Product in the Territory, and Licensor shall either take such action at Licensees expense or, if Licensor does not wish to do so, permit Licensee to do so, at Licensees expense, but in Licensors name. To the extent that Licensor elects to file or maintain registrations for Licensed Trademarks that cover both Licensed Products and Licensor Products, Licensor shall take such action at Licensors expense. If Licensor elects not to file or maintain registrations for Licensed Trademarks that cover both Licensed Products and Licensor Products, Licensee shall be under no obligation to file or maintain the registrations for the Licensor Products.

     ##### 

  

     

 (c) _Licensor Obligations If Licensee Pays_ : To the extent that Licensor is directing the prosecution and maintenance of Licensed Trademarks but Licensee is paying the costs, Licensor either directly or through its counsel shall furnish Licensee with copies of all filings made or received in connection with such Licensed Trademarks, provided that Licensor shall consult with Licensee about and send to Licensee for approval in advance of filing any responses to substantive office actions and Licensee shall not unreasonably withhold or delay such approval. Licensor shall also arrange for all invoices related to such prosecution and maintenance to be sent directly to Licensee for payment and Licensee shall have the right in good faith to dispute such invoices and to require Licensor to pay the disputed invoice if the dispute cannot be resolved to Licensees reasonable satisfaction, but in any such case Licensor shall not be required to take further steps as to the application or other matters at issue pending the satisfactory resolution of such dispute unless necessary to prevent the application or registration from lapsing. 

   

 (d) _Licensor Obligations If Licensee Handles and Pays_ : To the extent that Licensee is filing or maintaining registrations for any Licensed Trademarks in Licensors name, Licensor agrees to reasonably cooperate with Licensees preparation and filing of any applications, renewals or other documentation necessary to protect Licensors intellectual property rights in the Licensed Trademarks and Licensee may hire counsel of Licensees own choosing. 

   

 (e) _License Recordals_ : Should local counsel of either Party reasonably recommend that Licensee be appointed as a licensee of Licensor for the Licensed Trademarks in the Territory and (i) Licensor reasonably determines that such license should be recorded with the appropriate trademark or customs office as reasonably necessary to protect Licensors rights in the Licensed Trademarks, then Licensor at its expense shall prepare and file the necessary documents subject to Licensees approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed or (ii) if Licensee reasonably determines that such license should be recorded with the appropriate trademark or customs office as reasonably necessary to protect Licensees ability to enforce its rights in the applicable Territory, Licensee at its expense shall prepare and file the necessary documents subject to Licensors approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Licensee agrees to sign any documents reasonably necessary for Licensor to cause any recordals to be terminated as to any Licensed Products upon the expiration or termination of the license applicable to such product hereunder. 

   

 2.8 Enforcement and Defense of Infringement Claims. 

  

 (a) _Notification_ : The parties shall reasonably cooperate in providing notice to each other in writing (a "Notice of Alleged Infringement") if a Party becomes aware of any use of a Licensed Trademark, or element thereof, or of any Trademark on a Licensed Product, which may be confusingly similar to any Licensed Trademark, or element thereof, by any Person in the Territory. 

   

 (b) _Action by Licensor to Enforce_ : Licensor shall have the primary right, but not the obligation, to determine whether to institute and/or pursue any proceedings to enforce any rights in the Licensed Trademarks, as well as the right to select counsel. Licensee shall cooperate with Licensor in any such suit, including granting Licensor the right to bring suit in   ##### 

  

  

  

Licensees name with respect to such infringement (and execute any documents
necessary to effectuate the same) if necessary under the applicable rules of
civil procedure to effect standing, and Licensee shall be reimbursed for
reasonably incurred expenses. Licensor will be solely responsible for the
costs of such action and will retain all recoveries and awards necessary
to reimburse Licensor for any costs and expenses and, for any recoveries and
awards in excess, shall share equally any recoveries and awards with Licensee
to the extent such recoveries and awards are related to Licensed Products.
Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, in no event shall
Licensee be required to satisfy or comply with any settlement or other
agreement concerning its use of the Licensed Trademarks to which Licensee has
not consented (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

   

 (c) _Action by Licensee to Enforce_ : If applicable law in any jurisdiction in the Territory requires that Licensee enforce rights in the Licensed Trademarks against alleged infringers, or Licensor declines in writing to enforce its rights in the Licensed Trademarks with respect to the alleged confusingly similar use set forth in the Notice of Alleged Infringement, Licensee shall have a right, but not an obligation, to enforce such rights with respect to Licensed Products subject to any direction that Licensor may provide. Licensor shall cooperate with Licensee in any such suit, including granting Licensee the right to bring suit in Licensors name or granting a limited license to a TDK Mark (solely as necessary for the specific enforcement purpose) (and execute any documents necessary to effectuate the same) if necessary under the applicable rules of civil procedure to effect standing, and Licensor shall be reimbursed for reasonably incurred expenses. Licensee will be solely responsible for the costs of such action and will retain all recoveries and awards necessary to reimburse Licensee for any costs and expenses and, for any recoveries and awards in excess, shall share equally any recoveries and awards with Licensor. 

   

 (d) _Defense of Third Party Claims_ : Licensor shall have the sole right to defend the Licensed Trademarks against imitation, infringement or any claim of prior use. Licensee shall cooperate fully with Licensor, at Licensors reasonable request and expense, in connection with the defense of any such claim in the Territory. 

   

 (e) _Updates and Consultation_ : With respect to any enforcement actions taken pursuant to this Section, the party handling such enforcement action shall provide periodic updates to and request consultation from the parties not handling the action and each party not handling the action may hire its own counsel at its expense. 

   

 2.9 Reservation of Rights. Licensee acknowledges that, between the parties, Licensor is the sole owner of all right, title and interest in and to the Licensed Trademarks, and that Licensee has neither acquired, nor shall acquire, any right, title or interest in or to the Licensed Trademarks except the limited exclusive rights to use such Licensed Trademarks expressly granted to Licensee under this Agreement. Licensor shall retain all goodwill associated with the Licensed Trademarks. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Licensor from marketing, distributing or selling any products on an OEM basis, provided such products do not bear any Licensed Trademark or any confusingly similar variation thereof. 

   ##### 

  

  

 2.10 Removing Licensed Trademarks from License. At any time during the term of this Agreement, if Licensor reasonably determines that use of a Licensed Trademark hereunder in the Territory could infringe any intellectual property rights of any third party (not derived from Licensor), then Licensor shall notify Licensee. If such potential infringement _could_ reasonably be expected to limit Licensors ability to Display a Licensed Trademark on Licensor Products, then Licensor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such potential infringement claim with respect to both Licensor and Licensee. If such potential infringement could _not_ reasonably be expected to limit Licensors ability to Display a Licensed Trademark on Licensor Products (but could reasonably be expected to limit Licensees ability to Display a Licensed Trademark on Licensed Product(s)), then Licensor shall notify Licensee of such potential infringement claim and Licensee shall have the ability, but not the obligation, to seek to resolve such claim at its own expense provided that Licensee shall provide Licensor with periodic updates and ability for consultation. If the potential infringement claim is not resolved within a reasonable time period taking into account any settlement efforts, then upon written notice to Licensee, Licensor shall have the right to remove any particular Licensed Trademark from the scope of the license granted under this Agreement, upon written notice to Licensee. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section shall not apply to infringements based on facts that existed prior to the Effective Date. 

  

 2.11 Requests by License. 

  

 (a) If Licensee wishes to create any variations of existing Licensed Trademarks or new Trademarks that include any TDK Mark, then Licensee must seek Licensors written approval, which may be refused in Licensors sole discretion, and any such Trademarks approved by Licensor shall be deemed added to the list of Licensed Trademarks in _Exhibit B_ and shall be subject to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 

   

 (b) If Licensee wishes to use the Licensed Trademarks in connection with a co-branding program, Licensee shall first seek Licensors written approval, which may be granted or refused in Licensors sole discretion. Licensee shall present such plan (in reasonable detail) in writing to the Licensor Relationship Manager (as defined in Section 5.1). 

   

 2.12 Additional Commitments of Licensee. Licensee agrees to cause each Licensed Entity, to comply with all of its respective obligations under this Agreement, and any other agreement executed in connection herewith (including the applicable Sublicense Agreement), and agrees that it shall be directly liable for any act of any Licensed Entity in breach of any such obligation, including, for the avoidance of doubt any act by a Licensed Entity that, in either case, would be a breach of this Agreement if committed by Licensee. Licensor may pursue claims for any such breach against Licensee, in accordance with the terms hereof, regardless of whether such breach was committed by Licensee, or another party, and regardless of whether Licensor chooses to include any other party in the dispute resolution process applicable to the claim. In the event of any claim by Licensor, Licensee expressly waives any defense based on the absence of or failure to join any other party in the dispute resolution process or any other aspect of the claim. 

  

 2.13 Ireland Agreement. Licensor represents and warrants that Imation Ireland is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Licensee, and agrees that, at all times during the term of this 

   ##### 

  

    

Agreement, Licensee shall maintain Imation Ireland as a Qualified Entity. If
Imation Ireland ceases to be a Qualified Entity, the license rights of that
entity under the Ireland Agreement shall immediately and automatically
terminate without the further act of any party. 

  

ARTICLE III 

   

QUALITY CONTROL  

  

 As an express condition to, and in material consideration for, the licenses granted to Licensee hereunder, Licensee expressly agrees to the following restrictions as to its use of the Licensed Trademarks: 

  

 3.1 Trademark Guidelines. Licensee shall not use, reproduce or display any Licensed Trademark in any manner whatsoever other than as expressly authorized in the quality control guidelines for the Licensed Trademarks ("Quality Guidelines"), including guidelines regarding how each Licensed Trademark is used, presented and displayed ("Display"). The Quality Guidelines shall consist of two elements: guidelines related to Display (such guidelines shall be contained in a "Logo Manual") and guidelines regarding the nature and quality of products and services associated with the Licensed Trademark (such guidelines shall be contained in a "Quality Manual"). The initial Quality Guidelines are attached as _Exhibit H_. Licensee shall promptly cure any breach of the Quality Guidelines upon notice from Licensor, provided that Licensee shall have a reasonable time to comply with Updates (as defined below), including a reasonable amount of time to exhaust existing inventories of Promotional Material, packaging, and Licensed Product, except that Licensee shall not have rights to exhaust existing inventories if such inventories are in material noncompliance with the previous Quality Guidelines or if the existing Licensed Products (or use or distribution thereof) would violate any applicable law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 3.1_, if Licensee purchases products covered by the Supply Agreement from third parties as permitted under the terms of the Supply Agreement, Licensee shall not be in breach of provisions of the Quality Manual to the extent that such Quality Manual refers to standards or specifications that are not performance or quality-related specifications (e.g., the use of Licensor dye #25 in describing a color or other requirements for the product not tied to the performance of the product), provided that Licensee shall comply with the Logo Manual. Licensor may reasonably update such Quality Guidelines ("Updates") from time to time to reflect, among other things, changes in the use, presentation and display of the Licensed Trademarks, and the highest applicable industry standards, subject to the following: 

  

 (a) _Updates Relating to Guidelines Other Than Display:_ With respect to Updates relating to the nature and quality of products or services (e.g., performance requirements, defect rates, etc.) (and not, for purposes of clarification, Display), Licensor shall provide Licensee with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Updates. If the parties are unable to agree on such updates, Licensor shall be permitted to finalize the Updates subject to the following: 

   

 (i) with respect to Updates specifically applicable to Licensed Products, such Updates shall be consistent with the applicable, approved plans and quality requirements for such product; and 

   ##### 

  

  

 (ii) with respect to other Updates, such Updates shall be consistent with principles reflected in the most recent, applicable set of Quality Guidelines, best practices in the industry, standards that Licensor applies to itself, its affiliates, and other licensees similarly situated with Licensee, to the extent any such entities are selling similar products under the Licensed Trademarks, and other principles on which the parties may agree from time to time; and 

  

 (b) _Updates Related to Display Guidelines_ : With respect to Updates relating to Display, any such Updates shall be consistent with the guidelines for the relevant use, presentation and display that Licensor applies to itself, its affiliates, and other licensees similarly situated with Licensee, under like circumstances, provided that Licensee shall not be required to implement any Updates to the requirements relating to the shape, color or dimension of a TDK Mark for the Licensed Products and their packaging and Promotional Material if Licensee believes in good faith that such changes will be detrimental to its Licensed Product sales. 

   

 3.2 Conduct of Business. Each of the parties shall use the Licensed Trademarks in a manner that does not derogate Licensors rights in the Licensed Trademarks or the value of the Licensed Trademarks, and shall take no action that would interfere with, diminish or tarnish those rights or value. 

  

 3.3 Cooperation. Licensee shall cooperate fully with Licensor in enabling Licensor to ascertain that the Licensed Products meet Licensors quality standards. Such cooperation shall include, upon request, providing Licensor promptly with data regarding communications from third parties regarding the quality of specific Licensed Products, providing Licensor with names and addresses of vendors and suppliers producing Licensed Products or components thereof to be sold under a Licensed Trademark, and providing Licensor with access to product packaging and distribution facilities for such products for reasonable inspection by Licensor. 

  

 3.4 Cessation of Licensed Product Sales; Recall. Licensor shall have the right to request that Licensee immediately cease selling a Licensed Product, or revise or cease use of any or all Promotional Material, and Licensee shall promptly comply, upon written notice to Licensee if the condition of such Licensed Product or Promotional Material could reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect Licensors business or reputation. For the avoidance of doubt, if there is a reasonable basis for believing that a product poses a danger to person or property, such product shall be considered a product that could be reasonably expected to materially and adversely affect Licensors business or reputation. Further, Licensor shall have the right to request a product recall if there is a reasonable basis for believing that the product or category of products poses a danger to person or property, and Licensee shall promptly comply upon written notice of such request. If Licensee wishes to resume sale of a product, Licensor shall have the right to approve such resumption. 

  

 3.5 Samples. Licensee shall submit to Licensor upon reasonable request, specimens of uses of the Licensed Trademarks, including: (a) representative products that will bear any Licensed Trademark or be marketed, promoted, advertised, distributed or sold using any Licensed Trademark; and (b) samples of all Promotional Material. If, after review of such materials or samples, Licensor is concerned about compliance with any aspect of this Agreement, Licensee shall provide such additional materials and samples as Licensor may 

   ##### 

  

    

reasonably request. If Licensor discovers any improper use of the Licensed
Trademarks in any such submission, Licensee shall remedy the improper use
immediately upon written notice. 

  

 3.6 Inspections. In addition to _Section 3.3_, Licensee shall cooperate with Licensor to ensure that quality standards applicable to Licensed Products are met by permitting Licensor to inspect only those manufacturing and other facilities directly related to the manufacture of Licensed Products, upon reasonable notice and no more than once a year, and only in a manner that will not unreasonably interfere with Licensees business activities, provided that Licensee shall arrange for and accompany Licensor on any inspections to third-party facilities. 

  

 3.7 Standards Compliance. If Licensee publicly states that any Licensed Product is compliant with any applicable industry standard, Licensee shall ensure that such Licensed Product is fully compliant with all mandatory requirements of such standard, except for compliance with such applicable industry standards for which Licensor is responsible under the Supply Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, any use of a logo or trademark associated with an industry standard (e.g., the logo "DVD" or "Blu-ray") shall be deemed a public statement that the Licensed Product is compliant with the applicable industry standard. 

  

ARTICLE IV 

   

REVIEW PROCESS  

  

 4.1 Informal review. When plans for an RRM Product are reasonably definite, Licensee may, in its discretion, provide Licensor with such information as is reasonably available regarding the products functional, performance and other technical specifications, the target market, and marketing and branding plans through the Strategic Relationship Committee or otherwise as the parties may agree. If Licensor has any concerns about such product (or the related plans) Licensor shall have the opportunity to meet with the appropriate product management personnel of Licensee. Licensee shall have no obligations to make any changes to the product plans to respond to Licensors comments. Licensor shall have no obligation to provide any comments until Licensee formally requests that Licensor approve the product as a Licensed Product as set forth in  _Section 4.2_ below. 

  

 4.2 Formal review. During the first ten (10) years after the Effective Date, Licensee may request that an RRM Product, commercialized by or to be commercialized by Licensee or its Affiliates prior to the end of such period, be included as a Licensed Product under this Agreement. For purposes of clarification, Licensee need not make such request for enhancements to existing Licensed Products that implement changes in speed and capacity. To request that an RRM Product be included as a Licensed Product, Licensee shall provide Licensor with (a) detailed functional, performance and other technical specifications of the product, (b) a sample of the product, (c) information on quality control (including target defect rates, performance data, etc.), environmental impact, health and human safety and intellectual property, (d) data comparing the new product to competing products in the market, if any, including with respect to quality and performance, and (e) sales and marketing plans describing, among other things, the target market, the proposed branding strategy, specifying how the brand will be used in a manner compatible (or not inconsistent) with Licensors written branding goals/policies (and if Licensee will sell the products under other brands as well, how Licensed Trademark-branded 

   ##### 

  

    

products will be positioned relative to these other brands in terms of product
performance and other key features). 

  

 4.3 Review process. Licensor shall have sixty (60) days to provide comments on, approve or disapprove the request, provided that such period shall not begin to run unless the materials are reasonably complete. Licensor shall have the right to request additional information within this period or to notify Licensee that it needs additional time (not to exceed thirty (30) days) to complete its review. Licensee shall provide additional information reasonably requested by Licensor and shall meet with Licensor representatives as reasonably requested. Licensor shall approve the product unless it has a Commercial Reason to disapprove the request. 

  

ARTICLE V 

   

GOVERNANCE  

  

 5.1 Relationship Managers. Each of Licensee and Licensor shall appoint a relationship manager who shall serve as its primary point of contact for the other in all matters relating to this Agreement (a "Relationship Manager"). The Relationship Managers shall participate in regular meetings to review the parties performance hereunder, to review the product roadmaps of Licensee and other Licensed Entities for Licensed Products, to resolve any issues arising out of the rights granted to, and obligations undertaken by, the parties hereunder, including any issues relating to Quality Guidelines, and to otherwise manage the parties relationship under this Agreement. 

  

 5.2 Strategic Relationship Committee. Each of Licensee and Licensor shall appoint at least two senior executives to a joint strategic relationship committee (a "Strategic Relationship Committee"). The Strategic Relationship Committee shall meet at least twice a year, either in person or remotely. Among other things, as mutually agreed by the parties, the Strategic Relationship Committee shall be responsible for resolving disputes on an informal basis as set forth in _Section 5.3_. 

  

 5.3 Dispute Resolution. If a significant dispute under this Agreement, including as to a Material Breach, arises that the Relationship Managers cannot resolve (a "Dispute"), and provided that each of Licensee and Licensor have the unrestricted right and ability to participate in the process described in this Section 5.3 (and to effect a cure or take other action to which the parties might agree) without approval of any third party, including but not limited to a trustee in bankruptcy or a receiver, then the Dispute shall be resolved as follows, in order, before instituting legal proceedings. 

  

 (a) _Strategic Relationship Committee_ : Either Licensee or Licensor shall first refer the Dispute to the Strategic Relationship Committee for resolution. A Dispute shall be deemed referred upon either such party providing the other party with written notice that it wishes to refer the Dispute to the Strategic Relationship Committee in accordance with _Section 10.9_. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) _Chief Executive Officers_ : If the Strategic Relationship Committee is unable to resolve the Dispute thirty (30) days after the Dispute is referred to the Strategic Relationship Committee, either Licensee or Licensor may refer the Dispute to the Chief Executive Officers of Licensee and Licensor for resolution. A Dispute shall be deemed referred upon either such party providing the other party with written notice that it wishes to refer the Dispute to the Chief Executive Officers in accordance with _Section 10.9_ within fifteen (15) days after the expiration of such thirty (30)-day period. If no such notice is provided, the dispute resolution process hereunder as to the Dispute in question will be deemed complete. 

   

 (c) _Nonbinding Mediation_ : If Licensee or Licensor elects to refer a Dispute to the parties Chief Executive Officers pursuant to _Section 5.3_, and the Chief Executive Officers are unable to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after such election, either Licensee or Licensor may elect to refer the Dispute to nonbinding mediation conducted in the English language in New York, New York, using a neutral mediator having experience with the data storage industry and trademark licenses, in accordance with the rules of the Center for Public Resources (with costs shared equally). A Dispute shall be deemed to be so referred upon either such party providing the other party with written notice that it wishes to refer the Dispute to mediation in accordance with  _Section 10.9_. If no such notice is provided, the dispute resolution process hereunder as to the Dispute in question will be deemed complete. If such notice is provided, both parties shall request that the mediation be completed as promptly as practical and shall cooperate in moving the mediation process promptly forward, but the mediation shall, in any event, be deemed completed sixty (60) days after the request to refer the Dispute to mediation. 

   

 (d) _Efforts to Cure_ : Each of Licensor and Licensee agrees to make (and in the case of Licensee, to cause any Licensed Entity to make) commercially reasonable efforts, during the pendency of the foregoing dispute resolution procedure, to cure the breach or otherwise address the business concerns identified by the other party, to the extent possible on commercially reasonable terms. 

   

 (e) _Timing Issues_ : Either of Licensee and Licensor may commence the foregoing process as to a dispute at any time, and need not wait for the passage of any notice or cure period specified in _Section 5.3_ or for the occurrence of all facts otherwise required to give rise to any contractual right as to the matter in Dispute, including a right to terminate. In no event shall a party be required to engage in the dispute resolution process set forth in this _Section 5.3_ , or be precluded from exercising its rights by reason thereof, for more than one hundred twenty (120) days (in total) from the partys first submission of a Dispute to the Strategic Relationship Committee under _Section 5.3_, without its written consent to an extension. No dispute or disagreement relating to the same essential facts and circumstances may be referred to the dispute resolution process under this _Section 5.3_ more than once. 

   

 (f) _Judicial Remedies_ : Nothing in this _Section 5.3_ shall preclude either of Licensee or Licensor from seeking interim judicial relief to prevent immediate, irreparable harm to its interests. In the event that the procedures set forth in this _Section 5.3_ shall have been completed without agreement being reached between the parties, either Licensee or Licensor shall be free to pursue any available judicial remedies pursuant to _Section 10.7_. 

    ##### 

  

     

 5.4 Right of First Refusal. 

  

 (a) _Unsolicited Offer from a Designated Entity_ : As soon as practicable, and in any event within five (5) days, after Licensees receipt from a Designated Entity of any unsolicited oral or written offer with respect to a transaction which could constitute a Change of Control transaction with respect to Licensee (a "Sale Transaction"), Licensee shall notify Licensor in writing of such offer, and if the offer is in writing, provide a copy thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, such notice must identify the Designated Entity and contain all material terms of the Sale Transaction other than customary standard provisions. Promptly upon Licensees agreement in principle on the terms of any such Sale Transaction, Licensee shall provide Licensor with written notice (the "Offer Notice") setting forth (i) the price, material terms and conditions of the proposed Sale Transaction, including the identity of the Designated Entity making the offer; and (ii) a copy of any written proposal, term sheet, letter of intent or other agreement relating to the proposed Sale Transaction. Licensor will have thirty (30) Business Days from the date of the Offer Notice (the "Notice Period") to agree to acquire Licensee (or, if less than a full acquisition is contemplated in the Offer Notice, elect to pursue the transaction described therein), for the price and upon the terms and conditions specified in the Offer Notice, by giving written notice (an "Acceptance Notice") to Licensee. If Licensor fails to provide an Acceptance Notice within the Notice Period, Licensee will have sixty (60) days after the end of the Notice Period to execute a definitive agreement with the Designated Entity specified in the Offer Notice on terms and conditions no more favorable to the counter-party than the terms and conditions set forth in the relevant Other Notice. In the event Licensee does not so execute a definitive agreement within such period, Licensee may not thereafter enter into any binding agreement with respect to a Change in Control transaction with such Designated Entity without first offering such opportunity to Licensor in the manner provided in this _Section 5.4(a)_. If Licensor provides an Acceptance Notice within the Notice Period but no definitive agreement is reached between Licensor and Licensee within ninety (90) days after the date of the Acceptance Notice, Licensee shall have the right to restart the negotiations with the Designated Entity on the terms originally set out in the Offer Notice, but in no event may Licensee execute a definitive agreement with such Designated Entity on terms and conditions more favorable to such entity than those set forth in the Offer Notice. In the event that, during the pendency of the negotiations pursuant to an Acceptance Notice, Licensee receives a further offer from the Designated Entity that it considers superior to the initial offer, Licensee may elect to pursue that offer, in which case the process provided in this _Section 5.4(a)_ shall be restarted and Licensee shall delver a new Offer Notice to Licensor. 

   

 (b) _Unsolicited Offer from a Non-Designated Entity_ : For so long as Licensors rights under Section 1.5(b) of the Investor Rights Agreement remain in effect, if Licensee receives an unsolicited offer for a Sale Transaction from a Person other than a Designated Entity (a "Non-Designated Entity"), then Licensee shall notify Licensor in writing of such offer, and if the offer is in writing, provide a copy thereof. Other than the notice requirement, and without limiting any of Licensors rights under the Investor Rights Agreement, none of the requirements of  _Section 5.4(a)_ shall apply to such unsolicited offer. 

   

 (c) _Solicitation of Offers with Response from a Designated Entity_ : If Licensee initiates a process to solicit offers for a Sale Transaction, Licensee will include Licensor in such process (including by providing Licensor with access to all materials provided   ##### 

  

  

  

generally to potential bidders and at least the same opportunity to submit
bids in response thereto). If Licensee reaches an agreement in principle on
the terms of a Sale Transaction with a Designated Entity and Licensor _has_
submitted a competing offer, then all of the provisions of  _Section 5.4(a)
_shall apply to the Designated Entitys offer. If Licensee reaches
an agreement in principle on the terms of a Sale Transaction with a
Designated Entity and Licensor has  _not_ submitted a competing offer, then
Licensee shall notify Licensor in writing of the Designated Entitys offer in
accordance with _Section 5.4(a)_, and if the offer is in writing, provide
a copy thereof, but none of the other requirements of _Section 5.4(a)_ shall
apply to such solicited offer. 

   

 (d) _Solicitation of Offers with Response from a Non-Designated Entity_ : For so long as Licensors rights under Section 1.5(b) of the Investor Rights Agreement remain in effect, if, as a result of the solicitation process initiated in _Section 5.4(c)_, Licensee reaches an agreement in principle on the terms of a Sale Transaction with a Non-Designated Entity and Licensor  _has_ submitted a competing offer, then Licensee shall notify Licensor in writing of the Non-Designated Entitys offer in accordance with _Section 5.4(a)_, and if the offer is in writing, provide a copy thereof, but Licensee shall not be bound by any of the other requirements of _Section 5.4(a)_. If Licensee reaches an agreement in principle on the terms of a Sale Transaction with a Non-Designated Entity and Licensor has _not_ submitted a competing offer, then, without limiting any of Licensors rights under the Investor Rights Agreement, none of the requirements of _Section 5.4(a)_ shall apply to such solicited offer. 

   

ARTICLE VI 

   

EFFECTIVENESS; TERM, SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION  

  

 6.1 Effectiveness; Term. This Agreement shall become effective immediately upon the closing of the transactions contemplated in the Acquisition Agreement, which shall be the date set forth above (the "Effective Date"), and shall continue in full force and effect unless and until terminated as provided in this _Article VI_, although, for the avoidance of doubt, the term of the licenses granted hereunder for specific Licensed Products shall be as set forth in  _Section 2.1_. 

  

 6.2 Suspension. 

  

 (a) _When Suspension Applies_ : Licensor shall have the right to suspend the license with respect to (i) a particular type of Licensed Product (e.g., DVD, CD, Blue-ray media) throughout the Territory in the event of any Significant Breach by Licensee that affects the particular type of Licensed Product in more than one country or (ii) a Licensed Product in a discrete geographic territory (but in no event in a territory smaller than a country) in the event of a Significant Breach by Licensee of this Agreement that affects such Licensed Product only in such territory if Licensee fails to cure such Significant Breach within sixty (60) days after written notice by Licensor to Licensee. During the term of any suspension, Licensee shall not be authorized to and agrees that it shall not (and shall cause any Licensed Entity not to) use, reproduce and display the Licensed Trademarks for the marketing, promotion, advertisement,   ##### 

  

  

  

distribution, lease or sale of the affected Licensed Products in the
particular territory identified in _Section 6.2(a)_.2 

   

 (b) _Initial Suspension Period_ : The initial suspension period shall begin at the end of the sixty (60)-day period and last for the shorter of (i) the date on which both parties agree in writing that the Significant Breach identified in _Section 6.2(a)_ has been cured or (ii) one hundred twenty (120) days. If such initial suspension period ends because the parties agree that such Significant Breach _has_ been cured, then the license for the particular Licensed Product in the particular territory identified in _Section 6.2(a)_ shall be reinstated immediately without the need for separate notice. If such initial suspension period expires and the parties agree in writing that the Significant Breach identified in _Section 6.2(a)_ has _not_ been cured or Licensee _fails_ to commence the dispute resolution process as provided in _Section 6.2(c)_ , then the license for the particular Licensed Product in the particular territory identified in _Section 6.2(a)_ shall continue to be suspended or, at Licensors election, be terminated immediately upon written notice. 

   

 (c) _Further Suspension Period_ : If, just prior to the end of the initial suspension period, the parties remain in dispute as to whether such Significant Breach has been cured, Licensee may commence a dispute resolution process pursuant to _Section 5.3_ and the previously suspended license shall remain suspended pending the outcome of such dispute resolution process. If, at the conclusion of such dispute resolution process, there is a written agreement by the parties that the Significant Breach _has_ been cured, then the license for the particular Licensed Product in the particular territory identified in _Section 6.2(a)_ shall be reinstated immediately without the need for separate notice. If, at the conclusion of such dispute resolution process, there is a written agreement by the parties that the Significant Breach has _not_  been cured or there is _no agreement_ reached about whether the Significant Breach has been cured, then the license for the particular Licensed Product in the particular territory identified in  _Section 6.2(a)_ shall continue to be suspended or, at Licensors election, be terminated immediately upon written notice as to the Licensed Products and territories in question, subject to the any rights and remedies of Licensee pursuant to _Section 5.3(f)_. __  

   

 6.3 Termination for Convenience. At any time after the twenty-fifth (25th) anniversary of the Effective Date, Licensor may terminate this Agreement in its sole discretion, and for any reason, upon one (1) years written notice to Licensee. 

  

 6.4 Termination for Cause.3 Licensor, or in the case of _Sections 6.4(d) or 6.6_ either Licensor or Licensee, shall additionally have the right to terminate this Agreement as set forth below: 

  

 (a) _Material Breach of Investor Rights Agreement_ : upon written notice to Licensee, in the event of material breach by Licensee of the Investor Rights Agreement which is not cured within sixty (60) days after written notice by Licensor to Licensee; 

    

 



 

       |   |   
---|---|--- 
    2  |   | If there is a suspension under this agreement that covers
a territory outside the United States, there will be a corresponding
suspension under Ireland Agreement and vice versa.  
   
    3  |   | Ireland Agreement must contain appropriate parallel
termination rights and clear cross default and termination provisions.  
      ##### 

  

       

 (b) _Withdrawal from Business_ : upon written notice to Licensee, in the event that Licensee withdraws from or discontinues its conduct of the Business; 

   

 (c) _Change of Control_ : in the event of a Change of Control of Licensee, _provided_ that Licensor (i) shall have given written notice to Licensee of its election to terminate within sixty (60) days after the Change of Control shall have been publicly announced and, together which such notice, shall have either (i) (A) tendered to Licensee that number of shares of common stock of Licensee equal to fifty percent (50%) of the shares of common stock of Licensee received by Licensor and its Affiliates at Closing under the Acquisition Agreement and (B) paid to Licensee, in immediately available funds, an amount in U.S. Dollars equal to fifty percent (50%) of the cash received by Licensor and its Affiliates at Closing or pursuant to any notes issued to them at Closing, each such amount of cash and number of shares multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of whole years remaining prior to the twenty-fifth (25th) anniversary of the Effective Date, and the denominator of which shall be twenty-five (25) (although in no event shall the fraction be less than zero); or (ii) paid to Licensee, in immediately available funds, an amount in U.S. Dollars equal to (A) the cash to be tendered to Licensee pursuant to clause (i) hereof plus (B) the aggregate value of the number of shares of common stock of Licensee determined pursuant to clause (i) hereof valued at a price per share equal to a simple average of the closing share price of the common stock of Licensee on the thirty (30) Trading Days, as defined in the Acquisition Agreement, ending five (5) Business Days prior to the date on which the Change of Control shall have been first publicly announced; _provided, however,_ that the termination shall not be effective until the date one hundred eighty (180) days after the date on which such written notice shall have been given. 

   

 (d) _Divestiture_ : upon written notice to Licensee, upon any Divestiture of all or any material portion of Licensees business relating to the marketing, distribution or sale of Licensed Products, where "Divestiture" means any sale, assignment or other transfer to another Person all or any material portion of any relevant assets relating to or primarily used in such business, but not including a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Licensee; 

   

 (e) _Material Breach of Agreement_ : upon written notice to the other party, in the event of a Material Breach by such other party, which is not cured within sixty (60) days after written notice by the party to the other party, _provided, however,_ that if, during such sixty (60)-day period, the other party commences a dispute resolution process pursuant to _Section 5.3_ with respect to the partys notice of breach (or the breach is otherwise subject to a dispute resolution process thereunder), such termination shall not become effective until the later of (i) one hundred twenty (120) days after the commencement of such dispute resolution process or (ii) the end of any extension period beyond such one hundred twenty (120)-day period to which the party has expressly agreed in a writing that refers to _Section 5.3_ and this _Section 6.4(d)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge that, from time to time, there may be de minimus breaches of quality control requirements of this Agreement by Licensee but that, for so long as Licensee is diligently curing such breaches, such breaches shall be disregarded in determining whether Licensee is in Material Breach (although Licensor may commence the dispute resolution processes of _Section 5.3_ if it views such breaches as significant in the aggregate). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties further acknowledge that a Material Breach will only give rise to Licensors right to terminate this Agreement if (a) the Material Breach affects more than one Licensed Product in more than one country; or (b) Licensor 

     ##### 

  

    

previously has exercised its right to suspend the license as to a particular
Licensed Product due to a failure by Licensee to cure a Material Breach
within the initial sixty (60) day cure period specified in Section 6.2. 

   

 6.5 Other Termination Rights. Either of Licensor or Licensee may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to the other party upon: 

  

 (a) the filing by the other party of a petition in bankruptcy or insolvency; 

   

 (b) any adjudication that the other party is bankrupt or insolvent; 

   

 (c) the filing by the other party of any legal action or document seeking reorganization, readjustment or arrangement of such partys business under any law relating to bankruptcy or insolvency; 

   

 (d) the appointment of a receiver for all or substantially all of the property of the other party; 

   

 (e) the making by the other party of any assignment for the benefit of creditors; or 

   

 (f) sixty (60) days after the institution of any proceedings for the liquidation or winding up of the business of, or for the termination of the corporate charter of, the other party if such proceedings are not dismissed such sixty (60)-day period. 

   

 6.6 Termination for Termination of Ireland Agreement. Licensor may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to Licensee upon the effective date of termination of the Ireland Agreement for cause or default of Imation Ireland Limited (or any Licensed Entity) under such agreement. Licensee may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to Licensor upon the effective date of termination of the Ireland Agreement for cause or default of Licensor under such agreement. 

  

 6.7 Effect of Termination. 

  

 (a) _Termination of License_ : Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, subject to _Section 6.7(b)_, all rights and licenses granted hereunder (including any Sublicense Agreements executed pursuant hereto) shall immediately terminate (and Licensee and any Licensed Entities shall cease all use of the Licensed Trademarks), provided that Licensee may use the Licensed Trademarks (i) for historical reference, including to keep records and other historical or archived documents (including customer contracts and/or marketing materials) containing or referencing the Licensed Trademarks and to refer to the historical fact that Licensee and the Licensed Entities previously used the Licensed Trademarks, but not, for the avoidance of doubt, for marketing, promotion, advertisement, distribution, lease or sale of Licensed Products, and (ii) in any manner permitted under applicable law. 

   

 (b) _Use Up Rights_ : Without limiting any rights of Licensee pursuant to _Section 6.7_ , upon any termination of this Agreement under _Section 6.4(a),_ _6.5_ , or 6.6(b), Licensee shall have the right to continue to (i) sell and/or otherwise dispose of any Licensed   ##### 

  

  

  

Products bearing a Licensed Trademark which are on hand or in process, and
(ii) use the Licensed Trademarks on Internet and Intranet websites and on
existing stocks of packaging, Promotional Material, and other documents and
materials related to the Licensed Products in connection with sales permitted

 (a) Sublicensee shall not do anything inconsistent with Licensors ownership of the Licensed Trademarks. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Sublicensee shall not challenge the validity of any Licensed Trademark, Licensors ownership thereof, or the enforceability of Licensors rights therein. 

   

 (b) Sublicensee shall not use, reproduce or display (or authorize the use, reproduction or display of) the Licensed Trademarks in any manner whatsoever other than as expressly authorized by this Sublicense Agreement. 

   

 (c) During the term and after any termination of this Sublicense Agreement, Sublicensee shall not use any service mark, service name, trade name, trademark, design or logo that is confusingly similar to any Licensed Trademark or any element thereof, including any mark, word or design that incorporates TDK Marks, or any mark, word, logo or design confusingly similar thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the term and after any termination of this Sublicense Agreement, Sublicensee shall not use the word "TDK" or the TDK diamond logo in any corporate name or in any domain name [other than as permitted in Section 2.2 of the Brand License Agreement]3 For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that an element of a Licensed Trademark (but in no event a TDK Mark) is expressly disclaimed in a trademark registration (such as "mobile" in TDK MOBILE), Sublicensee shall not be prohibited from using such element in its own Trademarks by the terms hereof. 

   

 (d) Sublicensee shall not use any of the Licensed Trademarks together, or use any Licensed Trademark in combination with any other trademark, service mark, trade name, trading style, fictitious business name, name, character, symbol, design, likeness or literary or artistic material in a manner that create a unitary or combination Trademark without the prior written consent of Licensor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sublicensee may use (i) any Licensed Trademarks together if Licensor has a general practice of using such Licensed

Trademarks together and (ii) any Trademarks listed on an exhibit to this
Sublicense Agreement but not in a manner that might create a unitary or
combination Trademark. 

   

 (e) For a period that runs for one (1) year prior to the expiration of the separate licenses for the Speaker Products and Headphone Products and for each RRM Product licensed in this Sublicense Agreement, and for a period that runs for one (1) year prior to the termination of the Sublicense Agreement for the Core Products and Accessory Products, Sublicensee may Display one or more Imation Trademarks on or in connection with the Licensed Products as part of a transition plan that is provided by Licensee to Sublicensee. 

   

 (f) Sublicensee shall not register any Licensed Trademark, and Licensor shall retain the exclusive right to apply for and obtain registrations for each Licensed Trademark throughout the world. Sublicensee shall not register any domain name containing the word [TDK].

 2.3 Patent License. Licensee hereby grants to Sublicensee a royalty-free, non-transferable, nonsublicensable, non-exclusive license (not including manufacturing or have made rights) in the Territory under any patents of Licensor or its Affiliates that, as of the Effective Date, Licensor has the right to grant licenses without payments to third parties, for the marketing, distribution, or sales of Current Magnetic Tape Products and Current Optical Media Products which, in both cases, Licensor or Licensee has commercialized as of the Effective Date, provided that if Sublicensee or any of its Affiliates asserts a patent against Licensor or any of its Affiliates, the sublicense granted in this Section 2.3 shall terminate and further provided that Sublicensee and its Affiliates shall not sue Licensor or any of its Affiliates for damages arising before termination of the license. 

  

 2.4 Notice. In connection with the use of the Licensed Trademarks on packaging or Promotional Material for the Licensed Products, Sublicensee shall include a trademark notice in a form reading: "The [TDK [**] Logo] is a trademark of [Licensor]," except that Sublicensee may use the typed words "TDK Logo" instead of the actual logo where the notice would be too small to show the actual logo clearly or where the notice is embedded within other text. Further, with respect to any Licensed Product other than Core Products or Accessory Products, Sublicensee shall indicate when using a Licensed Trademark on packaging or Promotional Material for such product that "The [TDK [**] is used under a trademark license from [Licensor]," subject to the same exception as the previous sentence. If a Licensed Trademark is used multiple times on or in packaging or Promotional Material, the notice and statement regarding licensed use need only be used for the first prominent use of the Licensed Trademark on or in such packaging or Promotional Material.

ARTICLE III 

   

QUALITY CONTROL 

   

 As an express condition to, and in material consideration for, the licenses granted to Sublicensee hereunder, Sublicensee expressly agrees to the following restrictions as to its use of the Licensed Trademarks: 

  

 3.1 Trademark Guidelines. Sublicensee shall not use, reproduce or display any Licensed Trademark in any manner whatsoever other than as expressly authorized in the quality control guidelines for the Licensed Trademarks ("Quality Guidelines"), including guidelines regarding how each Licensed Trademark is used, presented and displayed ("Display"). The Quality Guidelines shall consist of two elements: guidelines related to Display (such guidelines 

   ##### 

  

 

shall be contained in a "Logo Manual") and guidelines regarding the nature and
quality of products and services associated with the Licensed Trademark (such
guidelines shall be contained in a "Quality Manual"). The initial Quality
Guidelines are attached as _Exhibit G-3_ to the Brand License Agreement.
Sublicensee shall promptly cure any breach of the Quality Guidelines
upon notice from Licensee or from Licensor, provided that Sublicensee shall
have a reasonable time to comply with Updates (as defined below), including a
reasonable amount of time to exhaust existing inventories of Promotional
Material, packaging, and Licensed Product, except that Sublicensee shall not
have rights to exhaust existing inventories if such inventories are in
material noncompliance with the previous Quality Guidelines or if the
existing Licensed Products (or use or distribution thereof) would violate any
applicable law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section
3.1_, if Sublicensee purchases products covered by the Supply Agreement from
third parties as permitted under the terms of the Supply Agreement,
Sublicensee shall not be in breach of provisions of the Quality Manual to the
extent that such Quality Manual refers to standards or specifications that
are not performance or quality-related specifications (e.g., the use
of Licensor dye #25 in describing a color or other requirements for the
product not tied to the performance of the product), provided that
Sublicensee shall comply with the Logo Manual. Sublicensee acknowledges that
the Quality Guidelines may be updated pursuant to the Brand License Agreement
("Updates") and Sublicensee shall comply with such Updates. 

   

 3.2 Conduct of Business. Sublicense shall use the Licensed Trademarks in a manner that does not derogate Licensors rights in the Licensed Trademarks or the value of the Licensed Trademarks, and shall take no action that would interfere with, diminish or tarnish those rights or value. 

  

 3.3 Cooperation. Sublicense shall cooperate fully with Licensee and Licensor in enabling Licensor to ascertain that the Licensed Products meet Licensors quality standards. Such cooperation shall include, upon request, providing Licensee or Licensor promptly with data regarding communications from third parties regarding the quality of specific Licensed Products, providing Licensee or Licensor with names and addresses of vendors and suppliers producing Licensed Products or components thereof to be sold under a Licensed Trademark, and providing Licensee or Licensor with access to product packaging and distribution facilities for such products for reasonable inspection by Licensor. 

  

 3.4 Cessation of Licensed Product Sales; Recall. Licensee or Licensor shall have the right to request that Sublicensee immediately cease selling a Licensed Product, or revise or cease use of any or all Promotional Material, and Sublicensee shall promptly comply, upon written notice to Sublicensee if the condition of such Licensed Product or Promotional Material could reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect Licensors business or reputation. For the avoidance of doubt, if there is a reasonable basis for believing that a product poses a danger to person or property, such product shall be considered a product that could be reasonably expected to materially and adversely affect Licensors business or reputation. Further, Licensee or Licensor shall have the right to request a product recall if there is a reasonable basis for believing that the product or category of products poses a danger to person or property, and Sublicensee shall promptly comply upon written notice of such request. If Sublicensee wishes to resume sale of a product, Licensor shall have the right to approve such resumption. 

   ##### 

  

  

 3.5 Samples. Sublicensee shall submit to Licensee or Licensor upon reasonable request, specimens of uses of the Licensed Trademarks, including: (a) representative products that will bear any Licensed Trademark or be marketed, promoted, advertised, distributed or sold using any Licensed Trademark; and (b) samples of all Promotional Material. If, after review of such materials or samples, Licensee or Licensor is concerned about compliance with any aspect of this Sublicense Agreement, Sublicensee shall provide such additional materials and samples as Licensee or Licensor may reasonably request. If Licensee or Licensor discovers any improper use of the Licensed Trademarks in any such submission, Sublicensee shall remedy the improper use immediately upon written notice. 

  

 3.6 Inspections. In addition to _Section 3.3_, Sublicensee shall cooperate with Licensee or Licensor to ensure that quality standards applicable to Licensed Products are met by permitting Licensee or Licensor to inspect only those manufacturing and other facilities directly related to the manufacture of Licensed Products, upon reasonable notice and no more than once a year, and only in a manner that will not unreasonably interfere with Sublicensees business activities, provided that Licensee shall arrange for and accompany Licensor on any inspections to third-party facilities. 

  

 3.7 Standards Compliance. If Sublicensee publicly states that any Licensed Product is compliant with any applicable industry standard, Sublicensee shall ensure that such Licensed Product is fully compliant with all mandatory requirements of such standard, except for compliance with such applicable industry standards for which Licensor is responsible under the Supply Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, any use of a logo or trademark associated with an industry standard (e.g., the logo "DVD" or "Blu-ray") shall be deemed a public statement that the Licensed Product is compliant with the applicable industry standard.

INVESTOR RIGHTS AGREEMENT  

  

 This INVESTOR RIGHTS AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made as of ___, 2007, by and between Imation Corp., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and TDK Corporation, a Japanese corporation (the "Investor"). 

  

RECITALS 

   

 WHEREAS, the Investor and the Company are parties to an Acquisition Agreement, dated as of ___, 2007 (the "Acquisition Agreement"), providing for the issuance and sale of certain shares of common stock of the Company, par value $.01 per share ("Common Stock"), in consideration of the Investors transfer to the Company of certain assets relating to the sale, service and support of optical, magnetic tape and flash memory recordable media products, as more fully described in the Acquisition Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, the obligations of the Company and the Investor under the Acquisition Agreement are conditioned, among other things, upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Investor and the Company; 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 

   

BOARD REPRESENTATION  

  

 1.1 Investor Nominee Appointment Right. Until such time as ninety (90) days have elapsed after the occurrence of a Nomination Forfeiture Event without cure by the Investor of such event (the "Forfeiture Date"), the Investor shall have the right to designate one employee or director of TDK or any Affiliate of TDK as a nominee to stand for election as a director of the Company (the "Investor Nominee"). Promptly after TDK has designated an Investor Nominee and the Investor Nominee has been approved by the Companys board of directors (the "Board") as provided below, the Company shall increase the size of the Board by one member and fill the resulting vacancy in accordance with the Companys bylaws by designating the Investor Nominee as a director of the Class whose term will expire at the next annual meeting of stockholders. Thereafter, the Board shall recommend to the Companys stockholders to vote to elect the Investor Nominee at the next stockholders meeting and at each subsequent stockholders meeting at which directors of that Class are elected. The foregoing nomination right will be subject to the Companys generally applicable policies with respect to the qualification of Board nominees under the Companys Corporate Governance Guidelines, as may be amended from time to time (the "Board Qualifications"); _provided_ , that (i) in the event that a proposed Investor Nominee is rejected by the Boards Nominating and Governance Committee, (A) the Board will not nominate any person not designated by the Investor to stand for election in place of the rejected Investor Nominee and (B) the Investor shall have the right to nominate a replacement candidate, until such time as an Investor Nominee that meets the Board Qualifications is put forward by the Investor, and (ii) the Company shall not revise or amend the 

   ##### 

  

 

Board Qualifications or the qualifications and procedures set forth in the
Companys Corporate Governance Guidelines in a manner that has the intent or
effect of materially adversely affecting the Investors ability to designate
the Investor Nominee (by for instance, adding requirements that all directors
meet citizenship or independence requirements that would disqualify the
Investors most probable nominees). Any Investor Nominee included within the
slate of director nominees presented to the stockholders for election shall
remain subject to the required affirmative vote of the Companys stockholders
in accordance with the Companys bylaws, as may be amended from time
to time. 

   

 1.2 Responsibilities of Investor Nominee. Any Investor Nominee duly elected to the Board shall be subject to the Companys bylaws, charters, guidelines, codes of conduct, policies and procedures and the laws of the State of Delaware governing the fiduciary responsibilities of directors to the same degree as other members of the Board, and may be removed for cause under applicable law. Any Investor Nominee duly elected to the Board shall be treated the same as an "employee director" for purposes of director compensation. 

  

 1.3 Vacancies. At any time prior to a Nomination Forfeiture Event, if an Investor Nominee who has been duly elected to the Board resigns from the Board, is removed for cause under applicable law, dies or otherwise cannot or is not willing to stand for reelection or to continue to serve as a member of the Board, the remaining members of the Board shall take all commercially reasonable actions to cause the vacancy to be filled, prior to or concurrent with any further meeting or action by the Board, by a new Investor Nominee. 

  

 1.4 Nomination Forfeiture Event. A "Nomination Forfeiture Event" shall occur when: 

  

 (a) as a result of voluntary sales of Common Stock by the Investor, the number of shares of Common Stock held by the Investor drops below seventy-five percent (75%) of the Initial Share Number; 

  

 (b) as a result of the Investors failure to exercise its Preemptive Rights and any voluntary sales by the Investor of Common Stock, the number of Issued Shares held by the Investor drops below ten percent (10%) of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock; 

  

 (c) that certain Trademark License Agreement, dated as of the date hereof between the Company and the Investor (the "Trademark License"), is terminated for any reason; or 

  

 (d) as a result of a breach by Investor of _Section 4.3_ or _4.4_ of this Agreement; _provided_ , that a breach of _Section 4._3 of this Agreement shall not constitute a Nomination Forfeiture Event unless either (i) the Investor shall have affirmatively voted its voting Securities in contravention of the provisions of that Section or (ii) the Investor, having been given express written notice by the Company in the form of attached _Exhibit B_ (an "Express Notice") and in accordance with the applicable terms of _Section 6.19_, shall have failed to vote its voting Securities with respect to a proposal as to which it is required to vote under _Section 4.3_ and, in the case of a proposal described in _Section 4.3(a)_ but not otherwise, such failure to vote shall 

   ##### 

  

    

have adversely affected the outcome of the stockholder vote on such proposal
from the Companys perspective (i.e., caused a proposal as to which the Board
recommended a vote "against" to succeed, or a proposal as to which the Board
recommended a vote "for" to fail). 

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 1.1_, if a Nomination
Forfeiture Event occurs as a result of clause (c) or (d) above, Investors
right to nominate an Investor Nominee shall terminate immediately, and
Investor shall cause any Investor Nominee who has been duly elected and is
then serving as a director of the Company to submit his resignation as a
director of the Company with immediate effect. For purposes of this Section
1.4, the number of Shares of Common Stock held by the Investor shall include
all shares of Common Stock issued to the Investor and its Affiliates at
Closing. 

   

 1.5 Information Rights. 

  

 (a) For so long as the Investor has a duly elected representative serving on the Board, the Company shall be required to provide such director with all information made available to other Board members, as and when it is made available to other Board members; _provided, however_ , the Company shall not be obligated to provide such director with information that is only made available to members of a duly constituted committee of the Board of which such director is not a member. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding the occurrence of an uncured Nomination Forfeiture Event other than pursuant to _Section 1.4(d)_, for so long as the Trademark License remains in effect, and subject to the provisions of _Section 6.3_ of this Agreement, the Company shall provide the Investor (i) reasonable notice of, and reasonably detailed information regarding, any discussions, negotiations, or correspondence regarding any proposed transaction that could be expected to result in a Change of Control of the Company (a "Proposed Transaction"), including any material changes to terms previously notified to Investor, and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to propose alternatives thereto to the Board for the Boards consideration. In addition, in the event that the Company or its advisors conducts (i) any form of "market check" process in connection with exploration of or discussion, negotiations or correspondence regarding a Proposed Transaction, or (ii) any form of formal or informal auction process, then, in either case, the Company agrees that the Investor will be one of the parties contacted in the first instance. The rights of the Investor under this  _Section 1.5(b)_ shall terminate immediately in the event of a Nomination Forfeiture Event described in _Section 1.4(d)_. 

  

 (c) For the purposes of _Section 1.5(b)_, a "Change of Control" with respect to the Company means any of the following transactions as a result of which the Company is under the direct or indirect control of any Person, whether singly or as a part of a 13D Group: 

  

 (i) the acquisition by any Person, as a result of one transaction or a series of transactions over time, of voting Securities representing, directly or indirectly, more than fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate voting rights of the Company; or 

  

 (ii) the Companys consolidation with or merger with or into another Person, whether or not the Company is the surviving entity in such transaction, unless, immediately after such consolidation or merger, shareholders of the Company prior to the 

   ##### 

  

    

transaction continue to own voting securities representing, directly or
indirectly, more than fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate voting rights of
such new or surviving entity. 

  

ARTICLE II 

   

PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS  

  

 2.1 Preemptive Rights. 

  

 (a) If the Company proposes to sell any Common Stock or any other Securities, however described or whether voting or non-voting, other than Exempted Securities ("Additional Securities"), whether in a private placement, a public offering, or as part of an acquisition, share exchange or otherwise, the Company shall, at least thirty (30) days prior to issuing such Additional Securities, notify the Investor in writing of such proposed issuance specifying, to the extent practicable, the purchase price or a range for the purchase price, if any, for, and the terms and conditions of, such Additional Securities and shall offer to sell such Additional Securities to the Investor in the amounts set forth in _Section 2.1(c)_, upon the terms and conditions set forth in the notice and at the Purchase Price as provided in _Section 2.1(d)_ (the "Preemptive Rights"); _provided_ , that, if the purchase price for, or any of the other material terms and conditions of, the proposed issuance are not known at the time of the initial written notice, the Company shall provide such notice without specifying the price or other such terms and conditions, and shall provide a supplemental notice, adding the missing terms, to the Investor as soon as they are known to the Company, and in no event later than ten (10) Business Days prior to such issuance. For purposes of calculating the number of Additional Securities issued pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a)_, such calculation shall include the maximum number of shares of Common Stock and other Securities issuable upon the conversion or exercise of any convertible or exchangeable Securities. 

  

 (b) If the Investor wishes to subscribe for a number of Additional Securities less than the number to which it is entitled under this _Section 2.1_, the Investor may do so and shall, in the notice of exercise of the offer, specify the number of Additional Securities that it wishes to purchase. 

  

 (c) The Company shall offer the Investor all, or any portion specified by the Investor in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_, of an amount of such Additional Securities such that, after giving effect to the proposed issuance (including the issuance to the Investor pursuant to the Preemptive Rights and including any related issuance resulting from the exercise of preemptive or similar rights by any unrelated Person with respect to the same issuance that gave rise to the exercise of the Preemptive Rights by the Investor), the Investors Equity Interest after such issuance would equal the Investors Equity Interest immediately prior to such issuance, such number of Additional Securities to constitute the "Preemptive Share Amount". If, at the time of the determination of any Preemptive Share Amount under this _Section 2.1(c)_, any other Person has preemptive or other equity purchase rights similar to the Preemptive Rights, such Preemptive Share Amount shall be recalculated to take into account the amount of Additional Securities such Persons have committed to purchase, rounding up such Preemptive Share Amount to the nearest whole Additional Security. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) The "Purchase Price" for the Additional Securities to be issued pursuant to the exercise of Preemptive Rights shall be payable only in cash (unless otherwise agreed by the Company and the Investor) and, except as otherwise set forth below, shall equal per Additional Security the per Security issuance price for the Additional Securities giving rise to such Preemptive Right. In the case of any issuance of Additional Securities other than solely for cash, the Company and the Investor shall in good faith seek to agree upon the value of the non-cash consideration; _provided_ , that the value of any publicly traded securities shall be deemed to be the closing price of such securities on the applicable national securities exchange as of the trading date immediately prior to the consummation of such issuance. If the Company and the Investor fail to agree on such value during the period contemplated by the first sentence of _Section 2.2_, then the Company will refer the items in dispute to a nationally recognized investment banking firm that is selected by the Board and reasonably acceptable to the Investor and that shall be instructed to make a final and binding determination of the fair market value of such items within ten (10) Business Days. If such a determination is required, the deadline for the Investors exercise of its Preemptive Rights with respect to such issuance pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ shall be extended until the fifth (5th) Business Day following the date of such determination. Whichever of the Company or the Investor whose last estimate differed the most from that finally determined by the investment banking firm shall be responsible for and pay all of the fees and expenses of such investment banking firm. All determinations made by such investment banking firm shall be final and binding on the Company and the Investor. 

  

 2.2 Exercise Period. The Preemptive Rights set forth in _Section 2.1_ must be exercised by acceptance in writing of an offer referred to in _Section 2.1(a)_, (i) if not in connection with a registered offering, within thirty (30) days of receiving notice from the Company of its intention to sell Additional Securities, or (ii) in connection with any registered offering, at least five (5) Business Days prior to the printing of the preliminary prospectus in connection with such offering. The closing of any purchase of Additional Securities pursuant to the exercise by the Investor of Preemptive Rights hereunder shall occur on the later of (i) the closing of the transaction triggering such Preemptive Rights, subject to the receipt of any necessary Governmental Approvals to which the issuance of Additional Securities is subject, and (ii) should either the Company or the Investor so elect, an agreed date within thirty (30) days after such closing. 

  

 2.3 Survival of Rights. The Investors rights set forth in _Section 2.1_ shall terminate when: 

  

 (a) as a result of voluntary sales of Common Stock by the Investor, the number of shares of Common Stock held by the Investor drops below seventy-five percent (75%) of the Initial Share Number; 

  

 (b) as a result of the Investors failure to exercise its Preemptive Rights and any voluntary sales by the Investor of Common Stock, the number of Issued Shares held by the Investor drops below ten percent (10%) of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock; or 

  

 (c) the Trademark License is terminated for any reason.

ARTICLE III 

   

REGISTRATION RIGHTS  

  

 3.1 Registration Rights. 

  

 (a) Demand Rights. 

  

 (i) At any time after the end of the Lock-Up Period, the Investor shall have the right to request the Company to file a registration statement under the Securities Act for a public offering of all or part of the Issued Shares and any additional shares of Common Stock issued or distributed by way of a dividend, stock split or other distribution, or acquired by way of any rights offering or similar offering made, in respect of the Issued Shares (the "Registrable Securities"), by delivering written notice thereof to the Company specifying (x) the number of Registrable Securities to be included in such registration, and (y) the intended method of distribution thereof (the "Demand Registration Request"). Thereupon the Company shall, as expeditiously as possible, use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect the registration under the Securities Act of the Registrable Securities which the Company has been so requested to register in the Demand Registration Request. The Investor may require the Company to file such registration statement with the SEC in accordance with and pursuant to Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act (or any successor rule then in effect) (a "Shelf Registration"). The demand registration rights granted in this _Section 3.1(a)(i)_ are subject to the following limitations: 

  

 (1) The aggregate offering price (net of known or estimated underwriting discounts and commissions) for the shares of Registrable Securities to be included in such registration shall be at least ten million Dollars ($10,000,000) based on the current market price of the Common Stock at the time of such initial filing; 

  

 (2) The Company shall not be obligated to effect any registrations pursuant to this  _Section 3.1(a)(i)_ within nine (9) months of the effective date of any other registration under the Securities Act, other than a registration on Form S-8 under the Securities Act; 

  

 (3) The Company shall not, under any circumstances, be obligated to effect more than two (2) registrations pursuant to this _Section 3.1(a)_, no more than one of which may be exercised in any twelve (12)-month period; and 

  

 (4) The Company may postpone for up to ninety (90) days the filing or the effectiveness of a registration statement for a Demand Registration Request if the Company furnishes to the Investor a certificate signed by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company stating that the disclosures that would be required in such registration statement would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on, or require the public disclosure of, any proposal or plan by the Company to engage in a significant financing or acquisition of assets (other than in the ordinary course of business), or any merger, consolidation, tender offer, or reorganization; _provided_ , that, in such event, the Investor shall be entitled to withdraw such 

   ##### 

  

    

Demand Registration Request and, if such request is withdrawn, such request
shall not count as one of the permitted Demand Registration Requests
hereunder. 

  

 (ii) If the Investor intends to distribute the Registrable Securities covered by the Demand Registration Request by means of an underwriting, the Investor shall so advise the Company in the Demand Registration Request, and in such event, the Investor shall negotiate in good faith with an underwriter or underwriters selected by the Company to act as the managing underwriter in connection with such underwriting; _provided, however,_ that if the Investor has not agreed with such underwriter or underwriters as to the terms and conditions of such underwriting within twenty (20) days following commencement of such negotiations, then the Company may select an underwriter or underwriters of its choice to be the managing underwriter, which choice shall be subject to the approval of the Investor (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Company and the Investor shall enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriter or underwriters selected for such underwriting (it being understood that all indemnification obligations which are customarily those of the issuer of securities under such underwriting agreement shall be the obligations of the Company). 

  

 (iii) If the Investor intends to distribute the Registrable Securities covered by the Demand Registration Request by means of an underwriting and the managing underwriters advise the Company in writing, with a copy to be delivered to the Investor, that, in their opinion, the number of Registrable Securities requested to be included in such offering exceeds the number of securities which can be sold therein without materially adversely affecting the marketability of the offering and within a price range acceptable to the Investor, the Company shall include in such registration the Registrable Securities requested to be included which in the opinion of such underwriters can be sold without materially adversely affecting the marketability of the offering; _provided_ , that, in the event that the number of Registrable Securities included in such registration is so reduced, such registration shall not count as one of the permitted Demand Registration Requests hereunder. 

  

 (b) Piggyback Rights. 

  

 (i) If at any time and from time to time after the end of the Lock-Up Period the Company proposes to effect a registration of any of its securities under the Securities Act (other than any registration of Securities on Forms S-4 or S-8 or any successor forms), for its own account, or for the account of one or more shareholders (other than pursuant to a Demand Registration Request) (the "Proposed Registration"), the Company shall give prompt written notice to the Investor of the Companys intention to do so. If the Investors Registrable Securities have not been included in the Proposed Registration, and within thirty (30) days of the receipt of any such notice, Investor delivers to the Company a written notice requesting to have any or all of the Registrable Securities included in the Proposed Registration (such notice to include the number of Registrable Securities that the Investor wishes to be included in the Proposed Registration), the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such shares to be registered as requested in such notice. Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section 3.1(b)_, if the Proposed Registration is an underwritten registration and the managing underwriter determines that marketing factors require a limitation of the number of shares to be underwritten, the Company may limit the number of shares of Registrable Securities to be 

   ##### 

  

    

included in the Proposed Registration without requiring any limitation in the
number of shares to be registered on behalf of the Company; _provided,
however,_ that the number of Registrable Securities included in the Proposed
Registration pursuant to this _Section 3.1(b)_ may not be reduced to less
than thirty percent (30%) of the total amount of shares subject to the
offering;  _provided, further_ , that nothing herein shall prevent the
Company from canceling or withdrawing any Proposed Registration prior to the
filing or effectiveness thereof. 

  

 (ii) If underwriters are appointed to conduct an offering of the Companys securities, including Registrable Securities, with respect to the Proposed Registration, no Registrable Securities shall be registered unless the Investor accepts the terms of the underwriting as approved by the Company for the offering; _provided_ , that the Investor may independently negotiate with the underwriters for the offering any representations and warranties that the Investor will give to such underwriters in connection with the offering. In the event that the Investor is unable to agree with such underwriters on such representations and warranties or does not accept the terms of such underwriting, then the Company may proceed with the Proposed Registration without the participation of the Investor or the inclusion of any Registrable Securities; _provided, further_ , that such non-participation of the Investor shall not in any way affect its rights under this _Section 3.1_ with respect to subsequent demands for registration of any Registrable Securities. 

  

 3.2 Holdback Agreements. Investor shall not effect any public sale or distribution (including sales pursuant to Rule 144) of Securities of the Company or engage in any hedging transactions relating to the same, during the thirty (30) days prior to and the 90-day period beginning on the effective date of any underwritten registration pursuant to a Demand Registration Request or any underwritten Proposed Registration, in each case pursuant to which Investors Registrable Securities are included, unless the underwriters managing the registered public offering agree otherwise. 

  

 3.3 Effectiveness of Registration Statement. The Company shall notify Investor of the effectiveness of each registration statement filed hereunder and prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such registration statement effective for a period of not less than one hundred twenty (120) days (or until the distribution described in the registration statement has been completed) (or, in the case of a Shelf Registration, a period ending on the earlier of (i) the date on which all Registrable Securities have been sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration or have otherwise ceased to be Registrable Securities, and (ii) the 24-month anniversary of the effective date of such Shelf Registration) and comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of securities covered by such registration statement during such period in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the sellers thereof set forth in such registration statement; _provided, however_ , that at any time, upon written notice to Investor and for a period not to exceed sixty (60) days thereafter (the "Suspension Period"), the Company may suspend the use or effectiveness of any registration statement (and the Investor agrees not to offer or sell any Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration statement during the Suspension Period) if the Company reasonably believes that the Company may, in the absence of such suspension hereunder, be required under state or federal securities laws to disclose any corporate development the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect upon the Company, its stockholders, a potentially 

   ##### 

  

    

significant transaction or event involving the Company, or any negotiations,
discussions, or proposals directly relating thereto. No more than two (2)
such Suspension Periods shall occur in any twelve (12) month period. In the
event that the Company shall exercise its rights hereunder, the applicable
time period during which the registration statement is to remain effective
shall be extended by a period of time equal to the duration of the Suspension
Period. The Company may extend the Suspension Period for an additional
consecutive thirty (30) days with the written consent of the Investor. If so
directed by the Company, Investor shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to deliver to the Company (at the Companys expense) all copies, other
than permanent file copies then in Investors possession, of the prospectus
relating to such Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of
such notice. Investor agrees to comply with any prospectus delivery and/or
notice requirements under the Securities Act then in effect, and agrees to
not use any "free-writing" prospectus in connection with the sale of any
Registrable Securities. 

  

 3.4 Registration Expenses. The Company shall pay the expenses associated with registrations pursuant to this _Article III_ (including all registration, filing, qualification fees, printing expenses, fees and expenses of the Companys counsel and of one counsel to the Investor and auditing expenses) and all related offering expenses (including printing expenses, road show costs and other marketing expenses). The Investor shall bear the cost of any underwriting discounts or commissions for the offering and sale of the Investors Registrable Securities. 

  

 3.5 Rule 144 Reporting. With a view to making available the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the SEC which may at times permit the sale of Registrable Securities to the public in the United States without registration after the Lock-Up Period, the Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to: 

  

 (a) Make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act; 

  

 (b) File, as and when applicable, with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the Company under the Exchange Act; and 

  

 (c) Furnish to the Investor forthwith upon request a written statement by the Company as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of Rule 144 and the Exchange Act, a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly (or other periodic) report of the Company, and such other reports of the Company as the Investor may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the SEC allowing the Investor to sell any such securities without registration.

OTHER AGREEMENTS  

  

 4.1 Standstill. 

  

 (a) From the date hereof through the date when (i) as a result of voluntary sales of Common Stock by the Investor, the number of shares of Common Stock held by the 

   ##### 

  

    

Investor drops below seventy-five percent (75%) of the Initial Share Number or
(ii) as a result of the Investors failure to exercise its Preemptive Rights
and any voluntary sales by the Investor of Common Stock, the number of Issued
Shares held by the Investor drops below ten percent (10%) of the total number
of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock (the "Standstill Period"),
the Investor agrees that neither the Investor nor any of its Affiliates will,
without the prior written consent of the Company, directly or indirectly,
alone or in concert with any other Person, acquire, offer to acquire, or
agree to acquire, directly or indirectly, by purchase, gift, business
combination or otherwise, any Securities such that the Investor and its
Affiliates would aggregately hold, after acquisition of such Securities or
the conversion thereof, in excess of twenty-one percent (21%) (the
"Standstill Threshold") of the outstanding voting Securities without the
prior written consent of the Company; _provided, however_ , that the Company
shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, inform the Investor of any change
in the number of outstanding voting Securities since the last Public
Disclosure of the total issued and outstanding Securities of the Company in
excess of one quarter of one percent (0.25%). 

  

 (b) For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding Section 4.1(a), the Investor and its Affiliates may, solely as a result of repurchases by the Company of its outstanding Common Stock, own in the aggregate up to twenty-two percent (22%) of the outstanding Common Stock (the "Investor Threshold") without being in breach of the Standstill Threshold. 

  

 (c) If Investor acquires, directly or indirectly, Securities in violation of _Section 4.1(a)_ , Investor shall, as soon as it becomes aware of such violation, give prompt notice to the Company and immediately dispose of the Securities in excess of the Standstill Threshold.

The Company agrees that the Rights Plan Amendment will be maintained in effect, and the Share Rights Plan shall not be further amended or revised without the prior written consent of the Investor to change the Standstill Threshold or the Investor Threshold or affect the ability of the Investor to maintain its level of investment in the Company until the end of the Standstill Period. 

  

 (e) The Investor shall be required, to the extent permitted by applicable law, in the event of any repurchases of Common Stock by the Company, to tender a pro rata proportion of its shares of Common Stock for repurchase by the Company to the extent necessary to avoid exceeding the Investor Threshold, and the Company shall be required to purchase such shares of Common Stock tendered by the Investor; _provided, however_ , that any sales required hereunder will not be taken into account for a period of five (5) years thereafter in determining whether a Nomination Forfeiture Event shall have occurred.

Any stock certificates representing the Issued Shares shall bear a legend substantially in the form below: 

  

 _"The securities represented by this certificate may only be
transferred pursuant to the provisions of an Investor Rights Agreement, dated
as of_   _ _ _, 2007, as amended from time to time,
between the issuer and TDK, copies of which are on file at the principal
office of the issuer."_  

  

 (b) Prior to any sale by the Investor of any of Issued Shares during the Standstill Period, Investor shall give the Company at least ten (10) days advance notice in writing, and the Investor and the Company shall negotiate in good faith and agree on limitations on the volume of any such sales on the open market; _provided, however,_ that such limitations shall be no greater than is necessary to maintain an orderly market for the Companys Common Stock; _provided, further,_ that any limitation shall not apply in the case of Investors exercise of any of the Investors registration rights set forth in _Article III_. 

  

 (c) Any sale, transfer or other disposition made in violation of _Section 4.2(a)_ shall be null and void, and the Company shall not register any such sale, transfer or other disposition in its books and records.

proposed, recommended or otherwise supported by the Board; 

  

 (b) become a "participant" in any "election contest" (as such terms are defined or used in Rule 14-11 under the Exchange Act) with respect to the Company or solicit any consent or communicate with or seek to advise, encourage or influence any Person with respect to the voting of any voting Securities; provided, however, that Investor shall not be prevented hereunder from being a "participant" in support of the management of the Company by reason of the membership of Investors designee on the Companys Board or the inclusion of Investors designee on the slate of nominees for election to the Board proposed by the Company;

 6.12 Waivers. The waiver by a party of a breach of or a default under any provision of this Agreement, shall not be effective unless such waiver is in writing, expressly states that is a waiver hereunder, and identifies the breach or default to be waived. No waiver hereunder shall, in any event, be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of, or default under, the same or any other provision of this Agreement, nor shall any delay or omission on the part of a party in exercising or availing itself of any right or remedy, or any course of dealing hereunder, operate as a waiver of any right or remedy.

 WHEREAS, Imation and TDK agree to enter into such an agreement on the terms and conditions set forth below. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants set forth in this Agreement, Imation and TDK agree as follows:

    **  |   | The appearance of a double asterisk denotes confidential
information that has been omitted from the exhibit and filed separately,
accompanied by a confidential treatment request, with the Securities and
Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934.  
      ##### 

  

       

 1.2 _Other Defined Terms; Interpretation and Usage_. All other capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement, but defined in the Acquisition Agreement, will have the meanings assigned to them in the Acquisition Agreement. Interpretation and usage of terms will be as set forth in the Acquisition Agreement. 

  

2\. _Supply and Purchase Commitments_  

   

 2.1 _Supply Commitment_. TDK will use commercially reasonable efforts to supply Products to Imation and its Subsidiaries as set forth in _Section 4 _during the term of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, TDKs supply commitment under this _Section 2.1_, _Section 4_ and otherwise under this Agreement will not require building or acquiring manufacturing capacity or holding inventory. 

  

 2.2 _Exclusivity_. TDK will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries not to, sell any Product to third parties for resale under any trademarks of TDK or any of its Affiliates for so long as Imation is purchasing such Product from TDK; _provided, however_ , that commencing on the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Effective Date TDK or any of its Subsidiaries may sell any Product to third parties for resale under any trademarks of TDK or any of its Affiliates that are not a TDK Trademark or confusingly similar to a TDK Trademark (collectively, " _Other TDK Trademarks_ "). In the event that TDK sells a Product under such Other TDK Trademarks after such fifth (5th) anniversary, Imations purchase commitment under _Section 2.3 _shall no longer apply with respect to such Product. For the avoidance of doubt, TDK may supply any Products hereunder to third parties for resale under a third-party brand and this _Section 2.2 _shall not limit or otherwise modify any rights of Imation under the Acquisition Agreement or the Brand License Agreement. 

  

 2.3 _Purchase Commitment_. Imation will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, purchase from TDK all of its respective requirements for Removable Recording Media Products and Accessory Products that: (i) are in any of the TDK Product Categories, (ii) are to be sold under any TDK Trademark, and (iii) TDK is able to supply with prices, delivery performance and features that are competitive with the prices, delivery performance and features of comparable Removable Recording Media Products and Accessory Products that Imation and its Subsidiaries can purchase from a third party. Any Removable Recording Media Product and Accessory Products subject to the purchase commitment set forth in this _Section 2.3_, will automatically be deemed and become a Product, and, if necessary, the parties will promptly amend _Exhibit I _consistent herewith. For purposes of this _Section 2.3_, "delivery performance" means on-time shipment in accordance with this Agreement. 

  

3\. _Product Changes_  

   

 3.1 _Modifications_. TDK may not change the form, fit or function of a Product Imation is purchasing from TDK without the prior written consent of Imation, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. For the avoidance of doubt, Imation may not withhold or delay consent if TDK proposes a change for the purpose of addressing a Products actual or potential infringement of third party rights, to address safety issues or concerns, or to comply with applicable regulatory requirements; and TDK agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any adverse effect of the proposed change. TDK will notify Imation in advance of, and discuss with Imation, any such change in process or materials that 

   ##### 

  

    

could materially and adversely affect the performance of a Product Imation is
purchasing from TDK. The parties may agree, from time to time, upon
reasonable additional standards and tests to be performed by TDK for any
change in process or materials. TDK will use commercially reasonable efforts
to discuss with Imation in advance the specifications for any new version of a
Product Imation is purchasing from TDK or any new Removable Recording Media
Product or Accessory Product in any of the TDK Product Categories and that
TDK intends to make generally available for sale to its customers. Except as
set forth in _Section 2.2_, nothing in this Agreement shall restrict TDK
from commercializing a new version of a Product or a new product. 

  

 3.2 _Discontinued Products_. TDK may discontinue a Product Imation is purchasing from TDK upon not less than one hundred twenty (120) days written notice to Imation; _provided_ that Imation and its Subsidiaries will have the right to issue a final Purchase Order of the discontinued Product during such period and on such other terms and conditions as are mutually agreed upon between the parties. Such final Purchase Order will be firm, at a fixed price and non-cancelable, and will provide for shipment no later than one (1) year after the order date set forth therein. Products ordered will be non-returnable except as provided in _Section 6.2 _or _9.3_. 

  

 3.3 _New Products_. In the event that (i) Imation or any of its Subsidiaries intends to sell a Removable Recording Media Product under a TDK Trademark that is not in a TDK Product Category (the " _New Product_ "), and (ii) it is commercially reasonable for TDK to supply the New Product (for the avoidance of doubt, as of the Effective Date, it would not be commercially reasonable for TDK to supply flash drives and cards, DVD discs, and HD DVD discs, although any of these may change over time depending on the future direction of TDK), then TDK will have the exclusive right of first negotiation and refusal to supply the New Product as follows: Imation will in good faith and promptly notify TDK in writing of its intention to sell the New Product, provide TDK with draft specifications for the New Product and consult with TDK with respect to the intended market and specifications (the " _New Product Specifications_ ") for the New Product and with respect to other matters relating to its commercialization. Once Imation has completed the New Product Specifications, Imation will deliver them to TDK, and (i) TDK will have the exclusive right to elect whether to supply the New Product to Imation and will exercise such right as promptly as commercially reasonable but not later than thirty (30) days after TDKs receipt of the New Product Specifications; (ii) starting upon TDKs receipt of the New Product Specifications, the parties then will negotiate in good faith and exclusively a price for the New Product that is competitive; and (iii) TDK will provide a commercialization schedule that is competitive. If TDK elects not to supply the New Product, the parties in good faith are unable to agree on such price for the New Product within sixty (60) days after the date on which TDK received the New Product Specifications or TDK does not provide a commercialization schedule that is competitive within sixty (60) days after the date on which TDK received the New Product Specifications, then Imation may make other arrangements for supply of such New Products. Otherwise, the New Product will become subject to the supply and purchase commitments set forth in _Article 2_. Nothing in this _Section 3.3 _will prevent either party from entering into a written joint development agreement with a third party to develop a new product, and Imation shall not be required to buy a New Product from TDK if (i) joint development of the specific New Product under such agreement requires at least a twelve (12)-month period prior to commercial launch and (ii) either (x) Imation manufactures the New 

   ##### 

  

    

Product itself and does not outsource the manufacture of such New Product to
any third party or (y) Imation is required under the joint development
agreement to have the New Product manufactured by the other party to the
joint development agreement. 

  

4\. _Purchase Orders and Forecasts_  

   

 4.1 _Forecasts_. 

  

 (a) To allow TDK to schedule production and control costs, Imation will provide in good faith to TDK a rolling forecast of Products that Imation and its Subsidiaries expect to purchase from TDK for shipment over the next six (6) months, specifying the quantities of Product to be purchased on: (i) a weekly basis for the first month of such forecast and a monthly basis for the remaining five (5) months of such forecast; and (ii) a Product-by-Product and region-by-region basis with respect to each such month and week (the " _Rolling Forecast_ ").

 (b) Imation will be obligated to purchase from TDK in any month (the " _Purchase Month_ ") a quantity of a particular Product for a particular region (the " _Forecasted Product_ ") equal to the highest of the following: 

   

 (i) ** percent (**%) of the quantity of Forecasted Products previously forecasted for the Purchase Month in the Rolling Forecast that was two-prior to the then-current and timely submitted Rolling Forecast (the " _Current Rolling Forecast_ ") (i.e., when the Purchase Month was the third (3rd) month of a preceding Rolling Forecast); 

  

 (ii) ** percent (**%) of the quantity of Forecasted Products previously forecasted for the Purchase Month in the Rolling Forecast prior to the Current Rolling Forecast (i.e., when the Purchase Month was the second (2nd) month of a preceding Rolling Forecast); and 

  

 (iii) ** percent (**%) of the quantity of Forecasted Products forecasted for the Purchase Month in the Current Rolling Forecast (i.e., when the Purchase Month is the first (1st) month of the Current Rolling Forecast).

 4.2 _Purchase Orders_. 

  

 (a) Imation will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, order Products by submitting purchase orders for each forecasted week of the Purchase Month (each, a " _Purchase Order_ ") to TDK no later than two (2) weeks in advance of such forecasted week. Each Purchase Order will specify the type and quantity of Products to be purchased and the requested shipment dates. After receiving a Purchase Order, TDK will issue a confirmation to such Purchase Order (each, a " _Purchase Order Confirmation_ ") no later than five (5) days in advance of such forecasted week. Each Purchase Order Confirmation will: (i) confirm the shipment date requested by Imation or its Subsidiary, as the case may be, or an earlier shipment date or, to the extent TDK is unable to ship by the shipment date requested by Imation or its Subsidiary, as the case may be, and subject TDKs obligations in  _Section 4.6_, specify the earliest date on which TDK is able to ship; and (ii) confirm the quantities requested by Imation or its Subsidiary, as the case may be, or, if TDK is unable to supply the quantities requested by Imation or its Subsidiary, as the case may be, and subject TDKs obligations in _Section 4.6_, specify the quantities which TDK is able to supply. TDK will use commercially reasonable efforts based on lead time and other factors to ship by the shipment date requested by Imation or its Subsidiary, as the case may be; _provided_ , that if TDK fails to ship any Products in accordance with TDKs minimum supply commitment as set forth in _Section 4.1(c) _and such failure is not due in whole or in part to Imation or its Subsidiaries _,_ including as a consequence of a Supply Constraint Situation pursuant to _Section 4.6_, the price for such Products shall be the lower of (i) the price of such Products on the relevant Purchase Order date, and (ii) the price of such Products applicable on the date such Products are actually shipped. In addition, TDK will use commercially reasonable efforts to supply any quantities specified in a Purchase Order that are in excess of TDKs minimum supply commitment for the relevant week as set forth in _Section 4.1(c)_. Once issued, a Purchase Order Confirmation will be binding upon both parties except as provided in  _Section 4.4_. 

   

 (b) Except as otherwise agreed in writing by Imation and TDK, all sales of Products shall be governed by the terms of this Agreement and such terms shall not be varied or supplemented by any terms contained in any Purchase Order or Purchase Order Confirmation or by any course of dealings between TDK and Imation or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to supply and purchase of Products hereunder. Any Purchase Order from any of Imations

 4.3 _Late Shipment_. TDK will notify Imation or its Subsidiary in writing if TDK has any reason to believe that it will be unable to fully supply the quantities of Products which TDK is obligated to supply in any month. If a shipment is delayed, the parties will discuss in good faith whether expedited shipment is necessary based on Imations or its Subsidiaries commitments to customers, availability of inventory and other factors. If the parties agree that expedited shipment is necessary and applicable, TDK will be responsible for the incremental cost of such expedited shipment. 

  

 4.4 _Rescheduling Orders_. Imation and its Subsidiaries will have the right to reschedule the shipment date of any Purchase Order not later than five (5) days prior to the scheduled shipment date; _provided_ that (i) Imation may reschedule the shipment date of any Purchase Order no more than two (2) times, (ii) any re-scheduled shipment date, whether re-scheduled from the original or a re-scheduled shipment date, will occur no later than three (3) months in the aggregate after the original shipment date of such Purchase Order and (iii) the pricing and payment terms, as determined in accordance with _Section 5_, as of, and applicable to, the original scheduled shipment date of such Purchase Order will continue to apply notwithstanding any rescheduled shipment date. Any further rescheduling will be subject to the written agreement of the parties. 

  

 4.5 _Shipment_. Delivery will be CIF (INCOTERMS 2000) to the port specified in the Purchase Order, _provided_ that delivery to any port not listed on _Exhibit IV _will be subject to written agreement of the parties (and a Purchase Order specifying any such port will not be deemed binding until such agreement is reached). Title will pass from TDK to Imation or its Subsidiary, as the case may be, when risk of loss passes. Any change from the foregoing delivery terms will be subject to the written agreement of the parties. 

  

 4.6 _Supply Constraints_. " _Supply Constraint Situation_ " means a shortage of supply, components, materials or capacity affecting the supply of the Products or a particular Product that (a) is industry- or sector-wide, or (b) is caused by demand from TDKs internal or external customers (including but not limited to Imation and its Subsidiaries). TDK will give Imation reasonable notice of any Supply Constraint Situation that may affect the supply of Products to Imation or any of its Subsidiaries which TDK has an obligation to supply under _Section 4._ _1(c)_ (the " _Supply Constraint Product_ "). TDK will use commercially reasonable efforts to give priority to orders for Supply Constraint Products other than those that are LTO Products from Imation and its Subsidiaries over orders from TDKs other customers, subject to pre-existing commitments by TDK, during a Supply Constraint Situation; _provided_ that Imation and its Subsidiaries, in the aggregate, are the largest customer of TDK by revenue and volume for the Supply Constraint Product in the six (6)-month period preceding TDKs notice of a potential Supply Constraint Situation. Imation may, upon reasonable advance written notice to TDK, request that TDK allocate a Supply Constraint Product among Imation and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , that the total allocation for Imation and its Subsidiaries will not be increased or decreased thereby. In the event of a Supply Constraint Situation which is not caused in significant part by demand from Imation and its Subsidiaries, (i) the parties will negotiate in good faith a plan to alleviate the Supply Constraint Situation, including without limitation 

   ##### 

  

    

extending shipment dates, prioritizing certain Purchase Orders for the Supply
Constraint Product and similar actions and (ii), if the parties are unable to
agree upon such a plan with respect to such Supply Constraint Product,
Imation will have a right to the extent TDK is unable to meet its commitments
under _Section 4._ _1(c)_ to purchase Supply Constraint Products from third
parties for the duration of the Supply Constraint Situation and a reasonable
transition period thereafter. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement
or otherwise, the above priority and right to purchase Supply Constraint
Products from a third party will be Imations sole remedy and TDKs
sole liability for shipment delays and failure to supply any Product during a
Supply Constraint Situation and all of TDKs obligations under this Agreement
shall be expressly subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
_Section 4.6_. 

  

5\. _Pricing_  

   

 5.1 _Product Prices_. From the Effective Date through [September 30, 2007], TDK will sell the Products to Imation and its Subsidiaries at the prices set forth on _Exhibit II _(the " _Initial Product Prices_ "). Thereafter, the parties will determine the prices of the Products in accordance with the pricing methodology set forth on _Exhibit II_. 

  

 5.2 _Post-Effective Date Adjustment to Initial Product Prices_  

  

 (a) Imation will have the right to have its independent accountants inspect, upon reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours for a period of not more than twenty (20) Business Days after the Effective Date, TDKs accounts and other records solely for the purpose of confirming that the Initial Product Prices were determined materially in accordance with the pricing methodology set forth on _Exhibit II_. Subject to Imation and its independent accountants agreement to abide by reasonable confidentiality covenants, TDK shall make its accounts and other records used in preparing the Initial Product Prices available to Imations independent accountants at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice in connection with the resolution by Imation and TDK of any objections to the Initial Product Prices. 

   

 (b) If Imation has any objections to the Initial Product Prices based on the review of its independent accountants, Imation will deliver a written statement describing in reasonable detail such objections to TDK within thirty (30) days of the Effective Date. Imation and TDK shall attempt in good faith to resolve any such objections. If Imation and TDK do not reach a resolution of all objections within thirty (30) days after TDK has received a statement of objections from Imation, they shall submit the issues to the Strategic Relationship Committee for resolution. 

   

 (c) If the Strategic Relationship Committee does not resolve all Imations objections to the Initial Product Prices within thirty (30) days of submission of the objections by either party to the Strategic Relationship Committee, then the parties shall submit the unresolved issues to Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (the " _Independent Accountants_ ") for resolution. The Independent Accountants shall be directed to determine whether Imations objections would require any change to the Initial Product Prices in accordance with the pricing methodology set forth on _Exhibit II_. The parties shall provide to the Independent Accountants, within twenty (20) Business Days after its retention, a definitive statement of the position of each party with respect to each unresolved objection and shall advise the Independent Accountants that the parties accept   ##### 

  

  

  

the accounting firm as the appropriate Person to interpret this Agreement for
all purposes relevant to the resolution of the unresolved objections. Subject
to reasonable confidentiality covenants, TDK shall provide the Independent
Accountants access to the books, records, accounts and other records to the
extent used in preparing the Initial Product Prices to the extent necessary
to resolve any unresolved objections. The parties shall request the
Independent Accountants to carry out a review of the unresolved objections
and prepare a written statement of its determination regarding each
unresolved objection together with its calculation of the Final Initial
Product Prices (as defined below) based on its resolution of the parties
objections (the " _Independent Accountant s Determination_") within thirty
(30) days. The Independent Accountants Determination shall be set forth in
writing and shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties. If Imation
and TDK submit any unresolved objections to the Independent Accountants for
resolution as provided in this section, (i) each of the parties shall bear
its own costs and expenses and (ii) the fees and expenses of the Independent
Accountants shall be borne equally by the parties. 

   

 (d) After the date on which the final Initial Product Prices (the " _Final Initial Product Prices_ ") shall have been finally determined pursuant to this _Section 5.2_: 

   

 (i) Within seven (7) days the parties will revise _Exhibit II _to reflect the Final Initial Product Prices; 

  

 (ii) If any of the Final Initial Product Prices exceeds the Initial Product Price for the corresponding Product and Imation or its Subsidiaries has paid TDK any amounts based on such Initial Product Price, within thirty (30) days Imation will pay to TDK an amount equal to the difference between (a) the aggregate amount Imation and its Subsidiaries would have paid based on the Final Product Prices and (b) the aggregate amount paid by Imation and its Subsidiaries based on the Initial Product Prices; and 

  

 (iii) If any of the Final Initial Product Prices is less than Initial Product Price for the corresponding Product and Imation or its Subsidiaries has paid TDK any amounts based on such Initial Product Price, within thirty (30) days TDK shall pay to Imation an amount equal to the difference between (a) the aggregate amount paid by Imation and its Subsidiaries based on the Initial Product Prices and (b) the aggregate amount Imation and its Subsidiaries would have paid based on the Final Product Prices. 

  

 5.3 _Delivery Costs_. All prices will be delivery CIF (INCOTERMS 2000) to the port named by Imation or its Subsidiary, as the case may be, in the applicable Purchase Order forwarded pursuant to _Section 4.2_. If Imation or any of its Subsidiaries requests delivery to a port other than those listed on _Exhibit IV_, then Imation or such Subsidiary will be responsible for any additional export, shipping, insurance and other costs that are in excess of the cost of delivery CIF (INCOTERMS 2000) to the nearest port listed on _Exhibit IV_; _provided_ , that Imation may designate two (2) of the five (5) ports listed on _Exhibit IV _for Mexico, Central America and South America (collectively, " _Latin America_ ") as Imations primary ports in Latin America (the " _Primary Latin American Ports_ "), and only the Primary Latin American Ports will be considered to be ports listed in _Exhibit IV _for purposes of allocating the costs of delivery under this _Section_  

   ##### 

  

 

 _5.3_. The Primary Latin American Ports will be [ _ _]
and [ _ _]1 on the Effective Date. From time to time,
Irene may change the Primary Latin American Ports to different Latin American
ports listed on _Exhibit IV _by written notice to Titan, which notice will
be effective as the first day of the month following delivery of the notice.
Imation shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use good faith commercial
efforts to request in a Purchase Order that any single shipment to any
particular port in Latin America or the United State be in container
or greater quantities, to the extent consistent with business circumstances.
If, at any given time, the monthly quantities of Products being delivered to
Latin America merit consideration of increasing the number of Primary Latin
American Ports, Imation and TDK shall consider in good faith a request from
Imation to increase the number of Primary Latin American Ports to a maximum of
five (5). 

   

 5.4 _Resale Prices_. Imation and its Subsidiaries will be solely responsible for determining their resale prices for the Products. 

  

 5.5 _Payment_. TDK will invoice Imation or its Subsidiaries for Products shipped under this Agreement at the time of shipment. Unless otherwise agreed, invoices shall be payable in U.S. Dollars within ninety (90) days after the date of shipment. In addition to and not in lieu or limitation of any other remedies TDK may have, if Imation fails to pay invoices when due under this Agreement TDK may request and the Strategic Relationship Committee will consider in good faith imposing on Imation additional terms, including but not limited to interest for late payments, reduced payment periods for future shipments, suspensions of shipment and other potential remedies. 

  

 5.6 _Taxes_. 

  

 (a) The Product prices, as determined by the parties in accordance with _Exhibit III_, are exclusive of, and Imation shall pay, any present or future national, state or local sales, use, excise or similar tax, levy, impost, fee, assessment, deduction, charge or foreign shipping charges, including without limitation forwarding, agent or brokerage fees, consular invoices, document fees and duties imposed on any payment by any taxing or other authority (any of the foregoing charges, a " _Tax_ "), except to the extent of TDKs obligation to pay any Taxes according to delivery CIF (INCOTERMS 2000) to the port named by Imation or its Subsidiary, as the case may be, in the applicable Purchase Order forwarded pursuant to _Section 4.2_. 

   

 (b) Any amounts payable under any provision of this Agreement by Imation and its Subsidiaries shall be paid without deduction or withholding for or on account of any Taxes. If Imation or its Subsidiary is required by law to deduct or withhold any Tax from or in respect of any amount payable hereunder to TDK other than Taxes payable by TDK under this Agreement: (i) Imation or such Subsidiary shall pay the relevant taxing or other authority the minimum amount necessary to comply with the applicable law; (ii) Imation or such Subsidiary shall make such payment prior to the date on which interest or penalty is attached thereto; and (iii) the amount payable hereunder shall be increased as may be necessary so that after Imation or

    1  |   | Imation will designate the two Primary Latin American
Ports prior to the execution of this Agreement.  
      ##### 

  

      

such Subsidiary makes all required deductions or withholdings, TDK shall
receive an amount equal to the amount it would have received had no such
deductions or withholdings been made. 

   

 (c) Neither TDK, on the one hand, nor Imation and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall be responsible for taxes assessed on the other partys net income. 

   

6\. _Quality_  

   

 6.1 _Inspection_. TDK will use commercially reasonable efforts to inspect and sort all Products and ship to Imation Products conforming to all applicable warranties. Imation, however, reserves the right to inspect, upon reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours a reasonable number of times per year and subject to reasonable confidentiality and other restrictions, TDKs facilities for manufacturing the Products. 

  

 6.2 _Acceptance_. Imation, and any Imation Subsidiary ordering Products hereunder, will have the right, at its expense, to inspect and test units of the Products for a period of forty-five (45) days beginning on delivery by TDK at the CIF point (the " _Acceptance Period_ ") and to accept or reject, on a per-unit basis, the Products based on whether the Products comply with the warranties set forth in _Section 9_. Imation will be deemed to have accepted the Products unless TDK receives written notice of rejection, specifying the units rejected and the basis therefore, within the Acceptance Period; _provided_ that acceptance by Imation or its Subsidiaries under this _Section 6.2_ will not constitute a waiver of the warranties and remedies in _Section 9_. If Imation rejects non-conforming Products, the parties will determine by mutual agreement whether credit, repair or replacement is the appropriate remedy. Any return of non-conforming goods by Imation as provided in the foregoing will be via TDKs return materials authorization ("RMA") process. TDK will bear all costs of transportation and risk of loss for shipment of nonconforming Products to and from Imation or its Subsidiaries and Imation will bear all other costs of transportation and risk of loss for shipment of conforming Products to and from Imation or its Subsidiaries. 

  

 6.3 _Quality Management_. TDK will participate on a non-binding basis only in Imations Total Quality Management programs upon request by Imation.1 The parties will mutually agree on an initial quality plan implementing such programs (the " _Quality Plan_ "). The parties acknowledge and agree that any quality programs and the Quality Plan, and any criteria, targets and goals in connection with any of the foregoing, are not binding in any way and will not affect in any manner TDKs obligations in connection with this Agreement or otherwise, including without limitation the warranties set forth in _Section 9 _and the Product Specifications. 

  

7\. _Packaging and Labeling_  

   

 7.1 _Packaging Specifications_. All Products sold by TDK to Imation or its Subsidiaries will comply with the labeling, artwork and packaging specifications set forth on _Exhibit VI_ (collectively, the " _Packaging Specifications_ "), which may be amended, modified or supplemented only by mutual written agreement of TDK and Imation. TDK will purchase sufficient quantities of packaging supplies, artwork and/or labeling in order to supply Products in 

   

 



 

       |   |   
---|---|--- 
    2  |   | Imation will provide its Quality Management Programs for

own all packaging supplies until they are shipped with the Products. 

   

 7.2 _Use of Trademarks_. TDK and Imation will work together to ensure that the Packaging Specifications will at all times be in compliance with the Quality Guidelines. 

  

8\. _Product Technical and Customer Support_  

   

 TDK will provide third-level technical support, i.e., engineering rather than direct customer or day-to-day Product support. 

  

9\. _Warranties_  

   

 9.1 _Compliance with Laws, etc_. TDK and Imation each agrees to comply with all laws, regulations, ordinances and rules that pertain to its business. In addition, TDK represents and warrants that Products sold to Imation under this Agreement will have been manufactured and sold in compliance with Restriction of the use of certain Hazardous Substances in electrical and electronic equipment in the European Union ("RoHS") and certain other laws, regulations, ordinances and rules agreed upon by the parties in writing from time to time (collectively, " _Rules_ "). Upon request, each party will reasonably cooperate with the other regarding compliance with the Rules. TDK will also ensure that the results of any changes or modifications to the Products as permitted under this Agreement will comply with the Rules and TDK will use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any adverse effect of such change. Imation will not unreasonably withhold its consent to changes or modifications intended to ensure such compliance. 

  

 9.2 _Additional Warranties_. TDK represents and warrants that for a period of eighteen (18) months from the date of delivery to the CIF point, the Products (i) are free from material defects in materials and workmanship; and (ii) conform to all Product Specifications and Packaging Specifications. The foregoing warranties shall not apply to any Products that are defective in whole or in part because of: (a) accident, abuse, misuse, negligence, modification, or improper maintenance (including static discharge, improper installation, repair, or accident) except when done by TDK; (b) a product, service or subcomponent (within a Product) that a vendor or supplier required or controlled by Imation or any of its Subsidiaries provides, qualifies, controls, or is otherwise responsible for; or (c) use or storage in an environment other than an environment specified in the Product Specifications. 

  

 9.3 _Remedies_. If any Product fails to meet the warranties given in this _Section 9_, TDK will, as agreed with Imation or its Subsidiary, provide a credit for, repair or replace the nonconforming Product within a reasonable time after written notification of the nonconformity and return of the Product via TDKs RMA process to TDK. TDK will bear all costs of transportation and risk of loss for shipment of nonconforming Products to and from Imation or its Subsidiaries and Imation will bear all other costs of transportation and risk of loss for shipment of conforming Products to and from Imation or its Subsidiaries. Acceptance by Imation or its Subsidiaries of delivery of any Product or payment therefor will not constitute a waiver of any warranty under this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 9.4 _Disclaimer of Other Warranties_. EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES STATED IN THIS  _SECTION 9_ (WARRANTIES), TDK DOES NOT PROVIDE AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW ALL WARRANTIES (EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE) RELATING TO THE PRODUCTS, PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS, OR OTHER INFORMATION PROVIDED HEREUNDER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES THAT MAY ARISE FROM COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE. IN ADDITION, THE REMEDIES SET FORTH IN THIS _SECTION 9_ CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND COMPLETE RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF IMATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND SOLE OBLIGATION AND LIABILITY OF TDK FOR BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN THIS _SECTION 9_. 

  

10\. _Indemnification_  

   

 10.1 _Product Liability_. Each party will indemnify and hold harmless the other party, its Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, employees, contract workers and agents against any Loss arising from or relating to any Third-Party Action alleging any injury to or death of any person or damage to or destruction of property resulting from any defect in a Product caused by the indemnifying partys defective materials or workmanship or negligent, reckless or willful act or omission, but specifically excluding defects caused by a negligent, reckless or willful act or omission of the other party, its Subsidiary or any of their respective employees, contract workers, agents or other representatives. 

  

 10.2 _Intellectual Property_. TDK will indemnify and hold harmless Imation, its Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, employees, contract workers and agents (collectively, " _Imation Indemnified Parties_ ") against any Loss arising from or relating to any Third-Party Action alleging that any Product as supplied by TDK and except with respect to the TDK Trademarks infringes or misappropriates any patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property right of any third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that TDK will have no indemnification obligation under this _Section 10.2_: (a) if the alleged infringement or misappropriation is primarily attributable to the designs or specifications of Imation except to the extent that such designs or specifications (i) are TDKs specifications or designs for the particular Product in question or (ii) are required for compliance with a then-current industry standard established by a recognized standards organization; (b) to the extent that the Third-Party Action arises from or is caused by any modification of a Product by Imation or a third party not authorized by TDK; or (c) to the extent that the Third-Party Action would have been avoided but for the combination, operation, or use of the Product with devices, parts, software or other materials not supplied or approved by TDK. Except to the extent TDK is obligated to indemnify any Imation Indemnified Parties pursuant to this _Section 10.2_, Imation will indemnify and hold harmless and defend TDK, its Subsidiaries or their respective directors, officers, employees, contract workers and agents against any Loss arising from or relating to any Third-Party Action alleging that any Product supplied by TDK and resold by Imation or its Subsidiaries infringes or misappropriates any patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property right of any third party. 

   ##### 

  

  

 10.3 _Claims_. The party entitled to be indemnified (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") will give prompt written notice to the party liable for such indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of any Third-Party Action which is reasonably anticipated to give rise to any claim for which indemnification may be required under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of the Indemnified Party to provide such notice will not affect the Indemnifying Partys obligations under this _Section 10 _if such failure does not materially prejudice the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnified Party notifies the Indemnifying Party of a Third-Party Action against the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party acknowledges is a Third-Party Action for which it must indemnify the Indemnified Party under this Supply Agreement, the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to assume the defense and control of the Third-Party Action at its own cost and expense; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Indemnified Party (as applicable) will have the right to be represented by its own counsel at its own cost in such matters. Neither Imation nor TDK may concede, settle or compromise any Third-Party Action without the consent of the other party, such consents not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each party will reasonably cooperate with the other party and its counsel in the course of the defense of any the Third-Party Action, such cooperation to include without limitation using reasonable efforts to provide or make available documents, information and witnesses.

" _Confidential Information_ " means all information disclosed by one party to the other party (the " _Recipient_ ") (in writing, orally or in any other form) that is (i) designated, at or before the time of disclosure, as confidential and (ii) the Product Specifications; the specifications for any new version of a Product or any new Removable Recording Media Product or Accessory Product disclosed in connection with _Section 3.1_; the New Product Specifications; Imations Purchase Orders and forecasts for purchases of the Products; and the supply price, pricing trends and related information disclosed in connection with Exhibit III. The party disclosing Confidential Information shall be a " _Discloser_ " and the party receiving Confidential Information shall be a " _Recipient_." 

  

 11.2 _Exclusions_. Confidential Information does not include information or material that (a) is now, or hereafter becomes, through no act or failure to act on the part of the Recipient, generally known or available; (b) is or was known by the Recipient at or before the time such information or material was received from the Discloser; (c) is furnished to the Recipient by a third party that is not under an obligation of confidentiality to the Discloser with respect to such information or material; or (d) is independently developed by the Recipient. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 11.2 _shall modify or limit in any way TDKs obligations in the Acquisition Agreement with respect to Confidential Information (as such term is defined in the Acquisition Agreement). 

  

 11.3 _Restrictions on Use_. During the term of this Agreement and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, the Recipient shall hold Confidential Information in confidence and shall not disclose to third parties or use such information for any purpose whatsoever other than as necessary in order to fulfill its obligations or exercise its rights under this Agreement. The Recipient shall take all reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of the Disclosers Confidential Information in a manner that is at least protective as the measures it uses to maintain the confidentiality of its own Confidential Information of similar importance. 

   ##### 

  

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Recipient may disclose the Disclosers
Confidential Information: (a) to employees and consultants that have a need
to know such information, _provided_  that each such employee and consultant
is under a duty of nondisclosure that is consistent with the confidentiality

 12.1 _Guaranty_. Imation hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to TDK the punctual performance and payment of all the obligations and liabilities of each of its Subsidiaries under any Purchase Orders submitted in connection with this Agreement (the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "), when and as due, and agrees that if for any reason whatsoever any of Imations Subsidiaries fails to or is unable to duly, punctually and fully perform or pay any of the Guaranteed Obligations when and as due, upon notice in writing from TDK to Imation, Imation shall promptly perform or pay each and every such Guaranteed Obligation.

EXHIBIT M 

   

TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT 

   

 This TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made as of _ _, 2007, by and between Imation Corp., a Delaware corporation (" _Imation_ "), and TDK Corporation, a Japanese corporation (" _TDK_ "). Imation, on the one hand, and TDK, on the other hand, are each referred to herein as a " _Party_ " and, together, as the " _Parties_." 

  

 WHEREAS, Imation and TDK are parties to an Acquisition Agreement dated as of _ _, 2007 (the " _Acquisition Agreement_ "); 

  

 WHEREAS, to facilitate Imations operation of the Business (as defined in the Acquisition Agreement) in an effective manner for a period of time after the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement, TDK has agreed to provide to Imation certain services for the periods and on the terms and conditions set forth herein; and 

  

 WHEREAS, it is a condition to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement that Imation and TDK enter into this Agreement. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements and covenants set forth herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which is hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties agree as follows: 

  

1\. SERVICES 

  

1.1 _General_. During the Term, TDK shall, either directly or through its
subsidiaries (each a " _TDK Subsidiary_ "), provide the services set forth in
the statements (each a " _Statement of Work_ ") set out in _Attachment A_
hereto (the " _Services_ ") to Imation or its subsidiaries (each an "
_Imation Subsidiary_ ") in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement and in the respective Statements of Work. Services will
be provided hereunder in Japan, ** and the U.S. (the " _Service Locations_
"). The Statements of Work set forth for each Service Location (i) the
Services to be provided in such Service Location, (ii) the applicable Service
Providers and Service Recipients, and (iii) other agreed terms with respect
to Services in such Service Location. The Parties may, from time to time,
agree to additional Statements of Work to replace or supplement those set out
in  _Attachment A_ with respect to any Services. For the avoidance of doubt,
no services other than those set forth in _Attachment A_ will be provided
pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

1.2 _Service Providers_. TDK may provide any or all of the Services through
any Service Provider. For purposes of this Agreement: " _Service Provider_ "
means, with respect to any of such Services, TDK or the TDK Subsidiary
designated in the Statement of Work applicable to those Services. Where a TDK
Subsidiary is the Service Provider, TDK shall: (i) supervise the
performance of such Service Provider to ensure that the Service Provider
complies with the obligations that apply to Service Providers under this
Agreement; (ii) impose on such Service Provider the same confidentiality
obligations that apply to TDK under this Agreement; and (iii) 

  

 



 

       |   |   
---|---|--- 
    **  |   | The appearance of a double asterisk denotes confidential
information that has been omitted from the exhibit and filed separately,
accompanied by a confidential treatment request, with the Securities and
Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. 
    ##### 

  

   

remain fully responsible for the complete performance of such Services by such
Service Provider in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and be liable
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement for any Service Providers
noncompliance with any terms of this Agreement. 

  

1.3 _Service Recipients_. Each Service Provider shall provide the relevant
Services to the Service Recipient. For purposes of this Agreement: " _Service
Recipient_ " means, with respect to any of such Services, Imation or the
Imation Subsidiary designated in the Statement of Work applicable to those
Services. Where an Imation Subsidiary is the Service Recipient, Imation
shall: (i) supervise such Service Recipient to ensure that the Service
Recipient complies with the obligations that apply to Service Recipients
under this Agreement; (ii) impose on such Service Recipient the same
confidentiality obligations that apply to Imation under this Agreement;
and (iii) remain fully responsible for the complete performance of this
Agreement, including for the payment of any fees invoiced to a Service
Recipient pursuant to Section 2.1 below, and be liable in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement for any Service Recipients noncompliance with
any terms of this Agreement. In providing Services under this Agreement, each
Service Provider shall be entitled to rely upon and shall comply with the
instructions, communications and other acts of the respective Service
Recipient to the extent the same are consistent with the provisions of
this Agreement. 

  

1.4 _Scope and Level of Services_. The scope, nature, volume, and quality of
each of the Services (the " _Service Profile_ ") shall be as specified in the
applicable Statement of Work. To the extent that the relevant Statement of
Work makes no specific provision as to the Service Profile of a Service, the
Service Profile shall be substantially the same as the Service Profile of the
same service provided or self-provided by the relevant Service Provider to the
Business during the twelve (12)-month period immediately preceding the
Closing Date. If Imation requests the provision of services that are not set
forth in _Attachment A_ , the Parties shall follow the procedure set out in
Section 1.7. 

  

1.5 _Designated Representatives_. Each Party shall name a global point of
contact (the " _Designated Representative_ ") who shall be responsible for
the overall implementation of this Agreement, including attempted resolution
of any issues that may arise during the performance of the Services.
Imations initial Designated Representative shall be [Stephen Bradley], and
TDKs initial Designated Representative shall be [___], with such successors
as may be notified by the relevant party to the other from time to time. Each
Party shall also designate a project manager for the day-to-day coordination
of the specific Services to be provided under each Statement of Work (the "
_Project Managers_ ") whose identities shall be set out in the respective
Statements of Work. 

  

1.6 _Third-Party Services_. Except as otherwise expressly stated in the
applicable Statement of Work or as otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties
during the Term, any services provided to the Business prior to the Closing
Date by third-party service providers are outside of the scope of the
Services. At Imations request, TDK shall provide commercially reasonable
assistance to Imation with obtaining the same or similar services for the
Business from such third-party service providers. This assistance may
include, subject to agreement by the relevant third-party service provider,
novation of the relevant service agreement, or relevant part thereof, by TDK
to 

  ##### 

  

   

Imation. Any such novation shall be documented in writing in a separate
agreement and shall release TDK as a party and from all further obligations
under the relevant agreements or portions thereof. 

  

1.7 _Additional Services_. If requested by Imation, a Service Provider may
provide services in addition to the Services set forth on _Attachment A_. The
scope of any such services, as well as the prices and other terms applicable
to such services, shall be as mutually agreed by the Parties prior to the
start of such services. 

  

1.8 _Alternatives_. If a Service Provider reasonably believes it is unable to
provide any Service because of a failure to obtain necessary consents,
licenses, sublicenses or approvals, or the Service Provider reasonably
believes that performance of the Service would infringe or misappropriate a
third partys intellectual property rights, and the Service Provider is unable
to arrange for such Service to be performed by an acceptable independent
contractor as provided in Section 1.4 above, the Parties shall cooperate to
determine the best alternative approach. Until such alternative approach is
determined, the Service Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
continue providing the Services; _provided_ , that the Service Provider shall
have no obligation to provide a Service if it reasonably believes that
performance of the Service would infringe or misappropriate a third partys
intellectual property rights or would be in contravention of any applicable
law. 

  

1.9 _Cooperation_. Each Service Recipient will cooperate with the relevant
Service Provider and provide it with such information and assistance as the
Service Provider reasonably requires to enable it to provide the Services.
Subject to Section 7.16, the Service Recipient shall allow the Service
Provider and its employees, agents and sub-contractors reasonable access to
its facilities as necessary for the performance of the Services. 

  

1.10 _Dependence on Service Recipients_. The Service Recipient recognizes and
agrees that the provision of the Services are dependent on the Service
Recipient or other Imation Affiliates complying with their obligations as set
forth below. The Service Provider shall not be responsible and shall have no
liability for any failure to provide or delay in providing Services in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement if such failure or delay results
from: 

   

       | (a)  |   | the failure of the Service Recipient to perform
any of the obligations or to make available any of the facilities set forth
in any applicable Statement of Work in relation to each Service;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | the failure of the Service Recipient to comply with its
obligations under Section 1.9; or  
      
    | (c)  |   | the failure of the Service Recipient to comply with any
other obligation under this Agreement.  
   

 

1.11 _Service Provider Employees_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement (including any Statement of Work) to the contrary , Imation
acknowledges and agrees that following the date hereof, the Service Providers
may not be able to retain their employees who 

  ##### 

  

   

are needed to provide Services hereunder; the Service Providers do not intend
(and shall have no obligation) to hire replacements for any employees whose
employment terminates for any reason; and the Service Providers obligations
to provide Services hereunder (including the quality, amount and other
attributes of such Services) shall be subject to the Service Providers having
sufficient employees to provide the Services. This Section 1.11 shall have no
application with respect to any Services provided in or with respect to **. 

  

2\. FEES AND PAYMENTS 

  

2.1 _Fees_. 

   

       | (a)  |   | Except as otherwise provided in any applicable
Statement of Work, the fees charged by the Service Provider for Services
hereunder (" _Service Fees_ ") shall be equal to the Service Providers fully
allocated cost for such Services, including without limitation (a) all

that is designated, at or before the time of disclosure, as confidential.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | _Exclusions_. Confidential Information does not include
information or material that: (a) is now, or hereafter becomes, through no
act or failure to act on the part of the Recipient, generally known or
available; (b) is or was known by the Recipient at or before the time such
information or material was received from the Discloser; (c) is furnished to

Confidential Information in confidence and shall not disclose to third
parties or use such information for any purpose whatsoever other than as
necessary in order to fulfill its obligations or exercise its rights under
this Agreement. The Recipient shall take all reasonable measures to protect
the confidentiality of the Disclosers Confidential Information in a manner

the Services described herein in a timely and professional manner consistent
with industry standards, in accordance with Section 1.4 above and all
applicable law. 

  

4.2 _Disclaimer of Warranties_. Except as expressly set forth in Section 4.1,
neither TDK nor any Service Provider provides, and each of them hereby
disclaims, to the maximum extent allowed under applicable law all warranties
(express, implied or otherwise) in connection with the Services provided
hereunder or otherwise arising under or in connection with this Agreement,
including without limitation any implied warranties of non-infringement,
merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, and any warranties that

Provider and TDK.

5.3 _Effects of Termination_.

6\. INDEMNIFICATION. 

  

6.1 _Intellectual Property_. TDK will indemnify and hold harmless Imation, its
Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, employees, contract
workers and agents (collectively, " _Imation Indemnified Parties_ ") against
any Loss arising from or relating to any claim by a third party (such claim,
a " _Third-Party Action_ ") alleging that any Service as supplied by
a Service Provider infringes or misappropriates any patent, copyright,
trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property right of any third
party; _provided_ , _however_ , that TDK will have no indemnification
obligation under this Section 6.1 to the extent that (a) the alleged
infringement or misappropriation is primarily attributable to any Service
specifications made by Imation or a Service Recipient except to the extent
that such specifications are from TDK or required for compliance with a then-
current industry standard established by a recognized standards organization;
(b) to the extent that the Third-Party Action arises from or is caused by any
action by Imation or a Service Recipient that constitutes a breach of this
agreement or the violation of any statute, law, ordinance or regulation in
connection with the receipt of the Services hereunder. 

  

6.2 _Claims_. The party entitled to be indemnified (the " _Indemnified Party_
") will give prompt written notice to the party liable for such
indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of any Third-Party Action
which is reasonably anticipated to give rise to any claim for which
indemnification may be required under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the failure of the Indemnified Party to provide such notice will not
affect the Indemnifying Partys obligations under this Section 6 if such
failure does not materially prejudice the Indemnifying Party. If
the Indemnified Party notifies the Indemnifying Party of a Third-Party Action
against the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party acknowledges is a
Third-Party Action for which it must indemnify the Indemnified Party under
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to assume the defense
and control of the Third-Party Action at its own cost and expense; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Indemnified Party (as applicable) will have the right
to be represented by its own counsel at its own cost in such matters. Neither
Imation nor TDK may concede, settle or compromise any Third-Party Action
without the consent of the other party, such consents not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each party will reasonably cooperate with
the other party and its counsel in the course of the defense of any the
Third-Party Action, such cooperation to include without limitation using
reasonable efforts to provide or make available documents, information
and witnesses.
