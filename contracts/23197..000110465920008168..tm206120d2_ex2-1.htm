ARTICLE II 
 THE MERGER

  



  

2.1 _  _ _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the ICL, at
the Effective Time, Merger Sub (as the target company ( _Chevrat Ha 'Ya'ad_)
in the Merger) shall be merged with and into the Company (as the absorbing
company ( _HaChevra Ha 'Koletet_) in the Merger). As a result of the Merger,
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company
shall continue as the surviving company (the  "Surviving Company") and shall
(a) become a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent; (b) continue to be
governed by the Laws of the State of Israel; (c) maintain a registered office
in the State of Israel; and (d) succeed to and assume all of the rights,
properties and obligations of Merger Sub and the Company in accordance with
the ICL.

  



  

2.2 _  _ _The Effective Time_. As soon as practicable after
the determination of the date on which the Closing is to take place in
accordance with _Section 2.3_ , each of the Company and Merger Sub shall (and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to), in coordination with each other, deliver
to the Registrar of Companies of the State of Israel (the "Companies
Registrar") a notice of the contemplated Merger and the proposed date of the
Closing, in which notice the Parties shall request that the
Companies Registrar issue a certificate evidencing the Merger in accordance
with Section 323(5) of the ICL (the "Certificate of Merger") on the date that
the Parties shall provide further notice to the Companies Registrar that the
Closing has occurred, and the Parties shall deliver such further notice to
the Companies Registrar on the Closing Date. The Merger shall become
effective upon the issuance by the Companies Registrar of the Certificate of
Merger in accordance with Section 323(5) of the ICL (the time at which the
Merger becomes effective is referred to herein as the "Effective Time").

  



  

2.3 _  _ _The Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_ , the consummation of the Merger
shall take place at a closing (the "Closing") to occur at the offices of
Goldfarb Seligman and Co., Tel Aviv, Israel, at 10:00 a.m. (Israel local time)
on the third Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent
permitted hereunder) of the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions
set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their terms
can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of such conditions), or at
such other location, date and time as Parent and the Company shall mutually
agree upon in writing; provided, that, notwithstanding the satisfaction or
waiver of all of the applicable conditions set forth in _Article VII_ , Parent
and Merger Sub shall not be obligated to effect the Closing prior to the
third (3rd) Business Day following the final day of the Marketing Period,
unless Parent shall request an earlier date to effect the Closing on at least
two (2) Business Days' prior written notice to the Company (but, subject in
such case, to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the applicable conditions
set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature
can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or
waiver of those conditions at the Closing))(the date upon which the Closing
shall actually occur pursuant hereto being referred to herein as the "Closing
Date"). For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, it is the intention of the Parties that the Merger
being declared effective and that the issuance by the Companies Registrar of
the Certificate of Merger in accordance with Section 323(5) of the ICL shall
both occur on the Closing Date.

  



  

2.4 _  _ _Effect of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the
effects set forth in the ICL and this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, by
virtue of, and simultaneously with, the Merger and without any further action
on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any Company Shareholder, (a)
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the
Surviving Company; (b) all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Company;
(c) all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall
become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company; and (d)
all the rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company
(as the Surviving Company) shall continue unaffected by the Merger in
accordance with the ICL.

  



   

-17-

 



    



  

  

2.5 _  _ _Memorandum and Articles of Association_. At the
Effective Time, the memorandum of association of the Company, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the memorandum of
association of the Surviving Company, until duly amended as provided therein,
herein and by Applicable Law. At the Effective Time, the articles of
association of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the articles of association of the Surviving Company, except
that references to the name of Merger Sub shall be replaced by references to
the name of the Surviving Company, until duly amended as provided therein,
herein and by Applicable Law.

  



  

2.6 _  _ _Directors and Officers_.

  



  

(a)   _Directors_. The Parties shall take all actions
necessary so that the director or directors of Merger Sub at the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be appointed and
serve as the only director or directors of the Surviving Company until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

  



  

(b)   _Officers_. At the Effective Time, the officers of the
Company as of the Effective Time shall be the only officers of the Surviving
Company, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the
case may be.

  



  

2.7 _  _ _Effect on Share Capital_.

  



  

(a)   _Share Capital_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, or the holders of any of the following securities, the following
shall occur:

  



  

(i)   _Company Shares_. Each Company Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be
cancelled in accordance with Section 2.7(a)(ii)), shall automatically be
converted into and represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
without interest and less applicable Taxes required to be withheld, in each
case in the manner provided in Section 2.8 and Section 2.13 (or in the case
of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit in
the manner provided in Section 2.10). No certificate or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates or with respect to book-entry shares, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a shareholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, each holder of Company Shares converted pursuant
to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of
a share of Parent Common Stock shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash, without
interest, in an amount equal to (A) such fractional part of a share of Parent
Common Stock multiplied by (B) the Parent Average Trading Price.

  



  

(ii)   _Owned Company Shares_. Each Company Share held in the
treasury of the Company (dormant shares) or on behalf of the Company, if any,
or held by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company or of Parent, in each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
if any, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and no payment hereunder shall be made
with respect thereto.

  



  

(iii)   _Share Capital of Merger Sub_. Each ordinary share,
nominal value NIS 0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically
converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable ordinary
share, nominal value NIS 0.20 per share, of the Surviving Company, and such
ordinary shares shall constitute the only outstanding share capital of the
Surviving Company.

  



  

(b)   _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. Without limiting
the other provisions of this Agreement, including _Sections 5.1_ and _5.2_
hereof, if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, the Company should split, combine or otherwise
reclassify the Company Shares, or make a distribution or dividend in shares of
Company Shares (including any distribution or dividend of securities
convertible into Company Shares), or engage in a
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or exchange or other like
change, then (without limiting any other rights of Parent or Merger Sub
hereunder), the Merger Consideration shall be ratably adjusted to reflect
fully the effect of any such change.

  



   

-18-

 



    



  

  

(c)   _Adjustments to Stock Merger Consideration_. Without
limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, including _Sections 5.3_ and
_5.4_ hereof, the Stock Merger Consideration shall automatically be adjusted
to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities of a
Subsidiary of Parent or of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to the Parent Common Stock.

  



  

2.8 _  _ _Payment Procedures_.

  



  

(a)   _Exchange Fund Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall (i) select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company (the "Paying Agent") to act as the payment agent for the payment and
delivery of the Merger Consideration and the fractional share consideration,
as provided in _Section 2.7(a)(i)_ ; and (ii) select an information agent
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Information Agent") to assist in
obtaining any requisite residency certificate or other declaration for
Israeli Tax withholding purposes.

  



  

(b)   _Exchange Fund_. On the Closing Date, Parent shall
deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent, or, if Parent so
elects, the 102 Trustee or another entity reasonably acceptable to the Company
(any, or any combination, of the foregoing the "Exchange Fund Agent") for
payment to (i) the holders of Company Shares (excluding Company Shares
issued upon exercise of Company 102 Options ("Company 102 Shares")); (ii) the
holders of Company 102 Shares and Company 102 Options (other than Company 102
Options which are Converted Options), in each case in respect of which Parent
shall cause payment to be made by the Exchange Fund Agent to the 102 Trustee;
and (iii) the holders of Company Options (other than Company 102 Options, and
the Converted Options), in respect of which Parent shall cause payment to be
made by the Exchange Fund Agent to the Company pursuant to the provisions of
this _Article II_ , (A) evidence of the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)(i)_ in book-entry form sufficient to issue the
aggregate Stock Merger Consideration; (B) cash in an aggregate
amount necessary to pay the Cash Merger Consideration; and (C) cash in an
aggregate amount necessary to make the aggregate payments in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, calculated in accordance with
_Section 2.7(a)(i)_ (such amount referenced in clauses (B) and (C), together
with the evidence of book-entry shares of Parent Common Stock, the "Exchange
Fund"). Parent shall cause the Exchange Fund Agent to make, and the Exchange
Fund Agent shall make, payments of the Merger Consideration and any amounts
payable in respect of dividends or distributions on shares of Parent Common
Stock in accordance with _Section 2.11_ out of the Exchange Fund in
accordance with this Agreement and the Certificate of Merger. In the event the
Exchange Fund shall at any time be insufficient to make the payments
contemplated by _Article II,_ Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be
deposited, additional shares of Parent Common Stock and/or cash funds, as
applicable, with the Exchange Fund Agent in an amount which is equal to the
deficiency in the amount required to make such payments. The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose.

(c)   _Payment Procedures With Respect to Company Shares_.

  



  

(i) Promptly following the Effective Time, and in no event
later than the fifth (5th) Business Day thereafter, Parent and the Surviving
Company shall cause the Exchange Fund Agent to mail to each holder of record,
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of (x) a certificate or
certificates (the "Certificates") that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding Company Shares and (y) uncertificated Company
Shares (the "Uncertificated Shares"), in each case whose shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.7(a)(i),_ and other than Company 102 Shares, (A) a letter of
transmittal in such form as the Company and Parent may reasonably agree (a
"Letter of Transmittal"), which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to such Company Shares shall pass, only upon (1)
delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in _Section 2.10_ ) to the Exchange Fund Agent, or (2) an
acknowledgment of the conversion of such holder's Uncertificated Shares into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, as the case may be, to the
Exchange Fund Agent, (B) a declaration in which the beneficial owner of
Company Shares provides certain information necessary for Parent to determine
whether any amounts need to be withheld from the Merger Consideration
payable to such beneficial owner pursuant to the terms of the Ordinance (in
each case, subject to the provisions of this _Section 2.8_ , _Section 2.13_
and _Section 6.18_), the Code, or any applicable provision of state, local,
Israeli, U.S. or other Tax Law; and (C) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or acknowledging the conversion of the
Uncertificated Shares into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_
including, in the case of the Uncertificated Shares, instructions
for identifying the deposit account through which such Uncertificated Shares
are held. Upon delivery to the Exchange Fund Agent of the Letter of
Transmittal and the declaration for Tax withholding purposes (under _Section
2.13(c)_ below) or a Valid Tax Certificate (and such other documents, if any,
as the Exchange Fund Agent may reasonably request consistent with customary
practice), duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and, if applicable, surrender of Certificates (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 2.10_ ) for
cancellation to the Exchange Fund Agent, the holders of such Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares, as applicable, shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the Cash Merger Consideration to
which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)(i)_ (less
any applicable withholding taxes payable in respect thereof subject to
the provisions of _Section 2.13_ and _Section 6.18_ ), that number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock representing the Stock Merger Consideration to
which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)(i)_ , cash in
lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holder
thereof is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)(i)_ , and an
amount in cash sufficient to pay any dividends or other distributions to which
the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.11_. Parent shall cause
the Exchange Fund Agent to accept such Certificates or acknowledgments of the
conversion of the Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with the foregoing
exchange procedures.

  



  

(ii)  Payments and deliveries to be made under this Agreement
shall be made in U.S. dollars by check or wire transfer of
immediately available funds to such address or bank accounts as shall be set
forth in the Letter of Transmittal and Parent shall cause the Exchange Fund
Agent to make payment of the Merger Consideration to the holders of
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares that comply with the exchange
procedures set forth in this _Section 2.8(c)_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 2.8(c)_, any Merger Consideration payable in
respect of Company 102 Shares shall be transferred by Parent to the Exchange
Fund Agent and Parent shall cause the Exchange Fund Agent to make payment of
such Merger Consideration promptly following the Effective Time, and in no
event later than the second (2nd) Business Day thereafter, to the 102 Trustee
for the benefit of the beneficial owners thereof, and such Merger
Consideration shall be released by the 102 Trustee to the beneficial holders
of such Company 102 Shares, in accordance with the requirements of Section
102 of the Ordinance and the Option Tax Ruling, if obtained.

  



  

(d)   _Payment Procedures With Respect to Company Options_.

  



  

(i)  Promptly following the Effective Time, and in no event
later than the second (2nd) Business Day thereafter, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Fund Agent to transfer the aggregate Merger Consideration payable
with respect to Company 102 Shares and Company 102 Options (that are not
Converted Options), to the 102 Trustee, on behalf of holders of Company 102
Shares and Company 102 Options, in accordance with Section 102 of the
Ordinance and the Option Tax Ruling, if obtained (the "102 Amounts"). The 102
Amounts shall be held in trust by the 102 Trustee pursuant to the applicable
provisions of Section 102 of the Ordinance and the Option Tax Ruling, if
obtained, and shall be released by the 102 Trustee, together with any interest
earned thereon by virtue of the investment of such amounts by the 102
Trustee, in accordance with the terms and conditions of Section 102 of
the Ordinance and the Option Tax Ruling, if obtained.

  



  

(ii)  Promptly following the Effective Time, and in no event
later than the second (2nd) Business Day thereafter, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Fund Agent to promptly deposit the aggregate Merger Consideration
payable in respect of Company Options (other than Company 102 Options) that
are not Converted Options or, if applicable, the relevant engaging Subsidiary,
at one or more accounts designated by the Company prior to Closing for the
benefit of the holders of Company Options (other than Company 102 Options),
which amounts shall be paid by the Surviving Company or, if applicable, the
relevant engaging Subsidiary, to the respective holders thereof through the
Surviving Company's or, if applicable, the relevant engaging Subsidiary's
payroll system pursuant to _Section 6.14_ , subject to applicable
withholdings.

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of
ownership of Company Shares is not registered in the share transfer books or
ledger of the Company, or if the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a name
other than that in which the Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor or
applicable Uncertificated Shares are registered in the share transfer books or
ledger of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificates so surrendered or applicable
Uncertificated Shares are registered in the share transfer books or ledger of
the Company only if such Certificate is properly endorsed or otherwise in
proper form for surrender and transfer or if the appropriate acknowledgment
for the conversion of such Uncertificated Shares into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration has been delivered and the Person requesting such
payment has paid any Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares, or established to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not
payable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.8(e)_ , each
Company Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this _Section 2.8_.

  



  

(f)   _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Exchange Fund
Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, Surviving Company or the Company, or any employee,
officer, director, agent or Affiliate of any of the foregoing, shall be
liable to a holder of Company Shares in respect of any part of the Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by
holders of any such shares immediately prior to the time at which such
amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental
Entity shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property
of the Surviving Company, free and clear of any claims or interest of any
such holders or their successors, assigns or personal representatives
previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(g)   _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of
the Exchange Fund (including any interest and other income received with
respect thereto, if any) that remains undistributed to the former holders of
the Company Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any former holders of Company
Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who
have not theretofore exchanged their Certificates representing such Company
Shares or delivered to the Exchange Fund Agent the acknowledgment of the
conversion of their Uncertificated Shares for exchange for the Merger
Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 2.8_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent, as general creditors thereof, for any payment
of and claim with respect thereto. If any Certificate shall not have been
surrendered or Uncertificated Share not paid, in each case, in accordance
with _Section 2.8(c)(i)_ , immediately prior to the date on which any Merger
Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any
such Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated
Share shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property
of Parent free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(h)   _Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Exchange Fund Agent
shall invest the Cash Merger Consideration in the Exchange Fund as directed
by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such investment income or gain or
loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to the former holders of
Company Shares. Any interest, gains and other income resulting from such
investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent payable to
Parent upon its request, and no part of such interest, gains and other income
shall accrue to the benefit of former holders of Company Shares; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any investment of such cash shall in all events be limited
to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully
guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in
commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most
recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available),
and that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable
to former holders of Company Shares pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)(i)_.

  



  

2.9 _  _ _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. From
and after the Effective Time, all issued and outstanding Company Shares shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, retired and
cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Share
theretofore representing any Company Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
payable therefor upon the surrender or acknowledgment of the
conversion thereof in accordance with the provisions of _Section 2.8_. The
Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Company Shares. From and after the Effective Time, there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving
Company of Company Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, for any reason (a)
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Company, or (b) acknowledgments
are delivered to the Exchange Fund Agent of the conversion of any
Uncertificated Shares, such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares, as the case
may be, shall be cancelled and the holder thereof shall be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration, in each case as provided for, and
in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this _Article II_.

  



   

-21-

 



    



  

  

2.10 _  _ _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Exchange Fund Agent or
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the
Exchange Fund Agent or Parent may require, as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against Parent with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Fund Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled
pursuant to this _Article II_.

  



  

2.11 _  _ _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of
Parent Common Stock_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to
shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or
Uncertificated Shares for which the applicable acknowledgment has not been
delivered to the Exchange Fund Agent with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock that the holder thereof is entitled to receive upon the surrender
or acknowledgment of the conversion thereof, as applicable, and no cash
payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to
any such holder pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)(i)_ , in each case until the
holder of such Certificate shall have surrendered such Certificate or the
holder of such Uncertificated Shares shall have delivered such acknowledgment
of the conversion of such Uncertificated Shares, in each case in accordance
with this _Article II_. Following the surrender of any Certificate or
acknowledgment of the conversion of any Uncertificated Shares, there shall be
paid to the holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange
therefor, without interest, in accordance with the procedures set forth in
this _Article II_ (a) at the time of such surrender or acknowledgment, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Parent Common
Stock and the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of
Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section
2.7(a)(i)_ and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior
to such surrender or acknowledgment and a payment date subsequent to such
surrender or acknowledgment payable with respect to such shares of
Parent Common Stock. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in
respect of Parent Common Stock, all shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence as if issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time.

  



  

2.12 _  _ _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at
any time after the Effective Time, any further action is determined by Parent
or the Surviving Company to be necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Company or Parent with
full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger
Sub and the Company with respect to the Merger, the officers and managers of
Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Company and otherwise) to take such action.

  



  

2.13 _  _ _Withholding Tax._

  



  

(a)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary hereunder,
Parent, its Subsidiaries, the Company, its Subsidiaries, the
Surviving Company, the 102 Trustee and the Exchange Fund Agent (each, a
"Payor") shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any payment or
consideration made pursuant to this Agreement (including the Merger
Consideration and payments made pursuant to _Section 6.14_ ) such amounts as
may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, the Ordinance, or under any provision of applicable
U.S. federal, state, local, Israeli, or other Tax Law, including the
Withholding Tax Ruling and the Option Tax Ruling (it being agreed that the
Payor shall be permitted to satisfy any Tax withholding requirement with
respect to the Merger Consideration by deducting and withholding the
appropriate cash amount from the Cash Merger Consideration). With respect to
withholding of Israeli Tax, in the event any holder of record of Company
Shares or Company Options provides the Payor with a Valid Tax Certificate
issued by the Israeli Tax Authority (the "ITA") regarding the withholding (or
exemption from withholding) of Israeli Tax from the consideration payable in
respect thereof in accordance with this _Article II_ , or other treatment
with respect to Israeli Tax, at least five (5) Business Days prior to any
payment payable pursuant to this Agreement, then the deduction and
withholding of any amounts under the Ordinance or any other provision of
Israeli Law or requirement, if any, from the Merger Consideration, including
any Merger Consideration payable with respect to Company Options, payable to
such holder of record of Company Shares or Company Options, as applicable,
shall be made only in accordance with the provisions of such Valid Tax
Certificate. To the extent that amounts are so withheld pursuant to this
_Section 2.13_ , they shall be paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Entity prior to the last day on which such payment is required to be paid
to such Governmental Entity, and such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  



   

-22-

 



    



  

  

(b)  Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 2.13(a)_ above,
with respect to Israeli Taxes, the consideration payable to each Company
Shareholder shall be retained by the Exchange Fund Agent for the benefit of
each such Company Shareholder for a period of up to 180 days from Closing
(the "Withholding Drop Date") (during which time no Payor shall make
any payments to any Company Shareholder or withhold any amounts for Israeli
Taxes from the payments deliverable pursuant to this Agreement, except as
provided below and during which time each Company Shareholder may obtain a
Valid Tax Certificate). If a Company Shareholder delivers, no later than five
(5) Business Days prior to the Withholding Drop Date a Valid Tax Certificate
to Payor, then the deduction and withholding of any Israeli Taxes shall be
made only in accordance with the provisions of such Valid Tax Certificate and
the balance of the payment that is not withheld shall be paid to such Company
Shareholder concurrently therewith subject to any non-Israeli withholding
which is applicable to the payment (if any). If any Company Shareholder (i)
does not provide Payor with a Valid Tax Certificate by no later than five
Business Days before the Withholding Drop Date or (ii) submits a written
request with Payor to release its portion of the consideration prior to the
Withholding Drop Date and fails to submit a Valid Tax Certificate at or
before such time, then the amount to be withheld from such Company
Shareholder's portion of the consideration shall be calculated according to
the applicable withholding rate as determined by Parent in its sole discretion
in accordance with Applicable Law (increased by interest plus linkage
differences, as defined in Section 159A(a) of the Ordinance, for the period
between the 15th day of the calendar month following the month during which
the Closing occurs and the time that the relevant payment is made, and
calculated in NIS based on a US$:NIS exchange rate not lower than the
effective exchange rate at the Closing Date as determined by Parent and the
Exchange Fund Agent).

Disclosure Letter (such disclosures being considered to be made for purposes
of the specific Section of the Company Disclosure Letter in which they are

such other Sections), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and

of incorporation or organization and has all corporate, limited
liability company or otherwise comparable power and authority (as applicable)
to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as presently conducted, except where the failure to have such power

a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company has made available to
Parent true and complete copies of the memorandum of association, articles of
association, certificates of incorporation, bylaws or equivalent
organizational or governing documents or other constituent documents, as in

of incorporation or organization of each Subsidiary of the Company as of the
date of this Agreement. Except for the Company's Subsidiaries, neither the

share capital of, or other equity or voting interest in, or any securities or
obligations convertible into or exchangeable for shares, securities or
interests, in any Person or (ii) has any obligation to acquire any share
capital of, or other equity or voting interests in, any Person or to provide
funds to or make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution
or otherwise) in any Person.

issued and outstanding company, partnership, corporate or similar
ownership, voting or similar interests in each of its Subsidiaries, free and
clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens) and, except as set forth in
the Charter Documents, free of any restriction on the right to vote, sell or
otherwise dispose of such share capital or other equity or voting interest
that would prevent the operation by the Surviving Company of such Subsidiary's
business. All company, partnership, corporate or similar ownership, voting or
similar interests of the Subsidiaries are duly authorized and validly issued,
fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights.

Disclosure Letter, and except for any Contract solely among or between the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries or solely among or between any
Subsidiaries of the Company, there are no outstanding (i) securities of the

any subscription, warrant, right, convertible or exchangeable security or
other similar agreement or commitment (whether payable in equity, cash or
otherwise) relating to any share capital of, or other equity or

the Subsidiaries of the Company, being referred to collectively as "Subsidiary
Securities"). Except as set forth in Section 3.2(c) of the Company Disclosure

duties under Israeli Law); or (vii) resolve, propose or agree to do any of
the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to obtaining the
Requisite Shareholder Approval, if at any time the Company receives an
unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal after the date of this

permitted to negotiate) the terms of which, taken as a whole, are no less
favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement and do not include any provision calling for the exclusive right to
negotiate with such party or having the effect of prohibiting the Company from
satisfying its obligations hereunder (an "Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement"); provided, that any such information (to the extent that such
information has not been previously provided or made available to Parent) is
furnished or made available to Parent prior to or substantially concurrently

such information to such Third Party. Within 24 hours after receipt by the

Company Shareholders who have executed the Voting Agreement, shall be deemed
to be a breach of this _Section 6.1_ by the Company. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries' other
Representatives to comply with the restrictions set forth in this _Section
6.1_.

_Section 6.1(b)_ , the Company shall promptly, and in all cases within 24
hours of its receipt, advise Parent orally and in writing of any (i)
Acquisition Proposal; (ii) request for information or request to engage in
negotiations or discussions or any other inquiry with respect to, or that
could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; or (iii)
request for a waiver or release under any standstill or similar Contract. The
Company shall provide Parent with (A) the material terms and conditions of
such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, including any financing
arrangements to the extent provided to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any Representative of the Company (other than the identity of the Third Party
who has made the Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry), (B) whether such
Person or group making any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, is
a financial or strategic buyer, and (C) copies of all written materials
provided by such Person in connection with such Acquisition Proposal, request

status of discussions relating to, and the material terms and
conditions (including all amendments or proposed amendments to such material

6.2 _  _ _Company Board Recommendation_.

  



  

(a)  Other than in accordance with the terms of this _Section
6.2_ , the Company Board shall not make a Company Board Recommendation Change
or enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining
the Requisite Shareholder Approval, the Company Board may, in response to its
receipt of a Superior Proposal that has not been withdrawn, (i) effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change with respect to such Superior Proposal
or (ii) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_ in order to
enter into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement providing for such
Superior Proposal if, in each case (A) the Company Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and after considering in
good faith any counter-offer or proposal made by Parent pursuant to clause (D)
below), that in light of such Superior Proposal, failure to effect a Company
Board Recommendation Change or failure to terminate this Agreement in order
to enter into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement providing for
such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
Company Board under Applicable Law; (B) prior to effecting such Company Board
Recommendation Change, the Company Board shall have given Parent at least
four (4) Business Days' prior written notice (the "Superior Proposal Notice
Period") of its intention to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_ (which notice shall
include the most current version of the proposed definitive agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal and, to the extent not included
therein, a reasonably detailed summary of all material terms and conditions
of such Superior Proposal, including any financing arrangements to the extent
provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their Representatives
and the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal, if not appearing
elsewhere in the documents provided to Parent); (C) the Company shall, and
shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, during the Superior Proposal
Notice Period, negotiate with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) in good faith any proposed modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement in response to such Superior Proposal; and (D)
after taking into account any counter-offer or proposal offered by Parent
within the Superior Proposal Notice Period in writing, if any, the Company
Board again makes the determination that the Acquisition Proposal that is
subject to the notice set forth above still constitutes a Superior
Proposal (it being understood that (1) any material amendment or modification
to the terms of a Superior Proposal, including any revision in price, shall
be deemed a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this _Section 6.2_ , and
(2) the Company shall promptly (but in any event within 24 hours of the
occurrence) notify Parent of any such amendment or modification and provide
the required information regarding such new Acquisition Proposal (to the
extent not previously provided) in compliance with the terms of this 
_Section 6.2_ anew; provided that the period during which the Company and its
Representatives are required to negotiate with Parent in good faith regarding
any modified terms proposed by Parent in response to such new Acquisition
Proposal shall expire on the later to occur of two (2) Business Days after
the Company provides written notice of such new Acquisition Proposal and
the end of the original Superior Proposal Notice Period).

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, other than in connection with a Company Superior Proposal
(which shall be subject to _Section 6.2(a)_ and shall not be subject to this
_Section 6.2(b)_ ), prior to obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Approval
(and in no event after receipt of the Requisite Shareholder Approval), the
Company Board may, in response to a Company Intervening Event, make a Company
Board Recommendation Change (pursuant to Section (i) of the definition of
Company Board Recommendation Change), if (i) the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law, (ii) the Company has notified Parent in writing that it
intends to effect such a Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to this
_Section 6.2(b)_ (which notice shall specify the facts and circumstances
providing the basis of the Company Intervening Event in reasonable detail),
(iii) for a period of four (4) Business Days following the notice delivered
pursuant to clause (ii) of this _Section 6.2(b)_ , the Company and the
Company's Representatives shall have discussed and negotiated in good faith
(to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) with Parent and Parent's
Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, and (iv) no earlier than the end of such four (4) Business Day
period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, and after taking into account any
proposal by Parent to amend or modify the terms of this Agreement offered by
Parent in writing, that the failure to take such action would still be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

  



  

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or
Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to Company Shareholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying
with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act; (ii) taking and
disclosing to the Company Shareholders a position contemplated by Section 329
of the ICL; (iii) making a "stop, look and listen" communication to Company
Shareholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act; or (iv) making
any other disclosure to Company Shareholders if the Company Board has
determined in good faith after consultation with the Company's outside legal
counsel that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the Company Board under Applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the taking of any such position or making of any such disclosure
contemplated by this _Section 6.2(c)_ shall not affect the definition of 
"Company Board Recommendation Change" and the Company Board may not effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change except in compliance with this _Section
6.2_.

(d)  Prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Article VIII_ , the Company shall not take any action to approve any
transaction under, or exempt any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and
their respective Affiliates) from the provisions of, any Takeover Law or any
anti-takeover provision in the Charter Documents of the Company or otherwise
cause such restrictions not to apply. To the extent permitted under any
Takeover Law, the Company shall promptly take all steps necessary to
terminate any waiver or other exemption that may have been previously granted
to any such Person or any Acquisition Proposal under any such provision.

  



  

6.3 _  _ _Company Shareholders ' Meeting_. Subject to the earlier
termination of this Agreement in accordance with  _Article VIII_ hereof, as
soon as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the
Securities Act, the Company shall establish a record date for, duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of the Company Shareholders
(together with any adjournment or postponement thereof, the "Company
Shareholders' Meeting") for the purpose of seeking (i) the Requisite
Shareholder Approval and (ii) as a separate agenda item, approval of the
Company Shareholders for the purchase of the "tail" insurance policy to be
purchased by the Company pursuant to _Section 6.16(c)_ , and shall submit
such proposals to such holders at the Company Shareholders' Meeting and shall
not submit any other proposal that is not related to the Merger or the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to such holders in
connection with the Company Shareholders' Meeting without the prior written
consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). The record date for the Company Shareholders' Meeting shall be
determined with prior consultation with Parent. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not adjourn or
postpone the Company Shareholders' Meeting without Parent's prior written
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); _provided_ , that without Parent's prior written consent, the
Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Shareholders' Meeting (a) after
consultation with Parent, to the extent necessary to ensure that any
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Company
Shareholders within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company
Shareholders' Meeting or (b) to a date that is in the aggregate not more than
30 days following the originally scheduled date (or the date
rescheduled pursuant to clause (a) hereof) if there are not sufficient
affirmative votes in person or by proxy at such meeting to constitute a
quorum at the Company Shareholders' Meeting or to obtain the Requisite
Shareholder Approval, to allow reasonable additional time for solicitation of
proxies for purposes of obtaining a quorum or the Requisite Shareholder
Approval. If the Company Board has not made a Company Board Recommendation
Change in accordance with _Section 6.2_ , the Company shall, through the
Company Board, make the Company Board Recommendation, include such Company
Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, and use its reasonable best
efforts to (i) solicit proxies from its shareholders in favor of the approval
of this Agreement and the Merger in accordance with Israeli Law and (ii)
otherwise seek to obtain the Requisite Shareholder Approval at the Company
Shareholders' Meeting. Notwithstanding any Company Board Recommendation
Change, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_
, the obligations of the Parties under this _Section 6.3_ shall continue in
full force and effect, neither the commencement, public proposal, public
disclosure or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal
(whether or not a Superior Proposal) nor the making of any Company Board
Recommendation Change shall obviate or otherwise affect the obligation of the
Company to set a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold
the Company Shareholders' Meeting in accordance with this  _Section 6.3_.

  



  

6.4 _  _ _Merger Proposal; Certificate of Merger_.

  



  

(a)  Subject to the ICL, the Company and Merger Sub shall (and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to), as applicable, take the following actions
within the timeframes set forth in this _Section 6.4(a)_ ; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such actions or the timeframes for taking such actions
shall be subject to any amendment in the corresponding applicable provisions
of the ICL (and, in case of an amendment thereto, such amendment shall
automatically apply so as to amend this _Section 6.4(a)_ accordingly):

reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 or any amendment
or supplement thereto is declared effective under the Securities Act, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading; or (ii)
the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first filed with the SEC or

of the Company Shareholders' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the

the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, it being
understood that no covenant is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to
statements or omissions made or incorporated by reference therein based on

(c)  If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite
Shareholder Approval, any information relating to the Company or Parent, or
any of their respective Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or
Parent which, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent, as
applicable, should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the
Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the Party which discovers
such information shall promptly notify the other Parties, and the Company and
Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary

(c)  As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, Parent
shall cause its Israeli counsel to prepare and file with the ISA an

efforts to cause its Representatives to cooperate with Parent and
its Representatives in connection with the preparation and filing of such

or advisable to obtain the Dual Listing and ISA Exemptions.

information subject to such a confidentiality agreement to disclose the
maximum extent of such information that does not result in a violation of
such obligation of confidentiality), (ii) information the disclosure of which
would violate any Applicable Law ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute

in such event, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for
such access or disclosure to the maximum extent that does not result in a
loss of any such attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal
privilege).

6.11 _  _ _Financing_.

  



  

(a)  Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, advisable or proper to obtain the proceeds of the Financing on the
terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter (or the proceeds of
permanent Financing in lieu thereof) (taking into account any "flex
provisions" set forth in the related fee letters) on or prior to the date upon
which the Merger is required to be consummated pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, including by: (i) maintaining in effect the Commitment Letter
(provided, that the Commitment Letter may be amended, supplemented, modified
and replaced as permitted by this _Section_ 6.11 (a)), (ii) negotiating and
entering into Definitive Financing Agreements with respect to the Financing
consistent with the terms and conditions contained in the Commitment Letter
(including, as necessary, the "flex" provisions contained in any related fee
letter) and (iii) satisfying (or, if deemed advisable by Parent, obtaining
the waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) in the Commitment
Letter and the Definitive Financing Agreements and complying with its
obligations thereunder. In the event that all conditions contained in the
Commitment Letter (other than the consummation of the Merger and those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been
satisfied or waived, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to enforce its
rights under the Commitment Letter, including to cause the Financing Sources
to fund on the Closing Date the Debt Financing; provided, that in no event
shall Parent be obligated to bring any Legal Proceedings against any
Financing Sources.

  



  

Parent shall not without the prior written consent of the Company permit any
amendment or modification to, replacement of, or any waiver of any material
provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letter if such amendment,
modification, replacement, waiver or remedy would reasonably be expected to
prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, that no consent
from the Company shall be required for (i) any amendment, replacement,
supplement or modification of the Commitment Letter that adds lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not
executed the Commitment Letter as of the date hereof, (ii) implementation or
exercise of any "flex" provisions provided in any related fee letter as in
effect as of the date hereof or (iii) any amendment to, or replacement of or
supplement or modification to, the Commitment Letter or Definitive Financing
Agreement so long as such action would not be prohibited by the foregoing
clause. Parent shall promptly notify the Company of any such amendment,
modification, waiver or replacement and deliver the Company a copy thereof.

  



  

(b)  Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.11(a)_ , if
Parent believes it will incur any Financing in connection with the Closing,
on not less than five Business Days' prior written notice of the initial
request therefor, the Company agrees to cooperate with Parent, as reasonably
requested by Parent, to obtain such Financing (provided that such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) including by using (and by causing
its Subsidiaries and its Representatives to use) reasonable best efforts to:

  



  

(i)  cause the management of the Company, in each case, with
appropriate seniority and expertise, to participate, at reasonable times and
upon reasonable advance notice, in a reasonable number of meetings,
presentations, roadshows, drafting sessions, sessions with rating agencies,
conference calls with prospective lenders of and investors in the Financing,
and due diligence sessions;

  



  

   

-67-

 



    



  

(ii)  subject to the confidentiality undertakings set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement, provide reasonable and customary assistance with
the preparation of materials relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for rating
agency presentations, marketing materials, offering documents and other
documents necessary for any Financing, and provide reasonable cooperation
with the due diligence efforts of the Financing Sources with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries during normal business hours upon reasonable
advance notice;

  



  

(iii)  furnish to Parent (A) the Financing Deliverables and (B) the
Financing Information (including any updates to the Financing Information so
that marketing materials used in any Financing do not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a fact necessary to make the
statements contained therein not misleading as a result of a misstatement or
omission with respect to the Financing Information, other than, in each case,
with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or
Merger Sub);

  



  

(iv) cause its independent auditors to provide reasonable and
customary cooperation in connection with the Financing, including by
providing the Specified Auditor Assistance and signing customary management
representation letters to such auditors so that such Specified Auditor
Assistance can be provided;

  



  

(v)  assist Parent with Parent's preparation of pro forma financial
statements and projections by providing the Financing Information to be used
in preparing such pro formas that are requested in connection with any
Financing or that would customarily be included in the marketing materials
with respect to the Financing; and

  



  

(vi)  furnish to Parent other documents of the Company and its
Subsidiaries reasonably requested by Parent in connection with any Financing
that includes an offering of securities in order to allow such Financing
Sources to establish a "due-diligence" defense; and

  



  

(vii)  satisfy the conditions precedent set forth in the Debt Letters
or any Definitive Financing Agreement to the extent the satisfaction of such
conditions requires the cooperation of or is within the control of the Company
and its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(c)  The Company hereby consents to the use of its and each of
its Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the Financing;  _provided_ that
such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to, and is not
reasonably expected to, harm or disparage the Company or its Subsidiaries or
the reputation or goodwill of the Company or its Subsidiaries and their
respective marks, products, services, offerings or Intellectual Property
Rights. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including attorney's fees) incurred by the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives in connection with providing
the assistance contemplated by this _Section 6.11_. Parent shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees), awards, judgments, penalties
and other Liabilities actually suffered or incurred by any of them in
connection with the Financing and any information used in connection
therewith (other than any information provided in writing by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries expressly for use in connection therewith) or in
connection with providing the assistance contemplated by this _Section 6.11_ ,
except to the extent arising from bad faith, willful misconduct or fraud of
the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives.

  



  

   

-68-

 



    



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
_Section 6.11_ , (i) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective Representatives shall be required to take or permit the
taking of any action or provide any assistance that would (A) unreasonably
interfere with the business or operations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (B) cause any representation or warranty or covenant of the
Company in this Agreement to be breached by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, (C) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective Affiliates to pay (or agree to pay) any fees, or reimburse any
expenses prior to the Closing for which it is not promptly reimbursed, or
otherwise incur any other obligations (other than any obligations under
customary authorization letters, management representation letters or
other documents delivered to the Company's independent registered accounting
firm in connection with the Specified Auditor Assistance) or give any
indemnities prior to the Closing that are not contingent on the Closing, (D)
cause any director, officer, employee or shareholder of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to incur any personal Liability, (E) conflict with the
Charter Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Applicable
Laws, (F) result in the breach of, or default under, any Material Contract or
(G) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to prepare separate
financial statements for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or change any
fiscal period or prepare any financial statements or information that are not
available to it and prepared in the ordinary course of its financial reporting
practice; and (ii) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective directors or officers shall be obligated to
adopt resolutions or execute consents to approve or authorize the execution
of the Financing; _provided_ , _however_ that this clause (ii) shall not
prohibit the adoption or execution of any resolutions or consents effective no
earlier than the Closing Date (after giving effect to the Closing) by any
Person that will remain or will become an officer or director of
the Surviving Company as of the Effective Time. Nothing in this _Section
6.11_ shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective Representatives to disclose any information to Parent, Parent's
Representatives or the Financing Sources if such disclosure would (x) violate
any Applicable Law or Contract or (y) jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege, work product doctrine or other legal privilege held by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
does not provide or cause its Representatives to provide such access or such
information in reliance on the immediately preceding sentence, then the
Company shall (1) provide a written notice to Parent stating that it
is withholding such access or such information and (2) reasonably cooperate
to provide the applicable access or information in a way that would not
violate such Applicable Law or Contract or jeopardize such privilege.

  



  

(e)  Parent acknowledges and agrees that, other than
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses subject to reimbursement
pursuant to _Section 6.11(c)_ , none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives shall have any
responsibility for, or incur any Liability to, any Person under any Financing
that Parent may obtain in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or any cooperation provided pursuant to this _Section 6.11_.

  



  

(f)  Notwithstanding any other provision set forth herein or
anything to the contrary contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, Parent
or any of its Affiliates may disclose Confidential Information (as defined in
the Confidentiality Agreement) of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Financing Sources (other than any sensitive information that the Company
specifically designates in writing may not be disclosed), so long as the
Financing Sources are subject to confidentiality undertakings under a binding
written confidentiality commitment to Parent that are at least as restrictive
as those applicable to Parent with respect to the Company (except that such
confidentiality agreement need not contain any explicit or implicit standstill
provision).

  



  

(g)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the
provisions contained in this _Section 6.11_ represent the sole obligations of
the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives with
respect to cooperation in connection with the arrangement of any financing
(including the Financing) to be obtained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and no other
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to expand such obligations.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall
the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Financing) by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries be a condition to any of Parent's or Merger Sub's
obligations under this Agreement.

Agreement"), which shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with

6.13 _  _ _Public Disclosure_. Parent and the Company have agreed upon
the initial joint press release with respect to the execution of this
Agreement, and will issue such press release promptly following the execution
of this Agreement. Thereafter, so long as this Agreement is in effect,
neither the Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective Affiliates, shall
issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public
announcement with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior consent

contained in _Sections 6.1_ and _6.2_ ).

6.14 _  _ _Company Options_.

  



  

(a)   _Company Options_.

  



  

(i) At the Effective Time, each Company Option (or portion
thereof) that is outstanding and vested as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time (or vests as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby) (each, a  "Cancelled Option") shall, by
virtue of the Merger, be cancelled and terminated and converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of each Net Share
covered by such Cancelled Option; except that, in lieu of the Merger
Consideration, any fractional Net Share (after aggregating all shares
represented by all Cancelled Options held by such individual) shall be
settled in cash based on the Cash Equivalent Consideration (such consideration
being hereinafter referred to as the "Option Consideration"). The holder of
each Cancelled Option shall receive at the Effective Time from the Company,
or as soon as practicable thereafter (but in no even later than the Company's
first full payroll after the Effective Time) from the Surviving Company, the
Option Consideration. If the exercise price per share of any such Cancelled
Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company
Option shall, by direction of Parent (which is hereby given pursuant to this
Agreement), be cancelled without any payment being made in respect
thereof. The payment of Option Consideration to the holder of a Cancelled
Option shall be reduced by any applicable tax withholding required under the
Ordinance, the Code, any Applicable Law, a Valid Certificate and otherwise as
set forth in _Section 2.13_ and _Section 6.18_. The applicable taxes required
to be withheld from the Option Consideration shall reduce first the Cash
Merger Consideration portion of the Option Consideration with any remaining
amount reducing the Stock Merger Consideration portion of the Option
Consideration, with the value of the stock portion for purposes of such
deduction determined based on the Parent Average Trading Price. The holder of
each Cancelled Option that is a Company 102 Option or that is otherwise held
by the 102 Trustee shall receive the Option Consideration through the 102
Trustee in accordance with _Section 2.8_.

  



  

(ii)  At the Effective Time, each Company Option (or portion thereof)
that is outstanding and unvested as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (and does not vest as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby) (each, a "Converted Option") shall be converted into
Parent Restricted Stock Units (each, a "Replacement RSU"). The holder of each
Converted Option shall receive an award of Replacement RSUs equal in value on
the grant date (based on the Parent Average Trading Price at Closing) to the
product of (A) the excess, if any, of the Cash Equivalent Consideration over
the per share exercise price of such Converted Option, multiplied by (B) the
number of Company Shares subject to such Converted Option. Each such
Replacement RSU shall be subject to vesting in accordance with the same
vesting schedule as was applicable to the Converted Option. Each of the
Parent and the Company shall take such acts and adopt such corporate
resolutions as may be required to effect the conversion set forth in this
_Section 6.14(a)(ii)_.

  



  

(b)   _Termination of Non-U.S. Company Options_.
Notwithstanding the provisions above, Parent may, prior to the
Effective Time, determine reasonably and in good faith, subject to the
consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed, that any Company Option that is subject to the Applicable Laws of
a non-U.S. or non-Israeli jurisdiction may be treated in a manner other than
prescribed by _Section 6.14(a)_ , to the extent that (i) Parent and the
Company reasonably and in good faith determine that (A) the manner in which
such Company Option would otherwise be treated pursuant to _Section 6.14(a)_
would result in a violation of Applicable Laws or a materially adverse tax
consequence to the individual holding such Company Option in the applicable
non-U.S. or non-Israeli jurisdiction and (B) such different treatment is
necessary to comply with such Applicable Laws; and (ii) such different
treatment is, to the maximum extent practicable, consistent with _Section
6.14(a)_. Parent and the Company shall agree at least ten (10) days prior to
the Effective Time to the treatment of any Company Options that will be
treated in a manner other than prescribed by _Section 6.14(a)_.

  



  

(c)   _Treatment of Company Plan_. At Parent's request, as
soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall
adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to provide that
the Company Plan shall be terminated as of the Effective Time.

  



  

(d)   _Necessary Actions; Form S-8_. The Company shall take all
actions reasonably necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this
_Section 6.14_ under all Company Plans, including delivering all required
notices, obtaining all necessary consents, and making any determinations
and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof. Promptly after
the Effective Time (but in no event later than 10 Business Days following the
Effective Time), Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or other appropriate form) relating to
the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to, or
underlying, the Converted Options under this _Section 6.14_ that are not
already subject to a registration statement or Form S-8 (or other appropriate
form).

  



  

   

-71-

 



    



  

6.15 _  _ _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) Following the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary of the Effective Time (or, if earlier, the termination date of
the relevant Continuing Employee), Parent shall provide, or shall cause the
Surviving Company to provide (i) (A) to each Continuing Employee in the
United States, an annual salary or wage substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the annual salary or wage provided by Parent or its Affiliates
to its similarly situated employees in the same or comparable geographical
locations, and (B) to all other Continuing Employees, an annual salary or wage
at least equal to the annual salary or wage of such other Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) (A) to each Continuing Employee
in the United States, cash incentive compensation opportunities substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the cash incentive compensation opportunities
provided by Parent or its Affiliates to its similarly situated employees in
the same or comparable geographical locations, and (B) to all other
Continuing Employees, cash incentive compensation opportunities at least
equal to the cash incentive compensation opportunities of such other
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) (A) to
each Continuing Employee in the United States, employee benefits
(excluding equity or equity-based compensation or incentive opportunities)
that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits
provided by Parent or its Affiliates to its similarly situated employees in
the same or comparable geographical locations, and (B) to all other
Continuing Employees, employee benefits (excluding equity or equity-
based compensation or incentive opportunities) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits of such other Continuing
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(b)  With respect to all benefit plans maintained by Parent,
the Surviving Company or their respective Subsidiaries (including any
vacation, paid time-off and severance plans) in which a Continuing Employee is
eligible to participate, for purposes of eligibility, participation, vesting,
and level of benefits for severance, accrual of paid time off, and statutory
notice and severance benefits, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause each Continuing Employee's service with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (as well as service with any predecessor employer of the Company
or any such Subsidiary, to the extent service with the predecessor employer
is recognized by the Company or such Subsidiary) to be treated as service with
Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be recognized (i) to the
extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits for
the same period of service, (ii) with respect to benefit accrual under any
defined benefit pension plan, or (iii) with respect to any newly established
plan for which prior service is not taken into account for any employees of
Parent or any of its Affiliates.

  



  

(c)  Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause to be
waived any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-
work requirements and waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan
maintained by Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees (and their eligible
dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the
Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Employee Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause to be recognized, and provide with credit for, the dollar
amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each
Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the
calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying
such year's deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare
benefit plans in which they will be eligible to participate from and after the
Effective Time.

  



  

(d)  For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein or in any Employee Plan, for purposes of any Employee
Plan containing a definition of "change in control" or "change of control,"
the Closing shall be deemed to constitute a "change in control" or "change of
control" (except as would result in the imposition of "additional taxes"
under Section 409A).

  



  

(e)  Upon Parent's written request, prior to Closing, the
Company shall terminate any and all Employee Plans intended to qualify under
Section 401(k) of the Code, or any successor statute (the "Company 401(k)
Plan"), effective not later than the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date. Upon the termination of such plans, the Company shall provide
Parent with evidence that such 401(k) plans have been terminated pursuant to
resolutions of the Company's board of directors not later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date. The Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to take such actions as are necessary to prevent a default by any
Continuing Employees with an outstanding loan under the Company 401(k) Plan
unless and until such Continuing Employee fails to make a timely payment on
such loan.

  



  

(f)  If the Closing occurs prior to the payment of annual
bonuses for 2019, solely to the extent such bonuses are set forth on 
_Section 5.2(g)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, Parent shall cause the
Company to pay to each employee an amount equal to such employee's annual
bonus for such year based on the actual level of achievement of the applicable
performance goals in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
applicable bonus plan at the time that annual bonuses are payable in the
ordinary course of business.

(g)  Nothing contained in this Agreement, including this
_Section 6.15_ , shall be construed as requiring Parent, the Company or any
of their Affiliates to continue the employment of any specific person, or to
limit the ability of Parent, the Company, or any of their respective
Affiliates from terminating the employment of any employee (including any
Continuing Employee). No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to
create any right to any compensation or benefits on the part of any Continuing
Employee or other future, present or former employee of Parent, the Company
or their respective Affiliates. _Section 6.14_ and _Section 6.15_ are
intended to be for the sole benefit of the Parties to this Agreement, and
nothing in _Section 6.14_ and _Section 6.15_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall be deemed to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
hereunder or make any employee or other service provider of the Parties or
their respective Subsidiaries or any other Person a third party
beneficiary of this Agreement. No provision of this Agreement shall be
construed to establish, amend or modify any Employee Plan, Governmental Plan,
or other benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, policy, contract or
arrangement. Further, nothing herein shall limit the ability of Parent, the

(a)  For a period beginning at the Effective Time and ending
no earlier than seven years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company
and Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless all past and present directors
and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Covered
Persons") to the same extent such Persons are indemnified as of the date of
this Agreement by the Company pursuant to Applicable Law, the Charter
Documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries, and the
indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this
Agreement and set forth in Section 3.10(a)(xiv) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, and, solely in the case of the Surviving Company (and not
Parent), any other indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the
date of this Agreement (collectively, and including the indemnification
agreements set forth in _Section 3.10(a)(xiv)_  of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the "Existing Indemnification Agreements") arising out of acts or
omissions in their capacity as directors or officers of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in
connection with the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby). The Surviving Company
and Parent shall advance expenses (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses) incurred in the defense of any Legal Proceeding with respect to the
matters subject to indemnification pursuant to this _Section 6.16_
in accordance with the procedures (if any) set forth in the Charter Documents
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any Existing Indemnification
Agreements and any other requirements under Applicable Law; _provided_ , that
Parent shall only be required to advance any such expenses to the extent that
the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined in a final, non-appealable
judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Person is not
entitled to indemnification (for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing proviso
shall not apply with respect to the Surviving Company's obligation to advance
expenses pursuant to this _Section 6.16(a)_ ). Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, if any Legal Proceeding (whether arising before, at or after
the Effective Time) is made against such persons with respect to matters
subject to indemnification hereunder on or prior to the seventh anniversary of
the Effective Time, the provisions of this _Section 6.16(a)_ shall continue
in effect until the final disposition or final resolution of such Legal
Proceeding. Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section 6.16(a)_ or
otherwise, Parent and the Surviving Company (i) shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without their prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and (ii) shall not
have any obligation hereunder to any Covered Person if it is ultimately
decided in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction that such indemnification is prohibited by Applicable Law, in
which case the Covered Person shall promptly refund to Parent or the Surviving
Company the amount of all such expenses theretofore advanced pursuant hereto.

  



  

(b)  For a period of seven (7) years from the Effective Time,
the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to,
maintain in effect in its Charter Documents provisions relating to
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses in favor of Covered
Persons that are no less favorable than the provisions of the Charter
Documents of the Company and any Subsidiary in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, or, if
the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company as of
or after the Effective Time to, purchase a seven (7)-year prepaid "tail"
policy that provides coverage with respect to matters arising on or before
the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions or actions contemplated by this Agreement) (the "DandO
Insurance"), with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are no less favorable in the aggregate than the coverage provided under the
Company's existing policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance; provided, that the Surviving Company shall
not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of
the amount set forth in _Section 6.16(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.
If prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time providing
the level of insurance coverage as described in the preceding sentence, the
Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to
maintain such policy in full force and effect, and cause all
obligations thereunder to be honored, in each case, to the extent required by
this Agreement.

  



  

(d)  In the event that Parent or the Surviving Company (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving company or entity of such consolidation or merger, or
(ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or
surviving company or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be,
shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.16_.

  



  

(e)  The obligations under this _Section 6.16_ shall not be
terminated or modified in any manner that is adverse to the Covered Persons
(and their respective successors and assigns), it being expressly agreed that
the Covered Persons (including successors and assigns) shall be Third Party
beneficiaries of, and may enforce, this _Section 6.16_.

  



  

6.17 _  _ _Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub_. Parent shall
take all action necessary to (i) cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Company

the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and (ii)

business, incur or guarantee any Indebtedness or any other liabilities or
make any investments, other than those activities incidental to its

6.18 _  _ _Tax Rulings_.

  



  

(a)  As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall instruct its Israeli counsel, advisors and accountants to

the cancellation and exchange of the Company 102 Options in accordance with
_Section 6.14_ and conversion of the Company 102 Shares in accordance _Section
2.7(a)_ and  _Section 2.8_ shall not be regarded as a violation of the
"requisite holding period" (as such term is defined in Section 102 of the
Ordinance) so long as the respective consideration to be received in respect
of such Company 102 Options and Company 102 Shares in accordance with this
Agreement is deposited with the 102 Trustee until the end of the respective
holding period (which ruling may be subject to customary conditions regularly
associated with such a ruling) and (ii) all Replacement RSUs replacing
Converted Options that were Company 102 Options prior to the Effective Time
shall continue, after the Effective Time, to benefit from the provisions of
Section 102 of the Ordinance and to qualify thereunder as grants made through
a trustee pursuant to the capital gains tax route (the "Option Tax Ruling").
The Company shall include in the request for the Option Tax Ruling a request
to exempt Parent, the Surviving Company, the Exchange Fund Agent and their
respective agents from any withholding obligation in relation to any payments
made with respect to any Company 102 Options or Company 102 Shares. If the
Option Tax Ruling is not granted prior to the Closing or in accordance with
the instructions of the ITA, the Company shall seek to obtain prior to the
Closing an interim tax ruling confirming, among other things, that Parent and
any Person acting on its behalf (including the Exchange Fund Agent) shall be
exempt from Israeli withholding tax in relation to any payments made with
respect to any Company 102 Options or Company 102 Shares to the Exchange Fund
Agent, the 102 Trustee or the Company in connection with the Merger (the 
"Interim Option Tax Ruling"). To the extent that prior to the Closing an
Interim Option Tax Ruling shall have been obtained, then all references
herein to the Option Tax Ruling shall be deemed to refer to such Interim
Option Tax Ruling, until such time that a final definitive Option Tax Ruling
is obtained.

respective agents from any obligation to withhold Israeli Tax from
any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this
Agreement, including the Merger Consideration, or clarifying that no such

Surviving Company and their respective agents on how such withholding is to

advisors and accountants to prepare and file with the ITA an application for a
ruling (or an interim ruling) permitting holders of Company Shares that are
Israeli residents (as defined in the Ordinance or as will be determined by the
ITA) (the "Electing Holder"), to defer any applicable Israeli tax with
respect to the Stock Merger Consideration that such Electing Holder will
receive pursuant to this Agreement until the sale, transfer or other
conveyance for cash of such stock portion of the consideration by such
Electing Holder or such other date set forth in Section 104H of the Israeli
Tax Ordinance (the "104H Tax Ruling").

of the Company and Parent shall (i) cause their respective Israeli counsel,
advisors and accountants to coordinate all material activities, and to
cooperate with each other, with respect to the preparation and filing of such
application and in the preparation of any written or oral submissions that may
be necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Option Tax Ruling (including
the Interim Option Tax Ruling), the Withholding Tax Ruling and the 104H Tax

to the Company Shareholders' Meeting), then the Company shall pay (or cause to
be paid) the Termination Fee Amount to Parent, prior to or concurrently with
the consummation of such transaction, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent;
provided, that for purposes of clause (2) of this _Section 8.3(b)(iii)_ , all
references to "20%" in the definition of "Acquisition Transaction" shall be
deemed to be references to "50%.

(iv) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the
Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ (provided that prior to such termination
the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1(b)_ and ___7.1(c)_ shall have been
satisfied, except if the failure of either such condition to be satisfied was
the result of a breach of this Agreement by the Company), and (1) following
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the
Company Shareholders' Meeting, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
publicly announced, shall have become publicly disclosed, or shall have been
otherwise publicly made known to the Company Shareholders, and in each case
not withdrawn; and (2) within 12 months following the termination of this
Agreement, the Company enters into a Contract with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal and such Acquisition Proposal is thereafter consummated (which need
not be the same Acquisition Proposal that was publicly made, disclosed or
communicated prior to the Company Shareholders' Meeting), then the Company
shall pay (or cause to be paid) the Termination Fee Amount to Parent, prior
to or concurrently with the consummation of such transaction, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated
in writing by Parent; provided, that for purposes of clause (2) of this
_Section 8.3(b)(iv)_ , all references to "20%" in the definition of
"Acquisition Transaction" shall be deemed to be references to "50%

  



  

(c)   _Enforcement_. Each of the Parties acknowledges and
agrees that the provisions of _Section 8.3(b)_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), and that,
without such provisions, Parent would not have entered into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner the amounts due
pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ , and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
makes a claim that results in a non-appealable judgment in favor of such
payment against the Company, the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable
fees, costs and expenses (including its reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses) incurred in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
amounts set forth in _Section 8.3(b)_ , at the prime rate as published by
_The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to
be made, plus 2%, through the date such payment was actually received.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, upon
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, if Parent receives
payment from the Company of the Termination Fee Amount pursuant to _Section
8.3(b)_ and any applicable amount described in the previous sentence, such
payments shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger
Sub against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective
former, current or future shareholders, members, managers, directors,
officers, employees, agents or Representatives (together with the Company,
collectively, the "Company Related Parties") for all losses and damages
suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder
or otherwise, and none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in circumstances in which the
Termination Fee Amount is payable, other than with respect to claims for,
arising out of or in connection with fraud. In no event shall the Company be
obligated to pay, or cause to be paid, the Termination Fee Amount on more than
one occasion. The Termination Fee Amount is nonrefundable and shall not be
set off by or credited against any other payment.

  



  

8.4 _  _ _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by mutual
agreement of the Parties at any time by execution of an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, except that if
this Agreement has been approved by the Company Shareholders in accordance
with Israeli law, no amendment shall be made to this Agreement that requires
the approval of the Company Shareholders without such approval.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything herein to the contrary (including 
_Section 8.5_ ), _Section 9.3_ , the proviso in _9.5_ , the second proviso in
_9.9_ , _9.10(b)_ , _9.11_ ,  _9.13_ and this _Section 8.4_ (and any
provision of this Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver or
amendment of such provision would modify the substance of _Sections 9.3_ ,
the proviso in _9.5_ , the second proviso in _9.9_ ,  _9.10(b)_ , _9.11_ ,
_9.13_ and this _Section 8.4_ ) may not be modified, waived or amended in a
manner that is adverse to any Financing Source without the prior written
consent of such Financing Source.

  



  

8.5 _  _ _Extension; Waiver_. At any time and from time to
time prior to the Effective Time, any Party or Parties may, to the extent
legally permitted and except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts
of the other Party or Parties, as applicable; (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties made to such Party or Parties contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; or (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such
Party or Parties contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party or
Parties to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party or Parties, as
applicable. Any delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall not
constitute a waiver of such right.

the prior written approval of the other Parties. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit

rights (but not its obligations) under this Agreement to any of its
Financing Sources as collateral security, (b) Merger Sub may assign, in its
sole discretion, any or all of its rights, interests, or
obligations hereunder to any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, and (c)
Parent may transfer the equity interests of Merger Sub to any wholly owned,
newly-formed Subsidiary of Parent organized under the Laws of the State of
Israel, in any such case, without the prior written approval of the Company.

  



  

9.4 _  _ _Entire Agreement_.

  



  

(a)  This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and the
documents and instruments and other agreements among the Parties
as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Company Disclosure
Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter, constitute the entire agreement
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof. However, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall not be superseded, shall survive any termination of this
Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect until the earlier to
occur of (a) the Effective Time and (b) the date on which the Confidentiality
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.

  



  

(b)  The Company Disclosure Letter is not intended to
constitute, and shall not be construed as constituting, representations or
warranties of the Company, except and solely to the extent that a
representation or warranty set forth in _Article III_  of this Agreement
specifically states that a true and complete list of a particular item is set
forth in a particular section of the Company Disclosure Letter. Inclusion of
any item or other matter in the Company Disclosure Letter shall not be
construed as an admission or indication that such item or other matter is or
is not material, that such item has had a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company or that such item will in fact exceed any applicable threshold
limitation set forth in this Agreement. Headings in the Company Disclosure
Letter are inserted for reference purposes and for convenience of the reader
only, and shall not affect the interpretation thereof or of this Agreement.
Nothing contained in the Company Disclosure Letter shall be construed as an
admission of liability or responsibility in connection with any pending,
threatened or future matter or proceeding. Any disclosure set forth in one
section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be
disclosed by the Company for, and apply to and qualify, the section or
subsection of this Agreement to which it corresponds and each other section or
subsection of this Agreement and each other section or subsection of the
Company Disclosure Letter to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on its
face that such disclosure is applicable to such other section or subsection
of this Agreement or the Company Disclosure Letter.

(c) The Parent Disclosure Letter is not intended to
constitute, and shall not be construed as constituting, representations
or warranties of Parent, except and solely to the extent that a
representation or warranty set forth in _Article IV_ of this Agreement
specifically states that a true and complete list of a particular item is set
forth in a particular section of the Parent Disclosure Letter. Inclusion of
any item or other matter in the Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be
construed as an admission or indication that such item or other matter is or
is not material, that such item has had a Material Adverse Effect on Parent
or that such item will in fact exceed any applicable threshold limitation set
forth in this Agreement. Headings in the Parent Disclosure Letter are
inserted for reference purposes and for convenience of the reader only,
and shall not affect the interpretation thereof or of this Agreement. Nothing
contained in the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be construed as an admission
of liability or responsibility in connection with any pending, threatened or
future matter or proceeding. Any disclosure set forth in one section or
subsection of the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be disclosed by
Parent for, and apply to and qualify, the section or subsection of this
Agreement to which it corresponds and each other section or subsection of
this Agreement and each other section or subsection of the Parent Disclosure
Letter to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on its face that such
disclosure is applicable to such other section or subsection of this
Agreement or the Parent Disclosure Letter.

  



  

9.5 _  _ _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in
or contemplated by _Section 6.16_ , this Agreement is not intended to confer
upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except for (i) the
right of the Company Shareholders and holders of Company Options to receive
the consideration set forth in this Agreement following the Effective Time;
and (ii) the right of the Company to pursue, on behalf of its shareholders
and holders of Company Options, monetary damages in the event that (x) Parent
and Merger Sub do not consummate the Merger in willful breach of this
Agreement, and (y) the Company is unable to enforce the remedy of specific
performance; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Financing Sources shall be
express third party beneficiaries of and have the right to enforce their
rights under _Sections 8.4_ , _9.3_ , the second proviso in  _9.9_ ,
_9.10(b)_ , _9.11_ , _9.13_ and this _Section 9.5_.

  



  

9.6 _  _ _Severability_. In the event that any provision of
this Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court
of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder
of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application
of such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to
replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

  



  

9.7 _  _ _Other Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, any and all remedies in this Agreement expressly conferred
upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other
remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such Party, and the
exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy.

  



  

9.8 _  _ _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed by the Parties in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that,
without posting bond or other undertaking, each of the Parties shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof in any court of Israel, the United States or any state
having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity.

  



  

9.9 _  _ _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any dispute,
controversy or claim arising out of, relating to or in connection with this
Agreement, the negotiation, execution, existence, validity, enforceability or
performance of this Agreement, or for the breach or alleged breach hereof
(whether in contract, in tort or otherwise) shall be governed by and construed
and enforced solely in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware,
without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or
rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause application of the law of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware; _provided_ that provisions related to the matters set forth in
_Article 2_ that relate to the effectuation of the Merger, and all other
provisions of this Agreement that are expressly or otherwise required to be
governed by the Laws of the State of Israel shall be exclusively governed by
the Laws of the State of Israel; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
adjudication of any action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any
kind or description, whether at law or equity, whether in contract, in tort
or otherwise, involving a Financing Source in any way relating to this
Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Financing, the Debt Letters, the Definitive Financing Agreement or the
performance thereof or any other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
shall be governed by and in accordance with the laws of the State of New York
(it being understood and agreed that after Closing and solely with respect to
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, the governing law provisions of the
Definitive Financing Agreement shall supplant this proviso to the extent
applicable).

9.10 _  _ _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

  



  

(a)  Each of the Parties (i) irrevocably consents to the
service of the summons and complaint and any other process in any action or
proceeding relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, for
and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance
with _Section 9.2_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by Applicable
Law, and nothing in this _Section 9.10_ shall affect the right of any Party
to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Applicable Law; (ii)
irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or,
if (and only if) such court finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the
Federal court of the United States of America sitting in Delaware, and any
appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection
herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and (iii)
irrevocably and unconditionally (A) agrees not to commence any such action or
proceeding except in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if
(and only if) such court finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the
Federal court of the United States of America sitting in Delaware, and any
appellate court from any thereof, (B) agrees that any claim in respect of any
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court finds it
lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of
America sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, (C)
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such action or proceeding in such courts, and (D) waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court
that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. Each of the Parties agrees that a final
judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law.

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing and without limiting
_Section 9.13_ , each Party unconditionally and irrevocably agrees that it
will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract, in tort or otherwise, against a Financing Source in any
way relating to this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Financing, the Debt Letters, the Definitive
Financing Agreement or the performance thereof or any other transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of
the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under Applicable Law
exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts
thereof); provided that, after the Closing and solely with respect to Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company, it is understood and agreed that the submission to
jurisdiction provisions of the Definitive Financing Agreement (and related
documents) shall supplant this paragraph to the extent applicable.

  



  

9.11 _  _ _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE, IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS
DELIVERED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY, INCLUDING ANY LITIGATION INVOLVING ANY FINANCING SOURCE,
OR WITH RESPECT TO THE FINANCING, THE DEBT LETTERS OR THE DEFINITIVE
FINANCING AGREEMENT, THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF, OR ANY OTHER TRANSACTION
CONTEMPLATED THEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THAT FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER
PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER
DOCUMENTS ENTERED INTO IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.11_.

  



  

9.12 _ __Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendments hereto
may be executed in one or more textually identical counterparts, all of which
will be considered one and the same agreement and will become effective when
one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and
delivered to the other Parties, it being understood that all Parties need not
sign the same counterpart. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by
fax or .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or similar attachment to electronic mail (any
such delivery, an "Electronic Delivery"), will be treated in all manner and
respects as an original executed counterpart and will be considered to have
the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. No Party may raise the use of an Electronic
Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement
or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of an Electronic
Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each Party forever
waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of
authenticity.

9.13 _  _ _Waiver of Claims_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Company (prior to the Closing) (and each of its
officers, directors, employees, agents, Representatives and Affiliates) hereby
waives any rights or claims (whether at law or equity, in contract, tort or
otherwise) against any of the Financing Sources in any way relating to this
Agreement, the Financing, the Debt Letters or the Definitive Financing
Agreement, the performance thereof or any other transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, and the Company (prior to the Closing) (and
each of its officers, directors, employees, agents, Representatives and
Affiliates) hereby agrees not to commence any action or proceeding (whether at
law or equity, in contract, tort or otherwise) against any Financing Source
in any way relating to this Agreement, the Financing, the Debt Letters or the
Definitive Financing Agreement, the performance thereof or any other
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and further agrees to (in the
case of itself) and to cause (in the case of its officers, directors,
employees, agents, Representatives and Affiliates) any such action or
proceeding asserted by the Company (prior to Closing) (whether at law or
equity, in contract, tort or otherwise) against any of the Financing Sources
in any way relating to this Agreement, the Financing, the Debt Letters or the
Definitive Financing Agreement, the performance thereof or any other
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby to be dismissed or otherwise
terminated. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing waiver, it
is acknowledged and agreed that no Financing Source shall have any
liability for any claims or damages to the Company (prior to the Closing) in
any way relating to this Agreement, the Financing, the Debt Letters or the
Definitive Financing Agreement, the performance thereof or any other
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
