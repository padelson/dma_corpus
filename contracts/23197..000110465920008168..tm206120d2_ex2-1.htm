</FONT><I>Enforcement</I>. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of <U>Section&nbsp;8.3(b)</U> are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), and that, without such provisions, Parent
would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant
to <U>Section 8.3(b)</U>, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent makes a claim that results in a non-appealable judgment
in favor of such payment against the Company, the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable fees, costs and expenses (including
its reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts
set forth in <U>Section 8.3(b)</U>, at the prime rate as published by <I>The Wall Street Journal</I> in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made, plus 2%, through the date such payment was actually received. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, upon termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, if Parent receives payment
from the Company of the Termination Fee Amount pursuant to <U>Section 8.3(b)</U> and any applicable amount described in the previous
sentence, such payments shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and its Subsidiaries
and any of their respective former, current or future shareholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents or
Representatives (together with the Company, collectively, the &ldquo;<B>Company Related Parties</B>&rdquo;) for all losses and
damages suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach
or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in circumstances in which the Termination
Fee Amount is payable, other than with respect to claims for, arising out of or in connection with fraud. In no event shall the
Company be obligated to pay, or cause to be paid, the Termination Fee Amount on more than one occasion. The Termination Fee Amount
is nonrefundable and shall not be set off by or credited against any other payment.</P>
