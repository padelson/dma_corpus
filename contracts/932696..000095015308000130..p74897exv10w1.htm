    ##### 

  

    

to such holder as soon as administratively feasible following the Closing in
accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section 1.9_ hereof, without
interest thereon. If the exercise price of any Option equals or exceeds a
Fully Diluted Fractional Interest of the Aggregate Proceeds, the Option Cash
Payment therefor shall be zero. 

   

 1.9. _Payment of Merger Consideration._  

  

 (a) _Paying Agent_. The Company shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Buyer to act as paying agent in the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "), pursuant to an agreement containing terms and provisions reasonably acceptable to Buyer that requires the Paying Agent to comply with the procedures set forth in this _Section 1.9_, and on the Closing Date, Buyer shall make available, or cause the Surviving Company to make available, to the Paying Agent funds in amounts necessary for the payment of the aggregate Member Cash Payment and the aggregate Option Cash Payment. 

   

 (b) _Letter of Transmittal_. As of or promptly after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent will mail to each holder of record of a certificate representing membership interests in the Company (each, a " _Certificate_ ") at the Effective Time as reflected on the Closing Date Capitalization Schedule (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and which letter shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Buyer shall reasonably specify (including, without limitation, provisions for the delivery of certificates of non-foreign status and representations and warranties regarding title and ownership), and (ii) instructions for surrendering the Certificates. As of or promptly after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent will mail (to the extent not previously received from an Option Holder) to each Option Holder as reflected on the Option Schedule a letter of transmittal in such form and with such provisions as Buyer shall reasonably specify (including, without limitation, waivers regarding rights under the Companys Class C Unit Option Plan and Options issued thereunder). 

   

 (c) _Surrender of Certificates_. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent by the holder of record of such Certificate and delivery of a duly executed letter of transmittal and any other documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent by the record holder of such Certificate or an Option Holder (including, if applicable, duly executed certificates of non-foreign status), the holder of such Certificate and such Option Holder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Member Cash Payment or the Option Cash Payment, as applicable, evidenced by such Certificate or letter of transmittal less any required withholding of Taxes in accordance with _Section 1.14_. Any Certificates so surrendered shall be cancelled immediately. No interest shall accrue or be paid on any amount payable upon surrender of the Certificates by holders of record of such Certificates or delivery of a letter of transmittal by the Option Holders. 

   

 (d) _Unregistered Transferees_. If any part of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, then such part of the Merger Consideration may be paid or otherwise delivered to such a transferee so long as (i) the surrendered Certificate is accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment (A) pays any applicable transfer Taxes or (B) establishes to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Taxes have already been paid or are not applicable. 

   

 (e) _No Other Rights_. Until surrendered in accordance with this _Section 1.9_, each Certificate shall be deemed, except as provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law, from and after the Effective Time, to represent for all purposes solely the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Payment of the Merger Consideration 

    ##### 

  

    

upon the surrender of any Certificate shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to that Certificate and the
membership interests formerly evidenced by it. 

   

 (f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Buyer, the posting by such Person of a bond or surety in such reasonable and customary form and amount as Buyer may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect thereto. 

   

 1.10. _Purchase Price and Deliveries at Closing._  

  

 (a) In the Merger, Buyer will pay an aggregate purchase price (the " _Purchase Price_ ") equal to $125,000,000, as adjusted upward or downward pursuant to _Section 1.10(b)_, which shall be paid to the Members and Option Holders in the manner provided by this _Article I_. The Purchase Price shall be subject to further adjustment following the Closing pursuant to  _Section 1.11_. 

   

 (b) Not more than five Business Days nor less than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Buyer a schedule (the " _Estimated Adjustment Schedule_ ") setting forth the Companys calculation of its good faith estimate of the Working Capital Assets less the Working Capital Liabilities as of the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Closing Date Working Capital Amount_ ") based on the most recently available unaudited month-end consolidated balance sheet of the Company regularly prepared by the Company in accordance with GAAP. If the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital Amount set forth on the Estimated Adjustment Schedule (i) exceeds Base Net Working Capital, the Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount equal to such surplus, _provided_ , _however_ , that the maximum amount the Purchase Price shall be increased under this clause (i) is $10,000,000 or (ii) is less than Base Net Working Capital, the Purchase Price shall be decreased by an amount equal to such deficiency (such upward or downward adjustment pursuant to this _Section 1.10(b)_ is hereinafter referred to as the " _Estimated Adjustment Amount Due_ "). 

   

 (c) On the Closing Date, Buyer will deliver the following: 

    

 (i) to the Paying Agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds, (1) an amount (the " _Member Cash Payment_ ") equal to the excess of (A) the Purchase Price  _over_ (B) the sum of (x) the Escrow Amount (as defined below) and (y) the aggregate Option Cash Payment for distribution to the Members and (2) the aggregate Option Cash Payment for distribution to the Option Holders, in each case in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section 1.9_ and pursuant to the allocations set forth in the Closing Date Capitalization Schedule and Option Schedule, as applicable; and 

   

 (ii) to the Escrow Agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount (the " _Escrow Amount_ "), equal to the sum of: 

   

 (A) an amount equal to the product of (I) the Purchase Price plus $25,000,000  _multiplied by_ (II) 0.07, which shall constitute the General Indemnification Escrow (as such term is defined in the Escrow Agreement); _plus_  

   

 (B) an amount equal to the greater of (I) the product of (a) the Purchase Price plus $25,000,000 _multiplied by_ (b) 0.0333, or (II) the Estimated Adjustment Amount Due (but only if such amount would result in an upward adjustment to the Purchase Price), which shall constitute the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow (as such term is defined in the Escrow Agreement); _plus_  

   ##### 

  

   

 (C) $945,000, which shall constitute the Change of Control Escrow (as such term is defined in the Escrow Agreement); _plus_  

   

 (D) $2,000,000, which shall constitute the Special Indemnity Escrow (as such term is defined in the Escrow Agreement). 

  

 (d) The Escrow Amount shall be distributed as contemplated in the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Amount shall be held by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ "). The General Indemnification Escrow, including all distributions thereon and proceeds thereof, will secure the indemnification obligations under _Section 8.1(a)_, the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow, including all distributions thereon and proceeds thereof, will secure any potential adjustments due to Buyer under _Section 1.11_, and the Special Indemnity Escrow, including all distributions thereon and proceeds thereof, will secure the indemnification obligations under _Section 4(d)_ of the Support Agreement. In the event that Buyer incurs any Losses (under and as defined in the Support Agreement), the parties shall instruct the Escrow Agent to promptly disburse from the Special Indemnity Escrow in accordance with the Escrow Agreement to Buyer an amount equal to the amount of such Losses without regard to the limitations set forth in _Section 8.2(b)_. Any remaining amounts in the Special Indemnity Escrow shall be released on April 30, 2009. The Escrow Amount will be held and disbursed as provided in the Escrow Agreement. The parties will promptly give any necessary instructions to the Escrow Agent to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. 

   

 1.11. _Post-Closing Adjustment._  

  

 (a) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than 60 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Member Agent a consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ "). Such balance sheet shall be accompanied by a schedule (the " _Buyer Adjustment Schedule_ ") setting forth Buyers calculation of (i) the Working Capital Assets and the Working Capital Liabilities, in each case as of the Closing Date (the " _Proposed Closing Date Working Capital Amount_ "), and (ii) the amount by which the Purchase Price should be adjusted (A) upward to the extent that the Proposed Closing Date Working Capital Amount is greater than the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital Amount, and (B) downward to the extent that the Proposed Closing Date Working Capital Amount is less than the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital Amount (such proposed upward or downward adjustment is hereinafter referred to as the " _Proposed Final Adjustment Amount Due_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of computing the Final Closing Date Working Capital Amount and the Final Adjustment Amount Due, no cap or limitation on the upward or downward adjustment, if any, to the Purchase Price in respect of the Proposed Final Adjustment Amount Due, shall apply. 

   

 (b) After receipt of the Buyer Adjustment Schedule, Member Agent may request, and Buyer will provide to Member Agent and its accountants and other representatives, upon reasonable notice, reasonable access during normal business hours to, or copies of, as Member Agent or such accountants and other representatives shall reasonably request, the information (including the books and records of the Surviving Company), data and work papers used in connection with the preparation of the Buyer Adjustment Schedule and to calculate the Proposed Final Adjustment Amount Due, and will make its and the Surviving Companys personnel and accountants reasonably available to Member Agent and its accountants and other representatives to discuss any such information, data or work papers. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the Dispute Period (as defined below), Buyer agrees to make available to Member Agent the services of the Chief Financial Officer and Controller of the Company as of the Effective Time (to the extent such persons are employees of the Surviving Company or Buyer during the Dispute Period) as requested by Member Agent to assist Member Agent with its evaluation and review of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and Buyer Adjustment Schedule; _provided, however_ , that neither the Chief Financial Officer nor the Controller shall be required to devote more than 

    ##### 

  

    

50% of his working hours each week to assisting Member Agent with its
evaluation and review of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Buyer
Adjustment Schedule. Buyer agrees that such persons shall not in any way be
deemed to have breached any fiduciary duty, duty of loyalty, or other
duty owed to Buyer or the Surviving Company by so assisting Member Agent, and
shall not have any liability to Buyer or the Surviving Company with respect
to such assistance. 

   

 (c) Member Agent shall have 30 days from the date that Member Agent receives the deliveries contemplated in _Section 1.11(a)_ (the " _Dispute Period_ ") to notify Buyer, in writing, as to whether Member Agent (i) agrees with the Buyer Adjustment Schedule and the Proposed Final Adjustment Amount Due (an " _Approval Notice_ ") or (ii) disagrees with such calculations, identifying with reasonable detail the items with which Member Agent disagrees (a " _Dispute Notice_ "). 

   

 (d) If Member Agent fails to deliver a Dispute Notice to Buyer during the Dispute Period, the Buyer Adjustment Schedule and the Proposed Final Adjustment Amount Due shall be deemed to be final and correct and shall be binding upon each of the parties hereto. 

   

 (e) If Member Agent delivers a Dispute Notice to Buyer during the Dispute Period, Buyer and Member Agent shall, for a period of 20 days from the date the Dispute Notice is delivered to Buyer (the " _Resolution Period_ "), use their respective good faith efforts to amicably resolve the items in dispute. Any items so resolved by them shall be deemed to be final and correct as so resolved and shall be binding upon each of the parties hereto. 

   

 (f) If Buyer and Member Agent are unable to resolve all of the items in dispute during the Resolution Period, then either Member Agent or Buyer may refer the items remaining in dispute (the " _Remaining Disputes_ ") to Deloitte and Touche LLP, 2901 N. Central Avenue, Suite 1200, Phoenix, AZ 85012 (the " _Independent Accountants_ "). Such referral shall be made in writing to the Independent Accountants, copies of which shall concurrently be delivered to the non-referring party hereto. The referring party shall furnish the Independent Accountants, at the time of such referral, with copies of the deliveries contemplated in _Section 1.11(a)_ and the Dispute Notice. The parties shall also furnish the Independent Accountants with such other information and documents as the Independent Accountants may reasonably request in order for them to resolve the Remaining Disputes. The parties hereto shall also, within ten days of the date the Remaining Disputes are referred to the Independent Accountants, provide the Independent Accountants with a written notice (a " _Position Statement_ ") describing in reasonable detail their respective positions on the Remaining Disputes (copies of which shall concurrently be delivered to the other party hereto). If any party fails to timely deliver its Position Statement to the Independent Accountants, the Independent Accountants shall resolve the Remaining Disputes solely upon the basis of the information otherwise provided to them. The Independent Accountants shall resolve all Remaining Disputes in a written determination to be delivered to each of the parties hereto within 30 days after such matter is referred to them. The decision of the Independent Accountants as to the Remaining Disputes shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto (except to correct manifest clerical or mathematical errors) and shall not be subject to judicial review. The fees and disbursements of the Independent Accountants shall be apportioned between Buyer and the Company based on the total dollar value of disputed exceptions resolved in favor of each such party, with each such party bearing such percentage of the fees and disbursements of the Independent Accountants as the aggregate disputed exceptions resolved against that party bears to the total dollar value of all disputed exceptions considered by the Independent Accountants. 

   

 (g) Within five Business Days following the date on which the Final Adjustment Amount Due is finally determined pursuant to this Agreement (whether through failure of Member Agent to timely deliver a Dispute Notice, agreement of the parties, or final determination of any Remaining Disputes by the Independent Accountants): 

    ##### 

  

      

 (i) if the Final Adjustment Amount Due results in an upward adjustment to the Purchase Price, (x) Buyer shall deliver to (a) the Paying Agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to the product of (i) the Final Adjustment Amount Due  _multiplied by_ (ii) 0.93 for distribution to the Members in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section 1.9(b)_ and pursuant to the allocations set forth in the Closing Date Capitalization Schedule and (b) the Escrow Agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to the product of (x) the Final Adjustment Amount Due _multiplied by_ (y) 0.07, which shall be added to the General Indemnification Escrow, and (y) the parties shall instruct the Escrow Agent to promptly disburse the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow in accordance with the Escrow Agreement to the Paying Agent for distribution to the Members in accordance with the procedures set forth in  _Section 1.9(b)_. 

   

 (ii) if the Final Adjustment Amount Due results in a downward adjustment to the Purchase Price, the parties shall instruct the Escrow Agent to promptly disburse from the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow in accordance with the Escrow Agreement (x) to Buyer, an amount equal to the Final Adjustment Amount Due and (y) to the Paying Agent for distribution to the Members in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section 1.9(b)_, the remaining amounts (if any) of the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow. 

  

 (h) For purposes of this _Section 1.11_, the following defined terms have the following meanings: 

    

 (i) " _Final Adjustment Amount Due_ " shall mean, as finally determined in accordance with this _Section 1.11_, the amount by which the Purchase Price shall be adjusted (A) upward to the extent that the Final Closing Date Working Capital Amount is greater than the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital Amount and (B) downward to the extent that the Final Closing Date Working Capital Amount is less than the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital Amount. 

   

 (ii) " _Final Closing Date Working Capital Amount_ " shall mean, as finally determined in accordance with this _Section 1.11_, the amount of the Working Capital Assets less the Working Capital Liabilities, in each case as of the Closing Date. 

  

 1.12. Earn-Out Payments. 

  

 (a) Buyer shall make additional payments to the Members (collectively, the " _Earn-Out Payments_ ") based on the Pro Rata Portion of the Company owned by each Member immediately prior to the Effective Time equal to the sum of: 

    

 (i) for each of the first four 12-month periods following the end of the quarter in which the Closing occurs (each, an " _Earn-Out Period_ "), an amount equal to the product of (A) the E-Rate Gross Profit attributable to such Earn-Out Period (not to exceed $12,500,000 for all Earn-Out Periods), _multiplied by_ (B) two; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall payments under this clause (i) exceed in the aggregate $25,000,000; _plus_  

   

 (ii) in the event that the E-Rate Gross Profit for the first two Earn-Out Periods, in the aggregate, exceeds $18,000,000, an amount equal to the product of (A) the E-Rate Gross Profit for the first two Earn-Out Periods in excess of $18,000,000, _multiplied by_  (B) two; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall payments under this clause (ii) exceed in the aggregate $10,000,000; _plus_  

   ##### 

  

   

 (iii) accrued interest on the amounts payable pursuant to the foregoing clause (i) at the rate of 5% per annum, compounded monthly; _provided_ , that the accrued interest shall be calculated on such amounts from the Closing Date through the estimated date of the applicable Earn-Out Payments. For purposes of clarity, if no Earn-Out Payments are due, no accrued interest amounts are payable. 

 

For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will the aggregate Earn-Out Payments
under clauses (i) and (ii) immediately preceding exceed in the aggregate
$35,000,000 plus accrued interest computed in accordance with clause (iii)
immediately preceding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time during
any Earn-Out Period, any of the events specified on  _Schedule 1.12(a)_
attached hereto (each an " _Earn-Out Termination Event_ ") occurs: 

   

 (1) the Earn-Out Periods hereunder shall cease for periods beginning as of the first day of the calendar quarter in which such Earn-Out Termination Event occurred (the " _Earn-Out End Date_ "), and 

  

 (2) the aggregate Earn-Out Payments that Members are entitled to receive under clauses (i) and (ii) of _Section 1.12(a)_ for the period commencing on the first day of the first Earn-Out Period and ending on the Earn-Out End Date (the " _Earn-Out Termination Period_ ") shall be equal to the sum of: 

   

 (x) the E-Rate Gross Profit attributable to the Earn-Out Termination Period not to exceed $12,500,000, _plus_  

   

 (y) the Earn-Out Gross Profit attributable to the first two Earn-Out Periods or the Earn-Out Termination Period, whichever is shorter, in excess of $18,000,000;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the amount under this clause (y) shall not exceed $10,000,000, _plus_  

   

 (z) accrued interest on the amounts payable pursuant to the foregoing clause (x) at the rate of 5% per annum, compounded monthly; _provided_ , that the accrued interest shall be calculated on such amounts from the Closing Date through the estimated date of the applicable payments. For purposes of clarity, if no payments are due, no accrued interest amounts are payable. 

 

For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will the aggregate Earn-Out Payments
under clause (2) immediately preceding exceed $22,500,000 plus accrued
interest computed in accordance with clause (z) immediately preceding. If the
amount computed under clause (2) immediately preceding is less than the
amount of Earn-Out Payments actually made by Buyer prior to the occurrence of
the Earn-Out Termination Event (the " _Earn-Out Overpayment Amount_ "), the
Members shall promptly (and in any event within three Business Days following
the Earn-Out Termination Event) pay to Buyer the Earn-Out Overpayment
Amount. 

   

 (b) No later than 45 days after the end of each Earn-Out Period, Buyer shall deliver to Member Agent a statement prepared at the direction of the Surviving Companys Chief Financial Officer setting forth its good faith calculation of the E-Rate Gross Profit (the " _Gross Profit Statement_ ") and the proposed Earn-Out Payment (the " _Proposed Earn-Out Payment_ ") for that fiscal year. 

   

 (c) After receipt of the Gross Profit Statement and the Proposed Earn-Out Payment, Member Agent may request, and Buyer will provide to Member Agent and its accountants and other representatives, upon reasonable notice, reasonable access during normal business hours to, or copies of, as Member Agent or such accountants and other representatives shall reasonably request, the information (including the books and records of the Surviving Company), data, and work papers used in connection with the preparation of the Gross Profit Statement and to calculate the Proposed Earn-Out Payment, and 

    ##### 

  

    

will make its and the Surviving Companys personnel and accountants reasonably
available to Member Agent and its accountants and other representatives to
discuss any such information, data, or work papers. 

   

 (d) Member Agent shall have 30 days from the date that Member Agent receives the Gross Profit Statement (the " _Earn-Out Dispute Period_ ") to notify Buyer, in writing, as to whether Member Agent (i) agrees with the Gross Profit Statement and the Proposed Earn-Out Payment or (ii) disagrees with such calculations, identifying with reasonable detail the items with which Member Agent disagrees (an " _Earn-Out Dispute Notice_ "). 

   

 (e) If Member Agent fails to deliver an Earn-Out Dispute Notice to Buyer during the Earn-Out Dispute Period, the Gross Profit Statement and the Proposed Earn-Out Payment shall be deemed to be final and correct and shall be binding upon each of the parties hereto. 

   

 (f) If Member Agent delivers an Earn-Out Dispute Notice to Buyer during the Earn-Out Dispute Period, Buyer and Member Agent shall, for a period of 20 days from the date the Earn-Out Dispute Notice is delivered to Buyer (the " _Earn-Out Resolution Period_ "), use their respective good faith efforts to amicably resolve the items in dispute. Any items so resolved by them shall be deemed to be final and correct as so resolved and shall be binding upon each of the parties hereto. 

   

 (g) If Buyer and Member Agent are unable to resolve all of the items in dispute during the Earn-Out Resolution Period, then either Member Agent or Buyer may refer the items remaining in dispute (the " _Remaining Earn-Out Disputes_ ") to the Independent Accountants. Such referral shall be made in writing to the Independent Accountants, copies of which shall concurrently be delivered to the non-referring party hereto. The referring party shall furnish the Independent Accountants, at the time of such referral, with copies of the Gross Profit Statement, the Proposed Earn-Out Payment, and the Earn-Out Dispute Notice. The parties shall also furnish the Independent Accountants with such other information and documents as the Independent Accountants may reasonably request in order for them to resolve the Remaining Earn-Out Disputes. The parties hereto shall also, within ten days of the date the Remaining Earn-Out Disputes are referred to the Independent Accountants, provide the Independent Accountants with a written notice (an " _Earn-Out Position Statement_ ") describing in reasonable detail their respective positions on the Remaining Earn-Out Disputes (copies of which shall concurrently be delivered to the other party hereto). If any party fails to timely deliver its Earn-Out Position Statement to the Independent Accountants, the Independent Accountants shall resolve the Remaining Earn-Out Disputes solely upon the basis of the information otherwise provided to them. The Independent Accountants shall resolve all Remaining Earn-Out Disputes in a written determination to be delivered to each of the parties hereto within 30 days after such matter is referred to them. The decision of the Independent Accountants as to the Remaining Earn-Out Disputes shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto (except to correct manifest clerical or mathematical errors) and shall not be subject to judicial review. The fees and disbursements of the Independent Accountants shall be apportioned between Buyer and the Members based on the total dollar value of disputed exceptions resolved in favor of each such party, with each such party bearing such percentage of the fees and disbursements of the Independent Accountants as the aggregate disputed exceptions resolved against that party bears to the total dollar value of all disputed exceptions considered by the Independent Accountants. 

   

 (h) During the period from the Effective Time until the end of the fourth Earn-Out Period, each of Buyer and the Surviving Company will (i) operate the E-Rate Business in the Ordinary Course of Business, including, without limitation, allocation of resources among the E-Rate Business and the non-E-Rate Business of the Surviving Company and the maintenance of the Surviving Companys relationships with its E-Rate Business customers, in each case consistent in all material respects with the Companys past practices, and (ii) refrain from removing material assets or material contracts from the business of the Surviving Company consistent in all material respects with the Companys past practices. 

    ##### 

  

    

In particular, Buyer shall, at or prior to the Effective Time, obtain and, if
necessary, guarantee on behalf of the Surviving Company bonding sufficient to
support the historical run rate of the E-Rate Business. Buyer shall refrain
from intentionally taking any actions intended to reduce the E-Rate Gross
Profit for the sole purpose of reducing the amount of the Earn-
Out Payments. 

   

 (i) If, prior to the end of the fourth Earn-Out Period, a majority of the membership interests of the Surviving Company or the Surviving Companys assets are disposed of in a single transaction or series of transactions, and assuming no Earn-Out Termination Event has occurred, upon the closing of such disposition, Buyer shall pay to the Members an amount equal to (A) $25,000,000  _plus_ accrued interest on such amount at the rate of 5% per annum, compounded monthly,  _plus_ the portion of the Earn-Out Payment described in _Section 1.12(a)(ii)_ to which the Members are entitled, _less_ (B) the aggregate amount of all Earn-Out Payments previously made. If, within 24 months of the beginning of the first Earn-Out Period, Michael F. Fongs employment by the Surviving Company is terminated without " _Cause_ " or Mr. Fong resigns for " _Good Reason_ ", as such terms are defined in Mr. Fongs Employment Agreement, attached hereto as _Exhibit B_, and assuming no Earn-Out Termination Event has occurred, upon the effective date of such termination, Buyer shall pay to the Members an amount equal to (A) $25,000,000 _plus_ accrued interest on such amount at the rate of 5% per annum, compounded monthly, _less_ (B) the aggregate amount of all Earn-Out Payments previously made;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not be required to make such payment if (x) Mr. Fong intentionally takes any actions intended to increase the E-Rate Gross Profit for the sole purpose of increasing the amount of the Earn-Out Payments in a manner detrimental to the non-E-Rate Business of the Surviving Company and inconsistent in any material respect with the Companys past practice and (y) Buyer provides Mr. Fong written notice specifying in reasonable detail actions taken by Mr. Fong in violation of clause (x) and Mr. Fong fails to cure such violations to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer within 30 days following receipt of such notice. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the proviso immediately preceding shall in any way limit the Members right to receive Earn-Out Payments they are otherwise entitled to under this _Section 1.12_. 

   

 (j) Within three Business Days following the date on which a Proposed Earn-Out Payment is finally determined pursuant to this Agreement (whether through failure of Member Agent to timely deliver an Earn-Out Dispute Notice, agreement of the parties, or final determination of any Remaining Earn-Out Disputes by the Independent Accountants), Buyer shall pay to the Members the applicable Earn-Out Payments, if any. 

   

 1.13. Change of Control Payments. In the event that the Company makes any payment under any Change of Control Severance Agreement listed on _Schedule 1.13_ attached hereto, the parties shall instruct the Escrow Agent to promptly disburse from the Change of Control Escrow in accordance with the Escrow Agreement to Buyer an amount equal to the amount set forth on such schedule corresponding to such Change of Control Severance Agreement (each such payment, a " _Change of Control Payment_ "). 

  

 1.14. Tax Withholding. Buyer or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration, or other payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, the amounts required to be deducted and withheld under the Code, or any provision of any Federal, state, local or foreign tax law.

ARTICLE VIII  INDEMNIFICATION 

   

 8.1. _Indemnification; Remedies._  

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Members (as constituted immediately prior to the Effective Time), solely out of the Escrow Fund, shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Buyer and its Subsidiaries, Affiliates, successors, assigns, officers, directors, stockholders, and employees from and against all Damages incurred by any of them that arise out of or result from (i) any breach of any representation or warranty contained in _Article II_ of this Agreement, or (ii) any breach by the Company of any of its covenants in this Agreement. 

   

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Members (as constituted immediately prior to the Effective Time) and their respective Affiliates, successors, assigns, officers, directors, members, and employees from and against all Damages incurred by any of them that arise out of or result from (i) any breach of Buyers representations and warranties contained in _Article III_ of this Agreement, or (ii) any breach by Buyer of any of its covenants in this Agreement. Such obligation to indemnify under this _Section 8.1(b)_ shall terminate on the earlier of (x) the date that is three years following the Effective Time and (y) March 31, 2011, unless before such termination date Member Agent shall have delivered to Buyer a Claim Notice with respect to which any claim for indemnification set forth therein has not been finally resolved as contemplated by this _Article VIII_ as of the expiration of such period, in which case such obligation to indemnify shall continue beyond such period but only with respect to any such unresolved claim and only until such unresolved claim is finally resolved as contemplated by this _Article VIII_. 

   

 8.2. _Limitation on Liability._  

  

 (a) With respect to indemnification under _Section 8.1(a)_, such obligation to indemnify shall terminate on the later of (i) the twelve-month anniversary of the Closing and (ii) the earlier of (w) 30 days after the completion of Buyers financial audit for the year ending December 31, 

    ##### 

  

    

2008 and (x) April 30, 2009, unless before such termination date Buyer shall
have delivered to Member Agent a Claim Notice with respect to which any claim
for indemnification set forth therein has not been finally resolved as
contemplated by this _Article VIII_, in which case such obligation to
indemnify shall continue beyond such period but only with respect to any
such unresolved claim and only until such unresolved claim is finally
resolved as contemplated by this  _Article VIII_. 

   

 (b) There shall be no obligation to indemnify under _Section 8.1(a)_ unless the liability for all such indemnification claims hereunder, in the aggregate, exceeds $1,500,000 (the " _Basket_ "), and then only to the extent of such excess. Once the Basket has been reached, the Members shall not have any liability for any individual claim for indemnity arising under  _Section 8.1(a)_ of $15,000 or less. The maximum liability of the Members with respect to indemnification arising under _Section 8.1(a)_ shall not, in the aggregate, exceed the General Indemnification Escrow. 

   

 (c) The amount of any Damages subject to indemnification under _Section 8.1_ shall be calculated net of any amounts that are actually recovered by Buyer or its Affiliates under insurance policies or other collateral sources (such as contractual indemnities of any Person that are contained outside this Agreement), and Buyer hereby covenants that, to the extent related to claims for indemnification already paid pursuant to _Section 8.1_, neither it nor its Affiliates will release any such collateral sources from any obligations those sources may have and that Buyer and its Affiliates will use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue all such insurance claims or other collateral sources promptly and in good faith. In the event any such amounts recoverable under insurance policies or other collateral sources are not received before any claim for indemnification is paid pursuant to _Section 8.1_, then Buyer and its Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue such insurance policies or collateral sources, and in the event it receives any recovery, the amount of such recovery shall be applied first, to reimburse Buyer and its Affiliates for their out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) expended in pursuing such recovery, and second, to refund any payments made by the Members that would not have been so paid had such recovery been obtained prior to such payment. In addition, all Damages subject to indemnification hereunder shall be calculated net of any Tax Benefits that are realized by Buyer or its Affiliates as a result thereof; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if such reduction in Tax liability of Buyer is subsequently required to be paid to a Governmental Authority, then the Members shall make a payment to Buyer in the amount equal to the excess of (i) the amount of such payment made by Buyer to the Governmental Authority over (ii) the Subsequent Tax Benefit. 

   

 8.3. _Notice of Claim; Defense._  

  

 (a) For purposes of this _Article VIII_, a party making a claim for indemnity under  _Section 8.1(a)_ or _8.1(b)_ is hereinafter referred to as an " _Indemnified Party_ " and the party against whom such claim is asserted is hereinafter referred to as the " _Indemnifying Party_."

If any claim, demand, investigation, action or proceeding (a " _Proceeding_ ") for which an Indemnifying Party would be liable to an Indemnified Party is asserted against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party, said Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such Proceeding stating with reasonable specificity the circumstances of the Indemnified Partys claim for indemnification (a " _Claim Notice_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that any failure to give such notice will not waive any rights of the Indemnified Party except to the extent the rights of the Indemnifying Party are actually and materially prejudiced or to the extent that any applicable period set forth in _Section 8.2(a)_ has expired without such notice being given. After receipt by the Indemnifying Party of such notice, then upon reasonable notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party, or upon the request of the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party may elect to retain counsel reasonably acceptable to the relevant Indemnified Parties to represent such Indemnified Parties in connection with such Proceeding and shall pay the fees, charges and disbursements of such counsel, and 

    ##### 

  

    

shall take all actions necessary, including but not limited to the posting of
such bond or other security as may be required by any Governmental Authority,
so as to enable the Proceeding to be defended against or resolved without
expense or other action by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Parties may
participate, at their own expense and through legal counsel of their choice,
in any such Proceeding, provided that (i) the Indemnifying Party may elect to
control the defense of the Indemnified Parties in connection with such
Proceeding and (ii) the Indemnified Parties and their counsel shall
reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in
connection with such Proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
Indemnifying Party elects not to retain counsel and assume control of such
defense (or fails to give prompt notice of its intention to do so) or if
conflicts of interests exist or arise between the Indemnifying Party and such
Indemnified Party (other than with respect to the Proceeding), or different
defenses are available with respect to such Proceeding, then the Indemnified
Parties shall retain counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party
(it being understood that counsel from any nationally recognized law firm
shall be deemed reasonably acceptable) in connection with such Proceeding and
assume control of the defense in connection with such Proceeding, and the
reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel selected by
each Indemnified Party shall be reimbursed promptly by the Indemnifying
Party. No compromise or settlement of such claims may be effected by the
Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified Partys prior written consent
unless: (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of any
Legal Requirement; (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages, none of
which are required to be paid by the Indemnified Party; and (C) such
compromise of settlement contains a full and unconditional release of the
Indemnified Party. Under no circumstances will the Indemnifying Party have
any liability in connection with any settlement of any Proceeding that is
entered into without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably delayed or withheld). 

   

 (b) From and after the delivery of a Claim Notice, at the reasonable request of the Indemnifying Party, each Indemnified Party shall grant the Indemnifying Party and its counsel, experts and representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the books, records, personnel and properties of the Indemnified Party to the extent reasonably related to the Claim Notice at no cost to the Indemnifying Party (other than for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Indemnified Parties). 

   

 (c) Pursuant to this _Section 8_, notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any claim in respect of Taxes, both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in and control any audit the resolution of which may give rise to a claim for Taxes in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to _Section 8.1_, and the resolution of any such audit shall be subject to the approval of Buyer and Member Agent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

   

 8.4. Assumption of Indemnification Obligations. In the event that the Company or Buyer or any of their respective successors or assigns (a) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (b) transfers or conveys all or a substantial portion of its properties and assets to any Person (whether by sale, merger, operation of law or otherwise), then, and in each such case and as a condition precedent to the validity of any such action, proper provision will be made so that the successors and assigns of the Company or Buyer, as the case may be, shall fully assume the obligations thereof set forth in _Sections 8.1(a)_ and _8.1(b)_ , as applicable. 

  

 8.5. Member Agent. Member Agent has been duly appointed as agent for each Member, with power to act for and on behalf of the Members with respect to the Escrow Agreement, _Article VIII_ and _Sections 1.11 and 1.12_. Member Agent is authorized to (a) give and receive notices and communications, (b) authorize delivery to Buyer of monies from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims made by Buyer, (c) deliver notices of objection, (d) agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and 

   ##### 

  

    

demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators
with respect to such claims, and (e) take all actions necessary or appropriate
in the judgment of Member Agent to carry out his responsibilities, exercise
his authority and represent the interests of the Members. Notices or
communications to or from Member Agent will constitute notice to or from each
of the Members.

 9.3. Governing Law. The provisions of this Agreement and the documents delivered pursuant hereto shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Delaware (excluding any conflict of law rule or principle that would refer to the laws of another jurisdiction). 

  

 9.4. _Dispute Resolution_. If there is a material dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement (other than with respect to the determination of Final Closing Date Working Capital Amount and the Final Adjustment Due, which shall be subject to the provisions of _Section 1.11_, or any dispute over the amount of any Earn-Out Payments, which shall be resolved in accordance with _Section 1.12_) or any Collateral Agreement, then the parties will resolve such dispute in the following manner: (i) any party may at any time deliver to the other a written dispute notice setting forth a brief description of the issue; (ii) during the 45-day period following the delivery of the written dispute notice the parties will meet and seek to resolve the disputed issue through negotiation; and (iii) if the parties are unable to resolve the disputed issue through negotiation, then within 30 days after that 45-day period (or such longer period as the parties mutually agree upon), the parties will refer the issue to final and binding arbitration in Phoenix, Arizona in accordance with the then existing rules (the " _Rules_ ") of the American Arbitration Association (" _AAA_ "), and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the law applicable to any controversy shall be the law of the state of Delaware, regardless of principles of conflicts of laws. In any arbitration pursuant to this Agreement, (a) discovery shall be allowed and governed by the Arizona Rules of Civil Procedure, and (b) the award or decision shall be rendered by a majority of the members of a Board of Arbitration consisting of three members, one of whom shall be appointed by each of the parties and the third of whom shall be the chairman of the panel and be appointed by mutual agreement of the two party-appointed arbitrators; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, persons eligible to be selected as arbitrators shall be limited to attorneys-at-law, each of whom (x) is on the AAAs Large, Complex Case Panel or a Center for Public Resources (" _CPR_ ") Panel of Distinguished Neutrals, or has professional credentials comparable to those of the attorneys listed on such AAA and CPR Panels, (y) has actively practiced law (in private practice) for at least 15 years concentrating in mergers and acquisitions, and (z) has not performed (or whose law firm has not performed) any material services to any of the parties hereto (or their respective Affiliates) at any time prior to his or her appointment as an arbitrator hereunder.

agreeing in writing to submit any dispute to a single arbitrator in lieu of a
three-member Board of Arbitration. Upon the completion of the selection of the
Board of Arbitration (or if the parties agree otherwise in writing, a single
arbitrator), an award or decision shall be rendered within no more than 45

 9.12. Attorneys Fees.

 9.14. No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as set forth in _Article VIII_, this Agreement is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties any legal or equitable rights or remedies; _provided_ , _however_ , that it is specifically agreed that, from and after the Effective Time, Member Agent may enforce this Agreement on behalf of the Members. 

  

 9.15. Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void, or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid, void or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration, area or applicability of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid, void, or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision.
