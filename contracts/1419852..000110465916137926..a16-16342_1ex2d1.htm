 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the foregoing and the

Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, the Company,
HoldCo and Merger Sub hereby agree as follows:

 



 

 **1** **The Transactions**

 



 

 **1.1** **The Offer**

 



 

 **1.1.1** As promptly as practical after the date of this Agreement on a date
mutually agreeable to Parent, HoldCo and the Company (but in no event later
than August 16, 2016), Merger Sub shall (and Parent and HoldCo shall (and
Parent shall cause HoldCo to) cause Merger Sub to) commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer.

 



 

 **1.1.2** In accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and
subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent such waiver is permitted
by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Annex I (collectively, the "
**Offer Conditions** "), Merger Sub shall (and HoldCo shall (and Parent shall
cause HoldCo to) cause Merger Sub to), promptly (within the meaning of Rule
14e-1(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the " **Exchange Act** ")) following the
Expiration Time, irrevocably accept for payment (the time of acceptance for
payment, the " **Offer Acceptance Time** ") and, at or as promptly as
practicable following the Offer Acceptance Time (but in any event within three
(3) Business Days (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the
Exchange Act) thereafter) pay for all shares of Company Common Stock validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer. HoldCo shall (and
Parent shall cause HoldCo to) provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub,
at the Offer Acceptance Time and on a timely basis at all times thereafter,
the funds necessary to purchase any shares of Company Common Stock that Merger
Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

 



 

 **1.1.3** The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the "
**Offer to Purchase** ") in accordance with the terms set forth in this
Agreement and subject only to the Offer Conditions. Merger Sub expressly
reserves the right to (i) increase the Offer Price, (ii) waive any Offer
Condition other than the Minimum

 



      
 

 



 

Condition and (iii) make any other changes to the terms and conditions of the
Offer not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement; provided that,
without the prior written consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not, and
HoldCo shall (and Parent shall cause HoldCo to) cause Merger Sub not to:

 



 

(i) decrease the Offer Price;

 



 

(ii) change the form of consideration to be paid in the Offer;

 



 

(iii) decrease the number of shares subject to the Offer; or

 



 

(iv) impose additional conditions to the Offer or, except as permitted by this
Agreement, otherwise amend, modify or supplement any of the conditions to the
Offer or terms of the Offer in a manner materially adverse to the holders of
the shares of Company Common Stock.

 



 

 **1.1.4** The Offer shall expire at Midnight (New York City time) on the date
that is twenty (20) Business Days following commencement (within the meaning
of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of the Offer (such initial expiration
date and time of the Offer, the " **Initial Expiration Time** ") or, if the
Offer has been extended pursuant to and in accordance with Section 1.1.5, the
date and time to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration
Time, or such later expiration date and time to which the Offer has been so
extended, the " **Expiration Time** ").

 



 

 **1.1.5** Subject to the parties respective rights to terminate the
Agreement pursuant to Section 7, the Offer may or shall, as applicable, be
extended from time to time as follows:

 



 

(i) if, at the then-scheduled Expiration Time, any of the Offer Conditions has
not been satisfied or waived by Parent, HoldCo and Merger Sub (to the extent
such waiver is permitted under this Agreement and applicable Law), then Merger
Sub shall, and HoldCo shall (and Parent shall cause HoldCo to) cause Merger
Sub to, extend the Offer on one or more occasions in consecutive increments of
five Business Days each (each such increment to end at 5:00 p.m. (New York
City time), on the last Business Day of such increment) (or such other
duration of up to 20 successive Business Days at the sole discretion of Parent
and HoldCo or as may be agreed to by Parent, HoldCo and the Company) in order
to permit the satisfaction of such Offer Condition(s); _provided_ , _however_
, that Merger Sub shall not be required or permitted to extend the Offer to a
date later than the Outside Date; and

 



 

(ii) Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for the minimum period required by
applicable Law, interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " **SEC** ") or its staff, or The NASDAQ Global Select Market
(" **NASDAQ** ") or its staff.

 



 

Merger Sub shall not, and HoldCo shall (and Parent shall cause HoldCo to) not
permit Merger Sub to, extend the Offer in any manner except as required or
expressly permitted pursuant to this Section 1.1.5 or as may otherwise be
agreed in writing with the Company.

 



      
 

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that, as a result of the extension
of the Offer in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.1.5, the
Expiration Time would occur on or after the date that is the Outside Date, the
Expiration Time shall instead occur at 5:00 p.m., (New York City time), on the
Business Day immediately preceding the Outside Date.

 



 

 **1.1.6** The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately and proportionately
to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into
Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Company
Common Stock occurring on or after the date of this Agreement and at or prior
to the Offer Acceptance Time, and such amendment to the Offer Price shall
provide to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company may not effect such change except as expressly
permitted by this Agreement.

 



 

 **1.1.7** In the event that this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
Section 7, Merger Sub shall (and HoldCo shall (and Parent shall cause HoldCo
to) cause Merger Sub to) as promptly as practicable (and in any event within
one Business Day of such termination) irrevocably and unconditionally
terminate the Offer, and shall not acquire any shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer and shall instruct any depository acting on behalf of
Parent, HoldCo or Merger Sub to return, in accordance with applicable Law, all
tendered shares of Company Common Stock to the registered holders thereof.

 



 

 **1.1.8** On the date of commencement of the Offer (within the meaning of
Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent, HoldCo or Merger Sub shall file
with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer
in accordance with Rule 14d-3 under the Exchange Act (together with all
exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto, the " **Schedule TO** ") that
will contain or incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase and form of the
related letter of transmittal (the Schedule TO, together with all documents
included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, the " **Offer
Documents** "). Parent, HoldCo and Merger Sub shall cause, at Merger Subs
expense, the Offer Documents to be disseminated to the Companys stockholders
as and to the extent required by applicable Law. Each of Parent, HoldCo,
Merger Sub and the Company shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents
if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and Parent and HoldCo further agree to use
reasonable best efforts to promptly cause, at Merger Subs expense, the Offer
Documents, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and to promptly be
disseminated to the Companys stockholders, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable Law. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
promptly furnish or otherwise make available to Parent, HoldCo, Merger Sub or
Parents, HoldCos and Merger Subs legal counsel any information concerning
the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries that is required by the Exchange
Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents or reasonably requested by

 



      
 

 



 

Parent, HoldCo or Merger Sub for inclusion in or in connection with the Offer
Documents. Parent, HoldCo and Merger Sub shall give the Company and its
counsel reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents
prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. Parent, HoldCo and Merger Sub shall
provide the Company and its counsel with a copy of any written comments, and a
written summary of any oral comments, that Parent, HoldCo, Merger Sub or their
counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents promptly after receipt of any such comments. Each of Parent, HoldCo
and Merger Sub shall give the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on any proposed written responses to any comments of the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents.

 



 

 **1.1.9** Parent, HoldCo, Merger Sub and the paying agent with respect to the
Offer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Offer Price payable
pursuant to the Offer such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "
**Code** "), or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent amounts are so withheld and (if required) paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

 **1.2** **Company Actions**

 



 

 **1.2.1** On the day that the Offer is commenced, in a manner that complies
with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, the Company shall, concurrently with
or promptly following the filing of the Schedule TO, file with the SEC and
disseminate to the Companys stockholders a Tender Offer
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the " **Schedule 14D-9** ") that,
subject to Section 5.2, shall contain the Company Board Recommendation. The
Schedule 14D-9 shall also contain the notice of appraisal rights required to
be delivered by the Company under Section 262(d) of the DGCL at the time the
Company first files the Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC. The Company shall set the
record date for the Companys stockholders to receive such notice of appraisal
rights as the same date as the Stockholder List Date and shall disseminate the
Schedule 14D-9 including such notice of appraisal rights to the Companys
stockholders to the extent required by Section 262(d) of the DGCL. Each of
Parent, HoldCo, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent
that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and the Company further agrees to use reasonable best efforts to
cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to promptly be filed with the SEC
and to promptly be disseminated to the Companys stockholders, in each case as
and to the extent required by applicable Law. Parent, HoldCo and Merger Sub
shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly furnish or otherwise make
available to the Company or its legal counsel any information concerning
Parent, HoldCo or Merger Sub that is required by the Exchange Act to be set
forth in the Schedule

 



      
 

 



 

14D-9 or reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in the Schedule
14D-9. Parent, HoldCo and their counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendment thereto prior to
the filing thereof with the SEC, and the Company shall give due consideration
to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent,
HoldCo, Merger Sub or their counsel. The Company shall provide Parent, HoldCo
and their counsel with a copy of any written comments, and a written summary
of any oral comments, the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such
comments. The Company shall give Parent and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any proposed written responses to any
comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, except if
the Company Board has properly made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



 

 **1.2.2** In connection with the Offer, from time to time as requested by or
on behalf of Parent, HoldCo or Merger Sub, the Company shall (or shall cause
its transfer agent to) promptly furnish Parent with a list of its
stockholders, non-objecting beneficial owners and any available listing or
computer file containing the names and addresses of record or beneficial
holders of shares of Company Common Stock and lists of securities positions of
shares of Company Common Stock held in stock depositories as of the most
recent practicable date, to the extent known by the Company, and shall provide
to Parent such additional information (including updated lists of stockholders

or the holder of any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

 



 

 **2.1.1** **Capital Stock of Merger Sub**

 



 

As of the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding share of capital stock
of Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted

(i) As of the Effective Time, (i) all shares of Company Common Stock that are
owned by the Company as treasury stock as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor and (ii) all shares
of Company Common Stock that were accepted for payment by Merger Sub in the
Offer shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor.

 



 

(ii) Any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or by a direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or the Company (other than those
cancelled under Section 2.1.2(i)) shall not be cancelled and shall convert
into a number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation in
connection with the Merger such that Parent and each such Subsidiary owns the
same percentage of the outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Effective Time as Parent and such Subsidiary owned
in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



      
 

 



 

 **2.1.3** **Conversion of Company Common Stock**

 



 

As of the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding share of Company Common
Stock (other than (i) Company Restricted Shares to be treated in accordance
with Section 2.3, (ii) Appraisal Shares to be treated in accordance with
Section 2.6, (iii) shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled in

in accordance with Section 2.1.2(ii)) shall be converted automatically into
and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Offer Price in
cash without interest (the " **Merger Consideration** "). As of the Effective
Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " **Certificate** ") or non-
certificated shares of Company Common Stock held in book entry form (each, a "
**Book Entry Share** ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate or Book Entry Share
in accordance with Section 2.2.2.

 



 

 **2.2** **Exchange of Certificates and Book Entry Shares**

 



 

 **2.2.1** **Paying Agent**

 



 

Prior to the Closing Date, HoldCo shall (and Parent shall cause HoldCo to)
designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act
as agent (the " **Paying Agent** ") for the payment of the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Section 2 and, in connection therewith,
prior to the Closing Date shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent
in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company. At or prior to the Closing,
HoldCo shall (and Parent shall cause HoldCo to) deposit or cause to be
deposited with the Paying Agent an amount in cash sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the
" **Exchange Fund** "). Pending its disbursement in accordance with this
Section 2.2, the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by HoldCo in (i) short-term direct obligations of the United States
of America, (ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith and credit of
the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of
principal and interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper rated the highest
quality by either Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Ratings Services or (iv) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements
or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion.
Subject to Section 2.2.5, HoldCo shall (and Parent shall cause HoldCo to)
cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly replace or restore the cash in the
Exchange Fund, to the extent necessary, so that the Exchange Fund is
maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make any remaining
payments of Merger Consideration in accordance herewith. No investment losses
resulting from investment of the funds deposited with the Paying Agent shall
diminish the rights of any of the Companys stockholders to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided herein.

 



      
 

 



 

 **2.2.2** **Payment Procedures**

 



 

Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event more than three Business
Days thereafter), Parent, HoldCo and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder
of record of Company Common Stock (other than the Company Common Stock to be
cancelled or converted in accordance with Section 2.1) (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in such form and shall
have such other customary provisions (including customary provisions regarding
delivery of an "agents message" with respect to Book Entry Shares) as Parent,
HoldCo and the Company may reasonably agree prior to the Closing Date) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or
Book Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration as
provided in Section 2.1.3. Upon surrender of a Certificate or a Book Entry
Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with such
letters instructions (and such other customary documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Certificate or Book Entry
Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by
such Certificate or Book Entry Share, and the Certificate or Book Entry Share
so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate or Book Entry Share is registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that (A) the Certificate or Book Entry Share so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and (B) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or Book Entry Share surrendered and shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid
or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2,
each Certificate and Book Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
as contemplated by this Section 2.

 



 

 **2.2.3** **Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock**

 



 

The Merger Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book Entry Shares in
accordance with the terms of this Section 2 shall be deemed to have been paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common
Stock previously represented by such Certificates or Book Entry Shares, and at
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer

 



       
 

 



 

books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and Book Entry Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable Law. Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.2.5, if, at any time
after the Effective Time, Certificates and Book Entry Shares are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Section 2.

 



 

 **2.2.4** **Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates**

 



 

If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the
posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as HoldCo may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to
be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
by such Certificate as contemplated by this Section 2.

 



 

 **2.2.5** **Termination of Exchange Fund**

 



 

At any time following the six (6) month anniversary of the Closing Date, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver
to it any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest received with
respect thereto) which has not been disbursed to holders of Certificates or
Book Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only
to Parent, HoldCo and the Surviving Corporation for, and Parent, HoldCo and
the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of their claims for
the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2\. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority
shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of
Parent or its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 



 

 **2.2.6** **No Liability**

 



 

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, none of the
parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable
to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable state, federal or other abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 



 

 **2.2.7** **Withholding Taxes**

 



 

Parent, HoldCo, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration such amounts as
are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law. To the

 



      
 

 



 

extent amounts are so withheld and (if required) paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

 **2.3** **Equity-Based Awards**

 



 

Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof administering the Company Stock Plan) shall adopt such
resolutions to provide that:

 



 

 **2.3.1** each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "
**Company Stock Option** "), whether vested or unvested, shall, as of the
Effective Time, be cancelled and the holder thereof shall then become entitled
to receive solely, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with
respect thereto, a lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock for which such Company Stock Option
has not been exercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per
share of such Company Stock Option (and for the avoidance of doubt, any
Company Stock Option that has an exercise price that is greater than or equal
to the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no
consideration or payment); and

 



 

 **2.3.2** each share of Company Common Stock subject to forfeiture conditions
(each, a " **Company Restricted Share** ") outstanding, including unvested
shares, immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger
Consideration.

 



 

 **2.4** **Payments with Respect to Equity-Based Awards**

 



 

Promptly after the Effective Time (but in any event, no later than the first
payroll date after the Effective Time), Parent shall cause HoldCo to fund or
cause to be funded and the Surviving Corporation shall pay through its payroll
systems (or through an alternative method) the amounts due pursuant to Section
2.3 (less applicable deductions and tax withholdings, which withheld amounts,
to the extent amounts are so withheld and (if required) paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Authority, shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made).

 



 

 **2.5** **Adjustments**

 



 

Without duplication of any adjustment made pursuant to Section 1.1.6, the
Merger Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately and proportionately to
reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into
Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Company
Common Stock occurring on or after the date of this Agreement and at or prior
to the Effective Time, and such adjustment to the Merger Consideration shall
provide to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action; provided,
however, that the Company may not effect such change except as expressly
permitted by this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

 **2.6** **Appraisal Rights**

 



 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company
Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
that are held by any Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands
appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,
Section 262 of the DGCL (" **Appraisal Shares** ") shall not be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1.3,
but instead shall be cancelled and shall represent the right to receive only
those rights provided under Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if any such Person shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive,
withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, then
the right of such Person to receive those rights under Section 262 of the DGCL
shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted
as of the Effective Time into, and shall represent only the right to receive,
the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1.3, without interest
thereon. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and HoldCo of any
demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Common
Stock, and Parent and HoldCo shall have the right to participate in, and after
the Offer Acceptance Time, direct all negotiations and Actions with respect to
such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent and HoldCo, make any payment with respect to,
or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing. Prior to the Effective Time, HoldCo shall (and Parent shall cause
HoldCo to) not, except with the prior written consent of the Company, require
the Company to make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or
offer to settle or settle any such demands.

respect to the disclosures that are amended) contained any untrue statement of
a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make

Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that

reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and
that all such information is communicated to the individuals responsible for
the preparation of the Companys filings with the SEC to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Since the Applicable Date, neither
the Company nor, to the Companys Knowledge, the Companys independent
registered public accounting firm, has

authority necessary to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and

jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the

engaged in any activities other than in connection with or as contemplated by
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.

 



 

 **4.2** **Authority; Noncontravention**

legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent, HoldCo and Merger Sub,
enforceable against each in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

 



 

 **4.2.2** Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent,
HoldCo and Merger Sub, nor the consummation by Parent, HoldCo and Merger Sub
of the Transactions, nor performance or compliance by Parent, HoldCo or Merger
Sub with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i) conflict with or
violate any provision of the articles of association or other comparable
charter or organizational documents of Parent, HoldCo or Merger Sub or (ii)
assuming that the authorizations, consents and approvals referred to in

any waiting periods with respect to such filings have terminated or expired
prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, (A) violate any Law or Judgment applicable
to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) result in a breach or violation,
constitute a default or require a consent (with or without notice or lapse of

is a party or accelerate Parents or any of its Subsidiaries, if applicable,
obligations under any such Contract, except, in the case of clause (ii), as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Act, including the filing with the SEC of the Offer Documents, (b) the filing

and Merger Sub of their obligations hereunder and the consummation by Parent,
HoldCo and Merger Sub of the Transactions, other than such other consents,

Effect.

Stock, on the other hand, that relate in any way to the Company or any of its
businesses or Subsidiaries (including those businesses and Subsidiaries

the Company would be entitled to receive value or consideration of a different
amount or nature than the Offer Price or the Merger Consideration or pursuant
to which any stockholder of the Company agrees to tender any shares of Company
Common Stock in the Offer or agrees to vote against or otherwise oppose any

Support Agreements. Parent, HoldCo and Merger Sub shall not amend, supplement

otherwise in respect of the Transactions that would be reasonably likely to
constitute a breach of a contracting partys fiduciary duties to the Company;
provided, however, that any such agreement or understanding shall provide that
such agreement or understanding will terminate if this Agreement terminates.

 



 

 **4.5** **Brokers and Other Advisors**

 



 

No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other Person is entitled to
any brokers, finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or

are defined under the Company Charter Documents). Neither Parent, HoldCo nor
Merger Sub "own" any shares of Company Common Stock (as such quoted term is
defined under the Company Charter Documents).

 



      
 

 



 

 **4.8** **Financing**

 



 

Parent has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of the fully
executed Facilities Agreement dated on or about the date of this Agreement
(together with all exhibits, or contemplated by annexes and schedules attached
thereto and as amended, modified, supplemented, replaced or extended from time
to time after the date of this Agreement in compliance with this Agreement).
As of the date of this Agreement, there are no side letters, understandings or
other agreements or contracts of any kind, in each case to which Parent,
HoldCo or Merger Sub is a party, relating to the Financing that could affect
the availability of the Financing contemplated by the Facilities Agreement,
other than as expressly set forth in or contemplated by the Facilities
Agreement provided to the Company. The Facilities Agreement, in the form so
delivered, is in full force and effect as of the date of this Agreement and is
a legal, valid and binding obligation of HoldCo, Steinhoff Finance, Steinhoff
Europe and Steinhoff Alpha and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties
thereto, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. The obligations to
make the Financing available to HoldCo, Steinhoff Finance and Steinhoff Alpha
pursuant to the terms of the Facilities Agreement are not subject to any
conditions other than the conditions expressly set forth in or contemplated by
the Facilities Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, (i) the Facilities
Agreement has not been supplemented, modified or amended, (ii) no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a Major Default under the Facilities Agreement and (iii) the
commitments contained in the Facilities Agreement have not been withdrawn,
terminated or rescinded. HoldCo (x) has no reason to believe that it will be
unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of closing to be
satisfied by it or its Affiliates contained in the Facilities Agreement and
(y) has no reason to believe that any portion of the Financing required to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby will not be made available to
HoldCo, Steinhoff Finance and Steinhoff Alpha on the Closing Date. Each of
HoldCo, Steinhoff Finance, Steinhoff Europe and Steinhoff Alpha has fully paid
any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Facilities Agreement
or the documents contemplated therein to be paid by it on or prior to the date
of this Agreement and shall in the future pay any such fees as they become due
(subject to any applicable grace periods (solely to the extent any such grace
period would not impact availability of the Financing on the Closing Date)).
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Facilities Agreement, assuming the
Financing is funded in accordance with the terms thereof, the aggregate
proceeds contemplated by the Facilities Agreement will be sufficient for
Parent, HoldCo and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions on the Closing
Date contemplated in this Agreement upon the terms contemplated by this
Agreement. Parent, HoldCo and Merger Sub acknowledge that their obligations
under this Agreement are not conditional upon or subject to its receipt of the
proceeds made available under the Facilities Agreement or any other Financing.

 



 

 **4.9** **Capitalization of Merger Sub**

common stock, par value $0.01 per share, 100 of which are validly issued and

and at the Effective Time will be, owned by HoldCo (free and clear of all
Liens). Merger Sub has not conducted any business prior to the date hereof
other than any business incident to its formation and

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and has no, and prior to the Effective Time
will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than

express or implied representation or warranty with respect to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or their respective business or operations, including

provided or made available to Parent, HoldCo, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Representatives or any oral, written, video, electronic or other
information developed by Parent, HoldCo, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Representatives. Parent, HoldCo and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge (each for
itself and on behalf of its Affiliates and Representatives) that it has
conducted, to its satisfaction, its own independent investigation of the
business, operations, assets and financial condition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and, in making its determination to proceed with the
Transactions, each of Parent, HoldCo, Merger Sub and their respective
Affiliates and Representatives have relied on the representations and
warranties expressly set forth in Section 3 and the Projections and on the
results of their own independent investigation.

 **5.2** **No Solicitation; Change in Recommendation**

 



 

 **5.2.1** Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.2, the Company
shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates and its Representatives to, (i)
immediately cease any solicitation, encouragement, discussions or negotiations
with any Persons that may be ongoing with respect to an Acquisition Proposal,
and on the second Business Day after the date of this Agreement, if not
already done prior to the date of this Agreement, instruct any Person who

Proposal to return or destroy all such information or documents in accordance

offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal, (B) other than informing Persons of the provisions
contained in this Section 5.2, engage in, continue or otherwise participate in
any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other Person any
non-public

 



       
 

 



 

information in connection with or for the purpose of encouraging or
facilitating, an Acquisition Proposal or (C) approve, recommend or enter into,
or propose to approve, recommend or enter into, any letter of intent or
similar document, agreement, commitment, or agreement in principle (whether
written or oral, binding or nonbinding) with respect to, or take any action to
support or in furtherance of, an Acquisition Proposal. Except to the extent
necessary to take any actions that the Company or any third party would
otherwise be permitted to take pursuant to this Section 5.2 (and in such case
only in accordance with the terms hereof), (i) the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not release any third party from, or waive, amend or modify
any provision of, or grant permission under, any confidentiality provision in
any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and
(ii) the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enforce the
confidentiality provisions of any such agreement, and the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, immediately take all steps necessary to
terminate any waiver that may have been heretofore granted, to any Person
other than Parent or any of Parents Affiliates, under any such provisions.
Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 5.2 applicable to the Company by any of
the Companys Affiliates or any of its other Representatives to the extent
acting on its behalf or at its instruction shall be deemed to be a breach of
this Section 5.2 by the Company.

 



 

 **5.2.2** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.2.1
or any other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time from and after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company
receives a _bona fide_ unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal from any
Person, under circumstances not involving any breach of this Section 5.2, if
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
financial advisors and based on the advice of outside legal counsel, that (x)
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead
to a Superior Proposal and (y) in light of such Acquisition Proposal, the
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to constitute a
violation of the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then
the Company may, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, (i)
furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information
(including non-public information) with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person who has made such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_
that the Company (1) shall not provide any non-public information concerning
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to such Person unless such non-public
information has been previously provided to, or is substantially
simultaneously provided to, Parent and (2) shall not provide to any such
Person any non-public information of or relating to Parent, HoldCo, Merger Sub
or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives except as required by
Law; and (ii) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such
Acquisition Proposal and such Persons Representatives. For purposes of this
Agreement, " **Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement** " means a customary
confidentiality agreement that contains provisions that are not materially
less favorable to the Company, taken as a whole, than those contained in the
Confidentiality

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement (other than standstill restrictions), _provided_ that such
confidentiality agreement shall not prohibit compliance by the Company with
any of the provisions of this Section 5.2.

 



 

 **5.2.3** The Company shall promptly (and in no event later than twenty-four
hours after receipt) notify Parent (which notice shall be provided orally and
in writing and shall identify the Person making the Acquisition Proposal and
set forth in reasonable detail the material terms thereof) after receipt of
any Acquisition Proposal, and shall promptly (and in no event later than
twenty-four hours after receipt) provide copies to Parent of any written
proposals or indications of interest with respect to any Acquisition Proposal,
and/or draft agreements relating to any Acquisition Proposal (including any
financing commitment papers submitted therewith). Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company shall keep Parent informed of any material developments
regarding any Acquisition Proposal (including by promptly (and in no event
later than twenty-four hours after receipt) providing to Parent copies of any
additional or revised written proposals or indications of interest with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal, and/or draft agreements relating to such
Acquisition Proposal) on a reasonably prompt basis (and in any event within
twenty-four hours) and upon the request of Parent shall apprise Parent of the
status of such Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it and its
Subsidiaries will not enter into any agreement with any Person subsequent to
the date of this Agreement that prohibits the Company from providing any
information to Parent in accordance with this Section 5.2.

 



 

 **5.2.4** Except as expressly permitted by Section 5.2.5, the Company Board
shall not (i) (A) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the
Schedule 14D-9 or any amendment thereof, (B) change, qualify, withhold,
withdraw or modify, or authorize or publicly propose to change, qualify,
withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board
Recommendation, (C) make any public statement in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal (other than a recommendation against such offer or a
customary "stop, look and listen" communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, in either case that includes a
reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation), (D) adopt, approve,
recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable or publicly propose to
adopt, approve, recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable to
stockholders of the Company an Acquisition Proposal, or (E) fail to publicly
recommend against an Acquisition Proposal and reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation within the earlier of three (3) Business Days prior to the then
scheduled Expiration Time or ten (10) Business Days of the public disclosure
of such Acquisition Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being
referred to as a " **Company Adverse Recommendation Change** "), or (ii)
authorize, cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter
into any letter of intent, agreement, commitment or agreement in principle
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with Section 5.2.2).

 



      
 

 



 

 **5.2.5** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company Board may make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change if (i) after receiving a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal that did not arise from a breach of this Section 5.2, the
Company Board has determined in good faith, (I) after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that in light of such Acquisition Proposal, the failure
to so make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be
expected to constitute a violation of the Company Boards fiduciary duties,
and (II) after consultation with outside financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or (ii) in
the absence of an Acquisition Proposal, due to events, facts or developments
not known by the Company, or in the Company Boards estimation, not reasonably
likely to occur (or the consequences of which were not known by the Company
or, in the Company Boards estimation, not reasonably likely to occur) as of
the date of this Agreement, the failure to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to constitute a violation
of the Company Boards fiduciary duties; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior
to making such Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (1) the Company has
given Parent at least four (4) days prior written notice of its intention to
take such action (which notice, in the case of clause (i), shall include a
copy of the Superior Proposal and a copy of the relevant proposed transaction
agreements and a copy of any financing commitments relating thereto), (2) to
the extent requested by Parent, the Company and its officers and directors
have negotiated, and the Company has used reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice
period to enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement
such that it would cause a Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a
Superior Proposal or would no longer reasonably be expected to constitute a
violation of the Company Boards fiduciary duties, as the case may be, (3)
following the end of such notice period, the Company Board shall have
considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed
by Parent, and shall have determined, in good faith, after consultation with
its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that a Superior
Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Superior Proposal or the
failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would nevertheless
continue to reasonably be expected to constitute a violation of the Company
Boards fiduciary duties, as the case may be, if the revisions proposed by
Parent were to be given effect, and (4) in the event of each and every change
to any of the terms of a Superior Proposal, the Company shall provide to
Parent notice of such change and, if such change is material (provided that
any change that, individually or in the aggregate with other elements of the
Acquisition Proposal, could cause the Company Board to determine a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change shall be deemed to be material), shall, in each
case, have delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that
described in clause (1) above of this proviso and a new notice period under
clause (1) of this proviso shall commence (except that the Company shall only
be required to provide Parent at least two (2) days prior written notice),
during which time the Company shall be required to comply with the
requirements of this Section 5.2.5 anew with respect to such additional
notice, including clauses (1) through (4) above of this proviso.

 



      
 

 



 

 **5.2.6** Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 or in Section 5.10 ( _Stock
Exchange De-listing_ ) shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any
"stop, look and listen" communication or any other similar disclosure to the
Companys stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act if, in
the Company Boards determination in good faith based on the advice of outside
counsel, the failure to so disclose would reasonably be expected to constitute
a violation of the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law or
its obligations under applicable federal securities Law, _provided_ that any
such position or disclosure (other than any stop, look and listen
communication that includes a reaffirmation of the Company Board
Recommendation) shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
unless the Company Board expressly and concurrently reaffirms the Company
Recommendation.

 



 

 **5.2.7** For purposes of this Agreement, " **Acquisition Proposal** " means
(i) any inquiry, proposal or offer for or with respect to (or expression of
interest by any Person that it is considering or may engage in) a merger,
joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation,
recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange, business combination or
similar transaction, (ii) any inquiry, proposal or offer (including tender or
exchange offers) to (or expression by any Person that is considering or may
seek to) acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, in one or more
transactions, 10% or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock or other
securities of the Company representing 10% or more of the total voting power
of the Company, or (iii) any inquiry, proposal or offer to (or expression by
any Person that it is considering or may seek to) acquire in any manner
(including the acquisition of stock in any Subsidiary of the Company),
directly or indirectly, in one or more transactions, assets or businesses of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, including pursuant to a joint venture or
partnership, representing 10% or more of the consolidated total assets
(including equity securities of its Subsidiaries), revenues or net income of
the Company, in each case, other than the Transactions.

 



 

 **5.2.8** For purposes of this Agreement, " **Superior Proposal** " means a
_bona fide_ unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that does not arise from
a breach of this Section 5.2 (i) that if consummated would result in a third
party (or in the case of a direct merger between such third party and the
Company, the stockholders of such third party) acquiring, directly or
indirectly, more than 55% of the outstanding Company Common Stock or more than
55% of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, for
consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, (ii) that the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and its outside financial advisors, is reasonably capable of being
completed, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other
aspects of such proposal, including all conditions contained therein and the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal, (iii) that the Company Board

 



      
 

 



 

determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and its outside financial advisors (taking into account any changes to this
Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such Acquisition Proposal, and all
financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal,
including all conditions contained therein, the form of consideration offered
and the Person making such proposal, and this Agreement), is more favorable to
the stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the Offer
and the Merger and (iv) the definitive documentation in respect of which does
not contain any due diligence or financing condition (other than any financing
condition relating to receipt of committed financing on a certain funds basis,
consistent with United States or United Kingdom custom).

 



 

 **5.3** **Efforts**

 



 

 **5.3.1** Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
parties hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts
(unless, with respect to any action, another standard of performance is
expressly provided for herein) to promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the other
parties hereto in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to cause
the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as reasonably

respect the consummation of the Transactions, in the case of each of clauses
(i) through (iv), other than with respect to filings, notices, petitions,
statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other
documents, approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and
other confirmations relating to Antitrust Laws, which are dealt with in
Sections 5.3.2 and 5.3.4 below. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, Parent, HoldCo and the Company shall have the right
to review in advance, and to the extent practicable Parent, HoldCo and the
Company will consult with the other party on and consider in good faith the
views of the other party in connection with, all of the information relating
to Parent, HoldCo or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written
material submitted to, any third party or Governmental Authority in connection
with the Transactions as required pursuant to this Section 5.3.1.

 



 

 **5.3.2** Each of the parties agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate

 



      
 

 



 

with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
(i) the obtaining of all other necessary actions or nonactions, waivers,
consents and approvals from Governmental Authorities and the making of all
other necessary registrations and filings (including other filings with
Governmental Authorities, if any), (ii) the obtaining of all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) the refinancing of
the Companys Indebtedness as contemplated by Section 5.12 hereof at the
Effective Time, and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional

be made the filings required of such party or any of its Subsidiaries under
the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (ii) cooperate with the other party in connection with any such filing,
and in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any
such agency or other Governmental Authority under the HSR Act, the Sherman
Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission
Act, as amended, and any other federal or state statutes, rules, regulations,
orders or decrees that are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions
having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade with
respect to any such filing or any such transaction. Each party shall promptly
inform the other party of any communication with, and any proposed
understanding, undertaking, or agreement with, any Governmental Authority
regarding any such filings or any such transaction. Neither party shall
participate in any meeting, with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
such filings, investigation, or other inquiry without giving the other party
notice of the meeting, if legally permissible, and, to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend and participate.

 



 

 **5.3.4** Each of Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best
efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the expiration of the
notice periods under the HSR Act or any state statutes, rules, regulations,
orders or decrees that are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions
having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as possible after
the execution of this Agreement.

 



 

 **5.3.5** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Sections 5.3.2, 5.3.3
or 5.3.4, (i) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
divest, or cause or permit the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to
divest, any of their respective businesses, product lines or assets, or to
accept any operational restriction, or take any other action that would
reasonably be expected to limit the right of Parent to own or operate any
portion of the businesses of Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries
or Affiliates, (ii) none of Parent, HoldCo or Merger Sub shall be required to
waive any of the Offer Conditions and (iii) Parent shall not, and shall cause
its Affiliates to not, prior to the expiration of the HSR waiting period with
respect to the Transactions, execute and deliver a definitive

 



      
 

 



 

agreement in respect of any transaction that would be reportable under the HSR
Act and that would reasonably be expected to materially increase the risk that
the Transactions fail to occur prior to the Outside Date.

 



 

 **5.4** **Public Announcements**

 



 

Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and give
each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or

relate specifically to the signing of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Subject to applicable Law, between the date of this Agreement and the earlier
of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1, upon reasonable notice, the Company shall, and shall cause its

unreasonably with the operation of any business conducted by the Company and
its Subsidiaries, to the Companys officers, employees, agents, properties,
books, Contracts and records and the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent
and Parents Representatives such information concerning its business,
personnel, assets, liabilities and properties as Parent may reasonably
request; _provided_ , however, that the Company shall not be obligated to
provide such access or information if the Company determines, in its
reasonable judgment (after consultation with its outside counsel), that doing
so is reasonably likely to (i) violate applicable Law or an applicable
Judgment, (ii) violate a Contract or binding obligation of confidentiality
owing to a third party, (iii) jeopardize the protection of an attorney-client
privilege, attorney work product protection or other legal privilege or (iv)
result in damage to property or if such access is for the purpose of
performing any onsite procedure or investigation (including any intrusive
onsite environmental investigation or study); _provided_ , _further_ ,
_however_ , that in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), the Company shall (A)
advise Parent of the nature of any information or documents withheld by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain any required consents to provide such information, and (C) otherwise
use its reasonable best efforts to institute appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements (such as the redaction of identifying or confidential
information,

 



      
 

 



 

entry into a joint defense agreement or other agreement or by providing such
access or information solely to outside counsel to avoid the loss of attorney-
client privilege). All requests for information made pursuant to this Section
5.5 shall be directed to the executive officer or other Person designated by
the Company. Until the Effective Time, all such information provided will be
subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. No investigation by
Parent or its Representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

 **5.6** **Indemnification and Insurance**

 



 

 **5.6.1** Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation by the Company and its Subsidiaries now existing in
favor of each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date
hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer or director of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a " **D andO Indemnified Party**")
under the DGCL or any other Applicable Law or as provided in the Company
Charter Documents or any such Subsidiarys organizational or governing
documents, as in effect on the date hereof, or pursuant to any other
agreements in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall remain in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms and will not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time (the
" **D andO Coverage Period**") (and, in the event that any relevant proceeding
is pending or asserted or any relevant claim made during such period, until
the final disposition of such proceeding or claim).

 



 

 **5.6.2** For the six (6)-year period commencing immediately after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the
Companys current directors and officers liability insurance covering acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the
Transactions) with respect to those individuals who are currently (and any
additional individuals who prior to the Effective Time become) covered by the
Companys directors and officers liability insurance policies on terms and
scope with respect to such coverage, and in amount, no less favorable to such
individuals than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement
(or Parent may substitute therefor policies, issued by reputable insurers, of
at least the same coverage with respect to matters existing or occurring prior
to the Effective Time, including a "tail" policy), so long as the Surviving
Corporation is not required to pay an annual premium in excess of 125% of the
last annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance before the date of
this Agreement (such 125% amount, the " **Maximum Premium** "). The Company
shall have the right prior to the Effective Time to purchase a six-year
prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions providing at least substantially
equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time, covering
without limitation the Transactions, so long as the effective annual premium
under such policy does not exceed the Maximum Premium. If such prepaid "tail
policy" has been obtained by the Company, it shall be deemed to satisfy all
obligations to obtain insurance pursuant to this Section 5.6.2 and the
Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such
policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and to
honor all of its obligations thereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

 **5.6.3** The provisions of this Section 5.6 are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified Party, his or
her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such individual may have under the Company Charter Documents, by contract or
otherwise. The obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.6
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
the rights of any DandO Indemnified Party to whom this Section 5.6 applies
unless (x) such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or
(y) the affected DandO Indemnified Party shall have consented in writing to such
termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the DandO
Indemnified Party to whom this Section 5.6 applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 5.6).

 



 

 **5.6.4** Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or
shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective
directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.6 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 



 

 **5.6.5** This Section 5.6 shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
Merger Sub, the Company and the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

 **5.7** **Rule 16b-3**

 



 

Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such steps as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable to cause dispositions of Company equity
securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the Transactions by
each individual who is a director or officer of the Company subject to Section
16 of the Exchange Act (and by each entity reporting as a director by
deputization under Section 16 of the Exchange Act) to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

 **5.8** **Employee Matters**

 



 

 **5.8.1** Subject to any applicable Collective Bargaining Agreements, until
December 31, 2017, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
provide (i) base salary or hourly wage rate and target bonus opportunity
amount to each person who is an employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " **Continuing
Employee** ") while remaining employed that are no less favorable, in each
case, than those in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii)
severance benefits to each Continuing Employee that are no less favorable than
those that would have been provided to such Continuing Employee under the
applicable severance benefit plans, programs, policies, agreements and
arrangements as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and set
forth in Schedule 5.8.1 of the Company Disclosure Letter and (iii) employee
benefits (excluding severance) that are no less favorable in the

 



      
 

 



 

aggregate to those provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to
the Effective Time (except that this subsection (iii) shall not preclude
changes to employee benefits (excluding severance) that are reasonable and
made in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices for the
new year commencing January 1, 2017), provided that nothing herein shall
preclude the Parent, HoldCo and Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation from
changing terms and conditions of employment (other than with respect to
compensation and benefits, or as may be required by Law or Collective
Bargaining Agreements) or terminating the employment of any employee at any
time after the Closing.

 



 

 **5.8.2** Without limiting the generality of Section 5.8.1, from and after
the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
honor in accordance with their terms all the Company Plans. Parent hereby
acknowledges that the consummation of the Transactions constitutes a "change
in control" or "change of control" (or a term of similar import) for purposes
of any Company Plan that contains a definition of "change in control or
"change of control" (or a term of similar import), as applicable. With respect
to all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, whether or
not subject to ERISA) (including any vacation, paid time-off and severance
plans) of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries in which Continuing
Employees are eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time, for
all purposes, including determining eligibility to participate, vesting, and,
with respect to any vacation, paid time-off or severance plans, rate of
benefit accruals, each Continuing Employees service with the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (as well as service with any predecessor employer of the
Company or any such Subsidiary, to the extent service with the predecessor
employer was recognized by the Company or such Subsidiary) shall be treated as
credited service under such plans; provided, however, that such service need
not be recognized (i) to the extent that such recognition would result in any
duplication of benefits for the same period of service, (ii) for purposes of
any plan or arrangement that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect
to the level of benefits or participation or (iii) to the extent that such
service was not recognized for a similar type of benefit by the Company. The
Continuing Employees of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will
receive comparable credit if they participate in any Parent employee benefit
plan.

 



 

 **5.8.3** Without limiting the generality of Section 5.8.1, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, waive, or cause to be waived, any
pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements
and waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees (and
their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the
Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, recognize the dollar amount of all co-payments,
deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Continuing Employee (and his
or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in which

 



       
 

 



 

the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such years deductible
and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which
they will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.

 



 

 **5.8.4** The provisions of this Section 5.8 are solely for the benefit of
the parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 5.8 is
intended to, or shall, (i) constitute the establishment or adoption of or an
amendment to any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise or
(ii) prevent the modification, termination or amendment of any benefit plan,
program, arrangement or agreement in the sole discretion of the Parent and the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries. No current or former employee or
any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as
a third party beneficiary of this Agreement or have the right to enforce the
provisions hereof or confer upon such individual the right to continue
employment with the Parent, or the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
following the Effective Time, or interfere with any right or ability of the
Parent or the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to terminate the
employment of any employee for any reason or no reason following the Effective
Time.

 



 

 **5.9** **Notification of Certain Matters; Stockholder Litigation**

 



 

Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company,
and the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, of (a) any notice or other
communication received by such party from any Governmental Authority in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions or from any Person alleging
that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of
such party to obtain such consent would reasonably be expected to be material
to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (b) any Actions commenced
or, to such partys Knowledge, threatened against such party which relates to
this Agreement or the Transactions and (c) any fact, event or circumstance
that (i) has had or would reasonably be expected to result in any Material
Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable, or (ii) is
reasonably likely to result in the failure of any of the Offer Conditions or
any of conditions set forth in Section 6 to be satisfied; provided, however,
that no such notification (or failure to provide such notification) shall
affect any of the representations, warranties, covenants, rights or remedies,
or the conditions to the obligations of, the parties hereunder. The Company
shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense and settlement
of any litigation against the Company or its directors relating to this
Agreement or the Transactions, and no such settlement shall be agreed to
without Parents prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 



 

 **5.10** **Stock Exchange De-listing**

 



 

Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Common Stock to be de-
listed from NASDAQ and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time.

 



      
 

 



 

 **5.11** **Rule 14d-10 Matters**

 



 

Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Compensation Committee of the Company
Board (the " **Compensation Committee** ") will cause each employment
compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement that is entered
into by the Company or a Subsidiary after the date of this Agreement pursuant
to which consideration is payable to any officer, director or employee who is
a holder of any security of the Company to be approved by the Compensation
Committee (comprised solely of "independent directors") in accordance with the
requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions
thereto as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit
arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act
and satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in
Rule 14d-10(d) of the Exchange Act.

 



 

 **5.12** **Financing**

 



 

 **5.12.1** Parent, HoldCo and Merger Sub shall use their, and shall cause
their Affiliates (and each of their respective officers, managers, employees,
agents and other similar representatives) to use their, reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the proceeds of the
Financing as promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms and conditions
contained in the Facilities Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts
to (i) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent, HoldCo,
Merger Sub or Company (or their Affiliates) in the Facilities Agreement, (ii)
comply with its and their obligations under the Facilities Agreement to
consummate the Financing no later than the Closing and (iii) enforce its and
their rights under the Facilities Agreement. In the event that all conditions
to the Facilities Agreement have been satisfied, Parent, HoldCo and Merger Sub
shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Financing Sources
providing such Financing to fund the Financing required to consummate the
Transactions upon the terms set forth herein on the Closing Date (including by
taking enforcement action to cause such lenders and other persons providing
such Financing to fund such Financing).

 



 

 **5.12.2** None of Parent, HoldCo or Merger Sub shall, without the prior
consent of the Company, amend, replace, supplement or modify or waive any
provision or remedy under, the Facilities Agreement or any other definitive
agreements relating to the Financing without first obtaining Companys prior
written consent to the extent such amendment, replacement, supplement or
modification would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of cash proceeds available
under the Financing to fund the amounts required to be paid by Parent, HoldCo
or Merger Sub under this Agreement below the amount required to consummate the
Transactions, (ii) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand,
amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing in a
manner that would prevent, delay, impair or make less likely the availability
of the Financing on the Closing Date or (iii) amend or modify any other term
in a manner that would prevent, delay, or impair the ability of Parent,
HoldCo, or Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions or would adversely impact
the availability of the Financing on the

 



      
 

 



 

Closing Date in any respect or that is otherwise adverse to the Company or
adversely impact the ability of Parent or HoldCo to enforce its rights against
the other parties to the Facilities Agreement.

 



 

 **5.12.3** Parent, HoldCo and Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt
written notice of any material breach or default by any party to the
Facilities Agreement, in each case, of which Parent becomes aware and shall
keep Company reasonably apprised of all other material developments relating
to the Financing. Upon the request of the Company, Parent, HoldCo and Merger
Sub shall otherwise promptly keep the Company reasonably informed of the
status of Parents, HoldCos and Merger Subs efforts to satisfy the
conditions to obtaining the Financing on the Closing Date and to arrange the
Financing (including as to any assignments of commitments made by the
Financing Sources on or prior to the Closing).

 



 

 **5.12.4** In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions contemplated in the Facilities Agreement, Parent,
HoldCo and Merger Sub shall promptly, and in any event within two Business
Days, notify Seller and shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to
obtain alternative financing from alternative sources on terms that will still
enable Parent, HoldCo and Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement upon the terms set forth herein as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event, but no later than the
Outside Date; provided that, subject to the last sentence of this Section
5.12.4, none of Parent, HoldCo or Merger Sub shall be required to pay any fees
or any interest rates applicable to the Alternative Financing materially in
excess of those contemplated by the Facilities Agreement (whether to secure
waiver of any conditions contained therein or otherwise). Parent shall deliver
to Company true and complete copies of all agreements (including any fee
letter) pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have committed to
provide the Alternative Financing in respect of all or any portion of the
Financing. In the event any Alternative Financing source is obtained, (i) any
reference in this Agreement to the "Financing" shall include the Alternative
Financing, (ii) any reference in this Agreement to the "Facilities Agreement"
shall be deemed to include any commitment letter in respect of the Alternative
Financing and (iii) any reference in this Agreement to "fee letter" shall be
deemed to include any fee letter relating to the Alternative Financing.
Parent, HoldCo and Merger Sub shall refrain (and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause their Affiliates, and its and their officers, managers,
employees, agents and other similar representatives to refrain) from taking,
directly or indirectly, any action that would reasonably be expected to result
in a failure to satisfy any of the conditions contained in the Facilities
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, failure to obtain all or any portion of
the Financing (or any alternative financing) shall not relieve or alter the
obligations of Parent, HoldCo and Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions.

 



 

 **5.12.5** Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
officers, managers, employees, consultants, counsel, accountants, agents,
advisors and other similar representatives (the " **Company s
Representatives**") to use their reasonable best

 



      
 

 



 

efforts to provide such cooperation that is reasonable and customary in
connection with the Financing (or Alternative Financing) as may be reasonably
requested by Parent, HoldCo or Merger Sub (provided that such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries), which shall include, in any event, to the
extent reasonably necessary to satisfy conditions precedent or covenants in
the Facilities Agreement using reasonable best efforts to: (i) reasonably
assist Parent, HoldCo and Merger Sub in their preparation of customary
materials for rating agency presentations required under the Facilities
Agreement to obtain the Financing, (ii) furnish Parent and the Financing
Sources with such documentation and other information about the Company or its
Subsidiaries in the Companys or its Subsidiaries possession, custody or
control which Parent has reasonably requested in writing at least ten (10)
Business Days in advance of the Closing that is required by regulatory
authorities in connection with applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations (including the U.S.A. Patriot Act of 2001) in
connection with the Financing (or Alternative Financing), (iii) obtain from
the Companys existing lenders customary payoff documents as reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with the Financing and collateral
arrangements thereunder, including customary payoff letters, lien releases,
instruments of termination or discharges and (iv) permitting officers of the
Company or its Subsidiaries who will be officers after the Closing Date to
execute and deliver any definitive financing documents or other certificates
or documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent, HoldCo or Merger Sub to
obtain the Financing.

 



 

 **5.12.6** Nothing contained in Section 5.12.5 shall require any of the
Company or its Subsidiaries to (i) pay any commitment or similar fee or incur
any liability in connection with the Financing prior to the Closing Date, (ii)
be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the Financing prior to the
Closing Date, (iii) deliver or obtain opinions of internal or external
counsel, (iv) provide access to or disclose information where the Company
determines that such access or disclosure could jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege or contravene any law or regulation to which they are subject or any
contract or agreement to which it or any of the Company or its Subsidiaries is
a party, (v) deliver any audited financial statements, to the extent not
already available to the Company or its Subsidiaries or (vi) waive or amend
any terms of this Agreement or any other contract or agreement to which any of
the Company or its Subsidiaries is party. Furthermore, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, (1) the cooperation under Section
5.12.5 shall not unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, (2) no such cooperation shall be required to the extent it would
(y) cause any condition to the Closing to not be satisfied or (z) cause any
breach or default under this Agreement and (3) the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective directors, managers, officers or employees
shall not be required to execute, deliver or enter into, or perform any
contract, agreement, document or instrument with respect to the Financing
(other than the authorization letters contemplated in Section 5.12.5),
including any definitive agreement with respect to the Financing, that is not
contingent upon the Closing

 



      
 

 



 

or that would be effective prior to the Closing, and the directors and
managers of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to adopt
resolutions approving the agreements, documents and instruments pursuant to
which the Financing is obtained, in each case, which are effective prior to
the Closing. All material, non-public information regarding the Company, its
Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates pursuant to Section 5.12.5 shall
be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except
for disclosure to potential lenders and investors as required in connection
with the Financing subject to the recipients acceptance of, and agreement to,
customary confidentiality terms reasonably acceptable to the Company. If this
Agreement is terminated for any reason, Parent shall promptly, upon the
request of the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees) incurred by the Company in connection with the cooperation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries contemplated by Section 5.12.5. In the event that
the Closing does not occur, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates from and against any
and all liability, obligation, loss, claim or damage suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing (including any action
taken in accordance with Section 5.12.5) and any information utilized in
connection therewith, except to the extent any of the forgoing arise from the
bad faith, gross negligence or willful and intentional misconduct of, or
material breach of this Agreement by the Company. The obligations of Parent in
the immediately preceding two sentences shall survive the Closing or
termination of this Agreement.

 



 

 **5.12.7** The Company consents to the limited use of its name(s) and
associated logos solely in connection with written marketing materials to be
used in arranging the Financing or Alternative Financing; provided, that, in
no event shall such names and logos be used in a manner that is intended to or
reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their other respective Intellectual Property rights.

perjury, certifying that interests in the Company are not "United States real

delivered pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement that by its terms

 **8.2** **Amendment or Supplement**

 



 

Subject to compliance with applicable Law, at any time prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all
respects by written agreement of the parties hereto. This Agreement may not be

that the Financing Sources are intended to be third-party beneficiaries of,

provisions of this Agreement shall not be amended without the consent of the
Financing Sources.

 



       
 

 



 

 **8.3** **Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc.**

 



 

At any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent and the Company may,
subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto, (b) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or acts of the other party or (c) waive compliance by the
other party with any of the agreements contained herein applicable to such
party or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive any of such partys
conditions (it being understood that Parent, HoldCo and Merger Sub shall be
deemed a single party for purposes of the foregoing). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent, HoldCo or Merger Sub in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

 



 

 **8.4** **Assignment**

 



 

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or
otherwise, by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of
the other parties hereto; _provided_ ; _however_ ; Parent and HoldCo may
assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of their rights, interests and
obligations under this Agreement to any entity that is wholly-owned directly
by Parent without the consent of the Company. No assignment by any party shall
relieve such party of any of its obligations hereunder. Neither Parent nor
HoldCo shall assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement to any
Affiliates located in jurisdictions outside of the United States if any such
assignment would increase the amount of withholding Taxes payable in
connection with the Transactions. Subject to the immediately preceding three
sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this Section
8.4 shall be null and void.

 



 

 **8.5** **Counterparts**

 



 

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts (including by
facsimile or electronic mail), each of which shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement,
and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties hereto.

 



 

 **8.6** **Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries**

 



 

This Agreement, together with the Company Disclosure Letter, (collectively,
the " **Related Documents** "), constitutes the entire agreement, and
supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, among the parties and their Affiliates, or any of them, with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof, including the Confidentiality
Agreement. If any term, condition or other provision of this Agreement is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other
terms, provisions and

 



      
 

 



 

conditions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect. Except as expressly provided for in Section 8.2 with respect to the
Financing Sources, this Agreement is not intended to and does not confer upon
any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder,
except for (each in accordance with the terms of this Agreement): (i) if the
Offer Acceptance Time occurs, the right of the Companys stockholders that
validly tendered their shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer to receive
the Offer Price in respect of such shares; (ii) if the Effective Time occurs,
the right of the Companys stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration;
(iii) if the Effective Time occurs, the right of the holders of Company Stock
Options and Company Restricted Shares to receive such amounts as provided for
in Section 2.3; (iv) if the Effective Time occurs, the rights of the DandO
Indemnified Parties set forth in Section 5.6 of this Agreement; and (v) the
rights of the Companys Subsidiaries and the respective Representatives of the
Company and its Subsidiaries set forth in Section 5.6, which are intended for
the benefit of the Persons and shall be enforceable by the Persons referred to
in clauses (i) through (v) above.

 



 

 **8.7** **Governing Law; Jurisdiction**

 



 

 **8.7.1** This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts executed in
and to be performed entirely within that State, regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under any applicable conflict of Laws principles.

 



 

 **8.7.2** All Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be
heard and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction
over any Action, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) and
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and
venue of such courts in any such Action and irrevocably waive the defense of
an inconvenient forum or lack of jurisdiction to the maintenance of any such
Action. The consents to jurisdiction and venue set forth in this Section 8.7.2
shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of
Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this
paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than
the parties hereto. Each party hereto agrees that service of process upon such
party in any such Action arising out or relating to this Agreement shall be
effective if notice is given by overnight courier at the address set forth in
Section 8.10 of this Agreement or in such other manner as may be permitted by
applicable Law. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such
Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law; provided,
however, that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any partys rights to
seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, a final trial
court judgment.

 



 

 **8.8** **Remedies**

 



 

 **8.8.1** The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary
relief (including any fees payable pursuant to Section 7.3), even if
available, would not

 



      
 

 



 

be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is
otherwise breached, including if the parties hereto fail to take any action
required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement. Subject to the
following sentence, the parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or
other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof (including any obligation to
extend the Offer and, to the extent ordered by any of the courts described in
Section 8.7.2, to recommence the Offer) in the courts described in Section
8.7.2 without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, (b) the
provisions set forth in Section 7.3 (i) are not intended to and do not
adequately compensate for the harm that would result from a breach of this
Agreement and (ii) shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in
any respect any partys right to specific enforcement and (c) the right of
specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and without that
right none of the Company, Parent or HoldCo would have entered into this
Agreement. The parties hereto agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any
reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy or that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law,
other than an assertion that the exercise of specific performance was not
effected in accordance with provisions of this Section 8.8. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 8.8 shall not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction.

 



 

 **8.8.2** If a court of competent jurisdiction has declined to specifically
enforce the obligations of Parent, HoldCo and Merger Sub pursuant to a claim
for specific performance brought against Parent, HoldCo and Merger Sub, and
has instead granted an award of damages for such alleged breach, the Company
may enforce such award and accept damages for such alleged breach on behalf of
its stockholders and employee equity award holders (which Parent, HoldCo and
Merger Sub agree may include damages based upon a decrease in share value or
lost premium as if the Companys stockholders and employee equity award
holders were third party beneficiaries to this Agreement). Notwithstanding any
other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, except to the extent
provided for in Section 8.6, under no circumstances is it intended that, nor
shall, any Person other than the Company have any right under this Agreement
to pursue any claim or action against Parent, HoldCo or Merger Sub.

 



 

 **8.9** **WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL**

 



 

EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY

 



      
 

 



 

APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A)
NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
