In consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1. DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION



1.1. Share Purchase. At the Closing, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, in consideration for the payments set
forth in Section 1.2, Sellers shall sell, assign, transfer and deliver to
Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase from Sellers, all of the Outstanding
Company Shares, free and clear from all Liens, and thereafter Sellers shall
not retain any rights of whatsoever nature attaching or accruing to such
Company Shares (such sale, assignment, transfer, delivery and purchase, the
"Share Purchase").



1.2. Purchase Price.



(a) Consideration for Company Shares. Subject to Sections 1.2(b), 1.5, 9 and
10.14(e): (i) the aggregate consideration payable by or on behalf of Purchaser
to Sellers in respect of all Outstanding Company Shares shall be the Aggregate
Share Consideration Amount set forth on the Closing Consideration Spreadsheet;
and (ii) the portion of the Aggregate Share Consideration Amount payable to
each Seller in respect of all of the Outstanding Company Shares held by such
Seller shall be the amount set forth opposite such Seller's name in the
Closing Consideration Spreadsheet (such Seller's "Per Holder Aggregate Share
Consideration Amount").



(b) Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in Section 1.2(a), Section 1.3(b) and Section 1.3(c) or elsewhere in
this Agreement, Purchaser shall withhold from the Per Holder Aggregate Share
Consideration Amount otherwise payable to each Seller pursuant to Section
1.2(a), from the consideration otherwise payable to each Holdings Equityholder
pursuant to the terms of the applicable Holdings Equity Agreement, and from
the consideration otherwise payable to each LTIP Participant pursuant to the
terms of the LTIP, an amount equal to such





























-2- 

Consideration Recipient's Pro Rata Portion of the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Amount for contribution to the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund.
The Escrow Agent shall hold the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund as
security for any amount payable to Purchaser pursuant to Section 1.5(d) or
Section 9.3(a)(ii), in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement and in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Agreement.



1.3. Treatment of Equity Awards.



(a) Unvested Options. Purchaser shall not assume any Unvested Options, or
substitute any Unvested Options with an equivalent option or right, in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. At the Closing, each
Unvested Option (whether held directly or through a trustee for the benefit of
the holder) shall by virtue of the transactions contemplated hereby and
without any action on the part of Purchaser, the Company, Holdings, Sellers or
any holder of Options, be cancelled and extinguished. In exchange for the
cancellation and extinguishment of an Unvested Option pursuant to this Section
1.3(a), subject to the holder thereof first executing and delivering an Option
Surrender and Waiver Agreement to Purchaser, Purchaser shall, or shall cause
Holdings to, pay through the payroll service of Holdings or one of its
Affiliates to each person who at the Closing was holding an Unvested Option,
with respect to the Holdings Shares issuable upon exercise of such Unvested

to the contingencies specified herein, an amount in cash (such holder's
"Unvested Option Cash") equal to: (i) the amount, if any, set forth for such
Unvested Option in the Closing Consideration Spreadsheet, plus (ii) the
amount, if any, set forth for such Unvested Option in the Post-Closing
Consideration Spreadsheet, in the case of each of clauses "(i)" and "(ii)"
above, less any deductions and withholdings for Taxes required by applicable
Legal Requirements. For the avoidance of doubt, no portion of any holder's
Unvested Option Cash shall be contributed to the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Fund. A holder's Unvested Option Cash shall be retained by Purchaser at
the Closing, shall be subject to permanent retention by Purchaser (i.e.,
forfeiture by the holder of such Unvested Option) and shall be released by
Purchaser from any right of retention or forfeiture of Purchaser on the
vesting schedule set forth in the Option Surrender and Waiver Agreement
executed and delivered by such holder, in each case subject to such holder
remaining continuously employed by Purchaser or one of its Subsidiaries
through the applicable vesting date. Purchaser shall cause all Unvested Option
Cash that is released by Purchaser from any right of retention or forfeiture
of Purchaser during any given calendar quarter to be paid within two payroll
periods following the end of such calendar quarter (and in no event later than
March 15 of the calendar year following the year in which such vesting
occurred).



(b) Vested Options.



(i) Purchaser shall not assume any Vested Options, or substitute any Vested
Options with an equivalent option or right, in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. At the Closing, each Vested Option (whether
held directly or through a trustee for the benefit of the holder) shall by
virtue of the transactions contemplated hereby and without any action on the
part of Purchaser, the Company, Holdings, Sellers or any holder of Options, be
cancelled and extinguished. In exchange for the cancellation and
extinguishment of a Vested Option pursuant to this Section 1.3(b), subject to
the holder thereof first executing and delivering an Option Surrender
Agreement to Purchaser, subject to Sections 1.2(b), 9 and 10.14(e), Purchaser
shall, or shall cause Holdings to, pay through the payroll service of Holdings
or one of its Affiliates to each person who at the Closing was holding a
Vested Option, with respect to the Holdings Shares issuable upon exercise of
such Vested Option immediately prior to the Closing, an amount in cash equal
to: (A) the amount, if any, set forth for such Vested Option in the Closing
Consideration Spreadsheet, plus (B) the amount, if any, set forth for such
Vested Option in the Post-Closing Consideration Spreadsheet, plus (C) the
amount, if any, set forth for such































-3- 

Vested Option in any Escrow Release Spreadsheet(s) (such amount with respect
to each Vested Option, the "Option Purchase Consideration"), in the case of
each of clauses "(A)," "(B)" and (C) above, less any deductions and
withholdings for Taxes required by applicable Legal Requirements.



(ii) As promptly as practicable following the Closing, subject to Sections 1.5
and 9, Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid: (A) through the payroll
service of Holdings or one of its Affiliates, the applicable Option Purchase
Consideration to holders of Vested Options (other than any Vested Options with
respect to which the Company has no Tax withholding obligations (such Vested
Options, "No-Withholding Options")); and (B) to holders of No-Withholding
Options who have delivered a Form W-9 or Form W-8, as applicable, at the
Closing, the applicable Option Purchase Consideration payable to holders of
No-Withholding Options.



(c) RSUs.



(i) Purchaser shall not assume any RSUs, or substitute any RSUs with an
equivalent restricted stock unit or right, in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby. At the Closing, each RSU (whether held directly or
through a trustee for the benefit of the holder) shall by virtue of the
transactions contemplated hereby and without any action on the part of
Purchaser, the Company, Holdings, Sellers or any holder of RSUs, be cancelled
and extinguished. In exchange for the cancellation and extinguishment of an
RSU pursuant to this Section 1.3(c), subject to the holder thereof first
executing and delivering an RSU Surrender Agreement to Purchaser, subject to
Sections 1.2(b), 9 and 10.14(e), Purchaser shall, or shall cause Holdings to,
pay through the payroll service of Holdings or one of its Affiliates to each
person who at the Closing was holding an RSU, with respect to the Holdings
Shares issuable upon settlement of such RSU immediately prior to the Closing,
an amount in cash equal to: (A) the amount, if any, set forth for such RSU in
the Closing Consideration Spreadsheet, plus (B) the amount, if any, set forth
for such RSU in the Post-Closing Consideration Spreadsheet, plus (C) the
amount, if any, set forth for such Vested Option in any Escrow Release
Spreadsheet(s) (such amount with respect to each RSU, the "RSU Purchase
Consideration"), in the case of each of clauses "(A)," "(B)" and "(C)" above,
less any deductions and withholdings for Taxes required by applicable Legal
Requirements.



(ii) As promptly as practicable following the Closing, subject to Sections 1.5
and 9, Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid: (A) through the payroll
service of Holdings or one of its Affiliates, the applicable RSU Purchase
Consideration to holders of RSUs (other than any RSUs with respect to which
the Company has no Tax withholding obligations (such RSUs, "No-Withholding
RSUs")); and (B) to holders of No-Withholding RSUs who have delivered a Form
W-9 or Form W-8, as applicable, at the Closing, the applicable RSU Purchase
Consideration payable to holders of No-Withholding RSUs.



(d) Surrender Agreements. Each individual who is a holder of an Option that is
outstanding and unexercised as of the date hereof has executed and delivered
an Option Surrender Agreement (or, in the case of holders of Unvested Options,
an Option Surrender and Waiver Agreement) each to become effective as of, and
contingent upon, the Closing, effectuating the provisions of this Section 1.3.

Price Component"): (i) the Closing Cash Amount; (ii) the Closing Indebtedness
Amount; (iii) the Unpaid Transaction Expense Amount; (iv) the Working Capital
Amount; (v) the Working Capital Shortfall Amount; (vi) the Working Capital
Surplus Amount; (vii) the Change in Control Payment Amount; (viii) the
Aggregate Holdings Equity Purchase Amount; and (ix) the Aggregate Share
Consideration Amount, which, in the case of each of clauses "(i)" through
"(ix)" above, shall be determined in accordance with the definitions thereof
(and the associated defined terms).



(b) Purchaser-Calculated Purchase Price. No later than 60 days following the
Closing, Purchaser shall deliver to the Sellers' Representative a statement
setting forth Purchaser's good faith determination of: (i) the actual Closing
Cash Amount; (ii) the actual Closing Indebtedness Amount; (iii) the actual
Unpaid Transaction Expense Amount; (iv) the Working Capital Amount; (v) the
Working Capital Shortfall Amount; (vi) the Working Capital Surplus Amount;
(vii) the actual Change in Control Payment Amount; (viii) the actual Aggregate

During such 30-day period, Purchaser shall provide the Sellers' Representative
and its Representatives with such access to the financial books and records of
the Acquired Companies, as well as any relevant work papers as it may
reasonably request, to reasonably enable it to evaluate the calculation of the
Purchaser-Calculated Purchase Price Components. If the Sellers' Representative
accepts Purchaser's determination of a Purchaser-Calculated Purchase Price
Component pursuant to Section 1.5(b), or if the Sellers' Representative fails
within such 30-day period to notify Purchaser of a dispute with respect to any
particular Purchaser-Calculated Purchase Price Component, then such Purchaser-
Calculated Purchase Price Component determined by Purchaser pursuant to
Section 1.5(b) shall be the applicable "Final Purchase Price Component" and
shall be final and binding on the parties.



































-6- 

(ii) If the Sellers' Representative disputes Purchaser's determination of the
Purchaser-Calculated Purchase Price Components pursuant to Section 1.5(b), the
Sellers' Representative shall provide written notice to Purchaser no later
than 30 days following the delivery by Purchaser to the Sellers'
Representative of the Purchaser-Calculated Purchase Price Components (the
"Dispute Notice"), setting forth in reasonable detail those items of the
Purchaser-Calculated Purchase Price Components that the Sellers'
Representative disputes (the "Disputed Items"), a brief description of the
reasons for such dispute and the Sellers' Representative's calculation of the
Disputed Items. All items in the Purchaser-Calculated Purchase Price
Components other than the Disputed Items ("Non-Disputed Items") shall be the
applicable "Final Purchase Price Components" and shall be final and binding
upon the parties. During the 10-day period following delivery of a Dispute
Notice, Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall negotiate in good
faith with a view to resolving their disagreements over the Disputed Items. If
the Sellers' Representative and Purchaser resolve their differences over any
of the Disputed Items in accordance with the foregoing procedure (a "Resolved
Disputed Item"), the "Final Purchase Price Component" in respect of such
Resolved Disputed Item shall be the amount agreed upon by them in writing and
shall be final and binding on the parties. If they fail to resolve their
differences over any of the Disputed Items within such 10-day period, then
promptly after the end of such period, either of them may request that a "big
four" accounting firm as Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative may
mutually agree (the "Expert") make a binding determination as to such Disputed
Items in accordance with this Agreement (the "Unresolved Disputed Items").
Only Unresolved Disputed Items are subject to resolution by the Expert.



(iii) The Expert will have no more than 30 days from the date of referral and
no more than 10 Business Days from the final submission of written submissions
by Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative within which to render its
written decision with respect to the Unresolved Disputed Items (and only with
respect to any Unresolved Disputed Items set forth in the Dispute Notice) and
the final determination of the Purchase Price shall be based on the Non-
Disputed Items, the Resolved Disputed Items and the resolution of such
Unresolved Disputed Items by the Expert. The Expert shall review such
submissions and base its determination solely on such submissions. In
resolving any Unresolved Disputed Item, the Expert may not assign a value to
any item greater than the maximum value for such item claimed by either party
or less than the minimum value for such item claimed by either party. The
final determination of the Expert of an Unresolved Disputed Item shall be the
"Final Purchase Price Component" in respect of such Unresolved Disputed Item,
shall be final and binding upon the parties (absent fraud or manifest error),
and shall be enforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction.



(iv) Each of Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers' Representative, on
the other hand, shall bear its own fees and expenses in connection with the
determination of the Final Purchase Price Components, provided that in the
event that an Expert is engaged to determine any Unresolved Disputed Items,
the fees and expenses of the Expert shall be allocated to and paid by
Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers' Representative, on the other
hand, based upon the percentage that the portion of the aggregate amount of
the Unresolved Disputed Items not awarded to each party bears to the total
amount of the Unresolved Disputed Items not awarded to either party, as
determined by the Expert, which determination shall be final and binding upon
the parties.



(d) Payment of Purchase Price Adjustment; Release of Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Fund.



(i) Following the determination of the Final Purchase Price Components in
accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 1.5(c), and the
calculation of the final































-7- 

Purchase Price based on such Final Purchase Price Components (in lieu of the
Estimated Purchase Price Components used to determine the Estimated Purchase
Price) (the "Final Purchase Price"), subject in all respects to Sections
1.5(d)(ii) and 9.5(h), if:



(A) the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price set
forth in the Closing Consideration Spreadsheet, then: (1) the Sellers'
Representative shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a spreadsheet (the
"Post-Closing Consideration Spreadsheet") allocating the amount of such
difference among Sellers, the former holders of Options, RSUs and Holdings
Shares and the LTIP Participants, and promptly (and in any event within 10
Business Days) following the delivery to Purchaser of the Post-Closing
Consideration Spreadsheet, Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, the
amount of such difference to Sellers, the former holders of Options, RSUs and
Holdings Shares and the LTIP Participants, in each case, in the amounts and in
accordance with the payment instructions set forth in the Post-Closing
Consideration Spreadsheet; and (2) Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative
will promptly (and in any event within five Business Days) following the
delivery to Purchaser of the Escrow Release Spreadsheet by the Sellers'
Representative jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release the balance of the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund to the Sellers' Representative (for the
benefit of, and further distribution to, Sellers and the former holders of
Holdings Shares) and to Purchaser (for the benefit of, and further
distribution to, the former holders of Options, the former holders of RSUs and
the LTIP Participants), in each case in accordance with such Escrow Release
Spreadsheet allocating the amount to be so released from the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Fund;



(B) the Final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price set
forth in the Closing Consideration Spreadsheet, then: (1) if the amount of
such difference is less than the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount, then
Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative promptly (and in any event within
five Business Days) following the delivery to Purchaser of the Escrow Release
Spreadsheet by the Sellers' Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow
Agent to: (x) pay to Purchaser from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund
an amount equal to the amount of such difference; and (y) release the balance
of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund to the Sellers' Representative
(for the benefit of, and further distribution to, Sellers and the former
holders of Holdings Shares) and to Purchaser (for the benefit of, and further
distribution to, the former holders of Options, the former holders of RSUs and
the LTIP Participants), in each case in accordance with such Escrow Release
Spreadsheet allocating the amount so released from the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Fund; or (2) if the amount of such difference is greater
than the amount then held in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund, then:
(x) Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative promptly (and in any event
within five Business Days) following such determination shall jointly instruct
the Escrow Agent to release to Purchaser all amounts then held in the Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Fund; and (y) Purchaser shall have no recourse against
the Sellers' Representative, Sellers, the former holder of Options, the former
holders of RSUs, the former Holdings Equityholders or the LTIP Participants
with respect to the amount of such difference that is greater than the amount
then held in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund; or



(C) the Final Purchase Price is equal to the Estimated Purchase Price set
forth in the Closing Consideration Spreadsheet, then Purchaser and the
Sellers' Representative promptly (and in any event within five Business Days)
following the delivery to Purchaser of the Escrow Release Spreadsheet by the
Sellers' Representative































-8- 

shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release all of the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Fund to the Sellers' Representative (for the benefit of
Sellers and the former holders of Holdings Shares) and to Purchaser (for the
benefit of, and further distribution to, the former holders of Options, the
former holders of RSUs and the LTIP Participants), in each case in accordance
with such Escrow Release Spreadsheet allocating the amount to be so released
from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund.



(ii) All payments pursuant to this Section 1.5(d) shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to account(s) set forth in the Post-
Closing Consideration Spreadsheet, any Escrow Release Spreadsheet, or in
written payment instructions delivered by Purchaser to the Sellers'
Representative, as applicable; provided, however, that any amount to be
released to the Sellers' Representative with respect to which Purchaser or any
Acquired Company has any Tax withholding obligations shall instead by released
to Purchaser for payment to the applicable payee through the payroll service
of Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser, in each case in accordance with
the Post-Closing Consideration Spreadsheet or any applicable Escrow Release
Spreadsheet. It is acknowledged and agreed that the delivery by Purchaser to
the Sellers' Representative of any amount on behalf of and for further
distribution to any Person shall fully satisfy Purchaser's obligations to such
Person under this Agreement.



(iii) Each Seller and Purchaser agree to treat (and cause their Affiliates to
treat) any payments received by Purchaser pursuant to Section 1.5(d)(i)(B) as
adjustments to the Aggregate Share Consideration Amount payable to such Seller
for all Tax purposes, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements.



1.6. Withholding. Each of Purchaser and the Company shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold, from any consideration or other amounts payable by or on
behalf of Purchaser, any Acquired Company or any of their respective
Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
any amounts payable by Purchaser and/or released from the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 1.5(d)) or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, such amounts as are required to
be deducted or withheld therefrom or in connection therewith under any
provision of applicable Legal Requirements relating to Taxes or under any
other applicable Legal Requirement; provided, however, that except with
respect to payments in the nature of compensation to be made to employees or
former employees, the applicable payor shall provide each Seller or other
applicable payee with a written notice of such payor's intention to withhold
at least three (3) Business Days prior to any such withholding indicating the
(a) amount to be withheld or deducted with respect to each Person from which
any amount is to be withheld or deducted and (b) relevant provisions of the
Code (or other applicable Legal Requirement) requiring such withholding or
deduction, and prior to any such withholding both the applicable payor and
applicable payee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any
such Taxes. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and
subsequently paid to the appropriate Tax authority by or on behalf of
Purchaser, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have
been paid.

Purchaser, and such plans and Contracts have not been amended, modified or
supplemented since being Made Available to Purchaser, and there are no
Contracts to amend, modify or supplement such plans or Contracts in any case
from those Made Available to Purchaser. The Company Equity Plan has been duly

counsel for the other party reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection with, any
proposed substantive written communication to any Governmental Authority
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in connection with the performance of each party's respective
obligations, each of the Sellers' Representative and Purchaser may, as each
determines is reasonably necessary, designate competitively sensitive material
provided to the other pursuant to this Section 5.6(b), as "Outside Counsel
Only". Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given
only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed
by such outside counsel to directors, officers or employees of the recipient
unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the
materials (a Seller, the Sellers' Representative or Purchaser, as the case may
be) or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 5.6, materials provided to the other parties or their counsel may be
redacted to remove references concerning the valuation of the Business or the
Acquired Companies or information otherwise not germane to regulatory review.
Each of the Sellers' Representative and Purchaser further agrees not to
participate in any substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by
telephone with any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless it consults with the other in advance
and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Authority, gives the
other the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting or discussion.

this Agreement, it is expressly understood and agreed that Purchaser shall not
have any obligation to litigate any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding that may be brought in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and neither Purchaser nor any Affiliate of
Purchaser shall be required to agree to any license, sale or other disposition
or holding separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise), of
its shares or of any business, assets or property of Purchaser, the Acquired
Companies or any of their respective Affiliates, or the imposition of any
limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their businesses or to own
or exercise control of such assets, properties and shares.

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for
public statements required by applicable Legal Requirements. Except as set

permit its Affiliates to, disclose the material economic terms and the

keep strictly confidential (and each Seller and the Sellers' Representative
shall ensure that each of its Representatives does not use and keeps strictly
confidential) all confidential or proprietary information of the Acquired

otherwise limiting the ability of any Seller or its Representatives from (A)
making any disclosures of confidential or proprietary information of the
Acquired Companies to the extent required by applicable law, (B) using
confidential or proprietary information of the Acquired Companies to the

confidentiality with respect to such information; or (D) is independently
developed by Sellers or the Sellers' Representative without reference to or
use of confidential or proprietary information of the Acquired Companies.

that Purchaser and its Representatives may disclose Confidential Information
(as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) to its financing sources for
purposes of seeking and obtaining financing in connection with the

Confidentiality Agreement shall prevent any such Persons, their Affiliates or
their portfolio companies from investing in, doing business with, engaging in,
managing and/or acquiring any business that may be similar to or in
competition with the Acquired Companies; provided, however, that for the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 5.7(d) shall abrogate from the

(or cause the borrower under such facility to deliver, as applicable) all
notices and take all other reasonable and customary actions necessary to

shall purchase: (i) an extended reporting period endorsement under the
Company's existing directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage for
the Company's directors and officers in a form reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser, which shall provide such directors and officers with coverage for
six years following the Closing and shall have a scope substantially similar
to the existing coverage under, and have other terms not materially less
favorable to the insured persons than the terms of, the liability insurance
coverage currently maintained by the Company; and (ii) an extended reporting
period endorsement under the Company's existing cyber security insurance
policy in a form reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, which shall provide
coverage for three years following the Closing Date and shall have a scope
substantially similar to the existing coverage under, and have other terms not
materially less favorable to the insured persons than the terms of, the cyber
security insurance coverage currently maintained by the Acquired Companies.



(b)For a period of six years from the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause each
Acquired Company to perform its obligations to any current or former director,
officer or person holding a comparable Entity position of such Acquired
Company (an "Indemnified DandO") to indemnify, compensate, reimburse, hold
harmless, exculpate, or advance expenses to such Indemnified DandO, in each
case, pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Acquired Company's Charter
Documents and any indemnification agreement set forth on Schedule 3.11(a)(ii)
of the Disclosure Schedule as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, and,
in each case, solely with respect to actions taken by such Indemnified DandO
prior to the Closing in his or her capacity as a director, officer or person
holding a comparable Entity position of any Acquired Company. Without limiting
the foregoing, Purchaser, from and after the Closing, shall cause the Charter
Documents of the Acquired Companies to contain provisions no less favorable to
the Indemnified DandO with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors,
officers and persons holding a comparable Entity position and indemnification
than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in such Charter Documents,
which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified
DandO in any material respect.



5.14. Employee Matters.

(a) The Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary and
appropriate to terminate all Company Employee Plans that contain a cash or
deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code (the
"401(k) Plans"), with such termination of the 401(k) Plans to be effective no
later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (but contingent upon
the Closing). For any 401(k) Plans to be terminated as described in this
Section 5.14(a), the Company shall deliver to Purchaser, no later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, evidence that its board of directors
has validly adopted resolutions to terminate such 401(k) Plans (the form and
substance of which resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of
Purchaser (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), drafts of
which resolutions shall be delivered to Purchaser by the Company at least
three days before their adoption). Effective as of the Closing, or as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Closing, Purchaser shall, or shall cause
one of its Affiliates, to establish or designate one or more plans intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code for Continuing Employees.



































-58-

Employees full credit for all service with an Acquired Company (or predecessor
employers to the extent an Acquired Company provides such past service credit)
prior to the Closing Date for purposes of eligibility, vesting and determining
the level of benefits under any benefit or compensation plan, program, policy,
agreement or arrangement made available to Continuing Employees on or after
the Closing Date (collectively, the "Purchaser Plans") (excluding any
sabbatical program, defined benefit pension, nonqualified deferred
compensation, equity or equity-based or retiree welfare benefits) to the same
extent service was recognized for the same purpose under the comparable
Company Employee Plan, except to the extent it would result in the duplication
of benefits. In addition, for purposes of each Purchaser Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical, or vision benefits to any Continuing
Employee, to the extent consistent with the governing terms of the applicable
Purchaser Plan, Purchaser will use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i)
cause to be waived all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively at work
requirements and similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence
of insurability requirements under any Purchaser Plans that provide such
benefits in which Continuing Employees commence participation during the plan
year in which the Closing Date occurs to the extent such exclusions,
requirements or limitations were waived or satisfied by a Continuing Employee
under any analogous Company Employee Plan providing such benefits in which the
Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing, and (ii)
cause any deductible, co-insurance and out-of-pocket expenses paid by any
Continuing Employee (or covered dependent thereof) prior to the Closing Date
under an analogous Company Employee Plan that provides such benefits during
the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs to be taken into account for
purposes of satisfying the corresponding deductible, coinsurance and maximum
out-of-pocket provisions under any Purchaser Plan that provides such benefits
for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs.



(c) The Company shall cause all Insider Receivables, if any, to be repaid in
full to the applicable Acquired Company prior to the Closing.



(d) Nothing in this Section 5.14, whether express or implied, shall: (i)
confer upon any current or former employee of the Company, Purchaser or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including any Continuing
Employee), the right to employment or continued employment or any term or
condition of employment for any specified period, of any nature or kind
whatsoever, or restrict the ability of Purchaser or any its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to terminate the employment or service of any Person; (ii) be
construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit or compensation plan,
program, Contract, policy or arrangement; (iii) limit the ability of Purchaser
or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any
benefit or compensation plan, program, Contract, policy or arrangement at any
time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them; or (iv)
create any third-party beneficiary rights or obligations in any Person
(including any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) other than
the parties to this Agreement.



5.15. Treatment of Equity Awards. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
cause Holdings to take all actions necessary to effect the treatment of
Options and RSUs provided for under Section 1.3 under the Company Equity Plan,
all Contracts governing the terms of all Options and RSUs and under any other
plan or arrangement to which Holdings is a party or by which Holdings may be
bound, including by giving any required notice and obtaining any required
consent contemplated thereby, such that, as of the Closing, no holder or
former holder of Options or RSUs will have any rights with respect to such
Options or RSUs other than as set forth in Section 1.3.



5.16. Data Room Files. The Company shall deliver to Purchaser, within ten
Business Days following the date of this Agreement, a USB drive or other
digital media evidencing the documents that were Made Available, which shall

-59- 

5.17. Solicitation of 280G Approval.



(a)Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall: (i) use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain from each Person who is a "disqualified individual" (within
the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder) with respect to the Company, if any, who might receive or retain
any payments and/or benefits that may be nondeductible under Section 280G of
the Code in connection with the consummation of the Share Purchase (a
"Disqualified Individual") a duly executed waiver of the Potential Parachute
Payment (the "280G Waiver"); and (ii) submit information regarding each such
Potential Parachute Payment for approval (in a manner reasonably satisfactory
to Purchaser and in accordance with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder) by such number of Persons entitled to vote as
required by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, such that, if the
requisite number of Persons vote to approve such Potential Parachute Payments,
all such payments and/or benefits shall not be nondeductible as a result of
Section 280G of the Code. If there are any Disqualified Individuals, then,
prior to the Closing, the Company shall notify Purchaser (x) that a vote was
solicited in conformance with Section 280G and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, and, if applicable, the requisite approval was obtained with
respect to any Potential Parachute Payment that were made subject to the vote
(the "280G Approval"), or (y) that the 280G Approval was not obtained and as a
consequence, that such Potential Parachute Payment shall not be made or
provided, pursuant to the waivers of those Potential Parachute Payments which
were executed by the Disqualified Individuals following the execution of this
Agreement and not later than one day prior to the solicitation of the 280G
Approval. At least five Business Days prior to the Closing, to the extent the
applicable Purchaser Arrangements have not been made available to the Company
in connection with the execution of this Agreement, Purchaser shall make
available to the Company a summary of the Purchaser Arrangements that
Purchaser or its Affiliates are providing or entering into with respect to
each "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code) set forth on Schedule 5.17(a) of the Disclosure Schedule in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that could reasonably be
expected to be treated as a Potential Parachute Payment (either alone or
together with any other payments to a disqualified individual); provided that,
in any event, the Company's failure to include in the stockholder voting
materials described herein information regarding any Purchaser Arrangements
for which a summary of such Purchaser Arrangement, or the underlying Purchaser
Arrangement, was not made available to the Company by Purchaser prior to the
date such stockholder voting materials were submitted will not result in a
breach of the covenants set forth in this Section 5.17. In no event shall the
Company be deemed in breach of this Section 5.17 if any disqualified
individual refuses to execute a waiver or, after soliciting the stockholder
vote in conformance with Section 280G and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, the 280G Approval is not obtained. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Potential Parachute Payment" shall mean the portion of any payments and/or
benefits received or retained by any Disqualified Individual in connection
with the consummation of the Share Purchase that is equal to or in excess of
3.0 times such Disqualified Individual's "Base Amount" (within the meaning of
Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code).



(b)Any materials to be submitted to Sellers in connection with the Company's
solicitation of the 280G Approval shall be subject to prior review by
Purchaser and the Company shall not unreasonably reject any comments from
Purchaser related thereto.



5.18. Termination of Agreements. Each Seller and the Company hereby agrees
that it will cause, effective as of the Closing: (a) all Contracts set forth
or required to be set forth on Schedule 3.4(j) or Schedule 3.23 of the
Disclosure Schedule or set forth on Schedule 5.18 to terminate in all respects
and be of no further force or effect, in each case, as between any Seller or
any Affiliate of such Seller, on the one hand, and the Acquired Companies, on
the other hand pursuant to a termination agreement substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit P; and (b) all obligations of the Acquired
Companies and all rights of any Seller and any Affiliate of such Seller
thereunder relating to the Acquired Companies































-60- 

to be deemed terminated, discharged and waived. Each Seller acknowledges and
agrees (on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates) that, from and after
the Closing, neither such Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall have any
recourse against any Acquired Company in respect of any of the matters
contained in the agreements to be terminated in accordance with the preceding
sentence.

5.19. Tax Assistance and Cooperation; Tax Elections. From and after the
Closing Date, the Sellers' Representative, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on
the other hand, shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to), as and
to the extent reasonably requested by the other party: (a) assist the other

provide any security, provide any agreements, opinions, authorization letters,

clams) and resulting from, or arising out of, any of the following:

































-68- 

(i)any breach or failure of any representation or warranty made by Sellers in
any of Sections 2.1, 2.4 and 2.5 to be true and correct (A) as of the date of
this Agreement or (B) as of the Closing Date with the same force and effect as

Recourse to the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund shall be the sole and

9.3(a)(ii).



(b)Insurance; Tax Benefits. For purposes of this Section 9, the amount of
Damages suffered by a Purchaser Indemnified Party in connection with an

extent recoverable thereunder), with respect to which the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall have an affirmative duty to exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to collect thereunder with respect to any matter for which
indemnity is sought hereunder, no Purchaser Indemnified Party shall have any
obligation to affirmatively pursue the collection of any insurance proceeds
prior to the bringing of an Indemnification Claim, regardless of whether such
Purchaser Indemnified Party has suffered or incurred any Damages for which
such Purchaser Indemnified Party has insurance coverage (it being understood,
however, that a Purchaser Indemnified Party may deliver a Notice of Claim to
the Sellers' Representative concurrently with seeking recovery under the
Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy for purposes of establishing such
claim during the Survival Period but the applicable Sellers shall not be
required to make any payment under this Section 9 until such time as Purchaser
has determined the amounts recoverable under the Representation and Warranty
Insurance Policy, if any, in respect thereof). The Representation and Warranty
Insurance Policy shall provide that the insurer thereunder shall waive any
right of subrogation against Sellers and their direct and indirect
equityholders in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, except in the case of Fraud. Nothing set forth in this
Section 9 shall be construed to contractually eliminate any duty that any
Purchaser Indemnified Party may have under the common law to mitigate such
Purchaser Indemnified Party's Damages.





































-69- 

(c) No Double Recovery. No Purchaser Indemnified Party shall have any right to
obtain indemnification under this Agreement for any Damages or alleged Damages
incurred by a Purchaser Indemnified Party with respect to any liability of the
Acquired Companies, to the extent such liability was included in the Closing
Indebtedness Amount, the Change in Control Payment Amount, the Unpaid
Transaction Expense Amount or the calculation of the Working Capital Amount
(as such amounts may be adjusted pursuant to Section 1.5).



9.5 Indemnification Claim Procedure. Any claim for indemnification,
compensation or reimbursement pursuant to this Section 9 (each, an
"Indemnification Claim") shall be brought and resolved exclusively as follows:



(a)Notice of Claim. If any Purchaser Indemnified Party has or claims in good
faith to have incurred, paid, accrued or suffered, or believes that it may
incur, pay, accrue or suffer, Damages for which it is or may be entitled to be
held harmless, indemnified, compensated or reimbursed under Section 9,
Purchaser may (on behalf of such Purchaser Indemnified Party) deliver a notice
of claim (a "Notice of Claim") to the Sellers' Representative. Each Notice of
Claim shall: (i) state that such Purchaser Indemnified Party believes it is or
may be entitled to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under
Section 9; (ii) contain a reasonably detailed description of the circumstances
supporting such Purchaser Indemnified Party's belief that it is or may be so
entitled to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement or is or may
otherwise be entitled to a monetary remedy; and (iii) if practicable, contain
a good faith, non-binding, preliminary estimate of the aggregate dollar amount
of actual and potential Damages that have arisen and may arise as a result of
such circumstances (the aggregate amount of such estimate, as it may be
modified by Purchaser (at the good faith direction of the Purchaser
Indemnified Party) from time to time, being referred to as the "Claimed
Amount").



(b)Dispute Procedure. During the 30-day period commencing upon delivery by
Purchaser to the Sellers' Representative of a Notice of Claim (the "Dispute
Period"), the Sellers' Representative may deliver to Purchaser a written
response (the "Response Notice") in which the Sellers' Representative: (i)
agrees that the full Claimed Amount is owed to the Purchaser Indemnified
Party; (ii) agrees that part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount (the "Agreed
Amount") is owed to the Purchaser Indemnified Party; or (iii) indicates that
no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Purchaser Indemnified Party,
including because the Notice of Claim fails to satisfy the requirements
thereof under this Agreement. If the Response Notice is delivered in
accordance with clause "(ii)" or "(iii)" of the preceding sentence, the
Response Notice shall also contain a reasonably detailed description of the
facts and circumstances supporting the Seller Representative's claim that only
a portion or no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Purchaser
Indemnified Party, as the case may be. Any part of the Claimed Amount that is
not agreed to be owed to the Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to the
Response Notice (or the entire Claimed Amount, if the Sellers' Representative
asserts in the Response Notice that no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to
the Purchaser Indemnified Party) is referred to as the "Contested Amount" (it
being understood that the Contested Amount shall be modified from time to time
to reflect any good faith modifications by Purchaser (on behalf of the
applicable Purchaser Indemnified Party) to the Claimed Amount). If a Response
Notice is not received by Purchaser prior to the expiration of the Dispute
Period, then the Sellers' Representative and Sellers shall be conclusively
deemed to have agreed that the full Claimed Amount is owed to the Purchaser
Indemnified Party.



(c) Payment of Claimed Amounts. If the Sellers' Representative delivers a
Response Notice to Purchaser agreeing that the full Claimed Amount is owed to
the Purchaser Indemnified Party, or the Sellers' Representative does not
deliver a Response Notice during the Dispute Period, then, subject to the
limitations contained in Section 9.4, (i) to the extent the Claimed Amount set
forth in the Notice of Claim is for a claim pursuant to Section 9.3(a)(i), the
Sellers' Representative shall (on behalf of Sellers), within ten Business Days
following the earlier of the delivery of such Response Notice or the
expiration































-70- 

of the Dispute Period, pay the Claimed Amount to the Purchaser Indemnified
Party, and (ii) to the extent the Claimed Amount set forth in the Notice of
Claim is for a claim pursuant to Section 9.3(a)(ii), Purchaser and the
Sellers' Representative shall, within ten Business Days following the earlier
of the delivery of such Response Notice or the expiration of the Dispute
Period, instruct the Escrow Agent to pay the Claimed Amount to the Purchaser
Indemnified Party from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund.



(d) Payment of Agreed Amount. If the Sellers' Representative delivers a
Response Notice to Purchaser during the Dispute Period agreeing that less than
the full Claimed Amount is owed to the Purchaser Indemnified Party, then,
subject to the limitations contained in Section 9.4, (i) to the extent the
Agreed Amount is for a claim pursuant to Section 9.3(a)(i), the Sellers'
Representative shall, within ten Business Days following the delivery of such
Response Notice, pay the Agreed Amount to the Purchaser Indemnified Party, and
(ii) to the extent the Agreed Amount is for a claim pursuant to Section
9.3(a)(ii), Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall, within ten
Business Days following the delivery of such Response Notice, instruct the
Escrow Agent to pay the Agreed Amount to the Purchaser Indemnified Party from
the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund.



(e) Resolution Between the Parties. If the Sellers' Representative delivers a
Response Notice to Purchaser during the Dispute Period indicating that there
is a Contested Amount, the Sellers' Representative and Purchaser (or the
applicable Purchaser Indemnified Party) shall attempt in good faith to resolve
the dispute related to the Contested Amount. If Purchaser and the Sellers'
Representative resolve such dispute, then their resolution of such dispute
shall be binding on Sellers and such Purchaser Indemnified Party and a
settlement agreement stipulating the amount owed to such Purchaser Indemnified
Party (the "Stipulated Amount") shall be signed by such Purchaser Indemnified
Party and Sellers. Subject to the limitations contained in Section 9.4, (i) to
the extent the Stipulated Amount is for a claim pursuant to Section 9.3(a)(i),
the Sellers' Representative shall (on behalf of Sellers), within ten Business
Days following the execution of such settlement agreement, or such shorter
period of time as may be set forth in the settlement agreement, pay the
Stipulated Amount to such Purchaser Indemnified Party, and (ii) to the extent
the Stipulated Amount is for a claim pursuant to Section 9.3(a)(ii), Purchaser
and the Sellers' Representative shall, within ten Business Days following the
execution of such settlement agreement, or such shorter period of time as may
be set forth in the settlement agreement, instruct the Escrow Agent to pay the
Stipulated Amount to the Purchaser Indemnified Party from the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Fund.



(f) Arbitration. If the Sellers' Representative and Purchaser are unable to
resolve the dispute relating to any Contested Amount during the 20-day period
commencing upon the delivery of the Response Notice to Purchaser, then either
Purchaser or the Sellers' Representative may submit the dispute (an
"Arbitrable Dispute") to be settled by binding arbitration. Notwithstanding
the preceding sentence, nothing in this Section 9.5(f) shall prevent the
Purchaser Indemnified Party from seeking an injunction or order or decree of
specific performance for any breach of any covenant to be performed in whole
or in part following the Closing, pending settlement of any Arbitrable
Dispute.



(i) Except as herein specifically stated, any Arbitrable Dispute shall be
resolved by binding arbitration in San Francisco, California in accordance
with the then current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association then in effect (the "AAA Rules"). However, in all events, the
provisions contained herein shall govern over any conflicting rules which may
now or hereafter be contained in the AAA Rules. The arbitration proceedings
shall be conducted in the English language. Any judgment upon the award
rendered by the arbitrator shall be entered in any court having jurisdiction
over the subject matter thereof. The arbitrator shall have the authority to
grant any equitable and legal remedies that would be available if any judicial
proceeding were instituted to resolve an Arbitrable Dispute. The final































-71- 

decision of the arbitrator will be furnished by the arbitrator to the Sellers'
Representative and Purchaser in writing and will constitute a final,
conclusive and non-appealable determination of the issue in question, binding
upon Sellers and such Purchaser Indemnified Party.



(ii) Any such arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator who
will be compensated for his or her services at a rate to be determined by
Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative or by the American Arbitration
Association, but based upon reasonable hourly or daily consulting rates for
the arbitrator in the event the parties are not able to agree upon his or her
rate of compensation.



(ii) The arbitrator shall be mutually agreed upon by Purchaser and the
Sellers' Representative. In the event Purchaser and the Sellers'
Representative are unable to agree within 20 days following submission of the
dispute to the American Arbitration Association by one of the parties, the
American Arbitration Association will have the authority to select an
arbitrator from a list of arbitrators who satisfy the criteria set forth in
Section 9.5(f)(iv).



(iv) No arbitrator shall have any past or present family, business or other
relationship with Purchaser, the Purchaser Indemnified Party, any Acquired
Company, any Seller, the Sellers' Representative or any "affiliate" (as such
term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended),
director or officer thereof, unless following full disclosure of all such
relationships, Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative agree in writing to
waive such requirement with respect to an individual in connection with any
dispute.



(v) The Purchaser Indemnified Party and the Sellers' Representative will each
pay 50% of the initial compensation to be paid to the arbitrator in any such
arbitration and 50% of the costs of transcripts and other normal and regular
expenses of the arbitration proceedings; provided, however, that: (A) the
prevailing party in any arbitration will be entitled to an award of attorneys'
fees and costs; and (B) all costs of arbitration, other than those provided
for above, will be paid by the losing party, and the arbitrator will be
authorized to determine the identity of the prevailing party and the losing
party.



(vi) The arbitrator chosen in accordance with these provisions will not have
the power to alter, amend or otherwise affect the terms of these arbitration
provisions or any other provisions contained in this Section 9.5 or this
Agreement.



(vii) Except as specifically otherwise provided in this Section 9.5 or this
Agreement, arbitration will be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties
for any Arbitrable Dispute or any other dispute arising out of or relating to
this Section 9.



(g) Payment of Award Amount. Upon resolution of an Arbitrable Dispute, subject
to the limitations contained in Section 9.4, (i) to the extent the awarded
amount relates to a claim pursuant to Section 9.3(a)(i), the Sellers'
Representative (on behalf of Sellers) shall, within ten Business Days
following the entry of the final decision, or such shorter period of time as
may be set forth in the final decision, pay any amount awarded to the
Purchaser Indemnified Party, and (ii) to the extent the awarded amount relates
to a claim pursuant to Section 9.3(a)(ii), Purchaser and the Sellers'
Representative shall, within ten Business Days following the entry of the
final decision, or such shorter period of time as may be set forth in the
final decision, instruct the Escrow Agent to pay the awarded amount to the
Purchaser Indemnified Party from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund.



(h) Release of Escrow. If prior to the expiration of the Closing Consideration
Spreadsheet Survival Period, there is any Claimed Amount pending pursuant to a
Notice of Claim solely

























-72- 

for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under Section 9.3(a)(ii)
("Pending Claim"), the amount of such Pending Claim shall reduce the amount
which would otherwise be paid pursuant to Section 1.5(d) to the Sellers'
Representative (for the benefit of, and further distribution to, Sellers and
the former holders of Holdings Shares) and to the Purchaser (for the benefit
of, and further distribution to, the former holders of Options, the former
holders of RSUs and the LTIP Participants) pending final resolution of any
Pending Claim. Promptly (and in any event within three Business Days)
following final resolution of any Pending Claim, Purchaser and the Sellers'
Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release any
remaining amounts held in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund finally
determined to be due to Purchaser to Purchaser and any remaining amounts to
the Sellers' Representative (for the benefit of, and further distribution to,
Sellers and the former holders of Holdings Shares) and to the Purchaser (for
the benefit of, and further distribution to, the former holders of Options,
the former holders of RSUs and the LTIP Participants).



9.6. No Contribution. Each Seller waives, and acknowledges and agrees that
such Seller shall not have and shall not exercise or assert (or attempt to
exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other
right or remedy against Purchaser, or the Company, in connection with any
indemnification obligation or any other liability to which it may become
subject under or in connection with this Agreement or any other agreement,
document or instrument delivered to Purchaser in connection with this
Agreement.



9.7. Third Party Actions.



(a)In the event any legal proceeding is instituted against a Purchaser
Indemnified Party that involves or appears reasonably likely to involve an
Indemnification Claim hereunder, Purchaser will, promptly after receipt of
notice of any such legal proceeding, notify the Sellers' Representative of the
commencement thereof. The failure to so notify the Sellers' Representative of
the commencement of any such legal proceeding will relieve Sellers from
liability for indemnification pursuant to this Agreement in connection
therewith only if and to the extent that such failure materially and adversely
affects the defense of such legal proceeding.



(b)The Sellers' Representative shall have the right, in its sole discretion,
to control the defense or settlement of such legal proceeding; provided,
however, that Purchaser and its counsel (at the sole expense of Purchaser) may
participate in (but not control the conduct of) the defense of such legal
proceeding; and provided, further, that, except with the consent of Purchaser
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), no
settlement of any such legal proceeding with third party claimants shall be
made unless the claimants seek solely monetary remedies for which Sellers
confirm in writing they are responsible.

9.8. Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Each Seller, the Sellers'
Representative and Purchaser agree to treat (and cause their Affiliates to
treat) any payments received by any Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to
Section 9.3 as adjustments to the Aggregate Share Consideration Amount
received by Sellers for all Tax purposes, to the extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements.



9.9. Exercise of Remedies Other Than By Purchaser. No Purchaser Indemnified
Party (other than Purchaser or any successor thereto or assign thereof) shall
be permitted to assert any indemnification claim or exercise any other remedy
under this Agreement unless Purchaser (or any successor thereto or assign
thereof) shall have consented to the assertion of such indemnification claim
or the exercise of such other remedy.



9.10. Exclusive Remedy. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees
that from and after the Closing, the indemnification provisions in this
Section 9 and the Representation and Warranty



























-73- 

Insurance Policy shall be the exclusive remedy of the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
no Purchaser Indemnified Party shall have any other rights or remedies in
connection with any breach of this Agreement or any other loss arising out of
the negotiation, entry into or consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, in each case, except for (a) specific performance or
injunctive relief with respect to any covenant to be performed in whole or in
part following the Closing, (b) remedies under any other Transaction Document,
(c) remedies for Fraud and (d) remedies with respect to disputes under Section
1.5 (which disputes will be resolved in accordance with the dispute resolution
mechanism set forth in Section 1.5).

9.11. Release. Effective as of the Closing, Purchaser hereby unconditionally
and irrevocably and forever releases and discharges Sellers and their
Affiliates (in each case, excluding the Acquired Companies) and each of their
respective successors and assigns (each, a "Released Party"), of and from, and
hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives, any and all claims, debts,
losses, expenses, proceedings, liabilities, suits, judgments, damages and
actions of any kind or character whatsoever, known or unknown, suspected or
unsuspected, in contract, at law or in equity that such party ever had, now
has or ever may have or claim to have against any Released Party, for or by
reason of any matter, circumstance, event, action, inaction, omission, cause
or thing whatsoever arising prior to the Closing (including in respect of the
management or operation of the Acquired Companies) solely in connection with
this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby; provided, however, that Purchaser is not
releasing, discharging or waiving any rights or remedies under this Agreement,
preserved under Section 9.11 or under any other Transaction Documents.
Purchaser expressly waives all rights afforded by any statute which limits the
effect of a release with respect to unknown claims. Purchaser understands the
significance of this release of unknown claims and waiver of statutory
protection against a release of unknown claims, and acknowledges and agrees
that this waiver is an essential and material term of this Agreement.
Purchaser acknowledges that Sellers will be relying on the waiver and release
provided in this Section 9.11 in connection with entering into this Agreement
and that this Section 9.11 is intended for the benefit of, and to grant third
party rights to each Seller and its Affiliates (in each case, excluding the
Acquired Companies) to enforce this Section 9.11.



10. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

10.1. Further Assurances. Each party hereto shall execute and cause to be
delivered to each other party hereto such instruments and other documents, and
shall take such other actions, as such other party may reasonably request
after the Closing Date for the purpose of carrying out or evidencing any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties further agree to
the covenants set forth on Schedule 10.1-A and Schedule 10.1-B.



10.2. Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, subject to
Section 9, each party to this Agreement shall bear and pay all fees, costs and

including all fees, costs and expenses incurred by such party in connection
with or by virtue of: (a) the negotiation, preparation and review of this
Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedule) and all agreements,
certificates, opinions and other instruments and documents delivered or to be
delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
and (b) the preparation and submission of any filing or notice required to be
made or given in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, however, that Sellers shall bear all such fees, costs and
expenses of the Acquired Companies included as Company Transaction Expenses,
if any.



10.3. Attorneys' Fees. If any Action relating to this Agreement or the
enforcement of any provision of this Agreement is brought against any party
hereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to































-74- 

recover reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements (in addition to
any other relief to which the prevailing party may be entitled).

10.4. Notices. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be
delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be

convenience of reference only, shall not be deemed to be a part of this
Agreement and shall not be referred to in connection with the construction or
interpretation of this Agreement.



10.6. Governing Law; Dispute Resolution.



(a)Governing Law. This Agreement and any disputes arising from or relating to
this Agreement, including the validity hereof and the rights and obligations
of the parties hereunder, whether sounding in contract, tort or statute, shall
be governed by and construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of
Delaware, including its statute of limitations, without giving effect to the
conflicts-of-laws provisions thereof.



(b)Venue. Except as provided in Sections 1.5 and 10.6(c), the parties hereto
agree that any legal proceeding by or against any party hereto or with respect
to or arising out of this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the
Delaware Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware (the "Chancery Court"),
or, if the Chancery Court declines to accept jurisdiction, in any other state
court located in Wilmington, Delaware or United States federal court located
in Wilmington, Delaware. By execution and delivery of this Agreement, each
party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts and to the appellate courts therefrom for the
purposes of disputes arising under this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The parties hereto irrevocably consent to the
service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such action
or proceeding by the delivery of copies thereof by overnight courier to the
address for such party to which notices are deliverable hereunder. Any such
service of process shall be effective upon delivery. Nothing herein shall
affect the right to serve process in any other manner permitted by applicable
Legal Requirements. The parties hereto hereby waive any right to stay or
dismiss any action or proceeding under or in connection with this Agreement
brought before the foregoing courts on the basis of: (a) any claim that it is
not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any
reason, or that it or any of its property is immune from the above-described
legal process; or (b) that such action or proceeding is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that venue for the action or proceeding is improper or
that this Agreement may not be enforced in or by such courts.



(c)Indemnification Claims. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in Section 10.6(b), any claim for indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement pursuant to Section 9 of the Agreement shall be brought and
resolved exclusively in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section
9.5 (it being understood that, for the avoidance of doubt that and without
limiting any portion of Section 10.6(b), nothing in this Section 10.6(c) shall
prevent Purchaser or the Sellers' Representative from seeking an injunction or
order or decree of specific performance with respect to any covenant to be
performed in whole or in part following the Closing).



(d)WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY PRIOR TO THE CLOSING IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH
RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY PRIOR TO THE CLOSING.



































-76- 

10.7. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon: (a)
Sellers and their respective successors or permitted assigns (if any); (b) the
Sellers' Representative and its successors or permitted assigns (if any); and

Agreement shall inure to the benefit of: Sellers, the Sellers' Representative,
Purchaser, the other Purchaser Indemnified Parties and the respective heirs,
executors, personal representatives, successors and assigns of the foregoing
(if any). Neither this Agreement, nor any of the rights or obligations
hereunder, shall be assigned (a) by Purchaser without the prior written
consent of the Sellers' Representative or (b) by any Seller or the Sellers'
Representative without the prior written consent of Purchaser; provided,
however, that after the Closing, Purchaser may freely assign any or all of its
rights under this Agreement (including its rights under Section 9), in whole
or in part, to any other Person (including one or more of the insurers under
the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policies) without obtaining the
consent or approval of any other party hereto or of any other Person. Any
attempted assignment or delegation by a party in violation of this Section
10.7 shall be null and void.



10.8. Waiver. No failure on the part of any Person to exercise any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of
any Person in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. No Person shall be deemed to have waived
any claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or
remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right,
privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly
executed and delivered on behalf of such Person; and any such waiver shall not
be applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it
is given.



10.9. Amendments. This Agreement may not be amended, modified, altered or
supplemented other than by means of a written instrument duly executed and
delivered on behalf of Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative (on behalf of
the Company (prior to the Closing) and the Sellers).



10.10. Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application of any such provision to any Person or set of circumstances,
shall be determined to be invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable to any
extent, the remainder of this Agreement, and the application of such provision
to Persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is determined to
be invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable, shall not be impaired or
otherwise affected and shall continue to be valid and enforceable to the
fullest extent permitted by law.



10.11. Parties in Interest. Except for the provisions of Sections 5.13
(solely with respect to the Indemnified DandOs) and 9 (solely with respect to
the Released Parties and the Purchaser Indemnified Parties), none of the
provisions of this Agreement is intended to provide any rights or remedies to
any Person, other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns (if any), specifically including employees or creditors of the
Acquired Companies.



10.12. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including the Disclosure Schedules
and the Exhibits hereto, and the other agreements referred to herein,
including the Confidentiality Agreement, set forth the entire understanding of
the parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings among or between any of the
parties relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof.



10.13. Legal Representation; Privileged Materials. Purchaser, on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies following the
Closing) ("Purchaser Related Parties") hereby waives any claim that Kirkland and
Ellis LLP (the "Law Firm") in connection with the negotiation, preparation,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions



























-77- 

contemplated by this Agreement prior to the Closing has a conflict of interest
or is otherwise prohibited from representing the Sellers' Representative or
any Seller or such Seller's officers, directors, managers or Affiliates
("Seller Related Parties") in any dispute with any of the Purchaser Related
Parties arising from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of
Purchaser (on behalf of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties), the Sellers'
Representative and each Seller further agrees that no communications prior to
the Closing among Law Firm, the Acquired Companies and/or the Seller Related
Parties pertaining to any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that are subject to the attorney-client privilege (collectively, "Privileged
Materials") may be used as evidence by any Purchaser Indemnified Party in
connection with any Indemnification Claim made under Section 9, other than as
evidence of Fraud.

10.14. Sellers' Representative.

(a)At the Closing, each Seller agrees that Vista Equity Partners Management,
LLC shall be constituted and appointed as the Sellers' Representative.
Pursuant to the terms of the applicable Holdings Equity Agreement, each
Consideration Recipient will constitute and appoint Vista Equity Partners
Management, LLC, as the Sellers' Representative. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Sellers' Representative" shall mean the representative,
true and lawful agent, proxy and attorney in fact of the Consideration
Recipients for all purposes of this Agreement and the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Agreement, with full power and authority on such
Consideration Recipients' behalf (i) to consummate the transactions
contemplated herein, (ii) to pay such Consideration Recipients' expenses
(whether incurred on or after the date hereof) incurred in connection with the
negotiation and performance of this Agreement, (iii) to pay, receive, give
receipt and disburse any funds received hereunder on behalf of or to such
Consideration Recipients and to hold back from disbursement any such funds to
the extent it reasonably determines may be necessary, (iv) to execute and
deliver any certificates representing the Company Shares or Holdings Shares
and execution of such further instruments as Purchaser shall reasonably
request, (v) to execute and deliver on behalf of such Consideration Recipients
all documents contemplated herein and any amendment or waiver hereto, (vi) to
prepare, deliver and receive any notices on behalf of the Consideration
Recipients contemplated by this Agreement, (vii) to take all other actions to
be taken by or on behalf of the Consideration Recipients in connection
herewith, (viii) to negotiate, settle, compromise and otherwise handle all
disputes under this Agreement, including without limitation, disputes
regarding the Working Capital Amount and any adjustment pursuant to Section
1.5 and any Indemnification Claim made pursuant to Section 9.3(a)(ii), (ix) to
waive any condition to the obligation of Sellers to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein, (x) to give and receive notices on behalf of
the Consideration Recipients and (xi) to do each and every act and exercise
any and all rights which such Consideration Recipient is, or the Consideration
Recipients collectively are, permitted or required to do or exercise under
this Agreement. The Consideration Recipients, by approving the principal terms
of the Share Purchase, executing this Agreement or the Holdings Equity
Agreements and/or accepting the consideration payable to them hereunder or
thereunder, irrevocably grant unto said attorney-in-fact and agent full power
and authority to do and perform each and every act and thing necessary or
desirable to be done in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, as fully to all intents and purposes as the Consideration
Recipients might or could do in person. Each Consideration Recipient agrees
that such agency and proxy are coupled with an interest, are therefore
irrevocable without the consent of the Sellers' Representative and shall
survive the death, incapacity or bankruptcy of any Consideration Recipient.



(b)Each Consideration Recipient agrees that all decisions, actions, consents
and instructions of the Sellers' Representative shall be final and binding
upon all Consideration Recipients and no Consideration Recipient shall have
any right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. Each
Consideration Recipient agrees that neither the Sellers' Representative nor

Consideration Recipient relating to

the performance of its duties hereunder except for actions or omissions
constituting fraud, bad faith or willful misconduct. Each Consideration
Recipient agrees that the Sellers' Representative shall not have by reason of
this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Consideration
Recipient, except in respect of amounts actually received on behalf of such
Consideration Recipient. Each Consideration Recipient agrees that the Sellers'
Representative shall not be required to make any inquiry concerning either the
performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of
this Agreement.



(c) The Consideration Recipients shall cooperate with the Sellers'
Representative and any accountants, attorneys or other agents whom the
Sellers' Representative may retain to assist in carrying out Sellers'
Representative's duties hereunder. The Consideration Recipients shall
reimburse the Sellers' Representative for all costs and expenses, including
professional fees, incurred.



(d) In the event that the Sellers' Representative becomes unable to perform
the Sellers' Representative's responsibilities or resigns from such position,
the Sellers' Representative or one of its Affiliates shall provide 10 days'
advance written notice of such inability to perform or resignation to
Purchaser, and the Sellers holding, prior to the Closing, a majority of the
Company Shares shall select another representative to fill such vacancy and
such substituted representative shall (i) be deemed to be the Sellers'
Representative for all purposes of this Agreement and (ii) exercise the rights
and powers of, and be entitled to the indemnity, reimbursement and other
benefits of, the Sellers' Representative. Purchaser and its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Acquired Companies) shall be entitled to
rely at any time after receipt of any notice of such inability to perform or
resignation on the most recent notice so received.



(e) At the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver to the Sellers' Representative an
amount determined by the Sellers' Representative and set forth in the Closing
Consideration Spreadsheet (the "Sellers' Representative Expense Fund") to be
held in trust to cover and reimburse the fees and expenses incurred by the
Sellers' Representative for its obligations in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated herein. Purchaser shall deduct from the
consideration otherwise payable to each Seller pursuant to Section 1.2(a) or
to each Holdings Equityholder pursuant to the terms of the Holdings Equity
Agreements, such Consideration Recipient's Pro Rata Portion of the Sellers'
Representative Expense Fund. Any balance of the Sellers' Representative
Expense Fund not incurred for such purposes shall be returned by the Sellers'
Representative to the Sellers and the Holdings Equityholders as soon as
reasonably practicable after payment of the Sellers' Representative the amount
due to it from the Sellers' Representative Expense Fund. For Tax purposes,
each Seller agrees that such Seller's contribution to the Sellers'
Representative Expense Fund shall be treated as having been received and
voluntarily set aside by such Seller at the Closing.



(f) Purchaser and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Acquired
Companies) shall be entitled to rely on the appointment of the Sellers'
Representative and treat the Sellers' Representative as the duly appointed
attorney-in-fact of each Consideration Recipient and as having the duties,
power and authority provided for in this Agreement. None of Purchaser or its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Acquired Companies) shall be
liable to any Consideration Recipient for any actions or omissions by them in
reliance upon any instructions, notice or other instruments delivered by the
Sellers' Representative.

gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender
shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall

(b) Ambiguities. The parties hereto agree that any rule of construction to the
effect that ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall
not be applied in the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

separate counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original and all of
which, when taken together, shall constitute one agreement. The exchange of a
fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic

parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.



10.17. Remedies. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur
in the event that the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed by the parties hereto that each party shall be entitled to

of specific performance (x) prior to the Closing with respect to any covenant
or (y) after the Closing with respect to any covenant to be performed in whole
