# ARTICLE 1. 
  
 THE MERGER

  

## SECTION 1.01. _The Merger_.

  

### (a) At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.01(b) hereof), Merger
Sub shall be merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance
with the Delaware General Corporation Law ("Delaware Law"), whereupon the
separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall be the
surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). The Merger is sometimes
hereinafter referred to as the "Transaction."

     

   



  

### (b) On the Closing Date (as defined in Section 9.03), the Company and
Merger Sub will file a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware (the "Certificate of Merger") and make all other
filings or recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger.
The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger
is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and any
additional requirements of Delaware Law are complied with or at such later
time as is specified in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time").

  

### (c)  From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall possess all the assets, rights, privileges, powers and franchises and
be subject to all of the liabilities, restrictions, disabilities and duties
of the Company and Merger Sub, all as provided under Delaware Law.

  

## SECTION 1.02. _Conversion of Shares_.

  

### (a) At the Effective Time and by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holders thereof or any other Person:

  

#### (i) each share of common stock of the Company, $0.10 par value per share
("Company Common Stock"), and Series M Convertible Non-Voting Preferred Stock
of the Company ("Series M Preferred Stock") held by the Company as treasury
stock or owned by Parent or any subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the
Effective Time (collectively, the "Non-Converted Shares") shall be canceled,
and no payment shall be made with respect thereto;

  

#### (ii) subject to Section 1.02(b) and Section 1.03, each share of Company
Common Stock, and the associated preferred stock purchase right (the
"Rights"), and each share of Series M Preferred Stock (collectively, the
"Shares") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, except
as otherwise provided in clause (i) of this subsection, be converted into the
right to receive $42.00 in cash, without interest (the "Merger
Consideration").  As of the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such Shares
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such certificate in
accordance with Section 1.03 hereof; and

  

#### (iii) each share of common stock of Merger Sub, $0.01 par value per
share, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, $0.01 par value
per share.

  

### (b)  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and
to the extent available under Delaware Law, any Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by a stockholder (a
"Dissenting Stockholder") who has neither voted in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement nor consented thereto in writing and who has demanded properly
in

     

   

### writing appraisal for such Shares and otherwise properly perfected
and not withdrawn or lost his, her or its rights (the "Dissenting Shares"
and, together with the Non-Converted Shares, the "Excluded Shares") in
accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law will not be converted into, or
represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration.  Such Dissenting
Stockholders will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of
the Dissenting Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of such
Section 262, except that all Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who have
failed to perfect or who effectively have withdrawn or lost their rights to
appraisal of such Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware Law
will thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and represent the right
to receive, the Merger Consideration in the manner provided in Section
1.02(a)(ii) hereof and will no longer be Dissenting Shares. The Company will
give Parent prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to
applicable law received by the Company relating to stockholders rights of
appraisal.  The Company will give Parent the opportunity to participate in
and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands
for appraisal. The Company will not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisals of
Dissenting Shares, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any
withdrawal or other treatment of any such demands.

  

## SECTION 1.03. _Payment for Shares_.

  

### (a) As of the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub shall enter into an
agreement with a bank or trust company selected by Parent (which is
reasonably satisfactory to the Company) as paying agent for the Merger (the
"Paying Agent"), which shall provide that Parent shall deposit with the
Paying Agent as of the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of
Shares (other than Excluded Shares), for exchange in accordance with this
Article 1, through the Paying Agent, cash in an amount sufficient to make the
payments to the holders of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) contemplated
by Section 1.02(a)(ii) hereof (the "Payment Fund"). The Payment Fund shall
not be used for any purpose other than as provided in the immediately
preceding sentence. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent
as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall
be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any
agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of
the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or
P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which
are then publicly available).  Any net profit resulting from, or interest or
income produced by, such investments shall be property of and payable to
Parent, provided in the event of any losses due to the investment of the
Payment Fund, Parent shall be required to deposit such additional amounts as
may be required to ensure that the Payment

  

### 

     

   

### Fund is sufficient to make any and all payments contemplated by
Section 1.02(a)(ii) hereof.

  

### (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the
Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") whose shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 1.02(a)(ii) hereof, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of
a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably
be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (subject to the terms of Section
1.03(g)) an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration with respect to
each share of Company Common Stock represented by the Certificate so
surrendered, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
 In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares which is not registered
in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the Shares represented by such Certificate may be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered
is registered if such Certificate is properly endorsed or otherwise in proper
form for transfer and the Person requesting such issuance pays any transfer
or other taxes required by reason of the payment of such Merger Consideration
to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establishes to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.03, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration which
the holder thereof has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate
pursuant to the provisions of this Article 1. No interest shall be paid or
will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the
provisions of this Article 1.

  

### (c)  After the Effective Time, there will be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of
Shares that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Paying Agent, they will be cancelled
and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 1.03.

  

### (d)  Any portion of the Payment Fund which remains undistributed to
the holders of the Certificates for six months after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates who
have not

     

   

### theretofore complied with this Article 1 shall thereafter look only
to Parent for payment of their claims for Merger Consideration.

  

### (e)  Neither Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any
amount delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate shall not have been
surrendered prior to two years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior
to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity (as defined in
Section 3.05 hereof)), any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

  

### (f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount
as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration due to such person pursuant to this Agreement in respect
thereof.

  

### (g)  The Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall deduct and
withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of Shares or holder of Stock Options or Company Awards any amounts
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to such payments under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the "Code"), or any provision of state, local or
foreign law. Any amounts so deducted and withheld will be timely paid to the
applicable Governmental Entity and will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or holders of Stock
Options or Company Awards, as the case may be, in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

  

## SECTION 1.04. _Certain Adjustments_. If after the date hereof and on or
prior to the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
shall be changed into a different number, class or series of shares or any
other security by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization,
reorganization, merger, business combination, split-up, stock split,
combination or exchange of shares, or any dividend payable in stock or other
securities shall be declared thereon with a record date within such period,
or any similar event shall occur, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted to reflect such change; provided, however, that nothing contained
herein shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with
respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

     

   

## SECTION 1.05. _Stock Options and Company Awards_.

  

### (a) As of the Effective Time, each outstanding stock option to purchase
Company Common Stock (the "Stock Options"), whether granted under the
Companys 1995 Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan or the Companys
2005 Omnibus Stock Plan (collectively, the "Company Stock Option Plans") or
otherwise, shall be cancelled and terminated and the holder of such Stock
Option will, in full settlement of such Stock Option and in exchange for the
surrender to the Company of any certificate or other document evidencing such
Stock Option, receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount (subject to
Section 1.03(g)) in cash equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of
the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock of such Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Stock Option (with the aggregate amount of such
payment rounded down to the nearest whole cent). The holders of Stock
Options will have no further rights in respect of any Stock Options from and
after the Effective Time.

  

### (b) As of the Effective Time, each outstanding award (including
restricted stock, deferred stock, phantom stock, stock equivalents and stock
units), but excluding Stock Options (each a "Company Award"), under the
Company Stock Option Plans shall be cancelled and terminated and the holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive (subject to Section 1.03(g)) from the
Surviving Corporation an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration in
respect of each share of Company Common Stock represented thereby, without
interest. The holders of Company Awards will have no further rights in
respect of any such Company Award from and after the Effective Time.

  

### (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will adopt such resolutions
and will take such other actions as shall be required to effectuate the
actions contemplated by this Section 1.05, without paying any consideration
or incurring any debts or obligations on behalf of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, including, without limitation, accelerating
and causing the complete vesting, as of the Effective Time, of all Stock
Options and Company Awards.

  

# ARTICLE 2. 
  
 THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

  

## SECTION 2.01. _Certificate of Incorporation_. The certificate of
incorporation of Merger Sub in effect at the Effective Time shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until amended in
accordance with applicable law, except that the name set forth in such
certificate of incorporation shall be changed to Delta and Pine Land Company.

  

## SECTION 2.02. _Bylaws_. The bylaws of Merger Sub in effect at
the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
amended in accordance with applicable law.

or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. All outstanding shares of
capital stock of each Subsidiary are validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and are owned by the Company or another Subsidiary free and
clear of any liens, claims or encumbrances, except for any directors
qualifying shares.

documents (in the case of non-corporate entities) of any Subsidiary, each as

### (b) (i) Each Company Material Contract is valid and binding on the

Company Material Contract, except where such noncompliance would not,

default on the part of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any other
party thereto under any Company Material Contract, except where such default
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

or properties of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or, to the knowledge of
the Company, any predecessor thereof, will prevent continued compliance by
the Company or any Subsidiary with applicable Environmental and
Safety Requirements, give rise to any investigatory, removal, remedial or

## SECTION 3.12. _Taxes_.

  

### (a) Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, (i) the Company

foreign law).

  

### (c) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has constituted a

### (e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is required to make

## SECTION 3.13. _Employment Agreements_. There are no written employment,
consulting, severance, change of control or similar agreements between the
Company or any Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any directors, officers,
consultants or employees of the Company or any Subsidiary, on the other hand,
which provide for annual remuneration, severance payments, termination
indemnities or other payments in excess of $100,000.

  

## SECTION 3.14. _Change of Control Provisions_.

  

### (a) Except as disclosed in the Filed Company SEC Documents, as set forth
in the Company Disclosure Letter or as required under the terms of Section
1.05 of this Agreement, none of the agreements described in Section 3.13
hereof and none of the Plans and no compensation plan maintained by the
Company or any Subsidiary for the benefit of their respective current or
former employees, officers, directors or consultants contains any provision
that would entitle any such employee, officer, director or consultant to any
additional or accelerated payments or benefits as a result of
the consummation of the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

### (b) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to any agreement,
contract, arrangement or plan that has resulted or could result, separately
or in the aggregate, in the payment of any "excess parachute payment" within
the meaning of Section 280G of the Code (or any corresponding provision of
state, local or foreign law).

  

## SECTION 3.15. _Employee Benefit Plans_. All material employee benefit
plans within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), maintained by the Company or any
of the Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Plans") and any related trusts
and funding vehicles are in compliance with, and have been administered
and operated in accordance with, the terms of such Plans, related trusts
and funding vehicles and applicable law, except for any failure to so
comply, operate or administer such Plans and related trusts and funding
vehicles that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect. The Internal Revenue Service has issued a determination
letter to the effect that each such Plan which is intended to be "qualified"
within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and that its
related trust is tax exempt

     

   

## under Section 501(a) of the Code. No event which constitutes a
"reportable event" as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA has occurred and is
continuing with respect to any Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA which
presents a material risk of the termination or partial termination of any
such Plan or would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect. At any time in the past six years, no Plan and no plan maintained by
an ERISA Affiliate that is subject to Title IV of ERISA has been terminated
pursuant to Title IV of ERISA in connection with which any liability has been
incurred by the Company or any Subsidiary which has not been satisfied in
full. Full payment has been made, or provision has been made therefor, of all
material amounts which the Company or any of the Subsidiaries were required
under the terms of the Plans or applicable law to have paid as contributions
to such Plans on or prior to the date hereof and at any time during the past
six years no Plan which is subject to Part 3 of Subtitle B of Title I of
ERISA has incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency" (within the meaning
of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived.
Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has engaged in any nonexempt
prohibited transactions in connection with any Plan (or its related trust or
funding vehicle) with respect to which the Company, any of the Subsidiaries,
or any officer, director or employee of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries would be subject to either a penalty pursuant to Section 502(i)
of ERISA or a tax imposed by Section 4975 of the Code nor, to the knowledge
of the Company, will the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement constitute such a transaction which penalty or tax would,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.  Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any officer, director or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has incurred any
liability under the fiduciary provisions of ERISA, other than any
liability that would not individually, or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect. At any time in the past six years, no claim, action or
litigation has been made, commenced or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened with respect to any Plan or its related trust or funding vehicle
that would, if adversely determined, have (individually or in the aggregate)
a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any entity under
"common control" with the Company within the meaning of Section 414(b), (c),
(m) or (o) of the Code or Section 4001 of ERISA (an "ERISA Affiliate") has
participated in or contributed to any multiemployer plan as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA at any time during the past six years, and none of the
Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any "withdrawal liability" (as
defined in Part I of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA) at any time in the past
six years that has not been satisfied in full. With respect to each employee
pension benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) which is a defined
benefit plan and is not a multiemployer plan, the assets of such Plan
available to meet the accrued liabilities of such Plan would exceed
such liabilities, based on the actuarial assumptions used for plan
termination. There does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that
could result in, any Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries following the Closing that would,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. "Controlled
Group Liability" means any and all liabilities (i) under Title IV of ERISA,
(ii) under Section 302 of ERISA, (iii) under Sections 412 and 4971 of the
Code and (iv) as a result of a failure to comply with the continuation
coverage requirements of Section 601 et seq. of ERISA and Section 4980B of
the Code or the requirements of Section 701 et.seq. of ERISA, other than such
liabilities that, in each case, arise solely out of, or relate solely to the
Plans.

## SECTION 3.16. _Licenses_. The Company and its Subsidiaries have obtained
all federal, state, local or foreign governmental and regulatory permits,
concessions, grants, franchises, licenses, authorizations and approvals that
are necessary or required in connection with the conduct of the business as
now conducted of the Company and the Subsidiaries (collectively,
"Licenses"), except where the failure to so obtain any such License would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. All of
the Licenses are in full force and effect and, to the Companys knowledge,
will not be impaired or adversely affected by the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement in a manner or to a degree that, individually or in the
aggregate, would have a Material Adverse Effect.

  

## SECTION 3.17. _Real Estate Leases_. The Company Disclosure Letter sets
forth a list of all material leases and subleases existing as of the date
hereof (together with all amendments, supplements, nondisturbance agreements
and other agreements pertaining thereto) under which the Company or any
Subsidiary is lessor or lessee of any real property located in the
United States (the "U.S. Leases"). As to the U.S. Leases and the material
leases and subleases existing as of the date hereof under which the Company
or any Subsidiary is lessor or lessee of any real property that is not
located in the United States (the "Non-U.S. Leases" and, together with the
U.S. Leases, the "Company Leases"), except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, (a) there exists no breach or
default, and no event has occurred which with notice or passage of time (or
both) would constitute such a breach or default or permit termination,
notification or acceleration, on the part of the Company or any Subsidiary,
or on the part of any other party thereto, and (b) as of the Effective Time,
no third party consents, approval or authorizations shall be required for the
consummation of the Merger.  To the Companys knowledge, there is no lien,
claim, option, charge, security interest, limitation, encumbrance or
restriction of any kind (any of the foregoing being a "Lien") on any of the
leasehold interests covered by the Company Leases except for (a) Liens
reflected in the balance sheet included in the Company 10-K or any Company
10-Q, (b) Liens of record consisting of zoning or planning restrictions,
easements, permits and other restrictions or limitations on the use of real
property which do not materially detract from the value of, or a materially
impair the use of, such property by the Company and its Subsidiaries in the
operation of their respective businesses, (c) Liens for current taxes,
assessments or governmental charges or levies on property not yet delinquent
or being contested in good faith and for which appropriate reserves have been
established in accordance with GAAP (which contested levies are described in
the Company Disclosure Letter), (d) Liens imposed by law, such as
materialmans, mechanics, carriers, workers and repairmens Liens securing
obligations not yet delinquent or being contested in good faith and for which
appropriate reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP
or securing obligations not being paid in the ordinary course of business
in accordance with customary and commercially reasonable practice, and (e)
Liens that do not materially adversely affect the use or enjoyment of the
assets or properties of the Company or its Subsidiaries (collectively,
"Permitted Liens").

  

## SECTION 3.18. _Real Property_. The Company Disclosure Letter lists all
material real property owned by the Company or a Subsidiary thereof as of the
date hereof. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has good
title in fee simple to its respective real properties set

     

   

forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, in each case free and clear of all
Liens, except for Permitted Liens.

  

## SECTION 3.19. _Intellectual Property and Germplasm_.

  

### (a) The Company Disclosure Letter lists (i) all of the United States
patents, certificates of plant variety protection, registered trademarks,
registered service marks, registered copyrights or application for any of the
foregoing, in each case that are owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries as
of the date hereof (collectively, the "U.S. Intellectual Property" and,
together with (x) all of the patents, certificates of plant variety
protection, registered trademarks, registered service marks, registered
copyrights or application for any of the foregoing that are owned by the
Company or its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof (but excluding the US
Intellectual Property) and (y) all of the patents, certificates of plant

registered copyrights or application for any of the foregoing that are

Property that is material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole. In the case where the Companys or its Subsidiaries use of the
Intellectual Property is subject to a royalty payment in excess of $2,000,000
per annum (excluding royalty payments payable to Parent or any Affiliate
thereof), the material terms of such royalty payment are set forth in the
Company Disclosure Letter. To the knowledge of the Company, each item
of material Intellectual Property owned by the Company or a Subsidiary is
valid and enforceable, except as such enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or other laws

related to the performance of the Companys obligations in this Section
5.03(d).

  

### (e) As part of its investigation pursuant to Section 5.03(a), following
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent will continue to conduct
due diligence with respect to the compliance by the Company and its
Subsidiaries (which term for purposes of this Section 5.03(e) shall include
the Other Entities) with the FCPA, and the Company hereby agrees to fully
cooperate with such efforts (and to cause its Subsidiaries and
their respective employees, counsel and other representatives to fully
cooperate with such efforts). If Parent concludes that there is a possible
violation of the FCPA by the Company or any Subsidiary, Parent will so inform
the Company, and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to resolve
each such violation and any issues related thereto, including by disclosing
to the applicable Governmental Entity the existence or occurrence of any such
violation if, in the opinion of the Companys outside counsel, such
disclosure should be made.  In determining whether any non-compliance with
the FCPA by the Company or any Subsidiary is material, or has caused a
Material Adverse Change or Material Adverse Effect, the evaluation of such
determination will be based solely on the effect of such non-compliance on
the Company and its Subsidiaries and shall not be based upon the effect of
such non-compliance on Parent and its Affiliates. Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, the Companys failure to resolve
any violation or related issues in respect of the FCPA prior to the Closing
Date shall not result in a breach of the terms set forth in this Section
5.03(e), it being understood and agreed that the foregoing shall not affect
the conditions to the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the
Closing, including, without limitation, the conditions to Closing set forth
in Sections 8.01(d) and 8.01(f) hereof.

  

## SECTION 5.04. _No Solicitation_.

  

### (a) The Company agrees that, prior to the earlier of the Effective Time
or the termination of this Agreement, it shall not, and shall not authorize
or

     

   

### permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or its
Subsidiaries directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives,
directly or indirectly, to solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way
of furnishing or disclosing non-public information) any inquiries or the
making of any proposal with respect to any merger, consolidation or other
business combination involving the Company or any material Subsidiary or the
acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets or capital stock of the
Company or any material Subsidiary (an "Acquisition Transaction") or
negotiate, explore or otherwise engage in discussions with any Person (other
than Parent or its directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives), or enter into any agreement, with respect to any
Acquisition Transaction or enter into any agreement, arrangement or
understanding requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided
that the Company may, prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting,
in response to a bona fide unsolicited written proposal or written expression
of interest with respect to an Acquisition Transaction from a credible third
party that is not subject to any material financing uncertainties and that
the Companys Board of Directors determines, in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor, constitutes or could reasonably result in a Superior Proposal,
furnish or disclose non-public information to, and negotiate, explore or
otherwise engage in discussions with, such third party, provided that the
Company concurrently discloses any material non-public information to Parent
as it is disclosing to such third party if such non-public information has
not previously been disclosed to Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company may, prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, in
response to a bona fide unsolicited written proposal or written expression of
interest with respect to an Acquisition Transaction from a credible third
party that is not subject to any material financing uncertainties and that
the Companys Board of Directors determines, in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, and after
giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Parent as
contemplated by the immediately following proviso, constitutes a Superior
Proposal, enter into a definitive agreement with a third party in respect of
an Acquisition Transaction (provided that the Company shall concurrently with
entering into such agreement terminate this Agreement with the consequences
specified in Section 9.04(d) hereof); provided, however, that the Company
shall only be permitted to enter into any such agreement (and terminate this
Agreement as provided in Section 9.01(f) hereof in connection therewith) if:
(i) the Company shall (x) have delivered written notice thereof to
Parent, which written notice shall include the form of the agreement that is
to be entered into with such third party or a written summary of all of the
material provisions thereof and (y) have given Parent three business days
after delivery of such written notice (together with the other documents
required to be delivered in connection therewith) to propose revisions to the
terms of this Agreement (or make another proposal); and (ii) at the end of
such three business day period, the Companys Board of Directors shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisor, and in the exercise of its fiduciary duties, and after
giving effect to all of the adjustments

     

   

### which may be offered by Parent as contemplated hereby, if any, that such
agreement with such third party constitutes a Superior Proposal. As used
herein, the term "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written offer in
respect of an Acquisition Transaction that the Companys Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisor, is more favorable to the stockholders of the Company
than the Merger.

  

### (b) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its
and its Subsidiaries directors, officers, employees, agents or
representatives, to immediately cease any solicitations, discussions or
negotiations existing on the date of this Agreement with any Person
(other than the parties hereto) that has made or indicated an intention to
make a proposal in respect of an Acquisition Transaction.

  

### (c) After the date hereof, the Company shall reasonably promptly advise
Parent in writing of the receipt, directly or indirectly, of any inquiries or
proposals, and of its intention to enter into any agreement, relating to an
Acquisition Transaction and any actions taken pursuant to Section 5.04(a)
hereof and shall promptly furnish to Parent (and in any event within 24 hours
following the receipt thereof) either a copy of such proposal or a written
summary of all of the material terms of such proposal, and shall keep Parent
reasonably informed on a current basis (and in any event within 24 hours) of
the occurrence of any material changes, developments, discussions or
negotiations in respect of any of the foregoing.

  

## SECTION 5.05. _Employment and Noncompetition Agreements_.

  

### (a) As soon as practicable after the date hereof, the Company shall (i)
offer to the employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries whose names are
included in the list of the "Key Employee Group" set forth in the Company
Disclosure Letter, a Key Employee Employment Protection and Retention
Agreement in the form attached as an exhibit to the Company Disclosure Letter
and (ii) offer to the employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries whose
names are included in the list of the "Management Key Employee Group" set
forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, a Key Employee Employment Protection
and Retention Agreement in the form attached as an exhibit to the Company
Disclosure Letter.

  

### (b) As set forth in Section 3.07 and Section 3.08 of the Company
Disclosure Letter, prior to the Effective Time, the Company may enter into
employment, severance or change in control agreements with certain executives
and may pay a special cash award to employees.

## SECTION 6.02. _Indemnification_.

  

### (a)  Parent shall indemnify and shall cause the Surviving Corporation

"Indemnified Parties") from and against all losses, obligations, expenses,
claims, damages and liabilities arising in respect of actions taken prior to
and including the Effective Time in connection with their duties as directors
or officers of the Company (including the transactions contemplated hereby)
for a period of not less than six years from the Effective Time; provided
that (i) in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made within such
six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim
or claims shall continue until final disposition of any and all such claims
and (ii) neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be liable for any
settlement effected without Parents prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Without limitation of
the foregoing, in the event any Indemnified Party becomes involved in such
capacity in any action, proceeding or investigation in connection with any
matter, including the transactions contemplated hereby, occurring prior to
and including the Effective Time, Parent shall periodically reimburse and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to periodically reimburse such
Indemnified Party for his reasonable legal and other reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses (including the reasonable cost of any investigation and preparation)
incurred in connection therewith.

  

### (b)  For not less than six years after the Effective Time, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect directors and
officers liability insurance covering the Indemnified Parties who are
currently covered by the Companys existing directors and officers
liability insurance, on terms and conditions no less favorable to such
directors and officers than those in effect on the date hereof with respect
to Parents officers and directors.

  

## SECTION 6.03. _Operations After the Effective Time_. Parent currently
intends to maintain offices, facilities and operations of the Company at
their current locations. Parent looks forward to continuing the

Subsidiary in accordance with the terms thereof.  Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain and fund in accordance with ERISA, the Code
and any other applicable law for a period of two years after the Effective
Time employee benefit and compensation plans and arrangements which, in the
aggregate, provide benefits and compensation to employees of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries which are no less favorable in the aggregate
than those provided pursuant to the employee benefit and compensation plans
and arrangements in effect for such individuals on the date hereof. From and
after the Effective Time, if any employees of the Surviving Corporation or
any Subsidiary will participate in any employee benefit plan of Parent or any
of its subsidiaries, Parent will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, cause
such employee benefit plans to (i) recognize the service of the affected
employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries completed prior to the Effective
Time for participation, vesting and eligibility for early retirement under
such plans of Parent or any of its subsidiaries, but not for purposes of (a)
benefit accrual under any employee benefit plan (within the meaning of
Section 3(2) of ERISA) or (b) eligibility for subsidized retiree medical
benefits under any retiree medical plans maintained or sponsored by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) with respect to group health plans, waive
any pre-existing condition limitations or exclusions under such plans of
Parent or its subsidiaries. If the Closing Date occurs more than three months
after the end of the Companys last completed fiscal year, then the amount of
bonuses payable, if any, to each employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries who is eligible to participate in a bonus plan or
arrangement sponsored or maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
for the fiscal year of the Company that includes the Closing Date shall be
determined consistent with past practices of the Company and shall be payable
no later than November 15 of the fiscal year of the Surviving Corporation
next succeeding the fiscal year that includes the Closing Date.

shall prepare and file the Company Proxy Statement with the SEC.  The
Company will use all reasonable efforts to cause the Company Proxy

practicable after the Company Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC.  No
filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Company Proxy Statement will be
made by the Company without providing Parent with the opportunity to review

information relating to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by the

Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all material consents of third parties (which, in any

the Pre-Merger Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act with the
Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the "Antitrust Division") (collectively the "Antitrust
Authorities") and, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Section 7.07, shall use their best efforts to respond as fully and as
promptly as practicable to all inquiries received from the FTC or the
Antitrust Division for additional information or documentation prior to the
issuance of a Request for Additional Information under the HSR Act (a "Second
Request").

     

   



  

### (b) In the event the Antitrust Division or the FTC issues a Second
Request, the parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to
substantially comply with the Second Request as promptly as practicable (and
in any event, the Company shall substantially comply with a Second Request no

### (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, and subject to
the terms set forth in this Section 7.07, each party shall cooperate and
consult with the other party in connection with the actions referenced in

party of (and, if in writing, supply such party with) any communication (or
other correspondence or other memoranda) to that party from the
Antitrust Division, the FTC, any State Attorney General or any other
Governmental Entity, and permit the other party to review in advance and
accept all of the other partys reasonable comments, in connection with, any
proposed written communication to any of the foregoing; (iii) to the extent
practical, not participate in any substantive meeting or any material
discussion or communication with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filings, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the Merger,
unless it consults with the other party in advance and, as permitted by such
Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat, or to the extent prior consultation is not practical,
shall promptly report to the other party the substance of the communication;
(iv) furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings, and
written communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof)
between them and their Affiliates and their respective representatives on the
one hand, and any Governmental Entities or their respective staffs on the
other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger; and (v) make
available such partys respective counsel, experts, and advisors to (and have
such persons participate with) the other party, and its respective counsel,
experts, and advisors for the purpose of (and in connection with) the actions

### (d) Other than as provided elsewhere in this Section 7.07, Parent shall
take such reasonable best efforts to ensure that (x) no requirement for a
waiver, consent or approval of the FTC, the Antitrust Division, any State
Attorney General or other Governmental Entity, (y) no decree, judgment,
injunction, temporary restraining order or any other order in any suit or
proceeding, and (z) no other matter relating to any Antitrust Law, would
preclude consummation of the Merger by the Outside Date, including promptly
offering to divest:

  

#### (i) the United States cotton seed business acquired by Parent in 2005,
including the Stoneville® and NexGen® brands, along

     

   

#### with substantially all the United States assets acquired in
that transaction, or to the extent those assets no longer exist or exist in
a different form, substantially equivalent assets; and

  

#### (ii) a license to Parents currently commercialized cotton traits (i.e.,
the traits marketed under the following trademarks: Roundup Ready®, Roundup
Ready® Flex, Bollgard® and Bollgard® II) on terms with respect to financial
terms and stacking rights at least as favorable as contained in any existing
commercial license to those traits.

  

In an effort to ensure that no requirement for a waiver, consent or approval
of the FTC, the Antitrust Division, any State Attorney General or other
Governmental Entity, no decree, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining
order or any other order in any suit or proceeding, and no other matter
relating to any Antitrust Law, would preclude consummation of the Merger by
the Outside Date, Parent shall defend through litigation on the merits any
claim asserted in any court by any Person, and in the event of
such litigation, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with Parent in such litigation.

  

### (e)  If, on or before the date that is six (6) months following the date
of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the condition to Closing
set forth in Section 8.01(b) hereof has not been satisfied, the Outside Date
shall automatically be extended up to, but not beyond, six (6) months, solely
for the purpose of Parent satisfying its obligations under Section 7.07(d).

  

### (f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, including
Section 7.07(d), in the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
(i) Section 9.01(b) and at such time the conditions to Closing set forth in
Section 8.01(b) or 8.01(c) have not been satisfied (in the case of Section
8.01(c), due to any statute, rule, regulation, temporary restraining order,
preliminary or permanent injunction or other order or legal restraint, in
each case relating to antitrust or competition matters) or (ii) Section
9.01(c) due to any law, regulation, judgment, injunction, order or decree
relating to antitrust or competition matters, and in either case, the Merger
has not been consummated, then within five business days following such
termination, Parent shall pay to the Company in cash via wire transfer of
immediately available federal funds an aggregate amount equal to $600,000,000
(the "Antitrust Termination Payment") and upon making such payment, the
Litigation shall be terminated and extinguished in all respects and the
parties hereto shall promptly take (or, if applicable, cause to be taken) any
and all actions as may be required to dismiss the Litigation with prejudice.
Payment of the Antitrust Termination Payment shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Company for any breach by Parent of this Section 7.07. For the
avoidance of doubt, upon the payment of the Antitrust Termination Payment
pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph, Parent shall not have any
other obligation to the Company under this Agreement.

     

   



  

## SECTION 7.08. _Confidentiality_. The Confidentiality Agreement will remain
in full force and effect until its expiration in accordance with the
terms thereof.

  

## SECTION 7.09. _Litigation Stay_. Upon the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by all of the parties hereto, and until the earlier to occur
of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of Article 9
hereof and the Closing Date, and subject to the rights of the parties hereto
in respect of the Litigation as further provided in Article 9 hereof, each
party shall take all steps necessary to obtain (a) from the Mississippi
Supreme Court a continuance of up to twelve months of any hearing on, or
decision in, _Delta and Pine Land Company v. Monsanto Company, et al_ ,
No. 05-M-00015-SCT consolidated with No. 05-M-00016-SCT (the "Supreme Court
Case") and (b) to the extent necessary, from the Circuit Court of the First
Judicial District of Bolivar County a stay of _Delta and Pine Land Company
v. Monsanto Company, et al_ , Civil Action No. 2000-1 (the "Lower Court Case"
and, together with the Supreme Court Case, the "Litigation"). Without limiting
the foregoing, prior to the earlier to occur of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Article 9 hereof and the Closing Date, Parent
and the Company shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates not
to, prosecute any claims they may have in respect of or otherwise pursue the
Litigation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the parties are
unable to obtain (or attain the maintenance of) such stay or continuance from
any court with jurisdiction to grant such stay or continuance, including the
Mississippi Supreme Court and, to the extent applicable, the Circuit Court of
the First Judicial District of Bolivar County, then the parties shall (i)
take all steps necessary to obtain a dismissal of the Litigation without
prejudice with leave to refile in (and only in) the same forum, (ii) consent
to such refiling, (iii) waive, and not assert, any applicable statute of
limitations or defense (whether in equity or otherwise) relating to the
passage of time caused by any such dismissal or the non-pursuit of claims or
counterclaims as of the date hereof through the termination of this Agreement
or failure to prosecute caused by any such dismissal or the non-pursuit of
claims or counterclaims as of the date hereof through the termination of this
Agreement and (iv) waive, and not assert, any defense relating to or arising
out of the parties conduct in connection with negotiating or attempting to
implement this Agreement.

to Section 9.01(d)(ii) hereof or (ii) by the Company pursuant to Section
9.01(f) hereof (each, a "Topping Offer Termination Event"), then
contemporaneously with the termination of this Agreement by the Company or
Parent, as applicable, upon the occurrence of such Topping Offer Termination

taken) any and all actions as may be required to dismiss the Litigation with

hereof (a "Company Covenant Termination Event"), then contemporaneously with
the termination of this Agreement by Parent upon the occurrence of such
Company Covenant Termination Event, the Litigation shall be terminated and
extinguished in all respects and the parties hereto shall promptly take (or,
if applicable, cause to be taken) any and all actions as may be required to
dismiss the Litigation with prejudice.

  

### (f) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company or
Parent other than in connection with a termination which would give rise to
an obligation to make the Antitrust Termination Payment or a Parent Covenant
Termination Event, a Stand-Alone Fiduciary Termination Event, a Topping Offer
Termination Event or a Company Covenant Termination Event, then, effective
upon the effective date of any such termination, (i) the obligations of the
parties under the terms of Section 7.09 hereof to obtain and maintain a
continuance or stay, as applicable, in respect of the Litigation and
otherwise not to prosecute or pursue any claims in respect of the Litigation
shall terminate and (ii) the parties hereto shall be permitted to pursue any
and all rights and remedies that they may have in respect of the Litigation
(including, if applicable, re-instituting all or any portion of the
Litigation that was dismissed without prejudice in accordance with the terms
of Section 7.09 hereof), which rights and remedies shall expressly survive
any such termination; provided, however, that in the event that this
Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to (x) Section 9.01(g) hereof due
to the fact that the Company has breached any of its representations or
warranties contained in this Agreement or (y) Section 9.01(b) hereof and
the condition to closing set forth in Section 8.01(f) hereof is not satisfied

in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be

enter into an agreement to jointly assign their respective rights and
obligations under this Agreement, in whole but not in part, to any Person

Closing, all of the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement
and, upon, but not prior to, the Closing, including without limitation, the

## SECTION 10.06. _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury
Trial_.

  

### (a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by

or proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in

hereto agrees that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any
such action or proceeding in the manner provided in Section 10.01 or in such
other manner as may be permitted by applicable laws, will be valid and
sufficient service thereof. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for itself and in

jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any
action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in any court or tribunal other than the aforesaid courts. Each
of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by
way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
respect of this Agreement and the rights and 

     

   

### obligations arising hereunder (i) any claim that it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other
than the failure to serve process in accordance with this Section 10.06(b),
(ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction
of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether
through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the
fullest extent permitted by the applicable law, any claim that (x) the suit,
action or proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (y)
the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (z) this
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such
courts.

  

### (c) Each party acknowledges and agrees that any controversy which may
arise under this Agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult
issues and, therefore, each such party irrevocably and unconditionally waives
any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any legal action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Each party to this Agreement certifies and acknowledges
that (i) no representative of any other party has represented, expressly or
otherwise, that such other party would not seek to enforce the foregoing

to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

  

## SECTION 10.11. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement are
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision will

the validity or enforceability of that provision, or the application of

been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this

authority or ability to cause the Subsidiary to do or take such action under
the organization documents of such Subsidiary, or any agreement between the
