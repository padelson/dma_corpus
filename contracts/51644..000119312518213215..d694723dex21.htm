the Company, become the owner of all of the equity interests of the Company
(the " _Holdco Merger_ "), pursuant to the terms and conditions as set forth
in a merger agreement in a form to be mutually agreed between Seller and
Purchaser (the " _Holdco Merger Agreement_ ");

WHEREAS, immediately after the consummation of the Holdco Merger and prior to
Closing, the Company shall be converted into a limited liability company
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware pursuant to Section 266 of

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Seller, the Company and LiveRamp are entering into a Master Contribution and
Assumption Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_
(the " _Contribution Agreement_ "), pursuant to which the Company and LiveRamp
will complete a restructuring related to Seller, the Company, the Business

and conditions of the Contribution Agreement);

 

WHEREAS, Seller will, upon the completion of the Holdco Merger and the LLC
Conversion, and immediately prior to the Closing, own all of the Membership

approved this Agreement and the Transactions, (ii) determined that this
Agreement is expedient and for the best interests of each of Seller and the
Company and its stockholders and (iii) resolved, subject to the terms of this
Agreement, to recommend that the stockholders of each of Seller and the

-1- NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

PURCHASE AND SALE OF MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS

1.01 _Holding_ _Company_ _Merger and Conversion_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
after the receipt of the approval of the stockholders of the Company for the
Holdco Merger, (a) the Company shall cause Seller and a Subsidiary of Seller
(" _Holdco Sub_ ") to complete the Holdco Merger, pursuant to which Holdco Sub
shall merge with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of
Holdco Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation of the Holdco Merger and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Seller and
(b) promptly following the Holdco Merger, Seller shall cause the Company to
consummate the LLC Conversion, following which the Company shall be a wholly
owned Subsidiary of Seller that is disregarded from Seller for U.S. income Tax
purposes. The parties hereto shall treat the LLC Conversion, when taken
together with the Holdco Merger, as a "reorganization" pursuant to Section
368(a)(1)(F) of the Code for U.S. federal (and applicable state and local)
income Tax purposes unless otherwise required by a "determination" within the
meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any similar provision of
applicable Law).

(b) With respect to any rights or obligations applicable to Seller prior to
the Closing in this Agreement, such rights, covenants or agreements shall be
exercisable by (or applicable to) the Company prior to the Holdco Merger,
applied _mutandis mutatis_ , unless the context otherwise requires.
With respect to any rights or obligations applicable to the Company prior to
the Closing in this Agreement, such rights, covenants or agreements shall be
exercisable by (or applicable to) Seller after the Holdco Merger, applied
_mutandis mutatis_ , unless the context otherwise requires.

1.02 _Purchase and Sale of Membership Interest_ _s_. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing,
Purchaser shall purchase from Seller, and Seller shall sell, assign, transfer
and deliver to Purchaser, the Membership Interests, free and clear of all
Encumbrances. At the Closing, in consideration for the purchase of the
Membership Interests, Purchaser shall pay in cash to Seller (a) $2,300,000,000
(the " _Base Purchase Price_ "), _plus_ or _minus_ (b) the Estimated Closing
Adjustment Amount (the " _Estimated Purchase Price_ "). The Estimated
Purchase Price shall be adjusted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.03_ (as so
adjusted, the " _Purchase Price_ ").

 



-2- 1.03 _Purchase Price Adjustments_.

 

(a) _Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount_. At least five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a
statement certified by the Chief Financial Officer of Seller (solely in his
capacity as the Chief Financial Officer of Seller and not in an individual
capacity) (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ") setting forth Sellers good
faith estimate of, as of 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time on the day prior to the
Closing (assuming full completion of the Separation), (i) the Net Working
Capital (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ "), (ii) the amount of Cash
(such estimated amount of Cash, the " _Estimated Cash_ "), (iii) the amount of
Debt (the " _Estimated Debt_ ") and (iv) the amount of Transaction Expenses
(the " _Estimated Transaction Expenses_ "), along with reasonable supporting
documentation with respect to the calculation of such amounts. Purchaser shall
have a reasonable opportunity to review the Estimated Closing Statement with
Representatives of Seller and shall have reasonable access to the personnel
and the books and records of the Business Subsidiaries used in preparing the
Estimated Closing Statement. Seller shall consider in good faith revising the
Estimated Closing Statement to appropriately address any comments made by
Purchaser. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no
event shall the delivery of the Estimated Closing Statement contemplated
hereby or any comments thereto provided by Purchaser be deemed to constitute
the agreement of Purchaser to any of the estimates or amounts set forth
therein or be construed as a waiver by Purchaser of any provisions, rights or
privileges hereunder. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Estimated
Closing Adjustment Amount_ " means the amount (positive or negative) equal to
(A) (x) if the Estimated Net Working Capital is greater than the Target
Working Capital by more than the Closing Adjustment Threshold, the amount by
which the Estimated Net Working Capital is greater than the sum of the Target
Working Capital and the Closing Adjustment Threshold, (y) if the Estimated Net
Working Capital is neither greater than nor less than the Target Working
Capital by the amount of the Closing Adjustment Threshold, zero, and (z) if
the Estimated Net Working Capital is less than the Target Working Capital by
more than the Closing Adjustment Threshold, a negative number equal to the
amount by which the Estimated Net Working Capital is less than the result of
the Target Working Capital minus the Closing Adjustment Threshold, _plus_ (B)
the Estimated Cash, _minus_ (C) the Estimated Debt, _minus_ (D) the Estimated
Transaction Expenses. If the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount is a
positive number, the Estimated Purchase Price shall be calculated by adding
the amount of the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount to the Base Purchase
Price on a dollar-for-dollar basis pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.02_. If the
Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount is a negative number, the Estimated
Purchase Price shall be calculated by subtracting the absolute value of the
amount of the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount from the Base Purchase Price
on a dollar-for-dollar basis pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.02_. The
Estimated Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the
accounting principles, practices, procedures, policies and methods set forth
on _Exhibit B_ (the " _Accounting Principles_ ").

(b) _Post-Closing Statement_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Closing Date (but not later than ninety (90) days thereafter), Purchaser will
prepare and deliver to Seller a statement (the " _Post-Closing Statement_ ")
setting forth, as of 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time on the day prior to the Closing
(assuming full completion of the Separation), (i) the Net Working Capital (the
" _Closing Net Working Capital_ "), (ii) the amount of Cash (such amount of
Cash, the " _Closing Cash_ "), (iii) the amount of Debt (the " _Closing Debt_
") and (iv) the amount of Transaction Expenses (the " _Closing Transaction
Expenses_ "), along with reasonable supporting documentation with respect to
the calculation of such amounts. The Post-Closing Statement shall be prepared
in accordance with the Accounting Principles. In preparation of the Post-
Closing Statement, Purchaser and its Representatives shall have the access
afforded to them pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.10(b)_.

 



-3- (c) _Dispute Notice_. In its review of the Post-Closing Statement, Seller and
its Representatives shall have the access afforded to them pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 6.10(b)_. The Post-Closing Statement shall be binding and
conclusive upon, and deemed accepted by, Seller unless Seller shall have
notified Purchaser in writing (the " _Dispute Notice_ ") of any objections
thereto consistent with the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 1.03(c)_ within
forty-five (45) calendar days after the delivery of the Post-Closing
Statement to Seller. The Dispute Notice shall specify in reasonable detail
each item on the Post-Closing Statement that Seller disputes and Sellers
calculation of each such item. Any item not included as disputed in such
notice shall be deemed accepted by Seller and Purchaser.

(d) _Disputes_. Disputes between Purchaser and Seller relating to the Post-
Closing Statement that cannot be resolved by Purchaser and Seller within
fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt by Purchaser of the Dispute Notice,
or such longer period as Seller and Purchaser shall mutually agree in writing,
may be submitted, by notice from Seller or Purchaser to the other, for
resolution to a nationally recognized independent accounting firm to be
mutually selected and retained jointly by Purchaser and Seller (the "
_Independent Accounting Firm_ "). Each of Purchaser and Seller shall submit
to the Independent Accounting Firm (with a copy delivered to the other party
on the same day), within ten (10) Business Days after the date of engagement
of the Independent Accounting Firm, a memorandum (which may
include supporting exhibits) setting forth its respective position on any
disputed items. Each of Purchaser and Seller may (but shall not be required
to) submit to the Independent Accounting Firm (with a copy delivered to the
other party on the same day), within forty-five (45) days after the date of
the engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm, a memorandum responding to
the initial memorandum submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm by the
other party. Unless requested by the Independent Accounting Firm in writing,
no party hereto may present any additional information or arguments to the
Independent Accounting Firm, either orally or in writing. During the review by
the Independent Accounting Firm, Purchaser and Seller and their respective
accountants will each make available to the Independent Accounting Firm such
personnel, and such information, books and records and work papers and
otherwise cooperate in good faith with the Independent Accounting Firm, as
may be reasonably required by the Independent Accounting Firm to fulfill its
obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 1.03(d)_; _provided,_ _however_ , that
the accountants of Seller or Purchaser shall not be obliged to make any work
papers available to the Independent Accounting Firm, except in accordance with
such accountants normal disclosure procedures and then only after the
Independent Accounting Firm has signed a customary agreement relating to such
access to work papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such
accountants.

(e) _Independent Accounting Firm_ __ _s Determination_. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall be directed to apply the terms of the
Accounting Principles and the definitions of Cash, Net Working Capital, Debt
and Transaction Expenses herein. Promptly, but no later than ninety (90) days
after its acceptance of its appointment as the Independent Accounting Firm,
Purchaser and Seller shall direct the Independent Accounting Firm to
determine, based solely on the written submissions of Purchaser and Seller
and the terms of this Agreement and not by independent review, those items in
dispute on the Post-Closing Statement and shall render a written report as to
the resolution of each dispute and the resulting calculation of the Final
Closing Adjustment Amount. Any such determination of an item in dispute shall
be (i) with

 



-4-  respect to Cash and Current Assets, neither lower than the amount specified
by Purchaser in the Post-Closing Statement nor higher than the amount
specified by Seller in the Dispute Notice and (ii) with respect to Current
Liabilities, Debt and Transaction Expenses, neither higher than the amount
specified by Purchaser in the Post-Closing Statement nor lower than the amount
specified by Seller in the Dispute Notice. The Independent Accounting Firm
shall have exclusive jurisdiction over, and resort to the Independent
Accounting Firm as provided in this _Section_ __ _ 1.03(e)_ shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of the parties hereto against one another or any other
Person with respect to, any disputes arising out of or relating to the Post-
Closing Statement and shall be enforceable in a court of law. The substance of
the Independent Accounting Firms determination shall not be subject to
review or appeal, absent manifest error in the application of this _Section_
__ _ 1.03(e)_. The fee of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne by
Purchaser and Seller in the same proportion that (x) the unresolved claims
so submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm are unsuccessfully disputed
by such party (as finally determined by the Independent Accounting Firm) bears
to (y) the total amount of such unresolved claims so submitted to the
Independent Accounting Firm.

(f) _Final Closing Adjustment Amount_. The Post-Closing Statement shall become
final and binding upon Purchaser and Seller upon the earliest of (i) the
failure by Seller to object thereto within the period permitted under, and
otherwise in accordance with the requirements of, _Section_ __ _ 1.03(c)_ (it
being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that Seller and Purchaser shall
be deemed to have agreed upon all items and amounts that are not disputed by
Seller in the Dispute Notice), (ii) the written agreement between Purchaser
and Seller with respect thereto and (iii) the decision by the Independent
Accounting Firm with respect to disputes under _Section_ __ _ 1.03(c)_. The
Post-Closing Statement, as deemed to be agreed pursuant to clause (i) above,
or as adjusted pursuant to the written agreement of Purchaser and Seller or
the decision of the Independent Accounting Firm, when final and binding, is
referred to herein as the " _Final Post-Closing Statement_." The " _Final
Closing Adjustment Amount_ " determined using the Final Post-Closing
Statement means the amount (positive or negative) equal to (A) (x) if the
Closing Net Working Capital is greater than the Target Working Capital by more
than the Closing Adjustment Threshold, the amount by which the Closing Net
Working Capital is greater than the sum of the Target Working Capital and the
Closing Adjustment Threshold, (y) if the Closing Net Working Capital is
neither greater than nor less than the Target Working Capital by the amount of
the Closing Adjustment Threshold, zero, and (z) if the Closing Net Working
Capital is less than the Target Working Capital by more than the Closing
Adjustment Threshold, a negative number equal to the amount by which the
Closing Net Working Capital is less than the result of the Target Working
Capital minus the Closing Adjustment Threshold, _plus_ (B) the Closing Cash,
_minus_ (C) the Closing Debt, _minus_ (D) the Closing Transaction Expenses.
The Estimated Purchase Price shall be (1) decreased by the amount, if any, by
which the Final Closing Adjustment Amount is less than the Estimated Closing
Adjustment Amount, or (2) increased by the amount, if any, by which the Final
Closing Adjustment Amount is greater than the Estimated Closing Adjustment
Amount. The adjustment to the Estimated Purchase Price provided for in this
_Section_ __ _ 1.03(f)_ is referred to as the " _Purchase Price Adjustment_."

 

(g) _Payment of Purchase Price Adjustment_. If the Purchase Price Adjustment
is a positive number, Purchaser shall, within five (5) Business Days after
the Final Closing Adjustment Amount is determined and the Final Post-Closing
Statement becomes final and binding, pay or cause to be paid, to Seller cash
in the amount of such Purchase Price Adjustment. 

 



-5-  If the Purchase Price Adjustment is a negative number, Seller shall, within
five (5) Business Days after the Final Closing Adjustment Amount is determined
and the Final Post-Closing Statement becomes final and binding, pay or cause
to be paid, to Purchaser cash in the amount of such Purchase Price Adjustment.
If the Purchase Price Adjustment is equal to zero, no payment shall be made in
respect of the Purchase Price Adjustment. 

(h) _Effect of Delayed Transfers_. The Purchase Price shall be paid assuming
that the Delayed Transfer Assets are contributed, assigned, transferred,
conveyed and delivered and that the Delayed Transfer Liabilities are assumed,
in each case in accordance with the terms of the Contribution Agreement, and
the Purchase Price shall not be adjusted in any manner in respect of the
Delayed Transfer Assets or Delayed Transfer Liabilities.

(i) _Payments as Adjustment to Purchase Price_. Payments made under 
_Section_ __ _ 1.03(g)_ shall be adjustments to the Purchase Price for all
purposes.

1.04 _Withholding_. Purchaser and each of its Affiliates shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under any applicable Tax Law. To the
extent that Purchaser determines that any such withholding is required with
respect to any payment hereunder, Purchaser shall notify Seller no less than
ten (10) Business Days prior to making such payment, and Purchaser and Seller
shall cooperate in good faith to take such commercially reasonable actions as
may be necessary to minimize any such withholding. To the extent that any
amounts are deducted or withheld pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 1.04_,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

 

1.05 _Company Purchase Price Allocation_.

 

(a) Purchaser and Seller agree that the acquisition of the Membership
Interests contemplated by this Agreement will be treated as a purchase of the
assets of the Company for U.S. federal income Tax purposes. Purchaser and
Seller agree to allocate, and, as applicable, to cause their applicable
Affiliates to allocate, the Company Purchase Price among the assets of the
Company and any other relevant assets acquired (or deemed acquired for U.S.

disputed items with respect to the Purchasers Allocation before the due date
for an applicable Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be filed as prepared in a
manner that reflects the Purchasers Allocation and then amended to the extent
necessary to reflect the Independent Accounting Firms determination. The
Company Purchase Price Allocation shall be adjusted as necessary and
appropriate to reflect any payments treated as an adjustment to the purchase
price for Tax purposes.

conditions of the Commitment Letter, assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions to Purchasers obligations to consummate the Closing, the aggregate
proceeds to be disbursed pursuant to the agreements

 



-35-  contemplated by the Commitment Letter (after netting out applicable fees,
expenses, original issue discounts and similar premiums and charges provided

pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letter.

(c) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the consummation of the Debt Financing shall not
be a condition to the obligation of Purchaser to consummate the Transactions.

4.11  _Investigation by Purchaser_. Purchaser has conducted its own
independent review and analysis of the businesses, assets, condition,
operations and prospects of the Business Subsidiaries and the Business and
acknowledges that it has been provided access to the properties, premises and
records of the Business Subsidiaries and the Business for this purpose. In
entering into this Agreement, Purchaser has relied solely upon its own
investigation and analysis, and Purchaser acknowledges that, except for the
representations and warranties of Seller expressly set forth in _Article III_
and the other Transaction Documents, none of Seller nor any of its
Representatives makes, and Purchaser has not relied on, any representation
or warranty, either express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of
any of the information provided or made available to Purchaser or any of its
Representatives. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except for
the representations and warranties made by Seller in _Article III_ or the
other Transaction Documents, none of Seller nor any of its Representatives or
any other Person has made, and Purchaser has not relied on, a representation
or warranty to Purchaser with respect to (a) any projections, estimates or
budgets of future results or future financial condition relating to Seller,
any of the Business Subsidiaries or the Business or (b) any material,
documents or information relating to Seller, the Business Subsidiaries or the
Business made available to Purchaser or its Representatives in any "data room"

ARTICLE VI

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

6.01 _Reasonable Efforts to Complete_. Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, each of the Company, Seller and Purchaser will cooperate with
each other and use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with each other in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable
to (a) consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby as
soon as practicable, (b) cause the conditions to the consummation of the
Closing set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 2.02_ to be satisfied and (c) obtain or
deliver all Consents of all Governmental Authorities and Third Parties that
may be or become necessary, proper or advisable for the performance of its and
the other partys obligations pursuant to this Agreement and the consummation
of the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, none of
Purchaser, Seller nor any of their Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any
consent or other similar fee, "profit sharing" or other similar payment or
other consideration, or provide additional security (including a guaranty) to
obtain the Consent of any Person under any Contract and any such payments
shall not constitute

 



-40-  Transaction Expenses; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser may request in
writing that the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries pay any such fee or
payment, in which case any such fee or payment paid by Seller shall not
constitute Transaction Expenses and shall be excluded from any adjustments to
the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.03_. For the avoidance of
doubt, obtaining the Consents described in the first sentence of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.01_ (including paying any fee or payment requested by
Purchaser) __ is not a condition to the consummation of the Closing by virtue
of this _Section_ __ _ 6.01_.

 

6.02 _Regulatory and Other_ _Approvals_.

 

(a) Each of the Company, Seller and Purchaser shall use its reasonable best
efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with
any filing or submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any inquiry,
investigation or Action initiated by a Governmental Authority or a private
Person, and (ii) keep the other party hereto informed in all material respects
and on a reasonably timely basis of any communication received by such party
from, or given by such party to, any Governmental Authority and of any
communication received or given by a private Person in connection with any
inquiry, investigation or Action, in each case regarding any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each of the Company, Seller and Purchaser shall
consult and cooperate with the other party hereto in connection with any
analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or
proposal to be made or submitted in connection with any such inquiry,
investigation or Action. In addition, the Company, Seller and Purchaser shall
permit counsel for the other party reasonable opportunity to review in
advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection
with, any proposed written communication to any Governmental Authority. Each
of the Company, Seller and Purchaser agrees not to participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the
extent not prohibited by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party
the opportunity to attend and participate. Neither the Company, Seller nor
Purchaser shall consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline
or waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or withdraw its notification and
report form pursuant to the HSR Act or any other filing made pursuant to any
Antitrust Law unless the other party has given its prior written consent to
such extension or delay, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. Purchaser and Seller may, as each deems proper, necessary or
advisable, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other under this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ as "outside counsel only." Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless
express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials or
its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_
__ _ 6.02_, materials provided to the other party or its outside counsel may
be redacted to remove references concerning the valuation, pricing and
other competitively sensitive terms from an antitrust perspective in the
Contracts of Purchaser, Seller and their respective Subsidiaries.

 



-41- (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the
Company, Seller and Purchaser (i) agrees to (x) make an appropriate filing of
a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
Sale as promptly as reasonably practicable and in any event, unless otherwise
agreed by Seller and Purchaser, within fifteen (15) Business Days after the
date hereof, (y) effect all other necessary notifications or registrations
under the Antitrust Laws as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date
hereof, and (z) supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR
Act or in connection with any other filing under the Antitrust Laws and use
their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other
actions consistent with this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ necessary to obtain all
Consents under any Antitrust Law as soon as practicable and (ii) shall use
their reasonable best efforts to (x) take all action necessary to ensure that
no state takeover statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (y) if any state takeover
statute or similar Law becomes applicable to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (with respect to Purchasers obligations under this clause (b),
to the extent caused by the actions of Purchaser), take all action necessary
to ensure that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise minimize the effect of such Law on the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(c) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under the Antitrust Laws of any applicable jurisdictions
or if any Action is instituted or threatened by any Governmental Authority or
any private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as
violative of the Antitrust Laws of any applicable jurisdictions, each of
the Company, Seller and Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to
promptly resolve such objections and Actions. In furtherance of the foregoing,
Purchaser, at Purchasers sole cost, shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
use reasonable best efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment
and obtain all Consents under any Antitrust Law that may be required by any
Governmental Authority (and to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of or vacate or lift, any Governmental Order, that would
otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the
consummation of the Closing) so as to enable Purchaser and Seller to
consummate the Closing as promptly as practicable, and in any event before
the Outside Date, including committing to or effecting, by consent decree,
hold separate orders, trust, or otherwise, (i) the sale or disposition of, or
prohibition or limitation on the ownership or operation by Purchaser and the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries of specific assets or
categories of assets or businesses; (ii) the amendment or termination of
existing contracts, licenses or other relationships; (iii) the entering into
of new contracts, licenses or other relationships; and (iv) behavioral
commitments limiting or modifying Purchasers or any of its Affiliates rights
of ownership in, or ability to conduct the business of, one or more of its
operations, divisions, businesses, product lines or assets. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
commit to or effect any such action that is not conditioned upon the
substantially concurrent consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and shall not effect or commit to effect any such action without
Purchasers prior written consent. Further, and for the avoidance of doubt,
Purchaser will use reasonable best efforts in order to ensure that (x)
no requirement for any non-action by or Consent of any Governmental Authority
with respect to any Antitrust Laws, (y) no Governmental Order with respect to
any Antitrust Laws and (z) no other matter relating to any Antitrust Laws
would preclude consummation of the Sale by the Outside Date. Notwithstanding

 



-42-  the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained herein, nothing in this
Agreement shall require Purchaser (or permit the Company or Seller, without
Purchasers prior written consent) to take or agree or commit to take any
action, or agree to any condition or restriction or other mitigation, whether
contemplated in this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ or otherwise, involving Seller,
Purchaser or their respective Subsidiaries, including the Business
Subsidiaries, that would have, or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on Purchaser, any
of Purchasers principal global networks or the Business.

 

6.03 _D_ _ebt Financing_.

 

(a) _No Amendments to Commitment Letter_. Subject to the terms of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.03_, Purchaser will not permit any amendment, replacement
or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy
pursuant to, the Commitment Letter without the Sellers prior written consent
if such amendment, replacement or modification or waiver would, or could
reasonably be expected to, (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing, (ii) impose new (or modify any existing) conditions to the receipt
of the Debt Financing on or prior to the Closing Date in a manner that
would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially
impede the consummation of the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (in each case, giving effect to the availability of any
Alternative Debt Financing) or (iii) adversely impact the ability of
Purchaser to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Commitment
Letter (each of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), an " _Adverse Effect on the Debt
Financing_ "), it being understood that amendments or joinders to the
Commitment Letter to provide solely for the inclusion of additional "Lead
Arrangers" or "Commitment Parties" (and the corresponding reduction in
commitments of the initial parties thereto) shall be expressly permitted (so
long as the aggregate debt commitments under the Commitment Letter are not
reduced). Purchaser shall promptly deliver to the Company copies ( _provided_
that the fee amounts, market flex provisions and other economic terms (none
of which would adversely affect the amount or availability or the Debt
Financing other than through original issue discount) may be redacted) of any
such amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification or waiver of
the Commitment Letter.

(b) _D_ _ebt Financing and Alternative Debt Financing_. Purchaser shall use
its reasonable best efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and obtain the
financing contemplated thereby on the terms and conditions set forth in the
Commitment Letter (except that such obligation shall not be breached in
respect of any condition where the failure to be so satisfied is a direct
result of the Companys failure to furnish the information described in
_Section_ __ _ 6.03(d)_, notwithstanding Purchasers reasonable best
efforts), including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in
effect the Commitment Letter in accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions thereof, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with
respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter on the
terms and conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letter or other terms
consistent with _Section_ __ _ 6.03(a)_ above, (iii) satisfy on a timely
basis all conditions to funding that are applicable to Purchaser in
the Commitment Letter and the definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing, (iv) enforce its rights pursuant to the Commitment Letter and (v)
in the event that all conditions contained in the Commitment Letter have been
satisfied and Purchaser is required to consummate the Closing pursuant to the
terms hereof, draw a sufficient amount of the Debt Financing or Alternative
Debt Financing (as defined below) to enable Purchaser to consummate the Sale.
Purchaser will fully pay, or cause

 



-43-  to be fully paid, all commitment or other fees arising pursuant to the
Commitment Letter as and when they become due. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, in the event that any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions set forth in the
Commitment Letter (including after giving effect to any "market flex"
provisions), Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly
as practicable following the occurrence of such event, (i) obtain alternative
debt financing from the same or alternative sources on terms, conditions and
costs not materially less favorable in the aggregate to Purchaser than those
set forth in the Commitment Letter ( _provided_ that such terms, conditions
and costs would not have any Adverse Effect on the Debt Financing) and in an
amount sufficient (together with cash on hand of the Company and Purchaser and
the amounts of Debt Financing then still available) to (1) consummate the
Closing upon the terms contemplated by this Agreement, (2) pay all amounts
payable at the Closing by Purchaser or its Affiliates pursuant to this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which Purchaser is a party
and (3) pay all related fees and expenses of Purchaser and any of their
respective Affiliates and Representatives and (ii) obtain one or more new
financing commitment letters with respect to such alternative debt financing
(the " _New Commitment Letters_ "), which New Commitment Letters will replace
the existing Commitment Letter in whole or in part. Notwithstanding any of the
foregoing, Purchaser shall have the right to reduce the commitments under the
Commitment Letter on a dollar-for-dollar basis with the net proceeds of
consummated offerings or other incurrences of any debt for borrowed money
incurred after the date of this Agreement for the purpose of financing payment
of the Purchase Price and other amounts payable by Purchaser or its Affiliates
pursuant to this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to
which Purchaser is a party. Further, Purchaser shall have the right to reduce
the commitments under the Commitment Letter on a dollar-for-dollar basis with
the aggregate amount of any substitute commitments in respect of other debt
financing from the same and/or alternative bona fide third party Debt
Financing Sources of similar creditworthiness as reasonably determined by
Purchaser (which commitments shall be evidenced by a New Commitment Letter)
so long as such substitution would not reasonably be expected to have an
Adverse Effect on the Debt Financing (any such financing which satisfies, or
reduction of the commitments under the Commitment Letter that is described
in, this _Section_ __ _ 6.03(b)_, the " _Alternative Debt Financing_ ").
Purchaser shall promptly provide Seller with a copy of any New Commitment
Letters (and any fee letters or engagement letters in connection therewith,
subject to redaction in a manner consistent with the original Commitment
Letter). In the event that any New Commitment Letters are obtained, (A) any
reference in this Agreement to the "Commitment Letter" will be deemed to
include the Commitment Letter to the extent not superseded by a New Commitment
Letter at the time in question and any New Commitment Letters to the extent
then in effect, and (B) any reference in this Agreement to the
"Debt Financing" means the debt financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter as modified pursuant to the foregoing.

(c)  _I_ _nformation_. Purchaser shall give the Seller prompt written notice
of any material breach or repudiation by any party of the Commitment Letter or
Fee Letter of which Purchaser becomes aware or any termination of the
Commitment Letter or Fee Letter. Purchaser shall keep the Company informed on
a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts
to arrange and consummate the Debt Financing.

 



-44- (d) Financing Cooperation. Prior to the Closing, the Company and Seller shall,
and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries, to the extent applicable, to,
use their reasonable best efforts to (and use their reasonable best efforts to
cause their respective officers, employees, agents and representatives to)
provide to Purchaser all cooperation reasonably requested by Purchaser that
is necessary, proper or advisable in connection with the Debt Financing or any
Alternative Debt Financing by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in connection
with the Sale, including using reasonable best efforts to:

(i) make the Companys senior management available to participate in a
reasonable number of meetings and calls, due diligence sessions (including
accounting due diligence sessions), on reasonable advance notice and
reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts of Purchaser and lenders, in
each case in connection with the Debt Financing or any other financing of the
Purchaser in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (the "
_Purchaser Financing_ ");

(ii) upon reasonable request by Purchaser, delivering to the Purchaser such
information regarding the Business Subsidiaries and the Business for the
Purchasers preparation of (1) appropriate and customary materials for rating
agency presentations, offering and syndication documents, bank information
memoranda (public and non-public), offering memoranda, private placement
memoranda (including Rule 144A and/or Regulation S under the Securities Act),
registration statements, prospectuses and prospectus supplements under the
Securities Act and other materials in connection with securities offerings
_provided_ that any non-public materials shall be subject to usual and
customary confidentiality provisions that inure to the benefit of the Seller,
business projections, other marketing documentation and similar documents (and
executing customary representation letters in connection therewith) and (2)
customary pro forma financial statements reflecting the Sale and the Purchaser
Financing; _provided_ , _further_ , that the only financial statements that
shall be required to be provided by Seller, the Company or their respective
Subsidiaries shall be the financial information described in _Section_ __ _
6.03(e)(v)_;

 

(iii) assisting Purchaser with the preparation of (but not executing, unless
effective only at or following the time of Closing) definitive financing
documents (and assisting in the preparation of applicable schedules and other
information necessary in connection therewith), including any loan agreements,
guarantees, currency or interest hedging agreements, certificates, and
other definitive financing documents, _provided_ that no obligation of any
Business Subsidiary under any such document or agreement shall be effective
until the Closing;

 

(iv) executing and delivering (or using reasonable best efforts to obtain from
its advisors), and causing its Subsidiaries to execute and deliver (or use

practicable following the date of this Agreement (and in any event within
thirty (30) days), prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC in preliminary
form the Proxy Statement. Subject to the ability of the board of directors of
the Company to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 6.07_, the board of directors of the Company shall include the
Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall promptly
notify Purchaser upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of
the SEC or any request from the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement, and shall provide Purchaser with copies of
all correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand. The Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to (A) respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect
to the Proxy Statement, (B) have the Proxy Statement cleared by the staff of
the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable after such filing and (C) cause the

thereto, will be made by the Company without providing Purchaser a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon, which comments the Company shall
consider in good faith; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply with
respect to an Adverse Recommendation Change. If at any time prior to the
Closing any event or circumstance relating to the Company or any of the
Business Subsidiaries or its or their respective officers or directors should
be discovered by the Company which, pursuant to the Exchange Act, should be
set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company

connection with the Proxy Statement and shall otherwise assist and cooperate
with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and resolution of
comments of the SEC or its staff related thereto. Purchaser will cause the
information relating to Purchaser and its Affiliates supplied by it for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement, at the time of the mailing of the Proxy
Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of the
Stockholders Meeting, not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

(iii) _Stockholder Meeting_. In accordance with the Companys Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws,
applicable Law and the rules of Nasdaq, the Company shall, as promptly as
practicable, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the " _Stockholders_ __ _Meeting_
"), for the purpose of obtaining the Stockholder Approvals. The Stockholders
Meeting shall be held at the earlier of the Companys 2018 annual meeting
of stockholders or the date that is 60 days following the date on which the
Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC. The Company shall (A) ensure that the
Stockholders Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and
that all Persons solicited in connection with the Stockholders Meeting are
solicited, in compliance with all applicable Laws and its Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws and (B) use
reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of
the approval of the Holdco Merger, LLC Conversion and the Sale and to take all
other actions reasonably necessary or advisable to pursue the vote or consent
of its stockholders and to obtain the Stockholder Approvals, including such
actions as are required by applicable Law. Once the Stockholders Meeting has
been noticed and called, the Company shall not postpone or adjourn the
Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Purchaser (other
than (1) to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the
Stockholder Approvals, if the Company determines in good faith such
postponement or adjournment is necessary or advisable to obtain
the Stockholder Approvals, (2) for the absence of a quorum and (3) to allow
reasonable additional time for the filing and/or mailing of any supplemental
or amended disclosure which the Company has determined after consultation with
outside legal counsel is necessary under applicable Law and for such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the
stockholders of the Company prior to the Stockholders Meeting).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may at its option elect to seek
stockholder approval for the Holdco Merger and/or the LLC Conversion prior to
a meeting of stockholders to approve the Sale, in which case, if such approval
is received, only the stockholder approval for the Sale shall be solicited
for the Stockholders Meeting.

6.05 _Separation_.

 

(a) In furtherance and not in limitation of _Section_ __ _ 6.01_, the
Company, Seller and LiveRamp shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to complete the Separation as
promptly as reasonably practicable, subject to and in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the Transaction Documents and applicable Law. 

 



-49-  The Company, Seller and LiveRamp shall provide Purchaser all information
regarding the Separation, including all Transfer Documents in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 6.06(a)_ and keep Purchaser informed on a timely basis with
respect to all material activity concerning the status of the Separation. None
of the Company, Seller or LiveRamp will (i) terminate, grant waivers or amend

extension of the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of
either the Company or LiveRamp thereunder or (B) waiver of any inaccuracy in

or (iii) waive compliance with any agreement or condition contained in the
Transaction Documents in any manner that is or could reasonably be expected to

without Purchasers prior written consent.

personnel, properties and Books and Records of the Business; and (ii) furnish
to Purchaser and its Representatives (including any financing sources) such
additional operating data and other information regarding the Business (or
copies thereof) as Purchaser may from time to time reasonably

_provided_ , _however_ , that any such access or furnishing of information
shall be subject to Sellers reasonable insurance requirements and conducted
at Purchasers expense, during normal business hours, under the supervision
of Seller or its Representatives and in such a manner as not to unreasonably
interfere with the normal operations of the business of Seller or the Business
Subsidiaries and shall not include the right to perform any "invasive"
testing or soil, air or groundwater sampling, including without limitation,
any environmental site assessment, without Sellers prior consent; _provided_

reasonable, good faith judgment of Seller is competitively sensitive; (x)
jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege or the protections of
the work product doctrine; (y) contravene any applicable Laws or Contract to
which Seller or any of the Business Subsidiaries is a party as of the date

appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements, to the extent practicable.
Notwithstanding anything herein to

 



-50-  the contrary, Seller shall not be required to provide any U.S. federal

an "affiliated group" (within the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code or any
similar or analogous provision of applicable income Tax law), or any portion
thereof, in any form or manner whatsoever (each such Tax Return described in
this sentence, a " _Seller Affiliated Group Return_ ") to any other Person
pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(b) The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of March 9, 2018,
between the Company and Purchaser (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "),
shall continue in full force and effect (including with respect to any
information provided to Purchaser pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.06(a)_) until
the Closing, at which time such Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate,
other than with respect to the confidentiality and non-use obligations
contained therein with respect to Evaluation Material (as defined therein) not
related to the Business, which obligations shall continue in full force and
effect for a period of five (5) years from the Closing Date. If this Agreement
is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties agree and
acknowledge that the standstill and similar restrictions in the

the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 6.06_.

6.07 _No Solicitation_.

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement (and subject to _Section_ __ _
6.07(c)_), Seller and the Company shall, and they shall cause their
Subsidiaries and any of Sellers, the Companys or their Subsidiaries
respective directors, officers and employees to, and shall use reasonable best

prompt return from, or destruction by, all such Third Parties of all copies

_Section_ __ _ 6.07(c)_), from and after the date of this Agreement until the
Closing or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms, Seller and the Company shall not and shall cause
their Subsidiaries and any of Sellers, the Companys or their Subsidiaries
respective directors, officers and employees not to, and shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause its or their respective other Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly facilitate or
encourage the submission or making of any Competing AMS Proposal or any
WholeCo Proposal or inquiries regarding any proposal or offer that would
reasonably be expected to lead to any Competing AMS Proposal or any WholeCo
Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations or discussions with
respect to any Competing AMS Proposal or WholeCo Proposal (it being understood
that, in response to an inquiry with respect to any WholeCo Proposal, the
Company and Seller may inform Persons of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
6.07_), (iii) furnish any non-public information to any Third Party
relating to a Competing AMS Proposal or a WholeCo Proposal or any inquiry or

Company shall be permitted to grant a waiver of or terminate any "standstill"
or similar obligation of any Third Party with respect to the Company or any of
the Business Subsidiaries to allow such Third Party to submit a WholeCo
Proposal, in which case the Company shall similarly waive or terminate any
"standstill" or similar obligations applicable to Purchaser and its Affiliates
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement then still in effect, if any.
For clarity, the foregoing restrictions and obligations of Seller and the
Company shall not apply with respect to any Permitted LiveRamp Proposal.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the date that the Stockholder

respective Representatives on Sellers or the Companys behalf) receives a
written WholeCo Proposal from any Third Party that did not result from
a material breach of _Section_ __ _ 6.07(a)_ or _(b)_ then (i) Seller or
the Company and their respective Representatives, to the extent such
clarification is reasonably necessary, may contact such Third Party solely to
request and obtain clarification of the terms and conditions thereof (without
the board of directors of the Company (or a duly authorized committee thereof)

__ _ 6.07(c)_) and (ii) the Company and its board of directors (including any
duly authorized committee thereof) and its Representatives may, subject to
compliance with _Section_ __ _ 6.07(d)_, engage in negotiations or
substantive discussions with, or furnish any information and other access to,
the Third Party making such WholeCo Proposal and its Representatives,
Affiliates and prospective debt and equity financing sources, in each case of
this clause (ii), if the Companys board of directors (or

 



-52-  a duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that such
WholeCo Proposal either constitutes a Superior WholeCo Proposal or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior WholeCo Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (x) prior to furnishing any non-public information, Seller or

Confidentiality Agreement and (y) Seller or the Company shall promptly (but

Proposal or Permitted LiveRamp Proposal and in any event within one (1)
Business Day, deliver to Purchaser a written notice setting forth the identity
of the Third Party and the material terms and conditions of any such WholeCo
Proposal, Competing AMS Proposal or Permitted LiveRamp Proposal and shall
provide to Purchaser copies of any written materials. Seller and the Company
shall keep Purchaser reasonably informed of the status of, and any material
developments regarding, any such WholeCo Proposal or Permitted LiveRamp
Proposal (including any material amendment or modification of any such WholeCo
Proposal or Permitted LiveRamp Proposal (including any change to the economic
terms thereof), and including by providing to Purchaser copies of any written
materials) on a prompt basis, and in any event within one (1) Business Day
thereafter. Neither Seller nor the Company shall and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries not to, enter into any agreement with any
Person (relating to a WholeCo Proposal, Permitted LiveRamp Proposal or
otherwise) which prohibits or otherwise would prevent the provision of any
information to Purchaser in accordance with, or Seller or the Company from
otherwise complying with, the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transactions as contemplated hereunder.

 

(e) Seller or the Company shall not be permitted to enter into a definitive
agreement contemplating a LiveRamp Sale without first providing written

such notice.

(f) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement with respect to a
WholeCo Proposal, the board of directors of the Company (including any

-53-  Business Days after the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under
the Exchange Act) of such tender or exchange offer (any action described in
this clause (i) being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "),
(ii) approve, cause or authorize or permit Seller, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, or other agreement providing for or constituting any Competing AMS
Proposal or WholeCo Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement), (iii) submit any Competing AMS Proposal or WholeCo Proposal to a
vote of the stockholders of the Company or (iv) resolve, agree or publicly
propose to do any of the foregoing. Purchaser may reasonably request in
writing for the Company to publicly affirm the Company Recommendation and the
Company shall make such public affirmation within three (3) Business Days of
such written request if such Competing AMS Proposal or WholeCo Proposal is
still then pending ( _provided_ that Purchaser shall be entitled to make such
written request only once in respect of each Competing AMS Proposal or WholeCo
Proposal and once for each material amendment thereto).

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to the receipt of the Stockholder Approvals, the board of directors of
the Company (or a duly authorized committee thereof) may, subject to
compliance with _Section_ __ _ 6.07(h)_, (x) make an Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to a WholeCo Proposal that the board of directors of the
Company (or a duly authorized committee thereof) has determined in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
constitutes a Superior WholeCo Proposal in circumstances not involving a
breach of  _Section_ __ _ 6.07(a)_ or _(b)_ , and (y) if Seller or the
Company has received a WholeCo Proposal in circumstances not involving a
breach of _Section_ __ _ 6.07(a)_ or _(b)_ that the board of directors of
the Company (or a duly authorized committee thereof) has determined in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
constitutes a Superior WholeCo Proposal, authorize, adopt or approve such
Superior WholeCo Proposal and cause or permit Seller or the Company to enter
into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior WholeCo Proposal
concurrently with the termination of this Agreement in accordance with 
_Section_ __ _ 9.01(c)(ii)_.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Adverse
Recommendation Change may be made and no termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.07(g)_ may be effected, in each case until after
the fifth (5th) Business Day following Purchasers receipt of written notice
from Seller or the Company advising Purchaser that the board of directors of
the Company (or a duly authorized committee thereof) intends to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to clause (x) of _Section_ __ _
6.07(g)_ (a " _Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to clause (y) of _Section_ __ _ 6.07(g)_ (a " _Notice of_

this Agreement and/or the Transactions to which Purchaser would agree (or the
terms of any WholeCo Proposal submitted by Purchaser), determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
that such WholeCo Proposal continues to constitute a Superior WholeCo
Proposal. Any material change to the terms (including any change to the
financial terms) or any other material amendment of such Superior WholeCo
Proposal shall require a new Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change or Notice
of Superior WholeCo Proposal, as applicable, and Seller or the Company shall

, _however_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.07(_ _i_ _)_ shall be
deemed to modify or supplement the definition of (or the requirements pursuant
to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.07_ with respect to an) Adverse Recommendation
Change.

Company or the board of directors of the Company (or any duly authorized

exchange offer or any similar transaction for any or all of the LiveRamp
Assets and none of the AMS Assets and that does not, and would not reasonably
be expected to, conflict with, materially impede, materially delay or
prohibit (including by imposing a Third Party consent right with respect to)
the consummation of the Sale and the Separation as contemplated hereunder and,
as a condition to the Companys entry into a definitive agreement with
respect to such proposal or offer (A) any such Third Party agrees to vote, or
cause to be voted, all the Company equity securities directly or indirectly
beneficially owned by such Third Party and its controlled Affiliates in favor

thereof) considers to be appropriate, including the consideration, terms,
conditions, timing, likelihood of consummation, financing terms and legal,
financial, and regulatory aspects of such WholeCo Proposal and the expected

any one or more assets or businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries that
constitute at least twenty percent (20%) of the consolidated assets of the

-56- 6.09 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Following the Closing, Purchaser shall cause the Business Subsidiaries not
to make any changes to their respective organizational documents that would

or directors of, or in a comparable role with, any of the Business
Subsidiaries (but not in the capacity of any roles of such persons with
Seller) to claim indemnification from such entity under the terms of their
respective organizational documents as in effect on the date hereof unless
such changes are required by Law and then only to the minimum extent required
by Law. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall or, if the Company is unable

with, any of the Business Subsidiaries (but not in the capacity of any roles
of such persons with Seller), for a claims reporting or discovery period of
six (6) years from and after the Closing with respect to any claim related to
any period of time at or prior to the Closing from an insurance carrier with
the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier
with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits
of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the
Companys existing policies.

 

(b) Following the Closing, Purchaser shall cause the Company to, as the
primary source of indemnification, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
current and former directors and officers, or persons in a comparable role
with, of the Business Subsidiaries (but not in the capacity of any roles of
such persons with Seller) for any damages, Taxes, costs and expenses
(including reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in connection with any
actual or threatened Action or investigation (whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative) arising from any acts or omissions by such
persons, in their respective capacities as directors or officers of, or in a
comparable role with, the Business Subsidiaries (but not Seller) prior to the

merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each
case, Purchaser shall make proper provision so that the successors and
assigns of Purchaser shall assume all of the obligations of Purchaser set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.09_.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.09_ are intended for the benefit

non-governmental Actions or investigations) relating to the conduct of the
Business prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during
such seven-year (7-year) period, Purchaser and the Business Subsidiaries may
dispose of any such Books and Records if Purchaser first offers the Books and
Records to Seller in writing and Seller thereafter notifies Purchaser in
writing that it wishes to reject such offer.

(b) After the Closing Date, for so long as such materials are retained in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_, Seller and Purchaser shall, and
Purchaser shall cause the Business Subsidiaries to, and Seller shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, permit the other party hereto and its authorized

to the extent necessary to ensure compliance with this Agreement or applicable
Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Seller nor Purchaser (nor any of
their Affiliates) shall be required to disclose any information under this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.10_ (A) if such disclosure would be reasonably likely to:
(1) contain information that in the reasonable, good faith judgment of the
disclosing party (after consultation with outside counsel) is competitively
sensitive; (2) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege or the
protections of the work product doctrine; (3) contravene any applicable Laws,
fiduciary duty or Contract to which the disclosing party or any of its
Affiliates is a party; or (4) expose the disclosing party or any or its
Affiliates to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal
information; _provided_ that, in any such case, the disclosing party shall
provide such information in redacted form as necessary to preserve such
privilege or protections or comply with such Law or Contract or otherwise make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements, to the extent practicable or
(B) in connection with any litigation or similar dispute between the parties
hereto; _provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing shall not limit any of the
parties rights of discovery. Any such access or furnishing of information
shall be conducted under the supervision of the disclosing party or its
Representatives and in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
normal operations of the business of the disclosing party and its Affiliates.

 



-58- (c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Seller and
Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, provide to
the other party such cooperation, documentation and information as either of
them reasonably may request in connection with (i) preparing and filing any
Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund, (ii) determining a
liability for Taxes or a right to refund of Taxes or (iii) preparing for or
conducting any audit, examination, litigation or other Action with respect to
Taxes. Such cooperation shall include providing at the cost and expense of
the requesting party any necessary powers of attorney and copies of all
relevant portions of relevant financial or accounting data and Tax Returns,
together with all relevant portions of relevant accompanying
schedules, relevant work papers, relevant documents relating to rulings or
other determinations by Governmental Authorities and relevant records
concerning the ownership and Tax basis of property and other relevant
information, which any such party may possess. Each party shall make its
employees reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis at the cost of
the requesting party to provide an explanation of any documents or information
so provided.

 

6.11 _Notification of Certain Matters_. (a) Seller shall give prompt notice to

of such Person under a Material Contract is or may be required in connection
with the Transactions, (iii) any Actions commenced against, relating to or
involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of their respective
Subsidiaries which relate to the Transaction Documents or the Transactions
and (iv) the occurrence of any event which would or would be reasonably likely
to (x) prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions or (y)
result in the failure of any condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.02_ to
be satisfied; and (b) Seller shall (i) give Purchaser prompt notice of any
written notice or other written communication received from any party to
any Material Contract with a customer listed on _Section_ __ _ 3.20_ of the
Disclosure Schedules after the date hereof, to the effect that such party has
terminated, intends to terminate or adversely and materially change
such relationship with respect to the Business (in each case other than the
expiration of the term of such Material Contract in accordance with its
terms); _provided_ that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.11_ shall not (i) affect or be deemed to modify any
representation, warranty, covenant, right, remedy, or condition to any
obligation of any party hereunder or (ii) update any section of the
Company Disclosure Schedules.

promptly provide Purchaser with copies of all proceedings and correspondence
relating to such Action, (ii) shall give Purchaser the opportunity to consult
with Seller regarding the defense or settlement of any such Action and (iii)
shall not compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to
compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding any Action arising or
resulting from the Transactions (other than any settlement that would not
affect Purchaser or the Business in any material respect following the
Closing, including any settlement solely for monetary damages to be paid by
Seller or entirely from proceeds of Sellers insurance, except for any
applicable deductible which shall be paid by Seller) without the prior written
consent of Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(a) Seller hereby acknowledges that, as of the Closing, all right, title and
interest in and to the Marks and names set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 3.15(a)_

that, except as expressly provided below, any and all rights of Seller and its
Subsidiaries that are not Business Subsidiaries to use the Names and Marks

practicable, with respect to jurisdictions outside of the United States),
"doing business as" name, trade name and any other similar corporate
identifier to (in the case of such corporate identifiers, no more than
ninety (90) days after the Closing) to a corporate name, "doing business as"
name, trade name or any other similar corporate identifier that does not
contain any Names and Marks and is not confusingly similar to any Names and
Marks. Except with respect to usage rights provided in a separate agreement
between Seller and its Subsidiaries that are not Business Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and the Business Subsidiaries, on the other hand, Seller shall use
reasonable best efforts to ensure that all Names and Marks are replaced,
removed or covered-over on all materials as soon as reasonably possible and

limitation, on: order, purchase or material forms; requisitions; invoices;
statements; labor reports; bill inserts; stationery; personalized note pads

Closing (irrespective of the terms of payment or such intercompany accounts)
in each case without

 



-60-  liabilities or obligations of any Business Subsidiary. Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Legacy Intercompany Agreements to be
terminated or amended to remove LiveRamp or its Affiliates (such Affiliates
shall be any Affiliates of Seller as of the Closing) as parties thereto, as
applicable, effective as of the Closing and without further liability or
obligation (contingent or otherwise) thereunder in each case
without liabilities or obligations of any Business Subsidiary.

6.17 _Payoff_. The Company shall deliver to Purchaser at least three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date a copy of a payoff letter, in a
customary form reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, subject to the delivery of
funds as arranged by Purchaser, with respect to the Existing Company Credit

Purchaser in obtaining, new ALTA/ACSM land title surveys of the Owned Real
Property certified to Seller, Purchaser, any title company selected by
Purchaser and any agent of such title company (" _Surveys_ "), _provided_ that
Purchaser shall pay all of the costs and expenses associated with obtaining
such Surveys.

this  _Section_ __ _ 6.19_ were not performed in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and that the Purchaser will be entitled to obtain specific
performance of the terms of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to
which it is entitled at law or in equity, and will not be required to post
any bond in connection therewith.

(c) The covenants contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.19_ are considered by
the Parties to (i) be fair, reasonable and necessary for the protection of the
legitimate interests of Purchaser, (ii) constitute a material inducement to
Purchaser to enter into this Agreement and consummate the Transactions, (iii)
not be injurious to the public and (iv) be appropriate based on the nature of
LiveRamps, AMSs and Purchasers respective businesses.

 

ARTICLE VII

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

7.01 _Employee Equity Awards_. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall take all
actions necessary or appropriate to assume each Company Stock Plan and each
outstanding Employee Option and Employee RSU and to ensure that none of
Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates (including any Business Subsidiary) will
have any Liabilities in respect of any Company Stock Plan, Employee Option,
or Employee RSU from and after the Closing; _provided_ that if any tax or
social insurance or other similar withholding, reporting, remittance or
payment obligations or any regulatory filing obligations apply to an Employee
Option or Employee RSU held by an AMS Employee after the Closing, Seller and
Purchaser (and any of their Affiliates for whom the AMS Employee worked or
works, as applicable), agree to cooperate to ensure that such obligations are
met (it being understood and agreed that Seller shall timely remit to
Purchaser any amounts that Purchaser or any of its Affiliates may be required
to be withheld in respect of any Employee Option or Employee RSU _plus_ the
employer-paid portion of any payroll or employment taxes payable in respect
thereof). Immediately prior to the Closing, all Employee Options and Employee
RSUs will have their vesting accelerate in full contingent upon the
consummation of the Closing, _provided_ that, with respect to Employee
Options and Employee RSUs subject to performance-based vesting conditions ("
_Employee Performance Awards_ "), the performance period, as set forth in the
award agreement underlying the applicable Employee Performance Award (the "
_Performance Award Agreement_ "), will be truncated (and the applicable
performance-based vesting conditions shall be accordingly pro-rated), and a
number of shares or restricted stock units, as applicable, subject to the
Employee Performance Award will vest based on the degree of achievement of
performance objectives (as set forth in the applicable Performance Award
Agreement) as of the date of the Closing, and all remaining shares or
restricted stock units, as applicable, subject to the Employee Performance
Award that fail to vest pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.01_ will terminate
as of the Closing and be of no further force or effect.

 



-62- 7.02 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) With respect to the AMS Employees as of the Closing (other than AMS
Employees covered by a collective bargaining or other agreement with a works
council or other labor or trade union), for a period commencing on the Closing
Date (or, with respect to any AMS Employee on a short-term or long-term
disability leave of absence as of the Closing Date, such later date as such
AMS Employees employment with Purchaser and its Affiliates commences) and
ending on the earlier of (x) the date that is twelve (12) months after the
Closing and (y) the date on which the applicable AMS Employees employment
is terminated for any reason (the " _Continuation Period_ "), Purchaser
agrees to provide or cause its Subsidiaries to provide each such AMS Employee
with (i) a base salary or base wage rate (as applicable) that is no less
favorable to each AMS Employee than that provided to such AMS Employee
immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) annual cash bonus opportunities that
are no less favorable to each AMS Employee than that provided to such AMS
Employee immediately prior to the Closing, and (iii) 401(k) and other
retirement benefits and medical and other welfare benefits that are no less
favorable, in the aggregate, than those provided to similarly situated
employees of Purchaser from time to time. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, prior to the Closing, Seller shall take all actions necessary or
appropriate to transfer the employment of each AMS Employee who is on a short-
term or long-term disability leave, or any other protected leave of absence
as of the Closing Date to Seller or an Affiliate of Seller (other than a
Business Subsidiary) _,_ _provided_ __ that, if any such AMS Employee is ready
to return to active work within 180 days following the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall, promptly following receipt of written notice from
Seller that such AMS Employee is ready to return to active work, make an offer
of employment to such AMS Employee, effective as of the date such AMS Employee
is ready to return to active work, on such terms and conditions as determined
by Purchaser taking into account its obligations pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 7.02_.

 

(b) Purchaser agrees to provide, or cause its Subsidiaries to provide, each
AMS Employee as of the Closing (other than AMS Employees covered by a
collective bargaining or other agreement with a works council or other labor
or trade union) with severance payments and benefits that are no less
favorable than the severance payments and benefits for which such AMS Employee
was eligible to receive immediately prior to the Closing for a similar
termination of employment under the applicable Seller Plan set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 7.02(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedules, taking into account any
service with Purchaser and its Subsidiaries through such date of termination,
subject to such AMS Employees execution of a general release of claims in
favor of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries in a form reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser that is effective within sixty (60) days following such
termination, and as permitted by applicable Law, for (i) for twenty-four (24)
months following the Closing with respect to participants in the Acxiom
Amended and Restated 2010 Executive Officer Severance Policy and the Acxiom
2010 Senior Vice President and Special Situation Associate Severance Policy,
or (ii) the duration of the Continuation Period with respect to participants
in all other Seller Plans set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 7.02(b)_ of the
Disclosure Schedules. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit, limit or
restrict the ability of Purchaser, the Business Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Subsidiaries from altering the duties and employment terms
applicable to a given AMS Employee following the applicable period for which
severance payments or benefits are provided.

 

(c) With respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy or
arrangement maintained by Purchaser or its Subsidiaries following
the Closing, including a Benefit Plan (the " _Purchaser Plans_ "), for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate and vesting, and for
purposes of vacation accrual and level of severance benefits, service with
Seller and the Business Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent
Seller or any of the

 



-63-  Business Subsidiaries provides past service credit) shall be treated as
service with Purchaser and its Subsidiaries to the same extent such service
was recognized for such AMS Employees under the analogous Benefit Plan
immediately prior to the Closing, except that Purchaser and its Affiliates
shall not be required to recognize prior service (i) to the extent that
recognition for prior service is not generally afforded to Purchasers (and
its Affiliates) other employees under such Purchaser Plan (or applicable
award agreement), (ii) if recognition of such prior service would result in
the duplication of benefits, or (iii) for purposes of benefit accruals or
eligibility for any retiree welfare benefits or under any defined benefit
pension plan other than an Assumed Business Benefit Plan in which such AMS
Employee participated in immediately prior to Closing. Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of the applicable Purchaser
Plans that provides medical, dental, pharmaceutical, or vision benefits to any
AMS Employee to (i) waive eligibility waiting periods, evidence of
insurability requirements and pre-existing condition limitations to the extent
waived or not included under the corresponding Seller Plan, and (ii) provide
AMS Employees with credit under the applicable Purchaser Plans for amounts
paid by such AMS Employees prior to the Closing during the plan year in which
the Closing occurs under a corresponding Seller Plan for purposes of applying
deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts
had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Purchaser
Plans; _provided_ that Seller provides Purchaser with all information
reasonably requested by Purchaser in order to satisfy its obligations
hereunder promptly following a written request from Purchaser.

 

(d) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall cause the AMS Employees to be
subject to the vacation, leave of absence, sick leave and other paid time off
policies of Purchaser applicable to similarly situated employees of Purchaser
in the applicable jurisdiction or geographic location, _provided_ that each
AMS Employee in the United States shall receive credit for all accrued
and unused vacation days, paid time off, or sick leave (as applicable),
earned but not yet taken by such AMS Employee as of the Closing Date to the
extent such accruals are included as Current Liabilities.

 

(e) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall take all actions necessary or
appropriate to ensure that all Business Employees are employed by a Business
Subsidiary effective immediately prior to the Closing. Seller shall, or shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, take all actions necessary in respect of consulting
obligations and similar notice and bargaining obligations that arise on or
before the Closing in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions.

(f) Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to employ the AMS Employees who are foreign nationals
working in the United States (the " _Alien Employees_ "), under terms and
conditions such that Purchaser or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, will
be considered the successor-in-interest to the Business for U.S. immigration
purposes. Accordingly, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
assume all immigration-related Liabilities that have arisen or will hereafter
arise in connection with the submission of petitions to the United States
Citizenship and Immigration Service requesting the grant of employment-
based non-immigrant and immigrant visa benefits on behalf of the Alien
Employees.

 



-64- (g) Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
Seller in Sellers efforts to fulfill its obligations to consult with its
works council in France, and any other such jurisdiction in which consultation
is required, which commercially reasonable efforts shall include providing
Seller such data and information reasonably necessary to fulfill its
obligations.

(h) Expenses and benefits with respect to claims incurred by AMS Employees or
their covered dependents on or after the Closing (or, with respect to any AMS
Employee on a short-term or long-term disability leave of absence as of the
Closing Date, the date such AMS Employees employment with Purchaser and its
Affiliates commences) and expenses and benefits payable under any Purchaser
Plans shall be the responsibility of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries. For
purposes of this paragraph, a claim is deemed incurred in the case of medical,
vision or dental benefits when the services that are the subject of the claim
are performed; in the case of life insurance, when the death occurs; in the
case of short-term or long-term disability, when the disability occurs; in the
case of workers compensation benefits, when the event giving rise to the
benefits occurs; and otherwise, at the time the AMS Employee or covered
dependent becomes entitled to payment of a benefit (assuming that all
procedural requirements are satisfied and claims applications properly and
timely completed and submitted).

(i) In the event that the Closing Date occurs prior to the date on which
discretionary bonuses that are accrued by Seller and its Affiliates in
respect of the Business Subsidiaries fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 are
paid to AMS Employees, Purchaser shall cause the Business Subsidiaries to pay
discretionary bonuses to AMS Employees in respect of the Business
Subsidiaries fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 that are in the aggregate not
less than the amount accrued by Seller and its Affiliates in respect of such
discretionary bonuses for the portion of the Business Subsidiaries fiscal
year ended March 31, 2019 that occurs on or prior to the Closing Date, with
such amounts to be paid on or prior to June 30, 2019.

 

(j) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this _Section_ __ _ 7.02_ with respect to AMS Employees are included for the
sole and exclusive benefit of the respective parties hereto and shall not
create any right (i) in any other person, including AMS Employees, former
employees, any participant or any beneficiary thereof in any Benefit Plan, or
Purchaser Plans or (ii) to continued employment with the Business Subsidiaries
or Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.02_ to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement, whether
express or implied, shall be treated as an adoption, amendment or other
modification of any Benefit Plan, Seller Plan or any other employee benefit
plans of Seller or the Business Subsidiaries.

 

(k) Seller has provided to Purchaser a list identifying each AMS Employee who
participates in the Acxiom Corporation Nonqualified Deferral Plan or the
Acxiom Corporation Non-Qualified Matching Contribution Plan sponsored and
maintained by Seller (each such AMS Employee, a " _SERP Employee_ ").
Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, notify Seller in writing
of the termination of employment of any SERP Employee within ten (10) business
days following the date of such termination. Purchaser and Seller agree that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not constitute a
"termination of employment" of the SERP Employees for purposes of Section
5.3(a) of the Acxiom Corporation Nonqualified Deferral Plan or the Acxiom
Corporation Non-Qualified Matching Contribution Plan.

 



-65- (l) Promptly following the date hereof (and in all events within thirty (30)
days following the date hereof), Seller shall determine the final allocation
of the Retention Pool and deliver award agreements to each AMS Employee set
forth on _Section_ __ _ 7.02(l)_ of the Disclosure Schedules, in each case,
as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 7.02(l)_ of the Disclosure Schedules.

TAX MATTERS

8.01 _Tax Returns_.

(a) Seller shall prepare and timely file or cause to be prepared and timely
filed when due (taking into account valid extensions) (i) all Tax Returns of
or with respect to any of the Business Subsidiaries or the AMS Assets that are
required to be filed on or after the date hereof and on or before the Closing
Date, (ii) all income Tax Returns of or with respect to any of the Business
Subsidiaries for any Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing Date and

the preceding sentence shall be prepared timely in a manner consistent with
the past practices of the Business Subsidiaries unless otherwise required by
applicable Law and the provisions of this Agreement. 

(b) Except for Seller Returns and only if not filed on or prior to the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed when
due (taking into account valid extensions) all Tax Returns that are required
to be filed by any of the Business Subsidiaries or with respect to the AMS
Assets the due date of which (taking into account extensions of time to file)
is after the Closing Date (the " _Purchaser Returns_ "). All such Purchaser
Returns relating to any Tax period or portion thereof ending on or prior to
the Closing Date shall be prepared timely in a manner consistent with the
past practice of the Business Subsidiaries unless otherwise required by
applicable Law.

(c) Any income or other material Purchaser Return relating to any Tax period
or portion thereof ending on or prior to the Closing Date and any Seller
Return relating to any Tax period ending on the Closing Date (other than a
Seller Affiliated Group Return) shall be submitted (with copies of
any relevant schedules, work papers and other documentation then available)
by Purchaser to Seller or by Seller to Purchaser, as applicable, for review
and comment not less than twenty (20) days prior to the due date for the
filing of such Purchaser Return (taking into account valid extensions). Any
disputes between Purchaser and Seller with respect to such Tax Returns shall
be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm, whose costs shall be borne
substantially in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 1.03(e)_.

(d) _Prohibited_ _Actions_. Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, without the prior written consent of Seller (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (A) in each case
with respect to the Business or any Business Subsidiary, amend any Tax Return,
make, change or revoke any Tax election, file any Tax Return in a
jurisdiction in which Tax Returns have not previously been filed, initiate or
enter into any voluntary disclosure agreement or similar agreements, extend
any applicable statute of 

 



-66-  limitations or take any other similar action outside the ordinary course of
business to the extent such amendment or action could materially increase
Sellers (or any of its Affiliates) liability for Taxes under applicable Law
or pursuant to the Contribution Agreement or this Agreement, or (B) take, or
cause to take, any action that could materially increase, or result in or
change the character of any material amount of, any income or gain that must
be reported on any Tax Return filed or to be filed by Seller (or any of its
Affiliates). Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall consider in good
faith any request by the other party to make any election under Section 338
of the Code, or any comparable provision of state, local or foreign Law, with
respect to any of the Business Subsidiaries, but any such election shall not
be made without the prior written consent of the non-requesting party (not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , that Buyer
agrees that Seller may withhold such consent if Buyer requests that elections
under Section 338(g) of the Code be made with respect to some, but not all,
of the Business Subsidiaries that are "controlled foreign corporations" within
the meaning of Section 957 of the Code.

 

8.02 _Refunds_. Any refund of Affiliated Group Taxes (including any interest
in respect thereof) received by Purchaser or any of the Business
Subsidiaries, and any amounts credited against such Affiliated Group Taxes in
lieu of a Tax refund to which Purchaser or any of the Business Subsidiaries
becomes entitled (including by way of any amended Tax Returns or any carryback
filing) for any Tax period or portion thereof ending on or prior to the
Closing Date shall be for the account of Seller to the extent such Affiliated
Group Taxes were paid on or prior to the Closing or indemnified or otherwise
economically borne by Seller or its Affiliates. Purchaser shall pay over to
Seller any such refund or the amount of any such credit in lieu of a Tax
refund (reduced by any costs or Taxes incurred in obtaining such refund or
credit) within five (5) Business Days after receipt or, in the case of a
credit in lieu of a Tax refund, after Purchaser or the Business Subsidiaries
become entitled to such credit as a result thereof. For purposes of this
_Section_ __ _ 8.02_, where it is necessary to apportion a refund or credit
in lieu of a Tax refund between Purchaser and Seller for a Tax period that
includes but does not end on the Closing Date, such refund or credit shall be
apportioned between the portion of such period ending on and including the
Closing Date and the period deemed to begin at the beginning of the day
following the Closing Date on the basis of an interim closing of the books of
the Business Subsidiaries as if such taxable period ended on and included the
Closing Date, except that refunds or credits of Affiliated Group Taxes
imposed on a periodic basis shall be allocated on a daily basis. Purchaser
shall cooperate, and cause the Business Subsidiaries to cooperate, in
obtaining any Tax refund for any Affiliated Group Taxes for any Tax period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date.

8.03 _Tax Sharing_ _Agreements_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, to the extent relating to the Business Subsidiaries, Seller shall
terminate or cause to be terminated, on or before the Closing Date, all Tax
sharing agreements or similar arrangements (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall not include this Agreement, the Contribution Agreement or any
other Transaction Document), if any, by and between any of the Business
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other
than the Business Subsidiaries), on the other hand, and neither Seller nor
any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Business Subsidiaries) nor any of the
Business Subsidiaries shall have any rights or obligations thereunder after
the Closing.

other provision of this Agreement, the aggrieved party shall be entitled to

AMS Proposal or such WholeCo Proposal shall not have been publicly withdrawn
at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the date of the Stockholders
Meeting and (y) within twelve (12) months after such termination, Seller

 



-69-  consummates or enters into a definitive agreement for any Competing AMS
Proposal or WholeCo Proposal ( _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of
this  _Section_ __ _ 9.03(a)(_ _i_ _)_ , the reference to "any AMS Assets"
in the definition of Competing AMS Proposal shall be deemed to be a reference
to "more than 25% of AMS Assets" and the references to "20%" in the

(ii) Seller pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.01(c)(ii)_; or

then, in any such case, Seller or the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid,
to Purchaser $86,250,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "). Any payment required to
be made under this _Section_ __ _ 9.03(a)_ shall be made by wire transfer of

earlier of the entry into a definitive agreement and consummation of the
transaction contemplated therein, (y) in the case of clause (ii) above,
simultaneously with or prior to such termination and (z) in the case
of clause (iii), promptly, but in no event later than three (3) Business Days
after the date of such termination.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
parties agree that in no event shall Seller be required to pay the Termination
Fee on more than one occasion.

 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by (i) Seller or Purchaser pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.01(b)(iii)_, (ii) Seller or Purchaser pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 9.01(b)(_ _i_ _)_ and as of the date of such termination the condition
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.02(a)(iv)_ has not been satisfied or (iii)
Seller or Purchaser pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.01(b)(ii)_ with respect to
the Separation, then in any such case, Seller or the Company shall pay, or
cause to be paid, to Purchaser all Purchaser Expenses, such payment to be made
promptly, but in no event later than three (3) Business Days after the date
of such termination. Purchaser Expenses shall reduce, on a dollar-for-dollar
basis, any Termination Fee that becomes due and payable under _Section_ __ _
9.03(a)_.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, and
except in the case of fraud or any willful and material breach of this
Agreement, Purchasers right to receive payment from Seller of the Termination
Fee pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.03(a)_ shall, in circumstances in which the
Termination Fee is owed, constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Purchaser
against Seller and any of its respective former, current or future general or
limited partners, stockholders, members, managers, Representatives or
assignees (collectively, the " _Seller Related Parties_ ") for all losses and
damages suffered as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be
consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and
upon payment of such amount, none of the Seller Related Parties shall have any
further liability or obligation related to or arising out of this Agreement or
the Transactions (except that Seller shall also be obligated with respect to 
_Section_ __ _ 9.03(e)_).

(e) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this  _Section_ __ _ 9.03_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but
is liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that 

 



-70-  will compensate Purchaser in the circumstances in which such fee is payable
and which do not involve fraud or willful and material breach of this
Agreement, except as expressly set forth herein, for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise
be impossible to calculate with precision, and (iii) without these
agreements, Purchaser would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if
Seller fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
9.03_, in addition to the Termination Fee, Seller shall pay Purchaser its
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including fees and
expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection of such overdue
amount, including any Actions in connection therewith, together with interest
on such amount at the prime rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date such
payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted
by applicable Law.

Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or

Delaware; _provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any disputes
involving the Debt Financing Sources will be governed by and construed in
accordance with the applicable Laws of the State of New York without giving
regard to conflicts or choice of law principles that would result in the

addition, each of the parties (a) submits to the exclusive personal
jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery, any other court of the State

transferred or removed to any court other than one of the above-named courts,
(iii) that any such Action should be stayed by reason of the pendency of
some other Action in any court other than one of the above-named courts, or
(iv) that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be enforced in
or by the above-named courts. Each party hereto agrees that service of process
upon such party in any such Action shall be effective if notice is given in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 11.13_. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this
_Section_ __ _ 11.08_, a party may commence any Action in any court
other than the above-named courts solely for the purpose of enforcing an
order or judgment issued by one of the above-named courts relating to any
dispute (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of this Agreement
or the Transactions. Each of the parties to this Agreement agrees that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, it will not bring

Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including but not limited to any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Commitment Letter, the Debt

FINANCING SOURCES).

for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of such party hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance
with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the parties hereto shall be entitled
to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at Law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on
the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at Law or that any award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or
in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

of its controlled Affiliates, on the one hand, and Seller and/or any of its
Affiliates, on the other hand, Counsel may represent Seller and/or any of its

Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates and even though Counsel may have
represented the Business Subsidiaries (prior to Closing) in a matter
substantially related to such dispute and (b) waives any conflict
in connection therewith. Purchaser (on its behalf and on behalf of its

asserted) the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential
communications by Counsel to such third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that

otherwise defined therein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in
this Agreement. The inclusion of any item referenced in one section
or subsection of the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to refer to (a) the
corresponding section of this Agreement and (b) any other section or
subsection of the Disclosure Schedules (and accordingly to the applicable
sections or subsections of this Agreement), whether or not an explicit cross-
reference appears, if the applicability of such item to the other section or
subsection is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure. The
inclusion of any information in the Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed
to be an admission or evidence of the materiality of such item, nor shall it
establish a standard of materiality for any purpose whatsoever.

 

11.17 _Entire_ _Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Disclosure
Schedules), the other Transaction Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes any prior
understanding, agreements or representations by or between the parties,

equity or otherwise, or granted by statute or otherwise, whether by or
through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited
liability company veil or any other theory or doctrine, including alter ego or
otherwise) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by
reason of, be connected with, or relate to: (A) this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereunder, (B) the negotiation, execution or
