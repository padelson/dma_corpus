SECTION 1.4.      Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.

      (a)   The Certificate of Incorporation of the Combination Company, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger as set forth in

                                   ARTICLE II

                EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE
               CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

SECTION 2.1. Effect on Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time of the Merger,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company,
Combination Company, EarthLink or the holders of any Company Shares or capital
stock of Combination Company:

      (a)    Cancellation of Treasury Stock. All shares of capital stock of the
Company held in the treasury of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time of the Merger, if any ("Treasury Stock") shall be cancelled and
extinguished as of the Effective Time of the Merger, without any conversion
thereof and no amount or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable
in exchange therefor.

      (b)    Conversion of Company Shares. Subject to Sections 2.1(a) and
2.1(c), each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger shall be converted automatically into the right to
receive, upon the surrender of the certificate formerly representing such
Company Shares pursuant to Section 2.2, a Per Share Price equal to $5.97 in
cash (the "Cash Portion") and .3511 (the "Stock Ratio") of a share of EarthLink
Common Stock (the "EarthLink Stock Portion"), subject to adjustment as set
forth herein. The Cash Portion and the EarthLink Stock Portion of the Per Share
Price payable and issuable to the holders of Company Shares outstanding on the
day immediately prior to the date on which the Effective Time of the Merger
occurs pursuant hereto (the "Measurement Date"), together with payments of cash
in lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 2.1(c) hereof, shall be
referred to herein as the "Merger Consideration". On the Measurement Date, the
parties shall recalculate the Per Share Price (as so recalculated, the "Final
Per Share Price"), the EarthLink Stock Portion, the Cash Portion and the Stock
Ratio on such date, based on the then-existing closing stock price of the
EarthLink Common Stock (determined by reference to closing quotation from
Nasdaq-National Market--the "Closing Price"), as set forth in Annex A attached
hereto, provided, that for purposes of such adjustments, if the Closing Price
on the Measurement Date is below $5.00 per share or above $50.00 per share, the
Cash Portion and the Stock Ratio shall be determined using the $5.00 and $50.00
Closing Price

                                       3

<PAGE>   13


levels, respectively, and provided further, that if the Closing Price is other
than a whole Dollar amount between a $5 and $50 Closing Price, the adjustment
to the Cash Portion, the Stock Ratio, the EarthLink Stock Portion and the
Intrinsic Option Value shall be on a pro rata basis between such whole Dollar
amounts and otherwise consistent with this provision.

      All such Company Shares shall automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously evidencing any such
shares shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. At the Effective Time of the Merger, the holders of Company
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of the Company Shares,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration and as otherwise provided
herein or pursuant to any rights of appraisal under any applicable law.

      (c)    No Fractional EarthLink Shares. No fractional shares of EarthLink
Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. All fractional shares of EarthLink
Common Stock that a holder of Company Shares would otherwise be entitled to
receive as a result of the Merger shall be aggregated and if a fractional share
of EarthLink Common Stock results from such aggregation, such holder shall be
entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash determined by
multiplying the closing sale price per share of a share of EarthLink Common
Stock on Nasdaq-National Market on the first trading day immediately preceding
the Effective Time of the Merger by the fraction of a share of EarthLink Common
Stock to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled pursuant to this
sentence. No such cash in lieu of fractional shares of EarthLink Common Stock
shall be paid to any holder of fractional EarthLink Common Stock until that
holder's Certificates (as defined in Section 2.2(c)) are surrendered and
exchanged in accordance with Section 2.2(c).

SECTION 2.2. Exchange of Certificates.

      (a)    Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time of the Merger,
EarthLink shall engage American Stock Transfer and Trust Company to act as
exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the issuance of the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of Certificates (as defined in Section 2.2(c)).

      (b)    Payment of Merger Consideration. As of the Effective Time of the
Merger, EarthLink shall have delivered to the Exchange Agent the Merger
Consideration consisting of the certificates for the EarthLink Common Stock
comprising the EarthLink Stock Portion to be issued upon the conversion of the
Company Shares pursuant to Section 2.1(b), the Cash Portion to be issued to
each Stockholder of the Company, and any cash necessary to make payments in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.1(c) (such shares of EarthLink
Common Stock and cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). At
the Effective Time of the Merger, EarthLink shall cause the Exchange Agent,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions delivered to the Exchange Agent prior
thereto, to deliver EarthLink Common Stock, the Cash Portion and cash for

                                       4

<PAGE>   14

fractional shares contemplated to be issued and paid pursuant to Section 2.1
out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose
other than as set forth in this Section 2.2(b).

      (c)    Exchange Procedure. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time of the Merger, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time of the
Merger represented outstanding Company Shares (the "Certificates"), other than
the Company, and any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in a form and have such other
provisions as EarthLink may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the certificates
representing the EarthLink Stock Portion and cash (in payment of the Cash
Portion) and any additional cash in lieu of a fractional share of EarthLink
Common Stock. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
applicable amount of the Merger Consideration consisting of (i) a certificate
or certificates representing the number of whole shares of EarthLink Common
Stock and cash into which the Company Shares theretofore represented by such
Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.1, and (ii) any
cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of EarthLink Common Stock, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If the shares of
EarthLink Common Stock are to be issued to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, it shall be a
condition of exchange that such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
exchange shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
exchange to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of EarthLink that such tax has been
paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time of
the Merger to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.2(c), the applicable amount of
the Merger Consideration consisting of the number of shares of EarthLink Common
Stock and cash and, additional cash, if any, in lieu of a fractional share of
EarthLink Common Stock into which the Company Shares theretofore represented by
such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.1. The
Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of
ownership with respect to the EarthLink Common Stock held by it from time to
time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other
distributions paid or distributed with respect thereto for the account of
Persons entitled thereto.

      (d)    Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Company Shares. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time of
the Merger with respect to the EarthLink Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time

                                       5

<PAGE>   15

of the Merger shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with
respect to the EarthLink Common Stock issuable upon exchange of such
Certificates pursuant to this Agreement, and no cash payment (including any
cash payment in lieu of fractional shares) shall be paid to any such holder
pursuant to Section 2.1 until the holder of record of such Certificate shall
surrender such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2(c). Subject to the
effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there
shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing the
EarthLink Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at
the time of such surrender, the amount of cash payable pursuant to Section
2.1(b) and any additional cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of
EarthLink Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.1(c) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time of the Merger theretofore paid with respect to such
EarthLink Common Stock, as the case may be, and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time of the Merger but prior to surrender and a payment date
subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such EarthLink Common Stock.

      (e)    No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares. All shares of
EarthLink Common Stock issued and all cash paid upon the surrender of
Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II, together with any
dividends payable thereon to the extent contemplated by this Section 2.2, shall
be deemed to have been exchanged and paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Company Shares theretofore represented by such Certificates
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the Company Shares represented by such
Certificates that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of
the Merger. If, after the Effective Time of the Merger, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this Article II, except as otherwise provided by
applicable law.

      (f)    No Liability. Neither EarthLink nor the Company nor any of their
Subsidiaries shall be liable to any holder of Company Shares for any shares of
EarthLink Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or
cash (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares of EarthLink Common
Stock) delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

      (g)    Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit setting forth that fact by the Person claiming such loss, theft or
destruction and, the granting of a reasonable indemnity against any claim that
may be made against EarthLink or the Exchange Agent with respect to such
Certificate, EarthLink shall cause the Exchange Agent to issue to such Person
the applicable amount of the Merger Consideration with respect to such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate to which the holder thereof may be entitled
pursuant to this Article II.

SECTION 2.3. Conversion of Stock Options and Certain Warrants.

      (a)    At the Effective Time of the Merger, each option or other right to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock (as hereinafter defined) pursuant to
stock options (the "Company Options") granted by the Company under any of the
Amended and Restated OneMain.com, Inc. 1999 Stock Option and Incentive Plan and
the OneMain.com, Inc. 1999 Plan (together, the "Company Stock Plans") and which
have an exercise price equal to or below the Final Per Share Price on the
Measurement Date (the "Convertible Options"), shall be converted into an option
to purchase EarthLink Common Stock and become a right with respect to EarthLink
Common Stock based on the Exchange Ratio (as defined below), and upon
conversion each such Company Option shall be subject to the terms of the
EarthLink Stock Incentive Plan and EarthLink Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee
Directors (the "EarthLink Stock Plans"), as applicable, and the stock option
agreement issued by EarthLink by which it is evidenced upon, at and as of the
Effective Time of the Merger (such converted Company Options shall be referred
to as "EarthLink Options"). For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Exchange
Ratio" shall mean the ratio derived by dividing the Final Per Share Price by
the Closing Price. The Convertible Options shall be converted into the number
of EarthLink Options as determined by multiplying the Convertible Options by
the Exchange Ratio. The applicable exercise price for the EarthLink Options
issued upon conversion of the Convertible Options shall be determined by
dividing the exercise price of such Convertible Options by the Exchange Ratio.
Attached hereto as Section 2.3(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule is a list
of the Company Options, applicable strike prices and other information related
to the Company Options as of the date hereof, which list is true, accurate and
complete in all material respects.

      Notwithstanding the above, EarthLink shall not be obligated to issue any
EarthLink Option exercisable into a fraction of a share of EarthLink Common
Stock. The EarthLink Options issued upon conversion of the Company Options as
provided herein that are "incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422
of the Code) are reasonably intended to be effected in a manner that is
consistent with continued treatment of such EarthLink Options as "incentive
stock options" under Section 424(a) of the Code. Each of the Company and
EarthLink agrees to take all reasonably necessary steps to effectuate the
foregoing provisions of this Section 2.3, including using its reasonable best
efforts to obtain from each holder of a Company Option any consent or contract
that may be deemed necessary or advisable in order to effect the transactions
contemplated by this Section 2.3.

      At the Effective Time of the Merger, each Company Option granted by the
Company under any of the Company Stock Plans and which have an exercise price
above the Final Per Share Price and/or which are unvested as of the Effective
Time of the Merger shall terminate in full as of the Effective Time of the
Merger. At the Effective Time of the Merger, all Company Options that are not
at that time converted into EarthLink Options or exercised by the holders
thereof, regardless of exercise price, shall terminate in full as of the
Effective Time of the Merger.

                                       7

<PAGE>   17

      (b)    As soon as practicable after the Effective Time of the Merger,
EarthLink shall deliver to the participants in each Company Stock Plan an
appropriate notice setting forth such participant's rights pursuant thereto,
and the grants subject to such Company Stock Plan shall continue in effect on
the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by Section
2.3(a) after giving effect to the Merger). At or prior to the Effective Time of
the Merger, EarthLink shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance sufficient shares of EarthLink Common Stock for delivery upon exercise
of Company Options assumed by it in accordance with this Section 2.3.

      (c)   EarthLink shall: (i) prior to the Effective Time of the Merger file
all necessary registration statements on Form S-8 (or amend existing
registration statements on Form S-8) in order to effectively register the
shares of EarthLink Common Stock subject to Company Options converted pursuant
to this Section 2.3 that were granted under the Company Stock Plans; (ii) use
reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement(s) (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses
contained therein) for so long as such converted Company Options remain
outstanding; and (iii) prior to the Effective Time of the Merger (subject to
official notice of issuance), prepare and submit to Nasdaq the Notification of
Additional Listing of Shares relating to inclusion for quotation on Nasdaq the
shares of EarthLink Common Stock subject to such converted Company Options and
use reasonable efforts to cause such securities to be approved for quotation on
Nasdaq.

      (d)    As of the Effective Time of the Merger, the warrant issued by the
Company to Heidrick & Struggles exercisable into 15,000 shares of Company
Shares shall be converted into and replaced by a warrant to purchase EarthLink
Common Stock, based on the applicable Exchange Ratio.

SECTION 2.4. Convertible Debentures. The Company shall: (a) repurchase and
terminate in full all outstanding 6.75% Convertible Debentures of the Company
due 2003 (the "Notes") from the holders thereof (the "Noteholders") on or prior
to the Closing Date, (b) effect the replacement of the warrants granted to the
Noteholders (the "Noteholder Warrants") with a warrant to purchase EarthLink
Common Stock (as acceptable to EarthLink) in accordance herewith, (c) terminate
in full the Convertible Debenture Purchase Agreement, the Registration Rights
Agreement and all other agreements related to such agreements, including
without limitation the termination of any obligation of the Company to issue
Second and Third Tranches (as defined therein) of Notes and all other future
obligations to issue securities thereunder, and (d) effect the replacement of
such Registration Rights Agreement with a Registration Rights Agreement to
which EarthLink is a party (as acceptable to EarthLink) (the "Note and Warrant
Termination"). The written, binding agreement pursuant to which the Note and
Warrant Termination shall be effectuated and the new EarthLink warrants to be
issued (the "Note and Warrant Termination Agreement") is attached hereto as
Exhibit C. As set forth in the Note and Warrant Termination Agreement, the
Noteholder Warrants shall be replaced by warrants to purchase EarthLink Common
Stock as set forth therein.

                                       8

<PAGE>   18

SECTION 2.5. Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time of the Merger, the
transfer books of the Company with respect to all shares of capital stock or
other securities of the Company shall be closed and no further registration of
transfers of such shares of capital stock or other securities shall thereafter
be made on the records of the Company.

SECTION 2.6. Certain Adjustments. If between the date hereof and the Effective
Time of the Merger, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or EarthLink
Common Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares by reason of
any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination or exchange of
shares, or any dividend payable in stock or other securities shall be declared
thereon with a record date within such period, the Per Share Price, Exchange
Ratio, EarthLink Stock Portion and Cash Portion shall be adjusted accordingly
to provide the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange or
dividend.

                                  ARTICLE III

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

SECTION 3.1. Representations and Warranties of the Company and the
Subsidiaries. The Company, for and in respect of itself and, where indicated,
for and in respect of its Subsidiaries, represents and warrants to, and agree
with, EarthLink and Combination Company as follows, subject to any exceptions
specified in the Disclosure Schedule of the Company provided to EarthLink on
the date hereof (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"); it being understood and
agreed that the Company may cross reference disclosures within the Company
Disclosure Schedule:

      (a)    Organization; Standing and Power. The Company is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware and has the requisite corporate power and authority to carry
on its business as now being conducted. The Company is duly qualified to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of
its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such
qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to
be so qualified to do business or in good standing (individually, or in the
aggregate) would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

      (b)    Subsidiaries; Other Investments. Except as set forth in Section
3.1(b) of the Company's Disclosure SCHEDULE, the Company does not own, directly
or indirectly, any capital stock or other ownership interest in any Person.
Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and
accurate list of the Company's direct and indirect Subsidiaries and the
respective capital structure of each Subsidiary (authorized capital stock, par
value, outstanding capital stock, owner of capital stock). Except as set forth
on Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the

                                       9

<PAGE>   19


Company's Subsidiaries are all corporations and are duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of their respective jurisdictions
of incorporation and have the requisite corporate power and authority to carry
on their respective businesses as they are now being conducted and to own,
operate and lease the assets they now own, operate or hold under lease, except
where failure of any of the above would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. The Company's Subsidiaries
are duly qualified to do business and are in good standing in each jurisdiction
in which the nature of their respective businesses or the ownership or leasing
of their respective properties makes such qualification necessary, other than
in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing
would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. All the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company's
Subsidiaries are owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries. All the outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Company's Subsidiaries have been duly authorized
and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable and were not issued in
violation of any preemptive rights or other preferential rights of subscription
or purchase of any Person other than those that have been waived or otherwise
cured or satisfied, except for immaterial breaches thereof. All such stock and
ownership interests are free and clear of all liens, pledges, security
interests, charges, claims, rights of third parties and other encumbrances of
any kind or nature ("Liens"), except for immaterial Liens.

      (c)    Capital Structure. The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 100,000,000 shares of common stock, $.001 par value ("Company
Common Stock"), and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $.001 par value
("Company Preferred Stock"). As of the date hereof, 25,126,471 shares of
Company Common Stock were issued and outstanding and no shares of Company
Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding. In addition, at the date hereof,
an aggregate of options to purchase 7,734,197 shares of Company capital stock
in total (the "Total Option Number") and options to purchase 698,647 shares of
Company capital stock (based on the treasury method) are issued and outstanding
and 35,280,857 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved for issuance
pursuant to various employee and director plans and agreements of the Company,
all as accurately described in Section 3.1(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. For purposes of the Total Option Number above and the definition of
"Material Adverse Effect" in Section 9.3(d) hereof, any inaccuracy of the Total
Option Number shall constitute a Material Adverse Effect only if: (X) the
actual intrinsic value of the in-the-money and vested (vested either now or
upon a change of control) Company Options (as of the date hereof based on the
Per Share Price) is not more than $8,847,945; and/or (Y) the Company has at
least 75,000 more vested and in-the-money Company Options at the Measurement
Date than as set forth on Section 2.3(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
The intrinsic value of the Company's in-the-money and vested (vested either now
or upon a change of control) options as of the Measurement Date does not exceed
the intrinsic value of such options at the Closing Price on the Measurement
Date as set forth on Annex A hereto, provided, that violation of this terms of
this sentence shall not be an automatic Material Adverse Effect as set forth in
the definition of that term in Section 9.3 hereof.

                                       10

<PAGE>   20

      Except as set forth above, no shares of capital stock or other equity or
voting securities of the Company are reserved for issuance or outstanding. All

statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The consolidated financial statements of EarthLink included in
the EarthLink SEC Documents complied in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the
case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X of
the SEC) and fairly present the consolidated financial position of EarthLink
and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated
results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject,
in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and
other adjustments described therein).

      (e)    Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or required
to be supplied by EarthLink or Combination Company for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (i) the Registration Statement will, at the time
the Registration Statement is filed with the SEC, and at any time it is amended
or supplemented or at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and
(ii) the Proxy Statement relating to the Company's Stockholders Meeting, at the
date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the Company's stockholders and at
the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no representation or warranty is made by EarthLink with respect
to statements made or incorporated by reference contained in or omitted from
any of the foregoing documents based on information supplied or required to be
supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.
All documents that EarthLink is responsible for filing with the SEC in
connection with the transactions contemplated herein will comply as to form and
substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

      (f)    Brokers. Other than Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities
Corporation, no broker, investment banker or other Person is entitled to
receive from EarthLink or any of its Subsidiaries any investment banking,
broker's, finder's or similar fee or commission in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including any fee for any
opinion rendered by any investment banker.

      (g)    Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as set forth in the EarthLink SEC
Documents, at the date of the most recent audited financial statements of
EarthLink included in the EarthLink SEC Documents neither EarthLink nor any of
its Subsidiaries had, and since such date neither EarthLink nor any of such
Subsidiaries has incurred (except in the ordinary course of business), any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent
or otherwise), required by generally accepted accounting principles to be set
forth on a financial statement or in the notes thereto or which, individually
or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on EarthLink and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

      (h)    Litigation. Except as disclosed in the EarthLink SEC Documents,
(x) there is no material claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation
pending or, to EarthLink's Knowledge, threatened against or affecting
EarthLink, the Combination Company or any of their Subsidiaries, and (y) there
is no claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation pending or, to
EarthLink's Knowledge, threatened against or affecting EarthLink that could
prevent or materially delay the ability of EarthLink or the Combination Company
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, nor is there any
judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity or
arbitrator outstanding against EarthLink or the Combination Company or any of
their Subsidiaries having, or which, insofar as reasonably can be foreseen, in
the future could have, any such effect.

      (i)    Opinion of EarthLink Financial Advisors. EarthLink's Board of
Directors has received an opinion from Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities
Corporation to the effect that, as of the date of this Agreement, the aggregate
consideration, which includes cash consideration and EarthLink stock
consideration (based on the closing stock price of EarthLink Common Stock on
June 7, 2000), to be paid by EarthLink (excluding any consideration to be paid
to stockholders of the Company who perfect their appraisal rights under
Delaware law) pursuant to this Agreement is fair to EarthLink from a financial
point of view.

      (j)    Full Disclosure. No representation or warranty made by EarthLink
or any Subsidiary of EarthLink contained in this Agreement, and no statement
contained in any certificate or schedule furnished to or to be furnished by
EarthLink or any Subsidiary of EarthLink contains or shall contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omits or will omit to state any material fact
necessary, in the light of the circumstances under which it was made, in order
to make statements herein or therein not misleading.

      (k)    Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as disclosed in the
EarthLink SEC Documents, since February 4, 2000, EarthLink has conducted its
business only in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice,
and there has not been (i) as of the date hereof, any changes events or
conditions with respect to EarthLink that has had or is reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect on EarthLink and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole; (ii) any amendment of any material term of any outstanding equity
security of EarthLink or any Subsidiary; (iii) any material damage,

                                       30

<PAGE>   40

destruction, loss, whether or not covered by insurance; or (iv) any change in
accounting methods, principles or practices by EarthLink materially affecting
its assets, liabilities or business, except insofar as may have been required
by a change in generally accepted accounting principles.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                   COVENANTS RELATING TO CONDUCT OF BUSINESS

SECTION 4.1.      Conduct of Business of the Company.

      (a)    Integration; Ordinary Course. In furtherance of integrating the
Company and its Subsidiaries with EarthLink (the "OM Integration"), prior to
the Effective Time of the Merger, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
provide to EarthLink and its representatives reasonable and full access (during
business hours and upon reasonable advance notice) to the Company's and
Subsidiaries' facilities, systems, records, employees (all levels and types)
and other personnel as requested by EarthLink. The Company and EarthLink agree
to cooperate and communicate in good faith in all aspects of the OM
Integration, with principal goals of facilitating the integration of the
Company's and Subsidiaries' operations into EarthLink and to minimize the
Company's potential contractual default/breaches, costs and other problems
arising as a result of the Merger. As part of the OM Integration, the Company
and Subsidiary representatives shall cooperate and work in good faith with
EarthLink representatives and take commercially reasonable actions in order to
identify, minimize and if possible eliminate potential violations (related to
or caused by the Merger) of the Company's and Subsidiaries' contracts,
agreements and leases, including without limitation working directly with the
Company's and Subsidiaries' vendors and other contractual parties for these
purposes.

      As has been disclosed to EarthLink, the Company and its Subsidiaries are
currently engaged in a series of integration steps whereby the Company's
Subsidiaries and regional operations are to be integrated into the Company's
national Internet service plan pursuant to the Company's Integration Plan as
provided in writing to EarthLink (the "Integration Plan"). During the period
from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time of the Merger (except as
otherwise specifically contemplated by the terms of this Agreement or as set
forth in the Company Disclosure Schedules), the Company shall and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to carry on the Company's Integration Plan and their
respective businesses in the usual, regular and ordinary course consistent with
the Integration Plan and in substantially the same manner as heretofore
conducted and, to the extent consistent therewith, use all commercially
reasonable efforts to preserve intact their current business organizations,
keep available the services of their current officers and employees and
preserve their relationships with customers, suppliers, licensors, licensees,
distributors and others having business dealings with them, in each case

                                       31

<PAGE>   41

consistent with past practice in the ordinary course of business to the end
that their goodwill and ongoing businesses shall be unimpaired to the fullest
extent possible at the Effective Time of the Merger. The Company shall use its
best efforts to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of its leasehold and other
interests in that certain airplane currently leased by the Company.

      In connection with the Integration Plan, without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, and except as otherwise expressly contemplated by this
Agreement or as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedules, from the date
hereof until the Effective Time of the Merger, without prior approval from
EarthLink in accordance with the following "Approval Mechanism", the Company
shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries of which it owns
directly or indirectly more than 50% of the voting or equity interests in to
take any of the actions set forth below (the "Approval Items"). The Approval
Mechanism shall be as follows: for each proposed Approval Action set forth
below, a Company representative (the President or his designee) shall contact
EarthLink (the President or his designee) via telephone or email with the
request and reasonable detail on the proposed Approval Item. EarthLink shall
then have two (2) business days after receipt of such request to either approve
or deny the proposed Approval Item, which decision shall be communicated by
EarthLink to the Company via telephone or email. A lack of response to the
Company by EarthLink as required by 5:00 p.m. on the second business day
following the request shall be considered an approval for such request. The
Approval Items, which are applicable to the Company and its Subsidiaries as
appropriate, are as follows:

      the Company and immaterial dividends, distributions and other similar
      transactions involving existing Subsidiaries, (B) split, combine or
      reclassify any of its capital stock or issue or authorize the issuance of
      any other securities in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for
      shares of its capital stock or (C) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
      any shares of capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or

             (ii)   (A) authorize, issue, deliver, sell, pledge or otherwise

      to Company Options outstanding on the date of this Agreement or pursuant
      to elections under the Stock Purchase Plan made prior to the date of this
      Agreement);

      or warrants and the Company's Stock Option Plan existing on the date
      hereof);

             (xii)  [reserved];

             (xiii) authorize or make any payment to an Affiliate of the
      Company except in the ordinary course of business or pursuant to any

                             ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

SECTION 5.1. Stockholder Approval; Preparation of Proxy Statement; Preparation
of Registration Statement.

      (a)    The Company shall, as soon as practicable following the execution
and delivery of this Agreement on a date to be agreed upon between EarthLink
and the Company, which date shall be set taking into account the status of
pending regulatory matters pertaining to the transactions contemplated hereby,
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting
for the purpose of approving the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Unless withdrawn pursuant to this Agreement, the Company
will, through its Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders the
approval and adoption of the Merger. The Company and EarthLink shall coordinate
and cooperate with respect to the timing of the Company Stockholders Meeting
and shall endeavor to hold such meeting as soon as reasonably practical after
the date hereof.

      (b)    Promptly following the date of this Agreement, EarthLink shall
prepare and file with the SEC, and the parties hereto shall cooperate and use
their reasonable best efforts to prepare and file, a registration statement on
Form S-4 (in which the Proxy Statement will be included), and any necessary
amendments or supplements thereto relating to the registration under the
Securities Act of the EarthLink Common Stock to be issued in the Merger (the
"Registration Statement"). Each of the Company and EarthLink shall use its
reasonable best efforts as promptly as practicable, subject to the setting of
the date for the Company Stockholders Meeting as provided in Section 5.1(a), to
have the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing. Each of the Company and EarthLink
will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed
to the Company's stockholders as

                                       35

<PAGE>   45

promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective
under the Securities Act. EarthLink shall also take such reasonable actions
(other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not
now so qualified) as may be required to be taken under any applicable state
securities laws in connection with the issuance of EarthLink Common Stock in
the Merger, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the
Company and the holders of the Company Shares and rights to acquire Company
Shares pursuant to the Company Stock Plans as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action. The Company and EarthLink will notify each
other promptly of the receipt of any written or oral comments from the SEC or
its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement or for
additional information and will supply each other with copies of all
correspondence between the Company or EarthLink, respectively, or any of its
representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand,
with respect to the Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement or the Merger.
No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Registration Statement or the
Proxy Statement will be made by EarthLink without the Company's prior consent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and without
providing the Company the reasonable and adequate opportunity to review and
comment thereon. EarthLink shall advise the Company, promptly after it receives
notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become
effective or when any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of
any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of EarthLink Common Stock
issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement or
the Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or
requests by the SEC for additional information. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger any information relating to the Company or
EarthLink, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should
be discovered by the Company or EarthLink which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to any of the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement, so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company and
EarthLink. EarthLink shall, prior to the Closing Date file with Nasdaq a
Notification for Additional Listing of Shares providing for inclusion for
quotation on Nasdaq-National Market of the shares of EarthLink Common Stock
issuable in connection with the Merger and upon the exercise of any Company
Options and Noteholder Warrant converted or replaced pursuant to this Agreement
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of EarthLink
Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger and upon the exercise of
any Company Options and Noteholder Warrant converted pursuant to this Agreement
to be approved for quotation on Nasdaq-National Market, subject to official
notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date.

                                       36

<PAGE>   46

      (c)    The Company will cause its transfer agent to make stock transfer
records relating to the Company available to the extent reasonably necessary to
effectuate the intent of this Agreement.

SECTION 5.2. Access to Information. Upon reasonable notice, the Company and
EarthLink shall each (and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to)
afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other
representatives of the other, reasonable access during normal business hours
during the period from the date hereof to the Effective Time of the Merger, to
all of its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and during
such period, each of the Company and EarthLink shall (and shall cause each of
their respective Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the other (i) a copy of
each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or
received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of the Exchange
Act or the Securities Act (including all comment letters from the staff of the
SEC) and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as such other party may reasonably request; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.2 or any other
provision of this Agreement, neither the Company nor EarthLink shall be
required to provide to the other party any information that is subject to a
confidentiality agreement and that relates primarily to a party other than the
Company, EarthLink or any Subsidiary or former Subsidiary of the Company or
EarthLink. Each of the Company and EarthLink agrees that it will not, and it
will cause its respective representatives not to, use any information obtained
pursuant to this Section 5.2 for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Confidentiality and
Standstill Agreement dated May 24, 2000 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), by
and between the Company and EarthLink, shall apply with respect to information
furnished by the Company, EarthLink and their respective Subsidiaries and
representatives thereunder or hereunder and any other activities contemplated
thereby. The parties agree that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall not constitute a violation of the Confidentiality
Agreement and that the provisions hereof shall supersede all provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement in the event of a conflict.

SECTION 5.3. Reasonable Efforts; Notification.

      (a)    Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, except to the extent otherwise required by United States regulatory
considerations and otherwise provided in this Section 5.3, each of the parties
agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with
the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
(i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and
approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities, if
any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an
approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by,

                                       37

<PAGE>   47

any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents,
approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or
other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by
any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed and (iv) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments (including any required
supplemental indentures) necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party shall be
required to agree to any consent, approval or waiver that would require such
party to take an action that would impair the value that such party reasonably
attributes to the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby. In
connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of the Company and
EarthLink and its respective Board of Directors shall (i) take all action
reasonably necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar
statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Merger and (ii) if any
state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to
the Merger, take all action reasonably necessary to ensure that the Merger may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on
the Merger.

      (b)    The Company shall give prompt notice to EarthLink, and EarthLink
shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any representation or warranty
made by it contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect or (ii) the failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement; provided, however, that no such
notification shall affect the representations or warranties or covenants or
agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
hereunder.

      (c)    (i)    Each of the parties hereto shall file a premerger
notification and report form under the HSR Act with respect to the Merger as
promptly as reasonably possible following execution and delivery of this
Agreement, but in no event later than fifteen (15) calendar days after the date
hereof. Each of the parties agrees to use reasonable best efforts to promptly
respond to any request for additional information pursuant to Section (e)(1) of
the HSR Act.

             (ii)   Except as otherwise required by United States regulatory
      considerations, the Company and EarthLink will each furnish to the other,
      copies of all correspondence, filings or communications (or memoranda
      setting forth the substance thereof) (collectively, "HSR Documents")
      between the Company and EarthLink, respectively, or any of their
      respective representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity,
      or members of the staff of such agency or authority, with respect to this
      Agreement or the Merger; provided, however, that (x) with respect to
      documents and other materials filed by or on behalf of either the Company
      or EarthLink, with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice,

      Documents (1) that contain any information which, in the reasonable
      judgment of Hogan & Hartson L.L.P., on behalf of the Company, and Hunton

stockholders and may respond to inquiries from financial analysts and media
representatives in a manner consistent with its past practice and each party
may make such disclosure as may be required by applicable law or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange without

the current or former directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") as provided in their
respective certificates of incorporation or bylaws and indemnity agreements
shall survive the Merger, and the Surviving Corporation shall continue such
indemnification rights in full force and effect in accordance with their terms
and be financially responsible therefor. EarthLink shall maintain and continue
for a period of five (5) years from the Effective Time of the Merger any
directors and officers insurance policies in place at the Company as of the

shall be true and correct in all material respects (except to the extent the
representation or warranty is already qualified by materiality and/or the
phrase 'Material Adverse Effect', in which case it shall be true and correct in
all respects) on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as though such
representations and warranties had been made on and as of such date, except

obtained, except such licenses, permits, consents, approvals, authorizations,
qualifications and orders which are not, individually or in the aggregate,
material to the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
or the failure of which to have received would not (as compared to the
situation in which such license, permit, consent, approval, authorization,
qualification or order had been obtained) have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving
effect to the Merger.

termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, an amendment of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.3 or an extension or waiver pursuant to Section

SECTION 8.1.     No Solicitation.

         (a)     Restricted Actions. Following the execution of this Agreement,
Section 8 in the Confidentiality Agreement shall be superseded by this Section
8.1(a).  Except as subject to and specifically permitted under Section 8.1(b)
(provided, that the actions described in Section 8.1(a)(i) below shall in no
event ever be permitted under this Agreement), following the execution of this
Agreement and before the Effective Time of the Merger, the Company shall not,
nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or
permit any officer, director or employee of or any investment banker, attorney
or other advisor, agent or representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (the "Representatives") to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate or encourage the submission of any Takeover Proposal (as defined
below), (ii) enter into any agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal,
(iii) seek to sell or otherwise dispose of shares of capital stock of the
Company or any portion of the assets of the Company and





                                       48
<PAGE>   58
its Subsidiaries outside of the ordinary course of business, to any third
party, or enter into any agreements with any third party with respect to such a
sale or disposition (unless approved by EarthLink in compliance with Section
4.1 hereof), (iv) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
furnish to any Person any information with respect to, or take any other action
to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or
may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal, or (v) take any
such Takeover Proposal to the Company's Board of Directors or stockholders for
consideration, except in accordance with Section 8.1 hereof.  Without limiting
the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set
forth in the preceding sentence by any officer, director or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any investment banker, attorney or other
advisor, agent or representative of the Company, whether or not such Person is
purporting to act on behalf of the Company or otherwise, shall be deemed to be
a material breach of this Agreement by the Company.  For purposes of this
Agreement, "Takeover Proposal" means (i) any proposal or offer, other than a
proposal or offer by EarthLink or any of its Affiliates, for a merger, share
exchange or other business combination involving the Company (excluding an
acquisition by the Company or by a Subsidiary of the Company otherwise
permitted to be made by the Company under this Agreement), (ii) any proposal or
offer, other than a proposal or offer by EarthLink or any of its Affiliates, to
acquire from the Company or any of its Affiliates in any manner, directly or
indirectly, all or any portion voting or equity interest in the Company or the
acquisition of a material amount of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, including an investment in or acquisition of
securities of a Subsidiary of the Company, to the extent so material, or (iii)
any proposal or offer, other than a proposal or offer by EarthLink or any of
its Affiliates, to acquire from the stockholders of the Company by tender
offer, exchange offer or otherwise all or any material portion of the Company
Shares then outstanding.

         (b)     Permitted Actions.   In the event that after the date of this
Agreement, the Company receives a bona fide, unsolicited Takeover Proposal,
subject to the last paragraph of this Section 8.1(b), the Company (including
the Company's Board of Directors and the Company's Representatives, employees
and agents, for purposes of this Section 8.1) may engage in the applicable
activities set forth in Sections 8.1(a)(ii), 8.1(a)(iii), 8.1(a)(iv) and/or
8.1(a)(v) above (excluding taking the Takeover Proposal to the Company's
stockholders - collectively, the "Negotiation Activities") as applicable and
only as specifically permitted herein, including furnishing information to such
third party, all within the following framework:

              (i)         the Company's Board of Directors shall have a 15
         calendar day period following receipt by the Company of any such bona
         fide, unsolicited Takeover Proposal (the "Initial Consideration
         Period" ) in which to engage in the actions permitted in Sections
         8.1(a)(iv) and 8.1(a)(v) (other than taking the Takeover Proposal to
         the Company's stockholders for approval) in order to determine if such
         Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; provided, however,
         that with respect to the activities set forth in Section 8.1(a)(iv),
         the Company may perform such activities only to determine whether or
         not such





                                       49
<PAGE>   59
         Takeover Proposal is a Superior Proposal, and shall not directly or
         indirectly participate in any negotiations with respect to such
         Takeover Proposal with the Person who has made such Takeover Proposal
         or such Person's representatives, employees or agents (the "Offeror")
         during the Initial Consideration Period, unless and until the
         Company's Board of Directors determines that such Takeover Proposal
         constitutes a Superior Proposal, as set forth below;

                 (ii)     if within the Initial Consideration Period as
         provided above, the Company's Board of Directors, in good faith
         exercise of its fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders,
         determines by resolution that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a
         Superior Proposal, then the Company's Board of Directors shall have a
         15 calendar day period following the day on which the Company's Board
         of Directors makes such determination (the "Negotiation Period") in
         which to engage in the Negotiation Activities in order to negotiate
         and enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
         Proposal.

                 (iii)    Upon determination that a Takeover Proposal
         constitutes a Superior Proposal as set forth above, then the Company
         shall so notify EarthLink pursuant to Section 8.1(c) hereof and
         EarthLink may in its discretion terminate this Agreement and abandon
         the Merger at any time during the Negotiation Period, but only if done
         so prior to receiving written notification by the Company that it has
         formally terminated negotiations with such Offeror, provided, however,
         that notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
         Company shall not be required to pay the Company Termination Fee
         (including, without limitation, any fees or expenses of EarthLink)
         pursuant to Section 8.3 and Section 7.1(c)(vii) upon any such
         termination and abandonment by EarthLink;

                 (iv)     if the Company does not enter into a definitive
         agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal within the
         Negotiation Period, the Company shall promptly reject and shall be
         deemed to have rejected such Superior Proposal and shall fully
         terminate and abandon its negotiations and discussions with such
         Offeror (a "Terminated Superior Proposal)");

                 (v)      if, after a Terminated Superior Proposal, the Company
         subsequently receives another bona fide, unsolicited Takeover Proposal
         from the same Offeror after the end of the Negotiation Period (a
         "Subsequent Proposal"), and the Company's Board of Directors, in good
         faith exercise of its fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders,
         determines by vote or resolution that such Subsequent Proposal is
         materially more favorable to the Company's stockholders from a
         financial point of view than such Offeror's prior Superior Proposal (a
         "Subsequent Superior Proposal"), then the Company shall have a second
         15 calendar day period following the day on which the Company's Board
         of Directors makes such determination (the "Subsequent Negotiation
         Period") in which to engage in the Negotiation Activities and enter
         into a definitive agreement with respect to such Subsequent Superior
         Proposal;





                                       50
<PAGE>   60
                 (vi)     Upon such determination by the Company's Board of
         Directors that a Subsequent Proposal constitutes a Subsequent Superior
         Proposal, then the Company shall so notify EarthLink pursuant to
         Section 8.1(c) hereof and EarthLink may in its discretion terminate
         this Agreement and abandon the Merger at any time during the
         Subsequent Negotiation Period, but only if done so prior to receiving
         written notification by the Company that it has formally terminated
         negotiations with such Offeror, provided, however, that the Company
         shall be required to pay the Company Termination Fee (including,
         without limitation, all fees or expenses of EarthLink) pursuant to
         Section 8.3 and Section 7.1(c)(viii) upon any such termination and
         abandonment by EarthLink; and

                 (vii)    if the Company does not enter into a definitive
         agreement with respect to such Subsequent Superior Proposal within the
         Subsequent Negotiation Period, the Company and its Board of Directors
         shall promptly reject and shall be deemed to have rejected such
         Subsequent Superior Proposal and shall fully terminate and abandon its
         negotiations and discussions with such Offeror (a "Terminated
         Subsequent Proposal");

provided, that the Company and its Representatives may engage in the activities
set forth in Sections 8.1(a)(ii), 8.1(a)(iii), 8.1(a)(iv) and/or 8.1(a)(v) as
applicable and as specifically permitted in this Section 8.1(b) only if (I) the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in its good faith judgment, after
consultation with outside legal counsel of the Company, that such action or
activity is reasonably necessary in order for the Board of Directors of the
Company to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, (II) the
Company has received from such third party Offeror an executed confidentiality
agreement with terms regarding confidentiality not less favorable to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement with EarthLink,
and (III) the Company has fully and completely complied with all other
provisions of Section 8.1.

         (c)     Notices.   If the Company (a) receives a Takeover Proposal, or
a request for nonpublic information relating to the Company (or any of its
Subsidiaries) or for access to the properties, books or records of the Company
(or any of its Subsidiaries) by any Person who is considering making or has
made a Takeover Proposal, (b) determines that a Takeover Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal, (c) determines to enter into a Negotiation Period, (d)
enters into a definitive agreement with respect to a Takeover Proposal,
Superior Proposal or a Subsequent Superior Proposal, (e) receives a Subsequent
Proposal, (f) determines that a Subsequent Proposal is a Subsequent Superior
Proposal, and/or (g) determines to enter into a Subsequent Negotiation Period,
the Company shall immediately inform EarthLink orally and shall as promptly as
practicable (in any event within one (1) calendar day) inform EarthLink in
writing of every such event, including terms and conditions of such Takeover
Proposal, Superior Proposal or Subsequent Superior Proposal (any of such
events, a "Proposal") and the identity of the person making it, forwarding a
copy of any written communications relating thereto.  The Company will keep
EarthLink fully informed on as prompt a basis as is practicable of the





                                       51
<PAGE>   61

status and details of any such Proposal or request and any related discussions
or negotiations, including by forwarding copies of any material written
communications relating thereto.  The Company will immediately cease and cause
its Subsidiaries, and its and their officers, directors, agents,
representatives and advisors, to cease any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect
to any of the foregoing, except that it shall use its best efforts to cause any
such parties in possession of confidential information about the Company (or
its Subsidiaries) that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company (or its
Subsidiaries) in connection with any of the foregoing to return or destroy all
such information in the possession of any such party or in the possession of
any agent or advisor of any such party.  The Company agrees not to release any
third party from, or waive any provisions of, any confidentiality or standstill
agreement to which it (or its Subsidiaries) is a party.  The Company shall
ensure that the officers, directors and employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and any investment banking firm or other advisor or representative
retained by such party are aware of and instructed to comply with the
restrictions described in this Section 8.1.  Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, nothing contained in this Section 8.1 shall
prohibit the Board of Directors of the Company, only to the minimum extent
required, from complying with the mandatory disclosure requirements of Rules
14e-2 and 14d-9 promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder with regard to an
any Proposal, after consultation with outside legal counsel; provided, that any
recommendation by the Board of Directors other than to recommend rejection of
such proposal shall be considered an immediate breach of this Section 8.1 and
be deemed to be a "withdrawal" as provided in Section 7.1(c)(iv)(X) hereof.

         (d)     Termination of Negotiations.   The Company agrees to cease and
terminate immediately, and to cause its Representatives to cease and terminate
immediately any negotiations (other than with EarthLink) with respect to any
Takeover Proposal.

SECTION 8.2.     Takeover Defenses.   The Company shall take such action with
respect to any anti-takeover provisions in its Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws, or afforded it by statute, to the extent necessary to consummate the
Merger on the terms set forth in the Agreement.

SECTION 8.3.     Fee and Expense Reimbursements.   In the event this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to any of Section 7.1(b)(i), Section 7.1(c)(i), Section
7.1(c)(ii), Section 7.1(c)(iii), Section 7.1(c)(iv), Section 7.1(c)(v), Section
7.1(c)(vi) or Section 7.1(c)(viii) hereof, the Company agrees to pay to
EarthLink in immediately available funds Nine Million Dollars ($9,000,000) PLUS
reimbursement of all EarthLink Merger transaction expenses (including without
limitation all legal, accounting and investment banking fees and expenses) (the
"Company Termination Fee"); provided, however, that if EarthLink terminates the
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i), and the Company also terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i), EarthLink shall nevertheless be
entitled to the Company Termination Fee, provided further, that if the
termination is pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) above, such fee shall be payable
only if within 12 months





                                       52
<PAGE>   62
after the date of termination of this Agreement, the Company shall have
consummated (or entered into an agreement to consummate) an Alternative
Transaction (as defined below).  An "Alternative Transaction" shall mean (i) a
merger, share exchange or other business combination or other transaction in
which more than 25% of the voting securities of the Company or all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company are acquired, including an
investment in or acquisition of securities of a Subsidiary of the Company to
the extent so material, or (ii) any acquisition from the stockholders of the
Company by tender offer, exchange offer or otherwise of more than 25% of the
outstanding Company Shares.  The Company Termination Fee payable under this
Section 8.3 shall be payable as a condition to the consummation of the
Alternative Transaction.  Payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be made
within one (1) business day following: (x) for terminations pursuant to
Sections 7.1(c) hereof, the date of such formal written termination by
EarthLink, and (y) for terminations pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i), the date the
Company closes the transaction contemplated by such definitive agreement for
the Alternative Transaction.  If the Company does not pay the Company
Termination Fee within such permitted periods, the Company shall pay to
EarthLink its costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred
in connection with any actions or lawsuits taken to collect such payment,
together with interest on the amount of any unpaid fee and/or expense (at the
published prime rate of Citibank, N.A. from the date such fee was required to
be paid to the date of payment).

SECTION 8.4.     Confidentiality.

         (a)     Neither the Company nor EarthLink shall issue any statement or
communication to the public or press regarding the proposed Merger without the
prior consent and approval of the other party, except as otherwise may be
required by law or regulatory authorities.

         (b)     If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VIII by
either the Company or EarthLink, the proposed terms of the Merger and all
Merger related discussions shall remain confidential and shall not be disclosed
to any person without the consent of the other party except as may be required
by law or regulatory authorities.

         (c)     Notwithstanding any other provision herein or in the
Confidentiality Agreement, Sections 1 through 7, 9 and 10 of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in effect subsequent to the execution of
this Agreement and shall continue to govern the confidentiality obligations of
the parties with respect to the Evaluation Material (as therein defined).
Except as set forth in this Section 8.4(c), the balance of the Confidentiality
Agreement is hereby terminated.

                                   ARTICLE IX

instrument delivered by the Company or EarthLink pursuant to this Agreement
