material to shareholders voting at the Court Meeting or the EGM, but only for
so long as the Covidien Board determines in good faith, after having
consulted with outside counsel, that such action is reasonably necessary or
advisable to give the Covidien Shareholders sufficient time to evaluate any
such disclosure or information so provided or disseminated, or (iii) if as of
the time the Court Meeting or EGM is scheduled (as set forth in the Joint
Proxy Statement), there are insufficient Covidien Shares represented (either

consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).



   3.6 | Switching to a Takeover Offer 
---|--- 



     | (a) | In the event (and only in the event) that Medtronic
reasonably considers (in its good faith discretion) that a competitive
situation exists or, based on facts known at the time, may reasonably be
expected to arise in connection with the Acquisition, Medtronic may elect
(and with the Panels consent, if required) to implement the Acquisition by
way of the Takeover Offer (rather than the Scheme), whether or not the Scheme
Document has been posted, subject to the terms of this Clause 3.6. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | If Medtronic elects to implement the Acquisition by way of
the Takeover Offer, Covidien undertakes to provide Medtronic as promptly as

that the Takeover Offer Document will contain provisions in accordance with
the terms and conditions set out in the Rule 2.5 Announcement, the relevant
Conditions and such other further terms and conditions as agreed (including

---|---|--- 
 



28 Takeover Offer shall be at least as favourable to the Covidien Shareholders
(except for the 80 per cent acceptance condition contemplated by paragraph 9
of Annex III to the Rule 2.5 Announcement) and the holders of Covidien Options
and Covidien Share Awards and Covidien Employees as those which would apply in
relation to the Scheme; 
---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | to reasonably co-operate and consult with Medtronic in the
preparation of the Takeover Offer Document or any other document or filing
which is required for the purposes of implementing the Acquisition;  
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | that, subject to the obligations of the Covidien Board
under the Takeover Rules, and unless the Covidien Board determines in good
faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial
advisor that, to do otherwise, would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the directors of Covidien or the
Takeover Rules, the Takeover Offer shall incorporate a recommendation to the
holders of the Covidien Shares from the Covidien Board to accept the Takeover
Offer, and such recommendation will not be withdrawn, adversely modified or
qualified except as contemplated by Clause 5.3. 
---|---|--- 



      | (d) | If Medtronic elects to implement the Acquisition by way of
the Takeover Offer in accordance with Clause 3.6(a), the Parties mutually
agree: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | to prepare and file with, or submit to, the SEC all
documents, amendments and supplements required to be filed therewith or
submitted thereto pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act in
connection with the Takeover Offer, and, save where there has been a Covidien
Change of Recommendation, each Party shall have reasonable opportunities to
review and make comments on all such documents, amendments and supplements
and, following reasonable accommodation of such comments and approval of such
documents, amendments and supplements by the other Party, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, file or submit, as the case may
be, such documents, amendments and supplements with or to the SEC; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | to provide the other Party with any comments received from
the SEC on any documents filed by it with the SEC promptly after receipt
thereof, other than with respect to any such documents to the extent related
to a Covidien Alternative Proposal; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | to provide the other Party with reasonable prior notice of
any proposed oral communication with the SEC and, except to the extent
prohibited by the SEC, afford the other Party reasonable opportunity to
participate therein, other than with respect to any such communication to the
extent related to a Covidien Alternative Proposal. 
---|---|--- 
 



29 cause Holdco and/or IrSub (or their respective designees) to effect as
promptly as reasonably practicable a compulsory acquisition of any Covidien
Shares under section 204 of the Act not acquired in the Takeover Offer for
the same consideration per share. 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | For the avoidance of doubt and except as may be required by
the Takeover Rules (and without limiting any other provision of this
Agreement), nothing in this Clause 3.6 shall require Covidien to provide
Medtronic with any information with respect to, or to otherwise take or fail
to take any action in connection with Covidiens consideration of or response
to, any actual or potential Covidien Alternative Proposal. 
---|---|--- 
 



   3.7 | Preparation of Joint Proxy Statement and Form S-4; Medtronic
Shareholders Meeting 
---|--- 



     | (a) | As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date
hereof, each of the Parties shall cooperate in preparing and shall cause to be
filed with the SEC (i) mutually acceptable joint proxy materials which
shall constitute (A) the Scheme Document, which shall also constitute the
proxy statement relating to the matters to be submitted to the Covidien
Shareholders at the Court Meeting and the EGM and (B) the proxy statement
relating to the matters to be submitted to the Medtronic Shareholders at the
Medtronic Shareholders Meeting (such joint proxy materials, and any amendments
or supplements thereto, the "Joint Proxy Statement") and (ii) a registration
statement on Form S-4 (of which the Joint Proxy Statement will form a part)
with respect to the issuance of Holdco Shares in respect of the Scheme and
Merger (the "Form S-4"). Each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the Joint Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC and the Form S-4
to be declared effective by the SEC, to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as
is necessary to consummate the Acquisition and the Merger, and to mail the
Joint Proxy Statement to their respective shareholders as promptly as
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective, to the extent required
by applicable Law. 
---|---|--- 
 

Each of the Parties shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof,
provide the other with copies of any written comments and advise the other
Party of any oral comments with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement or the
Form S-4 received from the SEC. Each Party shall cooperate and provide the
other Party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 prior to
filing such with the SEC, and each Party will promptly provide the other Party
with a copy of all such filings made with the SEC. Each Party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take any action required to be taken by it under
any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the Acquisition or the
Merger, and each Party shall furnish all information concerning it and the
holders of its capital stock as may be reasonably requested in connection
with any such action. Each Party will advise the other Party, promptly after
it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has become
effective, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the 

 



30  qualification of the Holdco Shares issuable in connection with the
Acquisition and the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any
request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form
S-4. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to
any of the Parties, or their respective Affiliates, officers or directors,
should be discovered by either Party, and such information should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement or the
Form S-4 so that such documents would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other Party and, to the extent required by Law, an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the Covidien
Shareholders and the Medtronic Shareholders.



     | (b) |

Medtronic shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of the Medtronic Shareholders (the "Medtronic Shareholders
Meeting") as promptly as practicable following the date upon which the Form
S-4 becomes effective for the purpose of obtaining the adoption of the plan of
merger set forth in this Agreement by the holders of Medtronic Shares
as required by the MBCA and Article I of the Medtronic Bylaws (the "Medtronic
Shareholder Approval"). Save as required by Law, Medtronic shall not adjourn
or postpone (or propose an adjournment or postponement of) the
Medtronic Shareholders Meeting after filing of the Form S-4 without the
consent of Covidien (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed); provided, however, that Medtronic may, without the consent of
Covidien, adjourn or postpone (or propose to adjourn or postpone) the
Medtronic Shareholders Meeting (i) to the extent reasonably necessary to
ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement
or Form-S-4 is provided to the Medtronic Shareholders or to permit
dissemination of information which is material to shareholders voting at the
Medtronic Shareholders Meeting, but only for so long as the Medtronic Board
determines in good faith, after having consulted with outside counsel, that
such action is reasonably necessary or advisable to give the Medtronic
Shareholders sufficient time to evaluate any such disclosure or information so
provided or disseminated, or (ii) if as of the time the Medtronic Shareholders
Meeting is scheduled (as set forth in the Joint Proxy Statement), there are
insufficient Medtronic Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) (A)
to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Medtronic
Shareholders Meeting, but only until a meeting can be held at which there are
a sufficient number of Medtronic Shares represented to constitute a quorum or
(B) voting in favour of the adoption of the plan of merger set forth in this
Agreement so as to obtain the Medtronic Shareholder Approval, but only until
a meeting can be held at which there are a sufficient number of votes of
holders of Medtronic Shares to obtain the Medtronic Shareholder Approval;
provided, that the Medtronic Shareholders Meeting is not postponed or
adjourned to a date that is more than 30 days after the date for which the
Medtronic Shareholders Meeting was originally scheduled (other than any
adjournments or postponements required

   4. | EQUITY AWARDS 
---|--- 



   4.1 | Covidien Options 
---|--- 

As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the occurrence of
the Effective Time and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
each Covidien Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be assumed by Holdco and shall be converted into
an option (a "Covidien Rollover Option") to acquire (a) that number of whole
Holdco Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (i) the number of Covidien Shares subject to such
Covidien Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the Equity
Award Conversion Ratio, (b) at an exercise price per Holdco Share (rounded up
to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the
exercise price per Covidien Share of such Covidien Option by (ii) the Equity
Award Conversion Ratio. Except as otherwise provided in this Clause 4.1, each
such Covidien Rollover Option assumed and converted pursuant to this Clause
4.1 shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and
conditions as applied to the corresponding Covidien Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

 



32 ---|--- 



     | (a) | This Clause 4.2(a) shall apply to Covidien Share Awards
granted prior to the date of this Agreement: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Covidien
Share Award covered by this Clause 4.2(a) that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the occurrence of the
Effective Time and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive from Holdco on the
Completion Date the Scheme Consideration, less the Applicable Withholding
Amount, in respect of each Covidien Share (including any corresponding
dividend equivalent units) underlying such Covidien Share Award. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | For any performance-based Covidien Share Award covered by
this Clause 4.2(a), the number of Covidien Shares underlying such Covidien
Share Award (including any corresponding dividend equivalent units) shall
be based on actual performance (with the "Ending Stock Price" (as defined in
the applicable award agreement) measured during the 60-trading day period
ending on the date that is the sixth Business Day prior to the date on which
occurs the Effective Time). 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | The Applicable Withholding Amount covered under this
Clause 4.2(a) shall first be applied to reduce the aggregate Share
Consideration (based on the Medtronic Closing Price) payable in respect of the
cancellation of such holders Covidien Share Award and, to the extent such
Applicable Withholding Amount exceeds the aggregate Share Consideration
payable in respect of the cancellation of such holders Covidien Share Award,
the excess of such Applicable Withholding Amount over the aggregate Share
Consideration payable in respect of the cancellation of such holders Covidien
Share Award shall be applied to reduce the aggregate Cash Consideration
payable in respect of the cancellation of such holders Covidien Share Award. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | This Clause 4.2(b) shall apply to Covidien Share Awards
granted on or after the date of this Agreement. As of immediately prior to the

4.2(b) (including any corresponding dividend equivalent units) that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
occurrence of the Effective Time and without any action on the part of the
holders thereof, be converted into an award (a "Covidien Rollover Share
Award") with respect to a number of Holdco Shares (rounded to the nearest
whole share) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the applicable
number of Covidien Shares subject to such Covidien Share Award (including any
corresponding dividend equivalent units) immediately prior to the Effective
Time by (ii) the Equity Award Conversion Ratio. Except as otherwise provided
in this Clause 4.2(b), each Covidien Rollover Share Award assumed and
converted pursuant to this Clause 4.2(b) shall continue to have, and shall be
subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding
Covidien Share Award immediately prior to the Effective Time.

applicable Laws and NYSE regulations, under the terms of the Medtronic Share
Plans covering the reserved but unissued Medtronic Shares, except that (i)
Medtronic Shares covered by such awards will be Holdco Shares and (ii) all
references to a number of Medtronic Shares will be changed to references to
Holdco Shares. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Medtronic Board
(or, if appropriate, any committee administering Medtronics stock-
based incentive plans) and Holdco shall adopt such resolutions and take such
other actions as may be reasonably required to effectuate the foregoing
provisions of this Clause 4.4 subject to any adjustments that may be required
by Irish law or by virtue of the fact that Holdco will be an Irish public
limited company. 
---|---|--- 



   4.5 | Reasonable Best Efforts 
---|--- 

Each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take any actions
reasonably necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this
Clause 4, including, without limitation, having the applicable board or

resolutions necessary to effect the foregoing.

 



34 ---|--- 

Covidien shall procure that a special resolution be put before the Covidien
Shareholders at the EGM proposing that the Articles of Association of Covidien
be amended so that any Covidien Shares allotted following the EGM will either
be subject to the terms of the Scheme or acquired by Holdco for the
same consideration per Covidien Share as shall be payable to Covidien
Shareholders under the Scheme (depending upon the timing of such allotment);
provided, however, that nothing in such amendment to the Articles of
Association of Covidien shall prohibit the sale (whether on a stock exchange
or otherwise) of any Covidien Shares issued on the exercise of Covidien
Options or vesting or settlement of Covidien Share Awards, as applicable,
following the EGM but prior to the sanction of the Scheme by the High Court,
it being always acknowledged that each and every Covidien Share will be bound
by the terms of the Scheme.

Covidien Share Awards shall be aggregated and sold in the market by the
Exchange Agent with the net proceeds of any such sale distributed pro-rata to
the holders of such Covidien Options or Covidien Share Awards in accordance
with the Fractional Entitlements to which they would otherwise have been
entitled.

any "standstill" or similar obligation of any person with respect to Covidien
or any of its Subsidiaries (provided that Covidien shall not be required to
take, or be prohibited from taking, any action otherwise prohibited or
required by this subclause (iii) if the Covidien Board determines in good

receives a bona fide written Covidien Alternative Proposal or enquiry
or proposal from a person who is intending on making a Covidien Alternative
Proposal and the Covidien Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with Covidiens financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that (i) such
Covidien Alternative Proposal, enquiry or proposal either constitutes a
Covidien Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in a
Covidien Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure to take the actions described
in clauses (x) and (y) below would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and which Covidien
Alternative Proposal, enquiry or proposal was made after the date of this
Agreement and did not otherwise result from a breach of this Clause 5.3,
Covidien may take any or all of the following actions: (x) furnish nonpublic
information to the third party (and any persons Acting in Concert with such
third party and to their respective potential financing sources and
Representatives) making or intending to make such Covidien Alternative
Proposal (provided that all such information has previously been provided to
Medtronic or is provided to Medtronic substantially concurrently with the
time it is provided to such person(s)), if, and only if, prior to so
furnishing such information, Covidien receives from the third party an
executed confidentiality agreement on terms (including any "standstill" terms,
which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the "fall away"
provisions to the "standstill" terms set forth in the Confidentiality
Agreement) no less restrictive of such person than the Confidentiality
Agreement and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party
with respect to such Covidien Alternative Proposal. Covidien will (1) promptly
(and in any event within 24 hours of receipt) notify Medtronic orally and in
writing of the receipt of any Covidien Alternative Proposal or any initial

reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of any material change to
the terms and status of any such Covidien Alternative Proposal. Without
limiting the generality of clause (2) of the preceding sentence, Covidien
shall provide to Medtronic as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt or
delivery thereof (and in any event within 24 hours of receipt or delivery)

Representatives) that is material to understanding such Covidien Alternative
Proposal and of all written material provided by Covidien or any of its
Subsidiaries to the person making a Covidien Alternative Proposal (or such
persons Representatives) that is material to understanding any
counterproposal or other material substantive response by Covidien to such
Covidien Alternative Proposal, including draft agreements or term sheets
submitted by either party in connection therewith. Covidien shall not, and

agreement with any person subsequent to the date of this Agreement that

Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum
of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, transaction agreement, implementation agreement, option agreement,

inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
provided, however, that Covidien shall have provided prior written notice to

or expressly reaffirms the Scheme Recommendation or the recommendation
contemplated by Clause 3.6(c)(iii), as applicable, or (y) does not

Recommendation or Covidien is not yet permitted to terminate this Agreement

Rules) for (i) the acquisition of Covidien by scheme of arrangement, takeover
offer or business combination transaction; (ii) the acquisition by any person
of 20% or more of the assets of Covidien and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, measured by either book value or fair market value (including equity

     | (h) | As used in this Agreement "Covidien Superior Proposal" shall
mean a written Covidien Alternative Proposal made by any person that the
Covidien Board determines in good faith (after consultation with Covidiens

such proposal as the Covidien Board considers to be appropriate (it being
understood that, for purposes of the definition of "Covidien Superior
Proposal", references to "20%" and "80%" in the definition of
Covidien Alternative Proposal shall be deemed to refer to "50%").

agreement, understanding or arrangement providing for a Covidien Superior
Proposal, provided that, (w) the Covidien Board has concluded in good faith
(after consultation with Covidiens financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) that (1) a Covidien Alternative Proposal constitutes a Covidien
Superior Proposal and (2) the failure to take such action would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, (x) promptly upon the Covidien Boards determination that a
Covidien Superior Proposal exists (and in any event, within 24 hours of such
determination), Covidien has provided a written notice to Medtronic (a
"Covidien Superior Proposal Notice") advising Medtronic that Covidien has
received a Covidien Alternative Proposal and specifying the information with
respect thereto required by Clause 5.3(b) and including written notice of the
determination of the Covidien Board that the Covidien Alternative Proposal
constitutes a Covidien Superior Proposal, (y) Covidien has provided Medtronic
with an opportunity, for a period of three Business Days from the time of
delivery to Medtronic of the Covidien Superior Proposal Notice (as may be
extended pursuant to the proviso below, the "Medtronic Notice Period"), to
propose to amend (the "Medtronic Right to Match") the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the Acquisition, including an increase in, or modification
of, the Scheme Consideration (any such proposed transaction, a "Medtronic
Revised Acquisition"), such that the Covidien Superior Proposal no longer
constitutes a Covidien Superior Proposal, and (z) at the end of such Medtronic
Notice Period, the Covidien Board has determined (after consultation with
Covidiens financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that (i) the Covidien
Superior Proposal continues to be a Covidien Superior Proposal notwithstanding
the Medtronic Revised Acquisition and taking into account all amendments and
proposed changes made thereto during the Medtronic Notice Period and (ii) the
failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law. In the event that
during the Medtronic Notice Period any material revision is made to the terms
of the Covidien Superior Proposal, Covidien shall be required, upon each such
revision, to deliver a new Covidien Superior Proposal Notice to Medtronic and
to comply with the requirements of this Clause 5.3(i)(i) with respect to such

---|---|--- 
 



56 returns, particulars, resolutions and documents required to be filed or to be
delivered on behalf of Covidien with the Registrar of Companies in Ireland.
As of their respective dates, or, if amended, as of the date of the last such
amendment, the Covidien SEC Documents complied in all material respects with
the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), as the case may be,
and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and none of

which they were made not misleading.

are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to
be disclosed by Covidien in the reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarised and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to Covidiens management
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the

detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of Covidien, (b) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are

assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements.

     | (g) | _Compliance with Law; Permits_. 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | Covidien and each of Covidiens Subsidiaries are in
compliance with and are not in default under or in violation of any Laws
applicable to Covidien, such Subsidiaries or any of their respective

the aggregate, a Covidien Material Adverse Effect.

all franchises, grants, authorisations, licenses, permits, easements,

facilitate the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Acquisition and the Merger). The Parties agree that Medtronic
shall, on behalf of the Parties, control and lead all communications and
strategy relating to the Antitrust Laws (provided that Covidien is not
constrained from complying with applicable Law), provided, further, that the
Parties shall consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good
faith the views of one another, regarding the form and content of any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of either Party in connection
with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law prior to their
submission. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) |

Subject to the provisos in Clause 7.2(d) and to the fullest extent permissible
under applicable Law, Medtronic and Covidien shall (i) promptly advise each
other of (and Medtronic or Covidien shall so advise with respect to written or
material oral communications received by any Subsidiary of Medtronic or
Covidien, as the case may be) any written or material oral communication to
or from any Relevant Authority in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Acquisition or the
Merger); (ii) not participate in any meeting or discussion with any Relevant
Authority in respect of any filing, investigation, or enquiry concerning this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it
consults with the other Party in advance, and, unless prohibited by such
Relevant Authority, gives the other Party the opportunity to attend; and
(iii) promptly furnish the other Party with copies of all correspondence,
filings, and written communications between them and their Subsidiaries and
Representatives, on the one hand, and any Relevant Authority or its
respective staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that materials may be
redacted (x) to remove references concerning the valuation of the businesses
of 

---|---|--- 
 



95 necessary to comply with contractual arrangements or address reasonable
privilege or confidentiality concerns (provided that the redacting Party
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such information to be
provided in a manner that would not result in such privilege concerns) and (z)
to prevent the exchange of confidential information as required by applicable
Law. With respect to any notice, documentation or other communication required
to be given by either Party to the other Party pursuant to this Clause 7.2(e),
such first Party may give such notice, documentation or other
communication to such second Partys outside counsel, instead of directly to
such second Party, if such first Party reasonably believes that doing so is
required by, or advisable pursuant to, applicable Law. The Parties may, as
they deem advisable and necessary, designate any competitively sensitive
materials provided to the other under this Clause 7.2(e) as "outside counsel
only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given
only to outside counsel of the recipient and shall not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without
the advance written consent of the Party providing such materials. 
---|--- 
 



     | (f) | In the event that the latest date on which the High Court
and/or the Panel would permit Completion to occur is prior to the End Date,
the Parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain
consent of the High Court and/or the Panel, as applicable, to an extension of
such latest date (but not beyond the End Date). If Rule 12(b)(i) of the
Takeover Rules may reasonably be expected to cause the Scheme to lapse, the
Parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain consent
of the Panel to avoid lapsing of the Scheme pursuant to Rule 12(b)(i) of the
Takeover Rules. If (i) the High Court and/or the Panel require the lapsing of
the Scheme prior to the End Date, (ii) the Scheme lapses pursuant to Rule
12(b)(i) of the Takeover Rules, (iii) Condition 1 fails to be satisfied or
(iv) the Scheme lapses pursuant to paragraph 7 of Annex III to the Rule 2.5
Announcement as a result of the Scheme failing to have become effective on or
prior to the End Date, the Parties shall (unless and until this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Clause 9) take all reasonable actions required in order
to re-initiate the Scheme process as promptly as reasonably practicable (it
being understood that no such lapsing described in subclause (i), (ii), (iii)
or (iv) shall, in and of itself, result in a termination of, or otherwise
affect any rights or obligations of any Party under, this Agreement).  
---|---|--- 



     | (g) |

In furtherance and not in limitation of the other covenants contained in this
Clause 7.2, and to resolve the objections, if any, that a Relevant Authority
may assert under any Antitrust Law with respect to the Acquisition or the
Merger, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Relevant Authority with respect to
the Acquisition or the Merger so as to enable the Completion to occur as
promptly as practicable and in any event no later than the End Date, Medtronic
and Covidien agree to propose, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent
decree or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license, or disposition of any
businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or properties of Medtronic
or Covidien (or any of their respective 

---|---|--- 
 



96 held by Medtronic or Covidien (or any of their respective Subsidiaries),
including by proposing, negotiating, committing to, and effecting, any
ancillary agreements or arrangements reasonably necessary to effectuate such
sale, divestiture, license, or disposition (including, but not limited to, any
temporary, pre-divestiture hold separate order) (each, a
"Divestiture Action") as may be required in order to obtain all Clearances
required directly or indirectly under any Antitrust Law or to avoid the
commencement of any action to prohibit the Acquisition or the Merger under any
Antitrust Law, or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any action or
proceeding seeking to prohibit the Acquisition or the Merger or delay
Completion beyond the End Date. To assist Medtronic in complying with its
obligations set forth in this Clause 7.2, Covidien shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, enter into one or more agreements requested by Medtronic to
be entered into by any of them prior to the Completion with respect to
any transaction to divest any of the businesses, assets, equity interests,
product lines or properties of Covidien or any of its Subsidiaries or any
equity interest in any joint venture held by Covidien or any of its
Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the consummation of the transactions
provided for in any such agreement for a Divestiture Action shall be
conditioned upon the Completion. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, nothing in this Clause 7.2 shall require, or be deemed to
require, Medtronic or Covidien (or any of their respective Subsidiaries), or
permit, or be deemed to permit, Covidien (or any of its Subsidiaries), without
the prior written consent of Medtronic, to (i) take any action, agree to take
any action, or consent to the taking of any action (including with respect to
selling, holding separate, or otherwise disposing of, any business or assets
or conducting its or its Subsidiaries or, following consummation of the
Acquisition and the Merger, Holdcos, business, in any specified manner), if
doing so would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result in a material adverse effect on the business, operations or financial
condition of Holdco and its Subsidiaries (including Medtronic, Covidien and
their respective Subsidiaries), taken as a whole (following consummation of
the Acquisition and the Merger) or (ii) take any action, agree to take any
action, or consent to the taking of any action, other than a Divestiture
Action, where such action would limit Medtronics or Covidiens freedom of
action or the conduct of any business, asset, product line or property of
Medtronic or Covidien (or one or more of their respective Subsidiaries) or
any joint venture in which Medtronic or Covidien (or one or more of their
respective Subsidiaries) holds an equity interest. 
---|--- 



     | (h) | In no event shall Covidien or Medtronic be required to pay
any material fee, penalty or other consideration in connection with obtaining
any Clearance under any applicable Antitrust Law, other than customary filing
or application fees in connection with any such Clearance.

any agreement to which Covidien or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in
respect of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time

were directors, officers or employees of Covidien or any of its Subsidiaries
in respect of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time

however, that in the event any claim, action, suit proceeding or investigation
is pending, asserted or made either prior to the Effective Time or within
such six year period, all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
or exculpation required to be continued pursuant to this Clause 7.3(a) in
respect thereof shall continue until disposition thereof.

Subsidiaries or as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of
another company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise if such service was

Time (including actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time arising out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

Law, indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director, officer or

shall cause to be maintained in effect (i) the coverage provided by the
policies of directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance in effect as of the Effective Time maintained

the Effective Time (provided that Holdco may substitute therefor policies with
a carrier with comparable credit ratings to the existing carrier of at least
the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less
favourable to the insured) or (ii) a "tail" policy (which Covidien may
purchase at its option prior to the Effective Time, and, in such case, Holdco
shall cause such policy to be in full force and effect, and shall cause all
obligations thereunder to be honoured by Covidien) under Covidiens existing
directors and officers insurance policy that covers those persons who are

effect as of the date hereof for actions and omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time, is from a carrier with comparable credit ratings to
Covidiens existing directors and officers insurance policy carrier and

the date hereof; provided, however, that, after the Effective Time, Holdco
shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last
annual premium paid by Covidien prior to the date hereof in respect of the
coverages required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall
purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount.

any of its Subsidiaries or the Organisational Documents of Medtronic or any

Act (or any other applicable Law) or otherwise. The provisions of this Clause
7.3 shall survive the consummation of the Acquisition and the Merger and
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
any Indemnified Party without the written consent of such affected Indemnified
Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties shall be third
party beneficiaries of this Clause 7.3 and shall be entitled to enforce the
covenants contained in this Clause 7.3). Holdco shall pay all reasonable

assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Holdco
assume the obligations set forth in this Clause 7.3.

(i) base compensation that is no less favourable to such Covidien Employee
than the base compensation provided to such Covidien Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time; (ii) an annual cash bonus opportunity
(performance metrics and target bonus as a percentage of base compensation)
that is no less favorable than such Covidien Employees annual cash bonus
opportunity (performance metrics and target bonus as a percentage of base
compensation) in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (iii)
other compensation opportunities and benefits that are substantially
comparable, in the aggregate to those provided to such Covidien Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Further, and notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Holdco shall or shall
cause its applicable Subsidiary to, assume, honor and fulfill all Covidien
Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to
the date hereof or as subsequently amended as permitted pursuant to the terms
of such Covidien Benefit Plans or as permitted pursuant to Clause 5.1(b)(iii)

Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Covidien Benefit
Plan in which such Covidien Employee participated or was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided that the
foregoing shall not apply with respect to any benefit accrual under any
defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that its application would
result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (A) each Covidien Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a Covidien
Benefit Plan in which such Covidien Employee participated immediately before
the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"), and (B) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Covidien Employee, Holdco shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause (1) all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee
and his or her covered dependents, unless and to the extent the individual,
immediately prior to entry in the New Plans, was subject to such conditions
under the comparable Old Plans, and (2) any eligible expenses incurred by such
employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan
year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | Holdco and Medtronic hereby acknowledge that a "change of
control" (or similar phrase) within the meaning of any Covidien Benefit Plan
will occur at or prior to the Effective Time, as applicable.

the rights of Holdco or Medtronic or any affiliate of Medtronic, which rights
are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any
Covidien Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without
cause. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
nothing in this Clause 7.4 shall (x) be deemed or construed to be an amendment
or other modification of any Covidien Benefit Plan or employee benefit plan of
Holdco or Medtronic, or (y) create any third party rights in any current or
former service provider or employee of Holdco, Medtronic, Covidien or any of
their respective affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

local Tax law) to be made with respect to Covidien and any or all of its
Subsidiaries.



   7.6 | Stock Exchange Listing 
---|--- 

Holdco and Medtronic shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
cause (i) the Holdco Shares to be delivered pursuant to the Merger and (ii)
all of the Share Consideration to be issued in the Acquisition to be approved

   7.7 | Holdco Board of Directors 
---|---

directors that comprise the full Holdco Board shall be no more than 13, and

Corporate Governance Committee of the Medtronic Board pursuant to the director
nomination process set forth in Medtronics 2014 proxy statement on Schedule
14A to be filed with the SEC in consultation with Covidien. In the event that,
prior to the Effective Time, any designee of Covidien to the Holdco Board is
unable to serve on such board of directors, a replacement shall be similarly

to delay the Completion, the Medtronic Parties shall use their reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do,

applicable Laws to consummate, no later than the date the Completion is
required to occur pursuant to this Agreement, the Financing. The Medtronic
Parties shall keep Covidien informed on a reasonably current basis of the
status of their efforts to arrange the Financing, including providing copies
of all executed credit agreements and indentures; provided that in no event
will the Medtronic Parties be under any obligation to disclose any
information that is subject to attorney-client or similar privilege (provided
that the Medtronic Parties shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to cause any such information to be disclosed in a manner that would
not result in the loss of any such privilege).

     | (b) | Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Medtronic Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that their

     | (iii) |

_Transferred Certificates; Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If payment

transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance of the
Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the
Medtronic Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax either has been paid or is
not applicable. In the event that any Medtronic Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the holders compliance with the replacement
requirements established by the Exchange Agent, including, if necessary, the
posting by the holder of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to the Medtronic Certificate,

---|---|--- 



     | (v) | _No Further Ownership Rights in Medtronic Shares_. Until
surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Medtronic Certificate or Medtronic
Book Entry Share shall, after the Merger Effective Time, represent for
all purposes only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable
Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Clause 8.2, the issuance or
payment of which shall be deemed to be the satisfaction in full of all rights
pertaining to Medtronic converted in the Merger. At the Merger Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of Medtronic shall be closed, and there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the Medtronic Shares which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time. If, after the Merger Effective

the Merger Consideration (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar applicable Laws).

respect thereto) from the Medtronic Exchange Fund delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

     | (viii) | _Withholding_. MergerSub and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount payable pursuant to this

payment under the Code or any other provision of federal, state, local or
non-U.S. Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld,
such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such consideration would
otherwise have been paid.

Each option or stock appreciation right to acquire Medtronic Shares or to
receive a cash payment based on the value thereof granted under any Medtronic
Share Plan (a "Medtronic Share Option") that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, cease to represent an
option or stock appreciation right based on Medtronic Shares and shall be
converted, at the Effective Time, into an option or stock appreciation right,
on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the Medtronic Share
Option (but taking into account any changes thereto provided for in the
applicable Medtronic Share Plan, in 

---|---|--- 
 



116 restrictions on replicating such terms and conditions under Irish Law), based
on that number of Holdco Shares equal to the number of Medtronic Shares
subject to such Medtronic Share Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time, at a price per share equal to the per share exercise price specified in
such Medtronic Share Option immediately prior to the Effective Time;  
---|--- 



     | (ii) | Each issued and outstanding Medtronic Share subject to
vesting or other lapse restrictions pursuant to the Medtronic Share Plans
immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "Restricted Medtronic
Share") shall, as of the Effective Time, cease to represent a right to
acquire a Medtronic Share and shall be converted into the right to receive a
Holdco Share, subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting and
other lapse restrictions to the extent that they may be replicated having
regard to any applicable restrictions under Irish Law) as were applicable to
the Restricted Medtronic Share in respect of which it was issued; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | Each stock-based award, other than a Medtronic Share
Option or Restricted Medtronic Share ("Other Medtronic Share-Based Awards"),
granted under any Medtronic Share Plan and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, cease to represent an
award based on Medtronic Shares and shall be converted into an award based on
a number of Holdco Shares equal to the number of Medtronic Shares covered by
such Other Medtronic Share-Based Award, provided that such a converted stock-
based right or award shall be subject to the same terms and conditions
(including the vesting terms, to the extent that they may be
replicated having regard to any applicable restrictions under Irish Law) as
were applicable to such Other Medtronic Share-Based Award in respect of which
it was issued. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Holdco
shall deliver to the holders of Medtronic Share Options, Restricted Medtronic
Shares and Other Medtronic Share-Based Awards appropriate notices setting
forth such holders rights pursuant to the Medtronic Share Plans, and the
agreements evidencing the grants of such Medtronic Share Options, Restricted
Medtronic Shares and Other Medtronic Share-Based Awards, as the case may be,
shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the
adjustments required by this Clause 8.3 after giving effect to the Merger and
the assumption by Holdco as set forth above). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) |

Holdco shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of Holdco Shares for delivery with respect to
Medtronic Share Options, Restricted Medtronic Shares and Other Medtronic
Share-Based Awards assumed by it in accordance with this Clause 8.3. If
requested by Medtronic prior to the Effective Time, Holdco shall, no later
than the tenth day following the Effective Date, file a registration
statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form) with
respect to the Holdco Shares subject to such Medtronic 

---|---|--- 
 



117 subsequent to the Merger will be subject to the reporting requirements under
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, where applicable, Holdco shall administer
the Medtronic Share Plans assumed pursuant to this Clause 8.3 in a manner that
complies with Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent the
applicable Medtronic Share Plan complied with such rule prior to the Merger.

---|---|---

party to any agreements with the Financing Sources) in connection with this
Agreement, the Acquisition, the Financing or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise; provided that, following consummation of the Acquisition, the
foregoing will not limit the rights of any parties under any agreements with
the Financing Sources. In addition, in no event will any Financing Source be
liable for consequential, special, exemplary, punitive or indirect damages
(including any loss of profits, business or anticipated savings) or damages of
a tortuous nature (it being expressly agreed that the Financing Sources in
their capacities as such shall be third party beneficiaries of this Clause
9.1(c)(ii) and shall be entitled to the protections of the provisions
contained in this Clause 9.1(c)(ii) as if they were a party to this
Agreement);

     | (d) | For the avoidance of doubt, termination of this Agreement

   10.1 | Announcements 
---|--- 

Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, the Takeover Rules, a court
order, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the SEC, the rules of the NYSE or
any Relevant Authority (including, without limitation, the Panel), the Parties
shall consult together as to the terms of, the timing of and the manner
of publication of any formal public announcement which either Party may make
primarily regarding the Acquisition, the Scheme, the Merger or this Agreement.
Medtronic and Covidien shall give each other a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon any such public announcement and shall not issue any
such public announcement prior to such consultation, except as may be required
by applicable Law, the Takeover Rules, a court order, the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, the SEC, the rules of the NYSE or any Relevant Authority
(including, without limitation, the Panel). For the avoidance of doubt, the
provisions of this Clause 10.1 do not apply to (a) any announcement, document
or publication in connection with a Covidien Alternative Proposal or Covidien
Superior Proposal or a change in the Scheme Recommendation or any amendment to
the terms of the Scheme proposed by Medtronic that would effect an increase in
the Scheme Consideration whether before or after a withdrawal or adverse
modification of the Scheme Recommendation or (b) any announcement, document or
publication in connection with a Medtronic Alternative Proposal or Medtronic
Superior Proposal or a change in the Medtronic Recommendation.

---|---|--- 



   10.3 | Assignment 
---|--- 

Neither Party shall assign all or any part of the benefit of, or rights
or benefits under, this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
other Party; provided that Medtronic may assign any or all of its rights and
interests hereunder to one or more of its Subsidiaries, provided the prior
consent in writing has been obtained from the Panel in respect of such
assignment, but no such assignment shall relieve Medtronic of its obligations
hereunder.



   10.4 | Counterparts 
---|--- 

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which,
taken together, shall constitute one and the same agreement, and each Party
may enter into this Agreement by executing a counterpart and delivering it to
the other Party (by hand delivery, facsimile process, e-mail or otherwise).

 



   10.5 | Amendment 
---|--- 

No amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless the same shall
be evidenced in writing duly executed by each of the Parties, except that,
following approval by the Covidien Shareholders or the Medtronic Shareholders,
there shall be no amendment to the provisions hereof which by applicable Law
would require further approval by the Covidien Shareholders or the Medtronic
Shareholders without such further approval nor shall there be any amendment or
change not permitted under applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, this Clause 10.5 and Clauses 9.1(c)(ii), 10.13(c) and
10.13(d) may not be amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified in any
manner adverse to the Financing Sources without the prior written consent of
the Financing Sources (it being expressly agreed that the Financing Sources
in their capacities as such shall be third party beneficiaries of this Clause
10.5 and shall be entitled to the protections of the provisions contained in
this Clause 10.5 as if they were a party to this Agreement).

 



123 ---|--- 

This Agreement, together with the Confidentiality Agreement, the Expenses
Reimbursement Agreement and any documents delivered by Medtronic and Covidien
in connection herewith (including the Medtronic Disclosure Schedule and the
Covidien Disclosure Schedule), constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes
all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between
Medtronic and Covidien with respect to the subject matter hereof, it being
understood that the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement. 



   10.7 | Inadequacy of Damages 
---|--- 

Each Party agrees that damages would not be an adequate remedy for any breach
by it of this Agreement and accordingly each Party shall be entitled, without
proof of special damages, to the remedies of injunction, specific performance
or other equitable relief for any threatened or actual breach of
this Agreement.



   10.8 | Remedies and Waivers 
---|--- 

No delay or omission by either Party to this Agreement in exercising any
right, power or remedy provided by Law or under this Agreement shall:



     | (a) | affect that right, power or remedy; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | operate as a waiver of it. 
---|---|--- 

The exercise or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy provided by
Law or under this Agreement shall not preclude any other or further exercise
of it or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.



   10.9 | Severability 
---|--- 



     | (a) | If any term, provision, covenant or condition of this
Agreement or the Acquisition is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Relevant Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement or, as appropriate,
the terms and conditions of the Acquisition, so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an equitable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible in accordance with applicable law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties intend that the remedies and
limitations thereon contained in this Agreement (including, without
limitation, Clauses 9.1(b), 9.1(c), 9.1(d) and 9.2) and the Expenses
Reimbursement Agreement shall be construed as integral parts of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and therefore shall not
be severable in any manner that increases or decreases a Partys liability or
obligations hereunder or thereunder. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | If at any time any provision of this Agreement is or becomes
illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect under the Law of any
jurisdiction, that shall not affect or impair: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | The legality, validity or enforceability in that
jurisdiction of any other provision of this Agreement; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | The legality, validity or enforceability under the Law of
any other jurisdiction of that or any other provision of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
 



124 ---|--- 



     | (a) | Nothing in this Agreement and no action taken by the Parties
pursuant to this Agreement shall constitute, or be deemed to constitute, a
partnership, association, joint venture or other co-operative entity between
any of the Parties. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Nothing in this Agreement and no action taken by the Parties
pursuant to this Agreement shall constitute, or be deemed to constitute,
either Party the agent of the other Party for any purpose. No Party has,
pursuant to this Agreement, any authority or power to bind or to contract in
the name of the other Party to this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



   10.11 | Further Assurance 
---|--- 

Without limitation to the provisions of this Agreement, the Parties will, and
will procure that each member of their respective Groups will, issue, execute
or despatch such documentation in a timely fashion or take other actions as is
necessary or desirable to facilitate the implementation of the Acquisition or
the Merger or carry out the purposes of this Agreement.



   10.12 | Costs and Expenses 
---|--- 

Save for:

 



     | (a) | the Panels document review fees (which shall be borne and
discharged 70% by Medtronic and 30% by Covidien); and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | the costs of, and associated with, the filing, printing,
publication and posting of the Joint Proxy Statement and the Form S-4 and any
other materials required to be posted to Covidien Shareholders or

Agreement, the Acquisition, the Merger and all other transactions
contemplated hereby, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.



   10.13 | Governing Law and Jurisdiction 
---|--- 



     | (a) | This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York; provided, however, that
(i) the Acquisition and the Scheme and matters related thereto (including
matters related to the Takeover Rules) shall, to the extent required by the
Laws of Ireland, and the interpretation of the duties of directors of Covidien
shall, be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of Ireland
and (ii) the Merger and matters related thereto shall, to the extent required
by the Laws of the State of Minnesota, and the interpretation of the duties of

LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY

THE FINANCING SOURCES IN THEIR CAPACITIES AS SUCH SHALL BE THIRD PARTY
BENEFICIARIES OF THIS CLAUSE 10.13(d) AND SHALL BE ENTITLED TO ENFORCE THE
