On August 8, 2006, concurrently with the public disclosure of the proposed Merger, the Company will provide to all holders of the Company Preferred Stock a Notice of Company Change of Control Redemption, as defined in the Articles of Incorporation, and in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Articles of Incorporation.

 SECTION 1.7 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited with a bank or trust company designated by Parent (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive, and become exchangeable for, the Common Stock Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section 1.6(a)(i)_, for exchange in accordance with this _Article I_ through the Exchange Agent, an amount equal to the aggregate Common Stock Merger Consideration (such consideration being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions of the Surviving Corporation, and in accordance with the provisions of _Section 1.7(b)_ make payments of the Common Stock Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedure for Certificates_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") that were converted into the right to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)(i)_: (x) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other customary provisions as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify); and (y) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Common Stock Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by the Surviving Corporation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Common Stock Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)(i)_, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates 

   ##### 

  

 

upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange
Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with
normal exchange practices. In the event of a transfer of ownership of such
Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of
the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall
be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the
Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required
by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation
that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 1.7(b)_, each Certificate (other than a
Certificate representing shares of Company Common Stock cancelled in
accordance with  _Section 1.6(a)(iii)_) shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
the Common Stock Merger Consideration, without interest, into which the
shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate
shall have been converted pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)(i)_. No interest will
be paid or will accrue on the consideration payable upon the surrender of any
Certificate. 

   

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time (i) all holders of Certificates that were outstanding prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as shareholders of the Company other than the right to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration and (ii) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, the Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this  _Article I_, except as otherwise provided by applicable Law. The Common Stock Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this  _Article I_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificates. 

  

 (d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation and any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this _Article I_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and only as general creditors thereof for payment of their claim for the Common Stock Merger Consideration. All rights of any former holder of Company Common Stock to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration hereunder shall, to the extent such Common Stock Merger Consideration remains unclaimed, terminate on the date that is six months prior to the date on which such unclaimed Common Stock Merger Consideration would otherwise become payable to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

 (e) _No Liability_. None of the Company, Merger Sub, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, or any of their respective employees, officers, directors, stockholders, agents or affiliates, shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (f) _Investment of the Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by the Surviving Corporation, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments of the Common Stock Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, the Surviving Corporation shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Exchange Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments. 

  

 (g) _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as the Surviving Corporation is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may require as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Common Stock Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate. 

  

 SECTION 1.8 _Stock Plans_.

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Except as provided herein or as otherwise agreed to by the parties, (i) the Company shall cause the Stock Plans to terminate as of the Effective Time and cause the provisions in any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant by the Company of any interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate and have no further force or effect as of the Effective Time and (ii) the Company shall ensure that following the Effective Time no holder of Options or other awards or any participant in the Stock Plans or anyone other than Parent shall hold or have any right to acquire any equity securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof.

The Company shall cause the principal amount of the Companys 11 7/8% Senior Notes due 2010 (the " _Senior Notes_ ") to be redeemed upon, and as a condition to Parents and Merger Subs obligations to consummate, the Merger, at the redemption price set forth in Section 3.7 of the Indenture governing the Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, which redemption will be funded by the Surviving Corporation with the proceeds of the Financing (as defined in _Section 2.4_).

other party to be present at each meeting or conference relating to any
such Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any

Sub shall agree to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with
any such Governmental Entity in respect of any filing, investigation or
inquiry related to any Proceeding arising under the HSR Act or other
Antitrust Laws related to this Agreement or the Merger unless it consults
with the other parties reasonably in advance and, to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Entity, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend
and participate. 

   

 (c) At the request of Parent, the Company shall agree to divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action with respect to its or its Subsidiaries ability to retain any of the businesses, product lines or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, provided that any such action is conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent shall not have any obligation under this Agreement to take any action if such action would constitute or could reasonably be expected to constitute a Detriment.

The rights of each Indemnified Person under this _Section 5.8_ shall be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Person may have under the Articles of Incorporation or 

   ##### 

  

 

Bylaws of the Company, or under any Pennsylvania Law or any other applicable
Laws or under any agreement of such Indemnified Person with the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company. The Company and the Surviving Corporation will
cooperate in the defense of any such matter; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
neither the Company nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for
any settlement effected without its written consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld). The Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the
Company shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of
six years from the Closing Date in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of any such individuals.

This _Section 5.8_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger. Notwithstanding  _Section 8.7_, this _Section 5.8_ is intended to be for the benefit of and to grant third-party rights to Indemnified Parties whether or not parties to this Agreement, and each of the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained herein. 

  

 (c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the Indemnified Parties rights thereunder are adequately preserved or provided for.

Nothing contained herein shall preclude Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries or affiliates from terminating the employment of any individual or from amending or terminating any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor in accordance with their terms all existing employment, severance, consulting and salary continuation agreements between the Company and any current or former officer, director, Employee or consultant of the Company or group of such officers, directors, Employees or consultants described on _Section 5.9(b)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule;  _provided_ , the Company and each of the Companys employees identified in _Section 5.9(b)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule will execute and deliver on or before the date hereof the agreements in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ (the " _Amendments_ "). 

  

 (c) To the extent permitted under applicable Law, each Continuing Employee shall be given credit for all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes of determining their eligibility to participate and vesting (but not for benefit accrual purposes) in any employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time and for determining the period of their employment under any vacation, sick leave or other paid time off plan, as well as for determining other entitlements and terms of employment affected by seniority under the employment policies of Parent and its Subsidiaries, except to the extent such credit would result in the duplication of benefits. 

  

 (d) To the extent of any changes in medical, dental or health plans covering Continuing Employees after the Effective Time, and to the extent permissible under such plans, Parent shall cause such plan to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions were covered under the applicable medical, health or dental plans of the Company and (ii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such employee on or after the Effective Time to the extent such employee had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Company plan prior to the Effective Time.
