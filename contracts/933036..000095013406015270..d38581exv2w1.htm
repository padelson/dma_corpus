outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the &#147;<U>Certificates</U>&#148;) that were converted into
the right to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;1.6(a)(i)</U>:

Agent and shall be in such form and have such other customary provisions as the Surviving

Certificates in exchange for the Common Stock Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by the Surviving Corporation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed,
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Common Stock
Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such
Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;1.6(a)(i)</U>, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates

Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes have been paid or are
not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this <U>Section&nbsp;1.7(b)</U>, each Certificate

<U>Section&nbsp;1.6(a)(iii)</U>) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive upon such surrender the Common Stock Merger Consideration, without interest,
