such 45-day period shall be extended by one day

 



15  for each additional day required for Buyer to respond fully to such request.
Prior to the end of such 45-day period (or such longer period as may be
extended in accordance with this paragraph), Seller may accept the Proposed
Closing Date Calculations by delivering written notice to that effect to
Buyer, in which case the Purchase Price will be finally determined when such
notice is given. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller may provide a Purchase
Price Dispute Notice on the basis that it has not been provided with adequate
information to understand and evaluate the differences between the Proposed
Closing Date Calculations, on the one hand, and Buyers calculation of
the Proposed Closing Date Calculations (and components thereof including the
Net Working Capital (and the related Net Working Capital Adjustment, if any),
the amount of Cash and Cash Equivalents, the amount of Closing Date
Indebtedness and/or the amount of Unpaid Seller Expenses), on the other hand.
If Seller delivers a Purchase Price Dispute Notice to Buyer within such 45-day
period, Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve
the dispute during the 30-day period commencing on the date Buyer receives
the Purchase Price Dispute Notice from Seller. Any item set forth in the
Proposed Closing Date Calculations and not objected to in the Purchase Price
Dispute Notice shall be final and binding on the Parties. If Seller and Buyer
do not agree upon a final resolution with respect to any disputed items within
such 30-day period, then the remaining items in dispute shall be submitted
immediately to the Accounting Firm, the determination of the Accounting
Firm being conclusive and binding on the Parties and shall not be subject to
court review or otherwise appealable. The Accounting Firm shall be instructed,
and Buyer and Seller shall (and Buyer shall cause the Group Companies, to use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm, to render a
determination (acting as an arbitrator and not as an expert) of the applicable
dispute within 45 days after referral of the matter to such Accounting Firm,
which determination must be in writing and must set forth, in reasonable
detail, the basis therefor. In a potential dispute resolution procedure
pursuant to this _Section 2.3(b)_, all prior discussions related thereto
shall, unless otherwise agreed by Seller and Buyer, be governed by Rule 408
of the Federal Rules of Evidence and neither Party may discuss, use or rely
upon the other Partys conduct or statements during such dispute resolution or
in any communication with the Accounting Firm.

 

(B) Within 15 days after the engagement of the Accounting Firm, Seller and
Buyer shall present their respective positions with respect to the items set
forth in the Purchase Price Dispute Notice in the form of a written report, a
copy of which shall be delivered to the other Party, and no ex parte
conferences, oral examinations, testimony, depositions, discovery or
other form of evidence gathering or hearings shall be conducted or allowed;
_provided_ , _however_ , that at the Accounting Firms request, or as mutually
agreed by Seller and Buyer, Seller and Buyer may meet with the Accounting Firm
so long as representatives of both Seller and Buyer are present. The
Accounting Firms determination shall be instructed to be based solely on the
written reports submitted to the Accounting Firm by Seller and Buyer and oral
submissions by Seller and Buyer at meetings held in compliance with the prior
sentence (i.e., not on independent review) and on the definitions and other
terms included herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that in resolving a disputed
item, the Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any particular item
greater than the greatest value for such item or _less_ than the smallest
value for such item, in each case, claimed by Buyer or Seller in the written
reports presented to the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firms decision with
respect to the matters in dispute shall be final and binding on the Parties,
and any Party may seek to enforce such decision in a court of competent
jurisdiction.

 



16 (C) The terms of appointment and engagement of the Accounting Firm shall be
as agreed upon between Seller and Buyer, and any associated engagement fees
shall be initially borne 50% by Seller and 50% by Buyer; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such fees shall ultimately be borne as set forth below. All
other costs and expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with resolving
any dispute hereunder before the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the Party
incurring such cost and expense. The fees and disbursements of the Accounting
Firm shall ultimately be allocated between Seller and Buyer in the same
proportion that the aggregate amount of the disputed items submitted to the
Accounting Firm that are unsuccessfully disputed by each such Party (as
finally determined by the Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of such
disputed items so submitted. Such determination of the Accounting Firm shall
be conclusive and binding upon the Parties. The Proposed Closing Date
Calculations shall be revised as appropriate to reflect the resolution of
any objections thereto pursuant to this _Section 2.3(b)(i)(A)_ and, as so
revised, such Proposed Closing Date Calculations shall be deemed to set forth
the final Net Working Capital, Cash and Cash Equivalents, Closing Date
Indebtedness, Unpaid Seller Expenses and Purchase Price, in each case, for
all purposes hereunder (including the determination of the Actual Adjustment).

(ii) The Parties shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, make their
financial records and other books and records that are relevant to the
preparation of the Proposed Closing Date Calculations available to the other
Parties and its accountants and other representatives (and either Party and
its accountants and other representatives, at their own expense, shall be
permitted to make copies as they see reasonably necessary) at reasonable times
during the review by Seller of, and the resolution of any objections with
respect to, the Proposed Closing Date Calculations. At the reasonable request
of Seller, the Company shall permit employees who are involved in the
preparation of the Proposed Closing Date Calculations to assist Seller in
its review of the Proposed Closing Date Calculations (but not to assist with
any objections or disputes with respect thereto).

(c)  _Adjustment to Estimated Purchase Price_.

(i) If the Actual Adjustment is a positive amount, then within three Business
Days after the date on which the Purchase Price is finally determined
pursuant to this _Section 2.3_, Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to
Seller an aggregate amount equal to such positive amount by wire transfer or
delivery of immediately available funds to an account specified by Seller.

(ii) If the Actual Adjustment is a negative amount, then within three Business
Days after the date on which the Purchase Price is finally determined
pursuant to this _Section 2.3_, Seller will pay to Buyer an amount equal to
the absolute value of such negative amount by wire transfer or delivery of
immediately available funds to an account specified by Buyer.

 



17 (iii) Any amounts which become payable pursuant to this _Section 2.3(c)_
will constitute an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all purposes.

(d) _Accounting Principles_. The Estimated Purchase Price, Proposed Closing
Date Calculations, the Actual Adjustment and the determinations and
calculations contained therein shall be prepared and calculated on a
consolidated basis for the Group Companies in accordance with the Accounting
Principles except that such statements, calculations and determinations
shall: (i) not include any purchase accounting or other adjustment arising out
of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(ii) be based on facts and circumstances as they exist at Closing in
accordance with GAAP.

Section 2.4 _Allocation._ Pursuant to _Section 6.11(a)_, the Parties have
agreed to the Section 338(h)(10) Election and that Buyer shall be permitted to
make an election under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to Carlisle
Mexico (the " _338(g) Election_ ") as further described in  _Section
6.11(a)_ and, in connection with such elections, the Parties further agree
that (a) the Purchase Price, as finally determined pursuant to _Section
2.3(b)_ and as increased by capitalized costs and assumed liabilities of the
Group Companies, shall be allocated for income Tax purposes among the assets
of the Company (including the shares of capital stock of S.J. Holdings, Inc.
and the equity interests in Carlisle Mexico held by the Company), and (b)
within 60 days after the Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to
_Section 2.3(b)_, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a statement reflecting the
allocation of the Purchase Price (and the capitalized costs and
assumed liabilities of the Group Companies) among the assets of the Company
(including the shares of capital stock of S.J. Holdings, Inc. and the equity
interests in Carlisle Mexico held by the Company) in a manner that is
consistent with the allocation methodology provided by Section 338 of the
Code and as set forth on _Schedule 2.4_ (the " _Allocation_ "). Buyer shall
have the right to review and comment on the Allocation, and Seller shall
consider such changes to the Allocation as are reasonably requested by Buyer
in writing. If Buyer and Seller are able to agree on the Allocation, then
Buyer and Seller will jointly file IRS Form 8883 and applicable state forms
with the applicable Tax Return for the year of this transaction reflecting
the Allocation, and neither Buyer nor Seller shall take any position (whether
in Tax Returns or otherwise) that is inconsistent with the Allocation unless
required to do so by applicable Law. If Buyer and Seller cannot agree on the
Allocation within 30 days after Seller delivers the Allocation to Buyer (or
such longer period as Buyer and Seller may mutually agree in writing), then
Buyer and Seller shall be permitted to file their respective IRS Forms 8883
and applicable state forms as they each determine to be correct. In the event
that the Purchase Price is adjusted (as provided herein or otherwise), any
such adjustment will be allocated among the assets of the Company (including
the shares of capital stock of S.J. Holdings, Inc. and the equity interests
in Carlisle Mexico held by the Company) in a manner consistent with the
Allocation as either agreed or, if not agreed by Buyer and Seller, then as
determined to be correct by each Party.

 

Section 2.5 _Withholding_. Buyer and the Company will be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any amount payable pursuant to this Agreement (including
payments of the Purchase Price) such amounts as Buyer or the Company (or any
Affiliate thereof) shall determine in good faith they are required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
other provision of applicable Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to
making any such deduction or withholding on any amount to be paid to Seller,
shall provide Seller with notice of its intent to make such deduction
or withholding at least two (2) Business

 



18  Days prior to payment and shall work in good faith to avoid (or minimize)
the need to make such deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are
so deducted or withheld by Buyer or the Company, such withheld amounts will
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made.

copies of (i) the executed commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof,
between Buyer and the financial institutions party thereto (including all
exhibits, schedules, and annexes thereto, and the executed fee letter
associated therewith and referenced therein ( _provided_ , _however_ , that
such fee letter may be redacted as to economic and "flex" terms, none of
which would reduce the amount of the Debt Financing to be funded on the
Closing Date or adversely affect the conditionality or availability of the
Debt Financing contemplated thereby on the Closing Date), as may be amended
or modified in accordance with the terms hereof, collectively, the " _Debt
Financing Commitments_ "), pursuant to which the lenders thereto have
committed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to lend the
amounts set forth therein (the " _Debt Financing_ ") for the purposes of
funding the purchase of the Shares and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and paying the related fees and expenses, and (ii) the
executed commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof, among Buyer, Buyer
Guarantor and the other parties thereto (including all exhibits, schedules and
annexes thereto, the " _Equity Financing Commitment_ ", and together with the
Debt Financing Commitment, the " _Financing Commitments_ "), pursuant to which
Buyer Guarantor has committed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
therein, to invest the cash amount set forth therein (the " _Equity
Financing_ ", and together with the Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ "). The
Equity Financing Commitment provides that the Company and Seller are third
party beneficiaries thereof, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
therein. None of the Financing Commitments has been amended or modified prior
to the date of this Agreement and, as of the date of this Agreement, no such
amendment or modification is contemplated (other than, for the avoidance of
doubt, amendments or joinders to the Debt Financing Commitments solely to add

as parties thereto who had not executed the Debt Financing Commitments as of

commitments contained in the Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn or
rescinded in any respect.

 

(b) Except for fee letters (complete copies of which have been provided to
Seller; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such fee letter may redacted as to
economic and "flex" terms, none of which would reduce the amount of the Debt
Financing to be funded on the Closing Date or adversely affect the
conditionality or availability of the Debt Financing contemplated thereby
on the Closing Date), as of the date hereof there are no side letters or
contracts to which Buyer is a party that impose conditions, affect the
availability of or modify, amend or expand the conditions to the funding of
the Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby other than as expressly
set forth in the Financing Commitments delivered to Seller prior to the date
hereof. Buyer has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in
connection with the Financing 

 



32  Commitments that are payable on or prior to the date hereof, and Buyer will,
directly or indirectly, continue to pay in full any such amounts required to
be paid as and when they become due and payable on or prior to the Closing
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that any payment due and payable on the Closing
Date may be funded contemporaneously with the Closing and subject to the
satisfaction of the other funding conditions in respect of the Financing on

force and effect with respect to, and are the legal, valid, binding and
enforceable obligations of, Buyer and, to the knowledge of Buyer, each of the
other parties thereto. As of the date hereof, there are no conditions
precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of
the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments
delivered to Seller prior to the date hereof. As of the date hereof, no event
has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to (i) constitute a default or breach on the part of
Buyer, (ii) constitute a failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the part
of Buyer or, (iii) to the knowledge of Buyer, result in any portion of the
Financing Commitments being unavailable on the Closing Date, assuming the
conditions to the Financing are satisfied and assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in _Article 3_ and _Article 4_ such
that the condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ is satisfied. As of the date
hereof, assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth
in _Article 3_ and _Article 4_ such that the condition set forth in _Section
7.2(a)_ is satisfied, the performance by Seller and the Company of their
respective obligations under this Agreement and the satisfaction of the other
conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_, Buyer has no reason
to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing contemplated by the
Financing Commitments applicable to it will not be satisfied on the Closing
Date. Assuming the conditions in _Sections 7.1_ and _7.2_ are satisfied and
the Financing is funded in accordance with the Financing Commitments
(including any "flex" provision), Buyer will have on the Closing Date funds
sufficient to (i) pay the aggregate Estimated Purchase Price and the other
payments under _Article 2_ and (ii) pay any and all fees and expenses
required to be paid by Buyer and its Affiliates due and payable on the
Closing Date in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Financing. Buyer affirms that it is not a condition to the
Closing or any of its other obligations under this Agreement that Buyer
obtains the Financing or any other financing for or related to any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.7 _Limited Guaranty_. Buyer has delivered to Seller a true and
correct copy of the Limited Guaranty. The Limited Guaranty is in full force
and effect. The Limited Guaranty is (a) a legal, valid and binding obligation
of Buyer Guarantor and (b) enforceable in accordance with its terms against
Buyer Guarantor, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. As of the
date of this Agreement, there is no default under the Limited Guaranty by
Buyer Guarantor, and no event has occurred that with the lapse of time or the
giving of notice or both would constitute a default thereunder by
Buyer Guarantor.

Section 5.8 _Acquisition of Shares for Investment_. Buyer has such knowledge
and experience in financial and business matters that it is capable of
evaluating the merits and risks of its purchase of the Shares. Buyer confirms
that it can bear the economic risk of its investment in the Shares and can
afford to lose its entire investment in the Shares. Buyer is acquiring the
Shares for investment and not with a view toward or for sale in connection
with any distribution thereof, or with any present intention of distributing
or selling such Shares. Buyer agrees that the Shares may not be sold,
transferred, offered for sale or otherwise disposed of without compliance with
applicable United States prospectus and registration requirements, except
pursuant to an exemption therefrom under applicable United States
securities Laws.

 



33 Section 5.9 _Solvency_. Assuming the representations and warranties of
the Company and Seller contained in this Agreement are true in all material
respects, at and immediately after the Closing, and after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, the Group Companies (on a consolidated
basis) (a) will be solvent (in that both the fair value of its assets will
not be less than the sum of its debts (including all debts, whether or not
reflected in a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP, and whether
direct or indirect, fixed or contingent, secured or unsecured, disputed or
undisputed) and that the present fair saleable value of its assets will not be
less than the amount required to pay its probable liability on its debts as
they become absolute and matured, (b) will have adequate capital in relation
to their business as contemplated on the Closing Date, and (c) will not have
incurred, and will not immediately incur, nor do they believe that they will
immediately incur, debts, including current obligations, beyond their ability
to pay such debts as and when they become due (whether at maturity or
otherwise). As used in this _Section 5.9_, liabilities that are contingent
have been computed as the amount that, in light of all of the facts
and circumstances existing as of the Closing Date, represents the amount that
can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured liability.

(a) BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT IT (I) IS AN INFORMED AND SOPHISTICATED

third party) and entering into such new licenses or other agreements.

(b) In the event any Action by any Governmental Entity or other Person is
commenced which challenges the validity or legality of the transactions
contemplated hereby or seeks damages in connection therewith, the Parties
agree to cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to defend against such
Action and, if an injunction or other Order is issued by a Governmental
Entity in any such Action, Buyer agrees to take any and all actions that are
necessary to have such injunction or other Order lifted, in order to
expeditiously consummate the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

or its Affiliates receives from any Governmental Entity relating to the
matters that are the subject of this Agreement and permit the other Parties to
review in advance any proposed communication by it to any Governmental Entity.
No Party shall agree to participate in any meeting or substantive
conversation with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings,
investigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the other Parties in
advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the
other Parties the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting or
conversation. Each Party will provide the other Parties with copies of all
correspondence, filings or communications between it or any of its
representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of
its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(d) The Parties may, as they deem advisable and necessary, designate any
competitively sensitive materials provided to the other under this  _Section

therein shall be given only to outside counsel of the recipient and will not
be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of
the recipient without the advance written consent of the party providing such

 



39  materials. In addition, subject to applicable Law, the Parties shall consult

Company to amend, repeal or otherwise modify the indemnification and
liability limitation or exculpation provisions contained in a Group Companys

the Closing, would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who,
as of the Closing Date or at any time prior to the Closing Date, were
directors, managers, officers, employees or agents of the Group Companies,
unless such amendment, repeal or modification is required by applicable Law.

(b) The directors, managers, officers, employees and agents of the Group
Companies entitled to the indemnification, liability limitation, exculpation
and insurance set forth in this _Section 6.7_ are intended to be third party

purposes, during normal business hours of the Group Companies or any of their
Subsidiaries, as applicable, upon reasonable request and upon reasonable
notice.

knowledge of relevant facts pertaining to the applicable Action (" _Covered

Defending Party and the Assisting Party. The Defending Party shall pay or
reimburse the Assisting Party for all reasonable and documented third party
costs and expenses incurred by the Assisting Party and the Covered Employees,
which payment or reimbursement shall be made by the Defending Party promptly
following the Defending Partys receipt of the documentation supporting such

Group Companies or any of their predecessors earned prior to the Closing Date
for eligibility and vesting and, for severance and vacation benefit
determinations only, benefit accrual purposes under any benefit or
compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement that may be established
or maintained by Buyer or the Group Companies or any of their Affiliates on or
after the Closing Date (the " _New Plans_ "). In addition, Buyer shall (A)
cause to be waived all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively at work

out of pocket provisions after the Closing Date under any applicable New Plan

applicable Employee Benefit Plans, subject to the terms and conditions of
such Employee Benefit Plans, unless and until such Inactive Employee returns
to active employment within six months following the Closing Date, or as
otherwise provided for under the applicable Employee Benefit Plans. As of an
Inactive Employees date of return to active employment, Buyer shall cause
applicable Group Company to continue the employment of any Inactive Employee
that returns to active employment within six months of the Closing Date and,
beginning on such date of return, shall be responsible for all liabilities
that arise with respect to such returning Inactive Employees on or after his
or her return to employment with the Group Companies. Neither Buyer nor any

Company to make, the Specified Group Company Employee Incentive Payments in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth on _Schedule P-2_.

 

(f) Nothing herein, express or implied, shall be construed to (i) create any
third-party beneficiary rights in any current or former employee or
individual worker or any of their respective covered dependents, or any right
of any employee to employment or continued employment for any specified period
or to a particular term or condition of employment, or (ii) interfere with or
restrict in any way the rights of Buyer or the Group Companies to terminate
the services of any employee or individual worker of any of the Group
Companies at any time for any reason.

related to this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, shall be issued or made by any Party (nor will
any Party permit any of its advisors or Affiliates to do any thereof) without
the prior written approval of Seller and Buyer, (a) unless, in the reasonable
opinion of counsel, such communication is required by applicable Law, in which
case Seller and Buyer shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such press release, announcement or communication prior to its
issuance, distribution or publication, and (b) except for disclosure made in
connection with the enforcement of any right or remedy relating to this
Agreement, the Ancillary Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby.
Nothing herein shall prevent (i) any Party from at any time furnishing any
information to any Governmental Entity or from making any disclosures required
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or under the rules
and regulations of any national securities exchange on which such Partys (or
such Partys Affiliates) shares of capital stock are listed or (ii) any Party
or any Affiliate thereof that is a private equity or other investment
fund from making customary disclosures to its current or prospective
investors.

Section 6.11 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Buyer and Seller intend that the purchase contemplated by this Agreement
shall constitute a "qualified stock purchase" within the meaning of Section
338(d) of the Code. Buyer and Seller shall make a joint election under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code (and corresponding elections under applicable state or
local Tax Law or non-U.S. Tax law, if any) with respect to the sale of the
Shares (collectively, the " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_ "), and Buyer and
Seller shall cooperate in the completion and timely filing of the Section
338(h)(10) Election in accordance with the provisions of Treasury Regulation

or non-U.S. Tax law, if any) or any successor provision. Buyer shall prepare
IRS Form 8023 (" _Form 8023_ ") (other than sections that relate to
information regarding Seller and Persons in Sellers control) and provide Form
8023 to Seller for Sellers completion and execution. Seller shall deliver to
Buyer at Closing a duly executed Form 8023 electing to treat the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as a qualified stock purchase
under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and either Party shall take such other
actions as may be reasonably requested by the other Party to facilitate the
Section 338(h)(10) Election, including joining in filing any comparable forms
or other documents with respect to any state, local or non-U.S. Tax elections.
The IRS Form 8883 related to the Form 8023 (and any corresponding forms under
state, local and non-U.S. tax law) shall be prepared and filed in

 



44  accordance with _Section 2.4_. Buyer shall have the right to make the
338(g) Election, and Seller and Buyer agree that in accordance with _Section
6.19(b)_, Seller will not be liable for any Taxes imposed on it or Carlisle
Mexico to the extent resulting from the 338(g) Election (the " _338(g) Taxes_
"). Seller shall take all commercially reasonable actions requested by Buyer
in connection with the 338(g) Election and cooperate with Buyer in
determining whether any 338(g) Taxes would arise.

(b) Seller shall prepare and file or otherwise furnish in proper form to the
appropriate Governmental Entity (or cause to be prepared and filed or so
furnished) in a timely manner all consolidated, combined, and unitary Tax
Returns for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or portion thereof) that include any
Group Company as a member of any Affiliated Group that also includes Seller or
any Affiliate of Seller (other than a Group Company) that is the parent of
such Affiliated Group for such Pre-Closing Tax Period (or portion thereof) ("
_Seller Income Tax Returns_ "). Neither Buyer nor the Group Companies shall
have any liability with respect to any Seller Income Tax Returns. All Seller
Income Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice
and without a change of any election or any accounting method of any
applicable Group Company, unless otherwise required pursuant to applicable
Law. Seller shall not amend any Seller Income Tax Returns of a Group Company
without the prior written consent of Buyer if such amendment would reasonably
be expected to increase the Tax liability of Buyer. Seller shall include the
Group Companies on the U.S. federal income Tax Return for Seller Affiliated
Group, as applicable, through the close of business on the Closing Date.

(c) Except for Seller Income Tax Returns, Buyer shall prepare or cause to be
prepared and timely file or cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns for the
Group Companies with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period that were not filed
as of the Closing Date and shall be liable for the payment of all Taxes with
respect to such Tax Returns. Buyer shall also prepare or cause to be prepared
and timely file or cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns (including any
information Tax Returns with respect to any income Tax) for any Straddle
Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that all such Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with past practice unless otherwise required
pursuant to applicable Law; _provided_ _further_ that, for the avoidance of
doubt, all Transaction Tax Deductions shall be treated as arising on or before
the Closing Date.

after the Closing, for the avoidance of doubt, the Group Companies) to, (i)
except as otherwise permitted under this _Section 6.11_, file, re-file,
supplement, or amend any Tax Return of any Group Company for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period if doing so would reasonably be expected to increase the Tax
liability of Seller, (ii) voluntarily approach any Governmental Entity or
Foreign Governmental Entity regarding any Taxes or Tax Returns of any Group
Company that relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period if doing so would reasonably
be expected to increase the Tax liability of Seller, (iii) except as
contemplated by _Section 6.11(a)_ and except for the 338(g) Election, make an
election under Section 338 of the Code (or any comparable provision of state
or local Tax Law or foreign Tax law) with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including with respect to any Subsidiaries of
the Company), or (iv) take any action relating to Taxes or that could create a
Tax liability on the Closing Date that is outside the ordinary course of
business.

 



45 (e) If Buyer or any Group Company receives notice of any audit or other
inquiry with respect to Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period which (depending
upon its resolution) could affect the income Tax liability of Seller, Buyer
shall (i) promptly inform Seller of such notice, (ii) allow Seller to manage,
control and defend (at its sole expense) such audit or inquiry; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any such audit or inquiry could have an adverse and
material effect on any Group Company, Seller may not settle such matter
without the consent of Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed and (iii) provide, and cause each Group Company to
provide, such assistance and access to information to Seller as is reasonably
necessary in connection therewith.

 

(f) Seller shall be entitled to any refund, credit or similar benefit
(including any interest paid or credited by a Governmental Entity
with respect thereto) of Taxes paid by any Group Company with respect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period or the pre-Closing portion of any Straddle Period, in
each case, net of (x) any Taxes (including any Taxes that would be imposed on
a distribution of any portion of such refund to Buyer) and (y) any reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses that Buyer or any Group Company incurs with respect to
such refund (and related interest). Nothing in this _Section 6.11(f)_ shall
require that Buyer make any payment with respect to any refund for a Tax (and
such refunds shall be for the benefit of Buyer and the Group Companies) that
is with respect to (A) any refund of Tax paid by Buyer or the Group Companies
after the Closing Date to the extent Seller has not borne (directly or
indirectly) the economic burden for such Tax by inclusion of such Tax in the
Net Working Capital, or the determination of Closing Date Indebtedness, in
each case, as finally determined; (B) any refund for Tax that is reflected as
a current asset (or offset to a current liability) on the Net Working Capital,
or included in the determination of Closing Date Indebtedness, in each case,
as finally determined; or (C) any refund for Tax that gives rise to a payment
obligation by any Group Company to any Person under applicable Law or pursuant
to a provision of a contract entered (or assumed) by any Group Company on or
prior to the Closing Date. Any such amounts payable to Seller pursuant
to this _Section 6.11(f)_ shall be paid to Seller (and any material
correspondence related thereto shall be provided), within ten days after
receipt or entitlement thereto. Upon the request of Seller, Buyer shall take
commercially reasonable actions to cause the Company to file for, obtain, and
expedite the receipt of, any refund, credit, or similar benefit to which
Seller is entitled under this _Section 6.11(f)_. To the extent that a refund
of Tax under this  _Section 6.11(f)_ is lost, disallowed, or reduced, Seller
shall pay to Buyer the amount of such lost, disallowed, or reduced refund of
Tax within ten days of such loss, disallowance, or reduction. Nothing in
this  _Section 6.11(f)_ shall require that Buyer make any payment with
respect to any refund for a Tax (and such refunds shall be for the benefit of
Buyer and the Group Companies) that is with respect to any refund of Tax paid
by Buyer or the Group Companies after the Closing Date to the extent Seller
has not borne (directly or indirectly) the economic burden for such Tax.

(g) Buyer, the Group Companies and Seller shall cooperate fully with each
other in connection with the filing of any Tax Return, in any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes and in allowing Seller to
review Tax Returns of the Group Companies for Pre-Closing Tax Periods and
Straddle Periods to determine or verify the proper amounts payable as refunds
hereunder. Such cooperation shall include the retention and the provision of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return
or Tax audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on
a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any materials provided hereunder. Buyer will, and 

 



46  will cause the Group Companies to, retain all books and records with respect
to Tax matters pertinent to the Group Companies and which relate to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period (and, if notified in writing by another Party, any
extensions thereof) and to abide by all record retention agreements entered
into with any Governmental Entity. Buyer, the Group Companies and Seller agree
to give each other and their respective representatives reasonable written
notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and
records. Seller, Buyer and the Group Companies further agree, upon request, to
use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or
other document from any Tax authority or any other Person or take any other
action as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could
be imposed on any Party (including with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) and to provide any information necessary or
reasonably requested to allow Buyer and the Group Companies to comply with any
information reporting or withholding requirements contained in the Code or
other applicable Laws or to compute the amount of payroll or other employment
Taxes due with respect to any payment made in connection with this Agreement.

(h) Prior to or at the Closing, Seller shall deliver a certificate, in form
and substance that complies with Section 1.1445-2(b), stating that Seller is
not a foreign person within the meaning of Section 1445 of the Code;
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement, delivery of such certificate shall not be a condition to Closing
and Buyers sole right if Seller fails to provide such certificate shall be to
make an appropriate withholding under Sections 897 and 1445 of the Code.

(i) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Straddle Period, the
amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income, gross or net sales,
payments or receipts, or payroll of the Company for the Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close
of business on the Closing Date and the amount of other Taxes of the Company
for a Straddle Period that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied
by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable
period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number
of days in such Straddle Period.

(j) Any and all existing Tax Sharing Agreements (other than Contracts entered
into in the ordinary course of business that is not primarily related to Taxes
but which include a Tax Sharing Agreement (such as paying real estate Taxes in
leases or grossing up for withholding Taxes in a credit agreement)) between
any Group Company and any member of a Seller Affiliated Group shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date and none of the Group Companies, Seller or
any Affiliate of Seller shall have any further rights or liabilities
thereunder.

48 Section 6.13 _Buyer Financing_.

 

(a) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or advisable
to arrange and consummate the Financing on the terms and conditions described
in or contemplated by the Financing Commitments (including complying with any
request exercising so-called "flex" provisions contained therein), including
using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Financing
Commitments (as such terms and conditions may be modified or adjusted in
accordance with the terms thereof and within the limits of the "flex"
provisions therein) until the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that for the
avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) Buyer may amend,
replace, supplement or modify the Debt Financing Commitments solely to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
as parties thereto who had not executed the Debt Financing Commitments as of
the date hereof, and (B) Buyer may amend, supplement or modify the Debt
Financing Commitments in accordance with the "flex" provisions contained
therein or amend, replace, supplement, modify or waive any provision under the
Debt Financing Commitment or the definitive agreements relating to the Debt
Financing if such amendment, replacement, supplement, modification or waiver
does not (x) decrease the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing to an amount
that would be less than an amount that would be required to consummate the
purchase of the Shares on the Closing Date and make the other payments
required to be made by Buyer or any of its Affiliates hereunder on the Closing
Date, in each case, that is not otherwise compensated for by an increase in
the Equity Financing, (y) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise
expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to the receipt of the Debt
Financing in a manner that would (I) reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the Closing, (II) make the timely funding of the Debt
Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing)
less likely to occur or (III) materially and adversely impact the ability of
Buyer to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Financing
Commitments or the ability of Buyer, the Company or Seller to enforce its
rights against the Buyer Guarantor under the Equity Financing Commitment, (ii)
satisfy (or obtain waivers to) on a timely basis all conditions to funding in
the Debt Financing Commitments and such definitive agreements to be entered
into pursuant thereto (including by consummating the Equity Financing
substantially concurrently therewith), (iii) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and conditions described
in the Debt Financing Commitments (subject to the exercise of any "flex"
provisions contained therein) on or prior to the Closing Date and (iv) enforce
its rights under the Debt Financing Commitments. To the extent requested by
Seller from time to time, Buyer shall keep Seller informed on a reasonably
current basis of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing (or
Alternative Financing).

 

(b) In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions) contemplated in the
Debt Financing Commitments for any reason other than due to the breach by the
Company or Seller of any of its respective representations, warranties or
covenants contained herein or as a result of the failure of a
condition contained herein to be satisfied by the Company or Seller, as
applicable, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller in writing and use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing from
alternative sources on terms not materially less favorable taken as a whole
(as determined in the reasonable discretion of Buyer) to Buyer than those
contained in the Debt Financing Commitments in an amount, when added with
Buyers existing cash on hand and 

 



49  the Equity Financing Commitment, sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event (the " _Alternative Financing_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such Alternative Financing shall not (i) involve any
conditions to funding the Debt Financing that are not contained in the Debt
Financing Commitments or (ii) reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or
delay the consummation of the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer
shall promptly notify Seller in writing (A) if Buyer becomes aware of the
existence of any material breach, material default, repudiation, cancellation
or termination by any party to the Financing Commitments, (B) of the receipt
by Buyer of any written notice or other written communication from any lender
or other provider of Debt Financing with respect to any actual repudiation,
cancellation or termination by any party to the Financing Commitments or (C)
Buyer reasonably expects that it will not be able to obtain all or any
portion of the Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources
contemplated by the Financing Commitments or the definitive documents related
to the Financing (as such terms and conditions may be modified or adjusted
in accordance with the terms thereof and within the limits of the "flex"
provisions therein or on other terms no less favorable, in the aggregate, to
Buyer and its Affiliates, in each case subject to the limitations set forth
in  _Section 6.13(a)_). As soon as reasonably practicable, Buyer shall
provide any information reasonably requested by Seller relating to any
circumstance referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C) of the immediately
preceding sentence. Buyer and Buyer Guarantor shall not (without the prior
written consent of Seller) consent or agree to any amendment, replacement,
supplement or modification to, or any waiver of any provision under, the
Financing Commitment or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing
if such amendment, replacement, supplement, modification or waiver (w)
decreases the aggregate amount of the Financing to an amount that would be
less than an amount that would be required to consummate the purchase of the
Shares and make the other payments required to be made by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including the Group Companies after the Closing Date) hereunder on
the Closing Date, in each case, that is not otherwise compensated for by
an increase in another Financing or (x) imposes new or additional conditions
or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to the receipt
of the Financing in a manner that (i) would reasonably be expected to prevent
or materially delay the Closing, (ii) make the timely funding of the
Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing) less
likely to occur or (iii) materially and adversely impacts the ability of Buyer
to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Financing Commitments.
Upon request, Buyer shall furnish to Seller a copy of any amendment,
modification, waiver or consent of or relating to the Financing Commitments
promptly upon execution thereof ( _provided_ , _however_ , that any fee
letter may be redacted as to economic and "flex" terms, none of which would
reduce the amount of the Debt Financing to be funded on the Closing Date or
adversely affect the conditionality or availability of the Debt Financing
contemplated thereby on the Closing Date). Upon any amendment, supplement or
modification of the Financing Commitments and made in compliance with this
_Section 6.13(b)_ (excluding any amendment for the sole purpose of joining
or adding additional commitment parties thereto), Buyer shall provide a copy
thereof to Seller ( _provided_ , _however_ , that any fee letter may be
redacted as to economic and "flex" terms, none of which would reduce the
amount of the Debt Financing to be funded on the Closing Date or adversely
affect the conditionality or availability of the Debt Financing contemplated
thereby on the Closing Date) and the term "Financing Commitments" as used
herein shall mean the Financing Commitments as so amended, replaced,
supplemented or

 



50  modified, including any Alternative Financing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, compliance by Buyer with this _Section 6.13(b)_ shall not relieve
Buyer of its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement whether or not the Financing is available, and Buyer acknowledges
that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are not
contingent on Buyers ability to obtain the financing (or any Alternative
Financing) or any specific term with respect to such financing.

(c) Prior to the Closing, Seller will, and will cause the Company, Sellers
other Affiliates and their respective directors, members, partners, officers,
employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and other representatives to, use
each of their reasonable best efforts to provide to Buyer, at Buyers sole
cost and expense, all reasonable cooperation reasonably requested by Buyer
that is necessary and customary in accordance with the terms of the Debt
Financing (or Alternative Financing obtained in accordance with  _Section
6.13(b)_), including (i) participating, upon reasonable advance notice, in a
reasonable number of meetings, presentations and rating agency presentations,
and participating in reasonable and customary due diligence, in each case
with or by the Debt Financing Sources (or prospective lenders or investors in
any Debt Financing), (ii) furnishing Buyer and the Debt Financing Sources, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, with the Required Information, (iii)
assisting Buyer and the Debt Financing Sources in the preparation of (A)
customary syndication documents and materials (including assistance in
creating usual and customary "public versions" of the foregoing),
including confidential information memoranda, lender presentations, rating
agency presentations, business and financial projections and similar documents
and materials, in connection with any Debt Financing (all of the foregoing,
collectively, the " _Syndication Documents_ "), including providing the
business description to be contained therein, and providing customary
authorization and representation letters with respect thereto, and (B)
materials for any Syndication Documents, including business projections and
financial statements (including assisting Buyer in preparing pro forma
financial statements; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Seller nor the
Company shall be responsible in any manner for any pro forma adjustments
relating to proposed debt and equity capitalization that is required to be
made to the historical information for such pro forma financial information)
and identifying any portion thereof as containing material, non-
public information, (iv) reasonably cooperating with the marketing and
syndication efforts of Buyer and any Debt Financing Sources for any portion of
any Debt Financing, including cooperation in connection with the obtainment of
ratings, (v) executing and delivering as of (but not before) the Closing Date
definitive financing documents, including credit agreements, intercreditor
agreements, guarantee agreements, pledge and security documents, and
certificates or other documents (including a customary solvency certificate
executed by the chief financial officer of the Company), to the extent
reasonably requested by Buyer and otherwise facilitating the providing of
guarantees with respect to and the granting or perfection of collateral to
secure any Debt Financing, including delivery of certificates representing
equity interests constituting collateral, intellectual property filings with
respect to intellectual property constituting collateral and mortgages with
respect to owned real property constituting collateral and obtaining releases
of existing Liens, _provided_ , _however_ , that the effectiveness of any
definitive documentation executed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall be subject to the consummation of the Closing, (vi) furnishing Buyer
and any Debt Financing Sources promptly, and in any event at least three
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, with all documentation and other
information that any Debt Financing Source reasonably determines is required
by regulatory authorities with respect to any Debt Financing

 



51  under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including without limitation the Uniting and Strengthening
America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct
Terrorism Act of 2001, as amended, in each case, to the extent that such
documentation and information has been reasonably requested in writing at
least ten days prior to the Closing Date, and (vii) taking all organizational
actions, subject to and only effective upon the occurrence of the Closing,
reasonably requested by Buyer to permit the consummation of any Debt Financing
and to permit the proceeds thereof to be made available at the Closing.
The Company hereby consents to the reasonable use of its and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the marketing of the Debt Financing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such logos are used solely in a manner that is
not intended to, and is not reasonably likely to harm or disparage the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the
Company, its Subsidiaries and its or their respective marks, products,
services, offerings or intellectual property rights. Seller and the Company
will, upon reasonable written request of Buyer, use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to promptly supplement any Required Information (to
the extent it is available) to be included in any Syndication Document to
assist Buyer in ensuring that such Required Information, when taken as a
whole, is correct in all material respects and does not contain as of the time
provided, any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not
materially misleading in light of the circumstances under which such
statements are made. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Buyer shall be
permitted to disclose information received from Seller, the Company, Sellers
other Affiliates and their respective directors, members, partners, officers,
employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and other representatives to the
Debt Financing Sources (including prospective Debt Financing Sources)
and rating agencies during syndication of the Debt Financing subject to
entering into customary confidentiality undertakings with respect to such
information.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) nothing in this _Section 6.13_ shall
require such cooperation to the extent it would unreasonably interfere with
the business or operations of the Group Companies and their Affiliates, (ii)
no Group Company nor any Affiliate thereof shall be required to pay any
commitment or other fee or incur any other liability or obligation in
connection with the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitments or be required to take any action for which it would not be
indemnified hereunder, to bear any cost or expense or to pay any commitment or
other similar fee or make any other payment or agree to provide any indemnity
in connection with the Debt Financing or any of the foregoing prior to the
Closing, (iii) no Group Company will be required to take any action that may
conflict with or violate its respective Governing Documents or any Laws or
foreign laws or result in, prior to the Closing, the contravention of, or that
may result in, prior to the Closing, a violation or breach of, or default
under, any contract to which any Group Company is a party, and (iv) neither
Seller nor any of its Affiliates will be required to provide or otherwise make
available any auditor documents, consents or certifications, or any audited
financial statements for the Group Companies other than the consolidated,
audited financial statements of CCI that are publicly available. For the
avoidance of doubt, prior to the Closing Date, no Group Company nor any of its
respective directors, managers, officers or employees shall be required to
execute or enter into or perform any agreement with respect to the Debt
Financing (other than providing customary authorization and representation
letters as provided in _Section 6.13(c)(iii)_, and no director, manager or
officer of a Group Company who resigns in such capacity at or prior to
Closing shall be required to execute or enter into or perform any agreement
with respect to the Debt Financing.

 



52 (e) Buyer (i) shall promptly, upon request by Seller, reimburse Seller or the
Company, as applicable, for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
incurred by any Group Company, any Affiliate thereof or any of their
respective directors, managers, officers, employees, representatives,
consultants, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other agents in
connection with the cooperation of Seller, any Group Company or any other
Affiliate thereof as contemplated by this _Section 6.13_ and (ii) shall
indemnify and hold harmless Seller, the Group Companies, their Affiliates and
their respective directors, managers, officers, employees, representatives,
consultants, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other agents from
and against any and all losses suffered or incurred by them in
connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and the performance of
their respective obligations under this _Section 6.13_ (including any action
taken in accordance with this _Section 6.13_) and any information used in
connection therewith.

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) neither the existence
nor the exercise of any "flex" provision in any Debt Financing Commitments or
definitive financing document shall constitute a breach by Buyer of this
_Section 6.13_; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such "flex" provision would
reduce the amount of the Debt Financing to be funded on the Closing Date or
adversely affect the conditionality or availability of the Debt Financing
contemplated thereby on the Closing Date, and (ii) in no event shall Buyer
have any liability for breach of its covenants or agreements under this
_Section 6.13_ if the Closing occurs.

Section 6.14 _Insurance Matters_.  

(a) Prior to the date hereof, Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Group
Companies) have maintained insurance coverage for products liability, general
liability and automobile liability provided by third-party insurers (including
stop loss, excess liability and umbrella coverage) (the " _Seller Occurrence
Policies_ " and each, a " _Seller Occurrence Policy_ " for certain
liabilities of the Group Companies relating to products claims, general claims
typically insured by a general liability policy and automobile related claims
arising out of occurrences on or prior to the Closing Date (such claims, the
" _Insurance Claims_ " and each, an " _Insurance Claim_ "). After the Closing,
upon request of the Company, Seller or its applicable Affiliate shall use
commercially reasonable efforts (including filing claims on behalf of any
Group Company) to facilitate coverage under the relevant Seller Occurrence
Policy for applicable Insurance Claims in the ordinary course of business in
substantially the same manner as similar claims were processed prior to the
Closing Date, with such coverage determination to be governed by and construed
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the relevant Seller Occurrence
Policy. In the event that (i) Seller or its applicable Affiliate receives
any proceeds of a Seller Occurrence Policy with respect to any Insurance
Claim covered thereby, and (ii) such claim has been paid by a Group Company,
Seller or its applicable Affiliate shall promptly pay or reimburse the Company
with respect to the amount so paid by a Group Company in accordance with this
_Section 6.14_.

 



53 (b) The applicable Group Company shall reimburse Seller or its applicable
Affiliate for any out-of-pocket administrative and processing fees or other
similar costs and expenses imposed by the insurer and paid by either of them
specifically relating to the submitted Insurance Claims and the processing
thereof (the " _Reimbursed Amounts_ "). Seller and Buyer agree that (i)
Seller will invoice the Company on a monthly basis for all Reimbursed Amounts
paid or incurred by Seller or its applicable Affiliate with appropriate
supporting details, and (ii) the Company will pay the amount reflected on
such invoices as promptly as practicable and in any event within 15 days of
receipt of any such invoice with appropriate supporting details.

 

(c) In the event that a Group Company or any or its Affiliates or
representatives takes or fails to take any action that results in the
Seller Occurrence Policy not being available for any reason with respect to
any Insurance Claim, Seller shall notify Buyer in writing as to what action or
failure of action caused a suspension of coverage. Buyer shall have 30 days to
cause the applicable Group Company to remedy such action or failure of
action. If no remedy has been effected at the end of such 30-day period, then
Sellers or its applicable Affiliates obligations pursuant to this _Section
6.14_ with respect to such Insurance Claim shall terminate and be of no
further force and effect. Buyer expressly acknowledges and agrees that (i) in
no event shall Seller or any of its Affiliates be required to pay, or be held
responsible for, any self-insured retention amounts or deductibles payable
with respect to any Insurance Claim, and (ii) the Group Companies shall be
responsible for all self-insured retention amounts and deductibles payable
with respect to any Insurance Claim.

 

(d) Buyer acknowledges that effective as of the Closing Date, Seller or its
applicable Affiliate intends to remove the Group Companies and their assets
from the Seller Occurrence Policies to the extent that the Seller Occurrence
Policies relate to any occurrences arising at any time after the Closing Date.
Accordingly, Buyer acknowledges that coverage under the Seller
Occurrence Policies will not be available to the Group Companies with respect
to any injury, loss or damage that the Group Companies or any third party may
suffer as a result of any act, omission, occurrence, fact or circumstance
occurring with respect to any period after the Closing Date.

(e) In addition to the foregoing, Seller will retain the liability for
workers compensation claims of any employee of a Group Company that relate
to events occurring prior to or on the Closing Date until all such claims are
finally resolved (the " _Retained Workers  Compensation Claims_").

 

Section 6.15 _Termination of Certain Agreements_. Seller, the Group Companies
and each of their respective Affiliates shall take all actions necessary to
terminate as of or prior to the Closing each of the Affiliate Transactions set
forth on _Schedule 6.15_ in such a manner that (a) following such termination,
each such Contract shall be of no further force or effect such that there are
no ongoing rights or obligations (including any accounts payable, accounts
receivable and indemnification obligations) of any Group Company thereunder
and (b) there shall be no penalty or liability of any Group Company arising
from such termination.

Section 6.16 _Restrictive Covenants_.

 

(a) _Non-Competition_. Seller hereby covenants and agrees that during the
three-year period beginning on the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, own any interest in,
operate, control, advise, work for, consult to,

 



54  have a financial interest which provides any control of, or participate with
or in any Person producing, designing, providing, soliciting orders for,
selling, distributing, consulting to, or marketing or re-marketing products
or services that are competitive with the Business; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing herein will prohibit Seller or any of its Affiliates from owning
or holding less than two percent of the outstanding shares of any class of
stock that is regularly traded on a recognized U.S. or non-U.S. securities
exchange or over-the-counter market; _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing in
this _Section 6.16(a)_ shall prohibit Seller or any of its Affiliates from
acquiring an entity or business that engages in the same business as the
Business as conducted as of the date hereof, so long as (i) the revenue from
such competitive operations is no more than 10% of the total revenue of such
entity or business (as applicable), and (ii) Seller or its applicable
Affiliate sells or otherwise divests each competitive operation within 24
months following such acquisition (unless such disposition would occur after
the end of the three-year period described in this _Section 6.16(a)_).

(b) _Non-Solicitation_. Seller hereby covenants and agrees that during the
three-year period beginning on the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, employ, hire, engage or
recruit, solicit, contact or approach for employment, hiring or engagement
(whether as an employee, consultant, agent, independent contractor or
otherwise), or encourage to leave his or her employment or consulting
relationship with Buyer, a Group Company or any of their respective
Affiliates, any of the Persons set forth on  _Schedule P-2_ or otherwise
seek or attempt to influence or alter any such Persons relationship with
Buyer, a Group Company or any of their respective Affiliates; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this  _Section 6.16(b)_ shall prohibit Seller or
any of its Affiliates from any: (i) general solicitation for employment
(including in any newspaper or magazine, over the internet or by any search or
employment agency), if not specifically directed towards any such Person;
(ii) hiring of any such Person where the initial contact with such individual
regarding such hiring arose from any such general solicitation; or (iii)
soliciting for employment or hiring any individual who at the time of such
solicitation and hiring has not been employed by Buyer or any Affiliate of
Buyer for at least six months prior to such solicitation.

 

(c) _Confidentiality_. Seller recognizes and acknowledges that as of Closing
Date, it will have knowledge of confidential or other proprietary information
relative to the activities of Buyer and the Group Companies, including
information relating to financial statements or other financial information,
clients, customers, potential clients or customers, employees,
suppliers, equipment, designs, discoveries, drawings, programs, strategies,
analyses, profit margins, pricing information, Contracts, sales and marketing
information or materials, methods of operation, plans, processes, research,
systems, techniques, Intellectual Property Rights, products, technologies,
materials, innovations, improvements, technical know-how, developments,
strategies, ideas, prospects, tangible or intangible work product or other
proprietary information (" _Confidential Information_ "). In light of the
foregoing, from and after the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees and representatives to, maintain
the confidentiality of, and refrain from using or disclosing for any
purposes, whether directly or indirectly, to any Person, all Confidential
Information, except to the extent disclosure of any such Confidential
Information is (i) required by Law, or (ii) after any such information is
in the public domain through no act on the part of Seller, or any of its
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees or representatives. In the event
that Seller or any of its Affiliates receives a request or is required (by
deposition, interrogatory, request for documents,

 



55  subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any
Confidential Information, Seller shall, and shall cause its applicable
Affiliate(s) to: (A) provide Buyer with prompt notice before such disclosure
so that Buyer may attempt to obtain a protective Order from a Governmental
Entity or other assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such
Confidential Information and (B) cooperate with Buyer in attempting to obtain
such Order or assurance. In the event that such Order or assurance is not
obtained or that Buyer waives compliance with the provisions hereof, Seller
and its Affiliates may disclose to any tribunal only any
Confidential Information which it is advised by counsel is legally required
to be disclosed, and shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such Confidential
Information.

 

(d) _Remedies_. Seller acknowledges and agrees that the length of time, scope
and geographic coverage of the covenants set forth in this  _Section 6.16_
are fair and reasonable given the benefits Seller has received under this
Agreement. Seller further agrees that it will not challenge the reasonableness
of the time and scope in any Action, regardless of who initiates such Action.
Seller further acknowledges and agrees that the covenants set forth in this
_Section 6.16_ are necessary for the protection of Buyers legitimate
business interests and that Buyer would not have entered into this
Agreement unless Seller had agreed for it and its Affiliates to be
irrevocably bound by the covenants contained this _Section 6.16_, that
irreparable injury will result to Buyer if Seller or any of its Affiliates
breaches any of the terms of this  _Section 6.16_, and that in the event of
an actual or threatened breach by Seller or any of its Affiliates of any of
the provisions contained in this _Section 6.16_, Buyer would have no adequate
remedy at law. Seller accordingly waives, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law, and agrees that in the
event of any actual or threatened breach by it or any of its Affiliates of any
of the provisions contained in this  _Section 6.16_, Buyer shall be entitled
to injunctive and other equitable relief without (i) the posting of any bond
or other security, (ii) the necessity of showing actual damages and (iii) the
necessity of showing that monetary damages are an inadequate remedy. Nothing
contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting Buyer from pursuing any
other remedies available to it for such breach or threatened breach, including
the recovery of any damages that it is able to prove. Seller shall be liable
for any breach by its Affiliates of this _Section 6.16_.

(e) _Blue Pencil_. This Agreement shall be deemed to consist of a series of
separate covenants, and shall be worldwide in geographic scope. The Parties
expressly agree that the character, duration and scope of this Agreement are
reasonable in light of the circumstances as they exist on the date hereof.
However, should a determination nonetheless be made by a court of competent
jurisdiction at a later date that the character, duration or geographical
scope of this Agreement is unreasonable in light of the circumstances as
they then exist, then it is the intention and the agreement of Seller (on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates) that this Agreement shall be construed by
the court in such a manner as to impose only those restrictions on the conduct
of Seller and its Affiliates that are reasonable in light of the
circumstances as they then exist and as are necessary to assure the Group
Companies and Buyer of the intended benefit of this Agreement. If, in any
Action, a court shall refuse to enforce all of the separate covenants deemed
included herein because, taken together, they are more extensive than
necessary to assure the Group Companies and Buyer of the intended benefit of
this Agreement, it is expressly understood and agreed among the Parties
that those of such covenants that, if eliminated, would permit the remaining
separate covenants to be enforced in such Action shall, for the purpose of
such Action, be deemed eliminated from the provisions of this _Section 6.16_.

 



56 Section 6.17 _Carlisle Name_.

 

(a) Buyer covenants and agrees it shall take action to amend the Governing
Documents of the applicable Group Companies to omit or change the word
"Carlisle" or any name intended or likely to be confused with the name
"Carlisle." Such action shall be effective no later than 24 months following
the Closing Date.

 

(b) No later than 24 months following the Closing Date, Buyer further
covenants and agrees that Buyer shall (i) request all relevant Governmental
Entities and domain name registrars to update their respective ownership
records to identify the current legal owner of the Owned Intellectual Property
and (ii) submit the necessary documents to accomplish such request.

 

(c) Except for the limited license rights expressly granted to Buyer in the
Trademark License Agreement and the right to maintain the names of the
applicable Group Companies in accordance with _Section 6.17(a)_, Seller is
not transferring to Buyer (or any Affiliate of Buyer), and reserves all right,
title and interest in and to, the "Carlisle" name.

 

Section 6.18 _Specified Lease_. Buyer agrees to use reasonable best efforts to
replace CCI as guarantor under the Specified Lease with an Affiliate of Buyer
no later than the 12 month anniversary of the Closing Date.

Section 6.19 _Certain Matters_.

(a) From and after the Closing, Seller agrees to indemnify and hold Buyer and
the Group Companies harmless from (i) any Action or Order against Buyer or
the Group Companies arising from or related to the matter described on
_Schedule 6.19_ (the " _Specified Matter_ ") and to reimburse Buyer for any
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Buyer
or the Group Companies in connection with such Action or Order, (ii) any
Losses incurred by Buyer and its Covered Employees in their capacity as
Assisting Party, as contemplated under  _Section 6.8(b)_, including in
connection with the Specified Matter, and (iii) the Retained Workers
Compensation Claims (other than with respect to Buyers responsibilities for
the Retained Workers Compensation described in _Section 6.8(c)_).

(b) From and after the Closing, Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold CCI, Seller
or their Affiliates, as applicable, harmless from (i) any Action or Order
against CCI in its capacity as guarantor under the Specified Lease and to
reimburse CCI for any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by CCI in connection with such Action or Order for so long
as CCI remains guarantor under the Specified Lease, (ii) any Losses incurred
by Seller, its Affiliates or any of their Covered Employees in their capacity
as Assisting Party, as contemplated under _Section 6.8(b)_ and (iii) any
338(g) Taxes and any other reasonable and documented out-of-pocket third party
costs and expenses arising from any (A) commercially reasonable actions
requested by Buyer pursuant to  _Section 6.11(a)_ and (B) cooperation with
Buyer in connection with the 338(g) Election.

 



57 Section 6.20 _One Percent Interest Transfer_. Prior to the Closing, Seller or
its applicable Affiliate will have caused Carlisle Producto, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company and an Affiliate of Seller, to transfer its one
percent interest in Carlisle Mexico to San Jamar Mexico, LLC (the "One
Percent Interest Transfer").

Section 6.21 _Further Assurances_. Each of Seller and Buyer, upon the request
of the other from time to time following the Closing, without further
consideration, shall sign such documents and take such actions as may be
necessary or reasonably requested to make more fully effective the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to carry
out the purposes hereof.

61 (b) by Buyer, if there shall have been a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Seller or the Company

_Section 9.1(b)_ if Buyer is then in material breach of any of its

(c) by Seller, if there shall have been a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Buyer contained in

Seller or the Company, as applicable, is then in material breach of any of its

other such breaches, would be the primary cause of a condition set forth in
_Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_ not to be satisfied;

 

(d) by Buyer, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to April 30,
2018 (the " _Buyer Termination Date_ "), unless the primary cause of the

warranties, obligations or covenants under this Agreement;

 

(e) by Seller, if the Closing shall not have been consummated on or prior to
March 30, 2018 (the " _Seller Termination Date_ "), unless the primary cause
of the failure to consummate the Closing is a breach by Seller or the Company
of its respective representations, warranties, obligations or covenants under
this Agreement;

 

(f) by either Buyer or by Seller, if any Governmental Entity shall have issued
an Order (or taken any other action) permanently enjoining, restraining or
otherwise prohibiting the Closing and such Order or other action shall have
become final and nonappealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Party
seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 9.1(f)_ shall
not have such termination right if such Party (or the Company in the case of
Seller being the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 9.1(f)_) is then in material breach of any of its respective
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement and such breach is the primary cause of such Order or other action;
or

Section 9.3 _Buyer Termination Payment_.

 

(a) If Seller validly terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_
or 9.1(g), then within five Business Days following the date of termination,
Buyer will pay to Seller or the Company, as directed by Seller, a fee equal to
$50,000,000 (the " _Buyer Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Seller.

(b) The Parties acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall Buyer be
required to pay the Buyer Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(c) The Parties acknowledge and hereby agree that the Buyer Termination Fee,
if, as and when required to be paid pursuant to this _Section 9.3_, shall
not constitute a penalty but will be liquidated damages in a reasonable amount
that will compensate Seller and the Company under the circumstances for their
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In furtherance of the
foregoing, and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Sellers right to direct the payment of the Buyer Termination Fee to the
extent provided in _Section 9.3(a)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
of Seller, the Company, any other Group Company and any of their respective
Affiliates against Buyer, the Buyer Guarantor, Sponsor, the Debt Financing
Sources, and each of their respective former, current, or future directors,
officers, employees, agents, general and limited partners, managers, members,
stockholders, Affiliates and assignees, and each former, current or future
director, officer, employee, agent, stockholder, general or limited partner,
manager, member, stockholder, Affiliate or assignee of any of the foregoing
(collectively, the " _Specified Parties_ ") for any Losses suffered as a
result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Ancillary Documents to be consummated or for a

 



63  breach or failure to perform hereunder or for any alleged breach of the
Financing Commitments, and no Specified Party shall have any other liability
or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any Ancillary
Document or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, in each case,
whether based on contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any
assessment, by any legal or equitable Action, by virtue of any Law or
otherwise and whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil,
by or through a claim by or on behalf of a party hereto to another Person or
otherwise.

 

(d) The Parties acknowledge and hereby agree that the agreements contained in
this _Section 9.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter
into this Agreement. If Buyer fails to pay timely the Buyer Termination Fee,
or any portion thereof, when due and payable in accordance with  _Section
9.3(a)_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Seller commences a suit that
results in a final and non-appealable judgment against Buyer for the Buyer
Termination Fee, or any portion thereof, then Buyer shall pay to Seller or
the Company, as applicable, their reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
attorneys fees and the reasonable and documented out pocket fees and expenses
of any expert or consultant engaged Seller or the Company, as applicable) in
connection with such suit promptly following the entry of such final and non-
appealable judgment by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated in writing by Seller.

this Agreement, whether or not the Closing occurs or the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the fees and disbursements of counsel, financial
advisors and accountants, shall be paid by the Party incurring such fees or
expenses; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, the Group Companies shall
remain responsible for any Unpaid Seller Expenses incurred by them prior to
the Closing. All transfer Taxes, recording fees or other similar Taxes imposed
on any of the Parties by any Governmental Entity in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne by Buyer.

Section 10.5 _Construction; Interpretation_. The term "this Agreement" means
this Agreement together with all Schedules and Exhibits hereto, as the same
may from time to time be amended, modified, supplemented or restated in
accordance with the terms hereof. The headings contained in this Agreement
are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement. No Party, nor its respective counsel,
shall be deemed the drafter of this Agreement for purposes of construing
or enforcing the provisions hereof, and all provisions of this Agreement
shall be construed according to their fair meaning and not strictly for or
against any Party, and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring
or disfavoring any Person by virtue of its authorship of any provision of
this Agreement. Unless otherwise indicated to the contrary herein by the
context or use thereof: (i) the words, "herein," "hereto," "hereof" and words
of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole, including the Schedules
and Exhibits, and not to any particular section, subsection, paragraph,
subparagraph or clause contained in this Agreement; (ii) masculine gender
shall also include the feminine and neutral genders, and vice versa; (iii)
words importing the singular shall also include the plural, and vice versa;
(iv) the words "include," "includes" or "including" shall be deemed to be
followed by the words "without limitation"; (v) the word "extent" in the
phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing
extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if"; and (vi) references to
"dollar," "dollars" or "$" shall be to the lawful currency of the United
States. In the event a value expressed or denominated in a currency is to be
expressed or denominated in another currency for purposes of this Agreement,
including for purposes of calculating Cash and Cash Equivalents, Indebtedness
or Net Working Capital, the relevant currency conversion shall be made using
the mid-point foreign exchange rate provided by Bloomberg as of 5:00 p.m. New
York City time on the Business Day prior to the Closing Date. In the event
that a relevant foreign exchange rate is not provided by Bloomberg, such
exchange rate for purposes of this Agreement shall be the mid-point official
foreign exchange rate published by the local central bank (or equivalent
institution) of the relevant foreign jurisdiction on the Business Day prior to
the Closing Date.

 

Section 10.6 _Exhibits and Schedules_. All Exhibits and Schedules or other
documents expressly incorporated into this Agreement, are hereby incorporated
into this Agreement and are hereby made a part hereof as if set out in full in
this Agreement. Any item disclosed on any section of the Schedules will
qualify (a) the corresponding Section of this Agreement and (b) other
Sections of this Agreement to the extent (notwithstanding the absence of a
specific cross-reference) that it is clear from a reasonable reading of the
Schedules and such other Sections of this Agreement that such disclosure
is also applicable to such other Sections of this Agreement. Further, each
Material Contract may be disclosed once in the most relevant

 



66  subsection of _Schedule 3.6(a)_ but shall be deemed disclosed in each and
every other subsection of _Schedule 3.6(a)_ to which it applies
(notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross-reference). The
specification of any dollar amount in the representations or warranties
contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item in any
Schedule is not intended to imply that such amounts, or higher or lower
amounts or the items so included or other items, are or are not material, and
no Party shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts or the inclusion of
any such item in any dispute or controversy as to whether any obligation,
items or matter not described herein or included in a Schedule is or is not
material for purposes of this Agreement.

Section 10.7 _Time of the Essence; Computation of Time_. Time is of the
essence for each and every provision of this Agreement. In the computation of
periods of time from a specified date to a later specified date, the word
"from" means "from and including" and the words "to" and "until" mean "to but
excluding" and the word "through" means "to and including." Whenever the last
day for the exercise of any privilege or the discharge of any duty
hereunder shall fall upon a day that is not a Business Day, the Party having
such privilege or duty may exercise such privilege or discharge such duty on
the next succeeding day that is a Business Day.

 

Section 10.8 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each Party and its successors and permitted
assigns and, except as provided in _Section 6.7_, _Section 6.12_, _Section
9.3(c)_ and _Section 10.18_, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any rights, benefits or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Debt Financing Sources shall be express
third party beneficiaries of this  _Section 10.8_ and _Sections 9.3(c)_ ,
_10.1(c)_ , _10.10_ , _10.11(c)_ , _10.14_ and _10.20_.

 

Section 10.9 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement will be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable Law, but if any term or other provision of this Agreement is
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable Law, all other
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect so long as
the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal or unenforceable under applicable Law, the Parties shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated
to the greatest extent possible.

Section 10.10 _Amendment_. Subject to Law and _Section 10.11_, this
Agreement may be amended or modified only by a written agreement executed and
delivered by duly authorized officers of the Parties. This Agreement may not
be modified or amended except as provided in the immediately preceding
sentence and any purported amendment by any Party or Parties effected in a
manner which does not comply with this _Section 10.10_ shall be void.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this  _Section
10.10_ and _Sections 9.3(c)_ , _10.1(c)_ , _10.8_ , _10.11(c)_ , _10.14_ and
_10.20_ (and any definition set forth in, or other provision of, this
Agreement to the extent that an amendment or modification of such definition
or other provision would amend or modify the substance of this _Section
10.10_ and _Sections 9.3(c)_ , _10.1(c)_ , _10.8_ , _10.11(c)_ , _10.14_ and
_10.20_ may not be amended or modified in a manner adverse to any Debt
Financing Source without the prior written consent of such Debt Financing
Source (and any such amendment or modification without such prior written
consent shall be null and void).

 



67 Section 10.11 _Waiver_.

 

(a) Seller may waive compliance by Buyer with any term or provision of this
Agreement. Buyer may waive compliance by Seller or the Group Companies with
any term or provision of this Agreement.

(b) Any agreement on the part of any Party to any such waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such Party. Any
waiver of any term or condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any
subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a
waiver of any other term or condition of this Agreement. The failure of or
delay by any Party to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute
a waiver of such rights; _provided_ , _however_ , that time is of the essence
with respect to each and every provision of this Agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this _Section
10.11(c)_ and _ Sections 10.8_, _10.10_ , _10.14_ and _10.20_ (and any
definition set forth in, or other provision of, this Agreement to the extent
that a waiver of such definition or other provision would amend or modify the
substance of this  _Section 10.11(c)_ and _Sections 10.8_, _10.10_ ,
_10.14_ and _10.20_ ) may not be waived in a manner adverse to any Debt
Financing Source without the prior written consent of such Debt Financing
Source (and any such waiver without such prior written consent shall be null
and void).

Section 10.12 _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement may be
executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement
by facsimile or scanned pages shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart to this Agreement.

Section 10.13  _Knowledge of the Company_. For all purposes of this
Agreement, the phrase "to the Companys knowledge," "to the knowledge of the
Company" and "known by the Company" and any derivations thereof or
phrases having similar import thereto shall mean as of the applicable date,
the actual knowledge without independent investigation (and shall in no event
encompass constructive, imputed or similar concepts of knowledge) of Trent
Freiberg, Jeffrey Fisher, Peter Stressman, Jose Rodriguez or Javier Payan,
none of whom shall have any personal liability or obligations regarding such
knowledge.

 

Section 10.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each Party hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, any right to trial by jury of any Action (a) arising
under this Agreement or (b) in any way connected with or related or incidental
to the dealings of the Parties in respect of this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including any Action against any Debt
Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the
Debt Financing Commitments or the transactions contemplated thereby), in each
case, whether now existing or hereafter arising, and whether in
contract, tort, equity, or otherwise. Each Party hereby agrees and consents
that any such Action shall be decided by court trial without a jury and that
the Parties (and any Debt Financing Source) may file an original counterpart
of a copy of this Agreement with any court as written evidence of the consent
of the Parties to the waiver of their right to trial by jury.

 



68 Section 10.15 _Jurisdiction and Venue_. Each of the Parties (a) submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware
(or, if the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the
State of Delaware) in any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such Action may be heard
and determined in any such court and (c) agrees not to bring any Action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other court. Each of the
Parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any
Action so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be
required of any other Party with respect thereto. Each Party agrees that
service of summons and complaint or any other process that might be served in
any Action may be made on such Party by sending or delivering a copy of the
process to the Party to be served at the address of the Party and in the
manner provided for the giving of notices in _Section 10.2_. Nothing in this
_Section 10.15_, however, shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal
process in any other manner permitted by Law. Each Party agrees that a
final, non-appealable judgment in any Action so brought shall be conclusive
and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
Law.

 

Section 10.16 _Remedies._

 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing
to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate this
Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach
such provisions. Prior to the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Article 9_, Seller and Buyer shall be entitled to seek an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent or cure breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which Seller or Buyer are
entitled at Law or in equity.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything herein or in any Ancillary
Document to the contrary, it is hereby acknowledged and agreed that Seller
shall not be entitled to seek specific performance to cause Buyer to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded or to consummate the Closing in accordance with
_Article 2_ unless (i) Buyer is required to complete the Closing pursuant to
_Section 2.1_ and fails to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is
required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.1_, (ii) the financing
provided for by the Debt Financing Commitment (or, if Alternative Financing,
as the case may be) has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the
Equity Financing is funded at the Closing and (iii) Seller has irrevocably
confirmed in writing that, if specific performance is granted and the
Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing will occur
in accordance with _Article 2_.

 



69 (c) Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief when expressly
available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis that (i) there
is adequate remedy at Law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. Any Party seeking an
injunction or injunctions from a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent
breaches of this Agreement when expressly available pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with
any such injunction or other Order.

 

Section 10.17 _Waivers_. Recognizing that Hunton and Williams LLP has acted as
legal counsel to Seller and certain of its Affiliates and the Group Companies
prior to the Closing, and that Hunton and Williams LLP intends to act as legal
counsel to Seller and certain of its Affiliates after the Closing, each of
Buyer, and each Group Company hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees to
cause its Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection with
Hunton and Williams LLP representing Seller and/or its Affiliates after the
Closing as such representation may relate to Buyer, the Group Companies or
the transactions contemplated herein (including in respect of litigation). In
addition, all communications involving attorney-client confidences between
Seller, its Affiliates, the Group Companies and Hunton and Williams LLP in the
course of the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that
belong solely to Seller and its Affiliates (and not any of the Group
Companies). Accordingly, Buyer agrees that following the Closing neither it,
nor any of the Group Companies nor any of their Affiliates shall have access
to any such communications or to the files of Hunton and Williams LLP relating
to its engagement with Seller and certain of its Affiliates and/or the Group
Companies. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after
the Closing, (i) Seller and its Affiliates (and not any of the Group
Companies) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with
respect to such engagement, and no Group Company shall be a holder thereof,
(ii) to the extent that files of Hunton and Williams LLP in respect of such
engagement constitute property of the client, only Seller and its Affiliates
(and not any of the Group Companies) shall hold such property rights and (iii)
Hunton and Williams LLP shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any
such attorney-client communications or files to any of the Group Companies by
reason of any attorney-client relationship between Hunton and Williams LLP and
any of the Group Companies or otherwise.

 

Section 10.18 _Non-Recourse_. All Actions (whether in contract or in tort, in
Law or in equity) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement or the Ancillary Documents, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents (including any
representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or
the Ancillary Documents or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement or
the Ancillary Documents), may be made only against the entities that are
expressly identified as Parties hereto and parties thereto. No Person who is
not a named party to this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents, including any
past, present or future director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator,
member, partner, equityholders (including stockholders and optionholders),
Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of any named party to this
Agreement or the other Ancillary Documents (" _Non-Party Affiliates_ "), shall
have any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in Law or in equity, or
based upon any theory that seeks to impose liability of an entity party
against its owners or affiliates) for any obligations or liabilities arising
under, in connection with or related to this Agreement or such other Ancillary
Document (as the case may be) or for any 

 



70  claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or such other
Ancillary Document (as the case may be) or the negotiation or execution hereof
or thereof; and each Party waives and releases all such liabilities, claims
and obligations against any such Non-Party Affiliates. Non-Party Affiliates
are expressly intended as third party beneficiaries of this provision of this
Agreement.

 

Section 10.19 _CCI Guarantee_. CCI does hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantee to Buyer the full, complete and prompt performance and payment, as
the case may be, of the Guaranteed Obligations (as hereafter defined), and
undertakes with Buyer that, whenever Seller does not pay or perform any of the
Guaranteed Obligations in accordance with their respective terms, CCI shall,
immediately on demand by Buyer, pay or perform such Guaranteed Obligations as
if it were the principal obligor primarily liable for the performance and not
as a mere surety. Buyer may obtain recourse against CCI for the payment
and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations prior to, concurrently with, or
after any other Action to enforce such Guaranteed Obligations. In no event
shall Buyer be deemed to have elected any remedy that precludes or impairs its
ability to proceed against CCI hereunder. CCI hereby waives protest,
presentment, demand for payment and notice of default or nonpayment.
Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, CCI may not
assign or transfer its obligations hereunder to any other person without the
prior written consent of Buyer. CCI shall be entitled to perform or satisfy
the Guaranteed Obligations pursuant to the same terms and conditions and
subject to the same rights and limitations as are applicable to Seller under
this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "
means Sellers obligations (a) under _Section 2.3(c)(ii)_ to pay to Buyer and
amount equal to the Actual Adjustment if the Actual Adjustment is a negative
number, (b) to comply with the restrictive covenants set forth in Section
_6.16_ , (c) to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and the Group Companies for
the matters described in _Section 6.19_ (subject to the limitations
described in _Section 6.19_), and (d) with respect to any claim based on
Fraud by Seller (based solely on the representations and warranties in
_Article 3_ and _Article 4_ ).

 

Section 10.20 Certain Matters Regarding the Debt Financing Sources.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) Seller, the Company
and each of the other Parties hereto agrees that any claim, controversy or
dispute of any kind or nature (whether in contract or in tort, in Law, in
equity or otherwise) against a Debt Financing Source that is in any way
related to this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt Financing Commitments
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including any such dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing, shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York, without
giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the Law of any jurisdiction other than the State of New
York; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) the determination of the accuracy of
any representation and warranty made by Seller in this Agreement as are
material to the interest of the Debt Financing Sources and whether as a result
of any inaccuracy thereof Buyer (or Buyers applicable Affiliate) has the
right to terminate its or its Affiliates obligations pursuant to _Section
9.1_ of this Agreement or otherwise declines to consummate the purchase of the
Shares as a result of the failure of the closing condition set forth in
_Section 7.2(a)_ of this Agreement as a result of a breach of such
representations and warranties in this Agreement, (B) the interpretation of
whether a Company

  



71  Material Adverse Effect has occurred and (C) the determination of whether
the purchase of the Shares has been consummated in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement shall, in each case, be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State
of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of
the Law of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware and (ii) Seller
and the Company (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and their respective
officers, directors, employees, members, managers, partners and
controlling persons) and each of the other Parties hereto (A) agrees that it
will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in Law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Debt Financing
Sources in any way relating to this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt
Financing Commitments or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Financing or the performance thereof or the transactions contemplated
thereby, in any forum other than exclusively in the Supreme Court of the State
of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York in the County of New York (and appellate
courts thereof), (B) submits for itself and its property with respect to
any such action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (C) agrees that
service of summons and complaint or any other process that might be served in
any action or proceeding may be made on any Party by sending or delivering a
copy of the process to such Party to be served at the address of such Party
and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in _Section 10.2_ and
shall be effective service of process against it for any such action brought
in any such court, (D) waives and hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of, any such action in any such court and (E) agrees
that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding so brought shall be
conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of Seller and the
Company (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and their respective
officers, directors, employees, members, managers, partners and controlling
persons) agrees that none of it, its Affiliates and their respective officers,
directors, employees, members, managers, partners and controlling persons
shall have any rights or claims against any Debt Financing Source in
connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt Financing
Commitments or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or in respect
of any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in connection
herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the Debt Financing or Alternative Financing, as applicable, or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, whether at Law or
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing will not limit the rights of the parties to the Debt Financing under
the Debt Financing Commitments or the definitive documentation with respect
thereto. In addition, in no event will any Debt Financing Source be liable for
consequential, special, exemplary, punitive or indirect damages (including any
loss of profits, business or anticipated savings) or damages of a tortious
nature in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt
Financing Commitments or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Financing or Alternative Financing, as
applicable, or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby,
whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.
