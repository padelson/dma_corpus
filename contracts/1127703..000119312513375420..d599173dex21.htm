ARTICLE 1

THE MERGER 

1.1 _Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Pennsylvania Business
Corporation Law of 1988, as amended (the "PBCL"), at the Effective Time (as
defined in Section 1.2 of this Agreement), NEWCO shall merge with and into
Eastern (the "Merger"). Eastern shall be the surviving corporation in the
Merger, and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate

connection with the Closing, articles of merger (the "Articles of Merger")
will be filed with the Department of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
(the "Pennsylvania Department of State") pursuant to Section 1926 and 1927 of
the PBCL. The parties will make all other filings or recordings as may be
required under the PBCL, and the Merger will become effective when the
Articles of Merger are filed in the office of the Pennsylvania Department of
State, or at such later date or time as NEWCO and Eastern agree and specify
in the Articles of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the
"Effective Time"). 1.3 _Effects of Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in this Agreement, the Articles of Merger and the
PBCL, including but not limited to Section 1929 of the PBCL. At the Effective
Time, (i) all rights, franchises, licenses and interests of NEWCO in and to
every type of property, real, personal and mixed, and all choses in action of
NEWCO shall continue unaffected and uninterrupted by the Merger and shall
accrue to Eastern; (ii) all rights, franchises, licenses and interests of
Eastern in and to every type of property, real, personal and mixed, and all
choses in action of Eastern shall continue unaffected and uninterrupted by the
Merger and shall continue to accrue to Eastern; (iii) all obligations and
liabilities of Eastern then outstanding shall remain obligations of Eastern;
(iv) all obligations and liabilities of NEWCO then outstanding shall become
and be obligations of Eastern; and (v) no action or proceeding then pending
and to which Eastern or NEWCO is a party shall be abated or discontinued but
may be prosecuted to final judgment by Eastern.

1.4 _Conversion of NEWCO Shares_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger without any action on part of the holder of any capital stock of
ProAssurance, NEWCO or Eastern, each of the shares of NEWCO common stock, no
par value ("NEWCO Common Stock"), issued and outstanding prior to
the Effective Time shall convert into one share of common stock of Eastern,
no par value (the "Eastern Common Stock"). It is the intention of the parties
that, immediately after the Effective Time, ProAssurance shall own all of
the issued and outstanding shares of Eastern Common Stock as the surviving
corporation of the Merger.

1.5 _Conversion of Eastern Capital Stock_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the following exchange shall occur at the
Effective Time:

(a) Without any action on the part of any holder of record of the shares of
common stock, each share of Eastern Common Stock (including the Eastern
Restricted Stock as provided in the Eastern Stock Plans (as defined in Section
1.6(a)) or pursuant to Section 1.6(d) below) shall be converted into the
right to receive payment of cash to each holder of Eastern Common Stock in an
amount equal to $24.50 per share of Eastern Common Stock without interest (the
"Stock Consideration").

(b) Each holder of Eastern Common Stock shall cease to have any rights as
shareholders of Eastern at and after the Effective Time.

(c) Each share of Eastern Common Stock that is owned by Eastern or any Eastern
Subsidiary shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no Stock Consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefore.

1.6 _Stock Options and Restricted Stock._

(a) Section 1.6 of the Eastern Disclosure Schedule (as defined in Article 3 of
this Agreement) lists (i) any unexpired and unexercised options or similar
rights to purchase Eastern Common Stock issued by Eastern (the "Eastern Stock
Options") pursuant to Easterns 2006 Stock Incentive Plan or any other
plan, agreement or arrangement (the "Eastern Stock Plans"), (ii) any
restricted shares of Eastern that have been or may be issued pursuant to the
Eastern Stock Plans (the "Eastern Restricted Stock"), and (iii) any other
stock-based amounts awarded or that are otherwise outstanding on the date of
this Agreement (collectively with the Eastern Stock Options and the Eastern
Restricted Stock, the "Eastern Stock Awards"). Section 1.6 of the Eastern
Disclosure Schedule also sets forth: (i) with respect to each Eastern

 



2  Stock Option, as applicable, the option exercise price, the number of shares
subject to the option, the date granted, vesting, and expiration of the option
and indicates whether the option is either an incentive or a nonqualified
stock option as those terms are used in the Code, (ii) with respect to each
award of Eastern Restricted Stock, as applicable, the date of the award and
the vesting schedule for such award, and (iii) any other information relating
to the liabilities or amount owed under the Eastern Stock Plans.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Eastern (or if
appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and
take all other actions necessary and appropriate to provide that, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, in accordance with the terms of the applicable
Eastern Stock Plans, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holders of any options or other stock-based awards, each
participant in any of the Eastern Stock Plans shall fully and immediately
vest in any options or other stock-based awards awarded under such Eastern
Stock Plans.

 

(c) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holders thereof, each Eastern Stock Option shall be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the amount by
which $24.50 exceeds the exercise price per share of the Eastern Stock Option
multiplied by number of shares of Eastern Common Stock previously subject to
such Eastern Stock Option without interest (such amounts payable hereunder
being referred to as the "Option Consideration"). From and after the Effective
Time, any Eastern Stock Option converted pursuant to this _Section
1.6_ shall be cancelled and no longer exercisable by the former holder
thereof, but shall only entitle such holder to the payment of the Option
Consideration.

 

(d) The restrictions on each share of Eastern Restricted Stock shall lapse
immediately prior to, and effective upon the occurrence of, the Effective
Time, and each share of Eastern Restricted Stock shall be fully vested in each
holder thereof at such time, and each such share of Eastern Restricted Stock
will be treated at the Effective Time the same as, and have the same rights
and be subject to the same conditions hereunder as, each share of Eastern
Common Stock, including the cash conversion discussed in Section 1.5 above.

 

(e) To the extent then in effect, after the Effective Time, all Eastern Stock
Plans shall be terminated and no further Eastern Stock Options, shares of
Eastern Restricted Stock, or other awards shall be granted under the Eastern
Stock Plans.

1.7 _Articles of Incorporation of Surviving Corporation_. Subject to the

this Agreement, at the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Eastern then in effect
shall be, and shall continue in effect as, the Bylaws of Eastern, as the
surviving corporation in the Merger, until amended in accordance with
applicable law.

 



3 1.9 _Management and Officers of Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time,
the Board of Directors of Eastern and the officers of Eastern, as the
surviving corporation in the Merger, shall be the persons named on Schedule
1.9 to this Agreement, until their successors are elected and qualified.

 

1.10 _ProAssurance Common Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each share
of ProAssurance Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior thereto
shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock of ProAssurance
and shall not be affected by the Merger.

 

ARTICLE 2

EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

2.1 _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, ProAssurance shall appoint a
bank or trust company to act as an exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent"), who
shall be acceptable to Eastern. The Exchange Agent shall effect the plan of
exchange as herein provided. ProAssurance shall pay the charges and expenses
of the Exchange Agent.

 

2.2 _Exchange Procedures._

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, ProAssurance shall deposit with the Exchange
Agent (the "Exchange Fund") cash in an amount equal to the sum of the Stock
Consideration and Option Consideration (collectively the "Merger
Consideration") and promptly after the Effective Time, but no later than five
(5) business days following the Effective Time, Eastern shall deposit with
the Exchange Agent a list of the names and addresses of each Person (as
defined in Section 9.16(a) of this Agreement) who was a record holder of
Eastern Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time or who
is otherwise entitled to receive the Merger Consideration (collectively the
"Merger Consideration Recipients") and the amount of the cash payment to which
each of the Merger Consideration Recipients is entitled under the plan
of exchange.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, but no later than ten (10) business
days following the Effective Time, ProAssurance will send or cause to be sent
to each person who was a record holder of Eastern Common Stock immediately
before the Effective Time transmittal materials for exchanging the shares of
Eastern Common Stock for the Merger Consideration. Upon delivery to the
Exchange Agent of the duly executed transmittal materials, including any
certificates representing shares of Eastern Common Stock (the "Old
Certificates"), and such other documents as the Exchange Agent may reasonably
require, the holder of such shares of Eastern Common Stock and book entry
shares of Eastern Common Stock shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to receive
in respect of the shares of Eastern Common Stock or book entry shares of
Eastern Common Stock surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Section
2.2 (after taking into account all shares of Eastern Common Stock then held by
such holder), and the Old Certificates and book entry shares so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. Neither ProAssurance nor Eastern, as the
surviving corporation, shall be obligated to deliver the Merger Consideration
to which any former record holder of Eastern Common Stock is entitled as a
result of the Merger until such record holder delivers to the Exchange Agent
the executed transmittal materials and, if applicable, his or her certificate
or certificates representing the shares of Eastern Common Stock for exchange
as provided in this Section 2.2.

 



4 (c) Promptly after the Effective Time, but no later than ten (10) business
days following the Effective Time, ProAssurance will send or cause to be sent
to each person who was a holder of an outstanding Eastern Stock Option or
Eastern Restricted Stock that was issued in book entry form only, the payment
to which such person is entitled with respect to such Eastern Stock Option or
Eastern Restricted Stock under the provisions of Section 1.5(a) and 1.6(c).

(d) Any other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, none of Eastern,
ProAssurance or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Merger Consideration
Recipient for any amounts paid or property delivered in good faith to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law.

(e) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Eastern shall be closed
as to holders of Eastern Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and no transfer of Eastern Common Stock by any such record holder shall
thereafter be made or recognized. Until surrendered for exchange in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 2.2, each certificate theretofore
representing shares of Eastern Common Stock shall from and after the Effective
Time represent for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration provided in this Agreement in exchange therefor.

2.3 _Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains
undistributed to the holder of Eastern Common Stock for six (6) months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to ProAssurance, upon demand, and any
holder of Eastern Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this
Agreement shall thereafter look only to ProAssurance for payment of
their claim for distributions with respect to the Merger Consideration.

2.4 _Withholding_. ProAssurance or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to any Merger Consideration
Recipient such amounts as ProAssurance (or any affiliate) or the Exchange
Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any applicable provision of U.S. federal, state,
local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent that such amounts are properly
withheld by ProAssurance or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts will be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Merger
Consideration Recipient in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were
made by ProAssurance or the Exchange Agent.

2.5 _Lost or Stolen Certificates_. If any holder of Eastern Common Stock is
unable to deliver the Old Certificate which represents such shares of Eastern
Common Stock, the Exchange Agent, in the absence of actual notice that any
such shares have been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, shall deliver to such
holder the Merger Consideration to which the holder of Eastern Common Stock
is entitled for such shares upon presentation of the following: (i) a sworn
affidavit or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Exchange Agent and
ProAssurance that any such certificate has been lost, wrongfully taken or
destroyed; (ii) such security or indemnity as may be reasonably requested by
the Exchange Agent or ProAssurance to

 



5  indemnify and hold ProAssurance and the Exchange Agent harmless, and (iii)
evidence satisfactory to the Exchange Agent and ProAssurance that such person
is the owner of the shares theretofore represented by each certificate
claimed by the holder to be lost, wrongfully taken or destroyed and that the
holder is the person who would be entitled to present such certificate for
exchange pursuant to this Agreement.

Filed SEC Reports"), and (vi) all comment letters received by Eastern from
the Staff of the SEC since January 1, 2010 and all responses to such comment
letters by or on behalf of Eastern.

 

(b) Except as set forth in Section 3.7(b) of the Eastern Disclosure Schedule,
the Eastern SEC Reports (i) were or will be prepared in accordance with the
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and the rules and
regulations thereunder (the "Securities Act") and the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder, as the case may be, in all material
respects, and (ii) did not at the time they were filed with the SEC, or will
not at the time they are filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As used in this
Section 3.7, the term "file" shall be broadly construed to include any manner
in which a document or information is furnished, supplied or otherwise made
available to the SEC.

 



12 (c) Eastern has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as such term is defined in Section 13(b)(2)(B) and Rule 13a-15(e) under the
Exchange Act). Such disclosure controls and procedures: (i) are designed to
ensure that material information relating to Eastern and its Subsidiaries is
made known to Easterns chief executive officer and its chief financial
officer by others within those entities, particularly during the periods in
which Easterns reports and filings under the Exchange Act are
being prepared, (ii) have been evaluated for effectiveness as of the end of
the most recent annual period reported to the SEC, and (iii) are effective to
perform the functions for which they were established. Neither the auditors of
Eastern nor the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Eastern have
been advised of: (x) any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in
the design or operation of the internal controls over financial reporting (as
such term is defined in Section 13(b)(2)(B) and Rule 13a-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) of Eastern and its Subsidiaries which could adversely affect
Easterns ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data,
and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a role in the internal controls over financial reporting of
Eastern and its Subsidiaries. Since the date of the most recent evaluation
of such internal controls over financial reporting and procedures, there have
been no significant changes in internal controls over financial reporting or
in other factors that could significantly affect such internal controls over
financial reporting, including any corrective actions with regard to
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.

(d) The financial statements of Eastern and the Eastern Subsidiaries included
in the Eastern SEC Reports (including the related notes) (the "Eastern GAAP
Financial Statements") (i) did or will comply as to form, as of their
respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto (including, without limitation, Regulation S-X),
(ii) were or will be prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of
unaudited statements, to the extent permitted by Regulation S-X for Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q) applied on a consistent basis during the periods and at
the dates involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), and
(iii) did or will fairly present the consolidated financial condition of
Eastern and the Eastern Subsidiaries at the dates thereof and the consolidated
results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in
the case of unaudited statements, to notes and normal year-end audit
adjustments that were not, or with respect to any such financial statements
contained in any Eastern SEC Reports to be filed subsequent to the date hereof
are not reasonably expected to be, material in amount or effect). Except (x)
as reflected in Easterns audited balance sheet at December 31, 2012 (the
"2012 Eastern Balance Sheet"), or liabilities described in any notes thereto
(or liabilities for which neither accrual nor footnote disclosure is required
pursuant to GAAP), or (y) for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of
business since December 31, 2012 consistent with past practice or in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
neither Eastern nor any Eastern Subsidiary has any material liabilities or
obligations of any nature.

 

(e) Each Eastern SEC Report filed pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange
Act which included financial statements was accompanied by the certifications
of Easterns chief executive officer and chief financial officer as required
under Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act.

 



13 (f) Section 3.7(f) of the Eastern Disclosure Schedule lists, and Eastern has
delivered to ProAssurance copies, of the documentation creating or governing,
all securitization transactions and "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as
defined in Item 303(c) of Regulation S-K of the SEC) effected by Eastern or
its Subsidiaries since December 31, 2009.

 

(g) To the Knowledge of Eastern, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, which has
expressed its opinion with respect to the Eastern GAAP Financial Statements,
is and has been throughout the periods covered by its opinion (i) a registered
public accounting firm (as defined in Section 2(a)(12) of SOX), (ii)
"independent" with respect to Eastern within the meaning of Regulation S-X,
and (iii) in compliance with subsections (g) through (l) of Section 10A of the
Exchange Act and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. All non-audit
services performed by Easterns independent auditor for Eastern and each
Eastern Subsidiary for each year commencing after December 31, 2009, have been
disclosed in the Eastern SEC Reports and were approved by the Audit Committee
of the Board of Directors of Eastern in accordance with Section 10A(i) of the
Exchange Act.

 

(h) Eastern and each Eastern Subsidiary maintains accurate books and records
reflecting its assets and liabilities and maintains proper and adequate
internal accounting controls over financial reporting which provide assurance
that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with managements
authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of the consolidated financial statements of Eastern and to
maintain accountability for the consolidated assets of Eastern; (iii) access
to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements authorization; and
(iv) the reporting of assets is compared with existing assets at regular
intervals.

3.8 _Accounts Receivable_. All accounts receivable payable to Eastern and
each Eastern Subsidiary arose and are collectible in the ordinary and usual
course of the Business consistent with past practices, are reflected properly
on their respective books and records, and will be collected in accordance
with their terms at the recorded amounts subject to a reasonable reserve for
uncollectible accounts.

3.9 _Broker s Fees_. Except as set forth in Section 3.9 of the Eastern
Disclosure Schedule (which sets forth amounts paid or to be paid and names of
parties to which such amounts were or will be paid), none of Eastern, the
Eastern Subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors, has
employed any broker or finder or incurred any liability for any brokers fees
or commissions, or investment banker fees or commissions, or finders fees in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

3.10 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events._

or reserved against on the 2012 Eastern Balance Sheet (or liabilities for
which neither accrual nor footnote disclosure is required pursuant to GAAP),

business consistent with past practice since December 31, 2012,

Eastern, and, there is no existing condition, situation or set of
circumstances that would be reasonably expected to result in such a liability
or obligation. Except as disclosed in the Eastern SEC Reports filed prior to

Subsidiaries have carried on their respective businesses in all material
respects in the ordinary and usual course theretofore conducted.

financial condition, assets, or business (financial or otherwise) of Eastern
or any Eastern Subsidiary, which, either individually or in the aggregate, has

3.11 _Legal Proceedings and Judgments._

 

(a) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(a) of the Eastern Disclosure Schedule,
neither Eastern nor any Eastern Subsidiary is a party to any, and there are
no pending or, to the Knowledge of Eastern, threatened, legal, administrative,
arbitral or other inquiries, proceedings, claims (whether asserted or
unasserted), actions or governmental or regulatory or self-regulatory
organization ("SRO") investigations of any nature (including noncontractual

16 3.12 _Insurance._

 

(a) Except as set forth in Section 3.12(a) of the Eastern Disclosure Schedule,
Eastern and the Eastern Subsidiaries maintain policies of general liability,
fire and casualty, automobile, directors and officers, errors and omissions,
fiduciary, and other forms of insurance (the "Eastern Insurance Policies") in
such amounts, with such deductibles and against such risks and losses as are
reasonable for the business and assets of Eastern and the Eastern
Subsidiaries. All such policies are in full force and effect, all premiums due
and payable thereon have been paid (other than retroactive or retrospective
premium adjustments that are not yet, but may be, required to be paid with
respect to any period ending prior to the Closing Date under comprehensive
general liability and workmens compensation insurance policies), and no
notice of cancellation or termination has been received with respect to any
such policy which has not been replaced on substantially similar terms prior
to the date of such cancellation.

 

(b) No issuer of the Eastern Insurance Policies has issued a reservation-of-
rights letter, or entered into a nonwaiver agreement, or otherwise denied or
limited coverage (in whole or in part), under any of the Eastern
Insurance Policies with respect to any open or unresolved claim, and no
declaratory judgment has been sought by any Person or entered by any court of
competent jurisdiction that denies or limits coverage (in whole or in part)
under any of the Eastern Insurance Policies.

3.13 _Taxes and Tax Returns._

 

(a) As used in this Agreement: "Tax" or "Taxes" means all federal, state,
county, local, and foreign income, excise, gross receipts, gross income,
profits, franchise, license, ad valorem, profits, gains, capital, sales,
transfer, use, payroll, employment, severance, withholding, duties,
intangibles, franchise, backup withholding, stamp, occupation, premium,
social security (or similar), unemployment, disability, real property,
personal property, sales, use, registration, alternative or add on minimum,
estimated, and other taxes, charges, levies or like assessments together with
all penalties and additions to tax and interest thereon). "Tax Return" or
"Tax Returns" means any and all returns, declarations, claims for refunds,
reports, information returns and information statements (including,
without limitation, Form 1099, Form W-2 and W-3, Form 5500, and Form 990)
with respect to Taxes filed, or required to be filed, by any Person or
any Subsidiary of such Person with the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS")
or any other Governmental Authority or tax authority or agency, whether
domestic or foreign (including consolidated, combined and unitary tax
returns).

 

(b) Eastern and the Eastern Subsidiaries have duly filed all Tax Returns
required to be filed by them on or prior to the date of this Agreement (all
such Tax Returns being accurate and complete in all material respects) and has
duly paid or made sufficient provisions for the payment of all Taxes shown
thereon as owing on or prior to the date of this Agreement (including, if and
to the extent applicable, those due in respect of their properties, income,
business, capital stock, premiums, franchises, licenses, sales and payrolls)
other than Taxes which are not yet delinquent or are being contested in good
faith and have not been finally determined for which adequate reserves have
been made in the Eastern GAAP Financial Statements. Neither Eastern nor any
Eastern Subsidiary has waived any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes
or agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax Return or tax

 



17  assessment or deficiency other than extensions that are automatically
granted by the taxing authorities upon filing an application therefore. The
unpaid Taxes of Eastern and the Eastern Subsidiaries do not exceed the
reserve for tax liability set forth on the 2012 Eastern Balance Sheet as
adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance with
past custom and practice of Eastern in filing its returns. No claim has been
made since December 31, 2008 by an authority in a jurisdiction where Eastern
or any Eastern Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be
subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

 

(c) There is no claim, audit, action, suit, proceeding or investigation now
pending or, to the Knowledge of Eastern, threatened against or with respect
to Eastern or any Eastern Subsidiary in respect of any material Tax. Eastern
and each Eastern Subsidiary in connection with amounts paid or owed to any
employee, independent contractor, creditor, shareholder or other third party
have complied with applicable tax withholding in all material respects.
Eastern and each Eastern Subsidiary have reported such withheld amounts to the
appropriate taxing authority and to each such employee, independent
contractor, creditor, shareholder or other third party as required by
applicable law.

(d) There are no Tax Liens upon any property or assets of Eastern or its
Subsidiaries except Liens for current Taxes not yet due. Neither Eastern nor
any Eastern Subsidiary has been required to include in income any adjustment
pursuant to Section 481 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code") by reason of a voluntary change in accounting method initiated by
Eastern or any Eastern Subsidiary, and the IRS has not initiated or proposed
any such adjustment or change in accounting method. Except as set forth in the
Eastern GAAP Financial Statements, neither Eastern nor any Eastern Subsidiary
has entered into a transaction which is being accounted for as an installment
obligation under Section 453 of the Code. Neither Eastern nor any Eastern
Subsidiary is a party to or bound by any tax indemnity, tax sharing or tax
allocation agreement (other than such agreements as exist by and among
themselves). Neither Eastern nor any Eastern Subsidiary has ever been a member
of an affiliated group of corporations within the meaning of Section 1504 of
the Code other than as a common parent corporation. Neither Eastern nor any
Eastern Subsidiary is liable for the Taxes of any person under Section
1.1502-6 of the Treasury Regulations (or any similar provision of state,
local or foreign Tax law) or by contract, as a successor or otherwise. During
the five (5) year period ending on the date hereof, neither Eastern nor any
Eastern Subsidiary was a distributing corporation or a controlled corporation
in a transaction intended to be governed by Section 355 of the Code. Neither
Eastern nor any Eastern Subsidiary is a party to any joint venture,
partnership or other arrangement or contract that could be treated as
a partnership for federal income tax purposes.

(e) Except as set forth in Section 3.13(e) of the Eastern Disclosure Schedule,
any amount that is reasonably likely to be received (whether in cash or
property or the vesting of property) as a result of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by any employee, officer or director of Eastern
or any of its affiliates who is a "Disqualified Individual" (as such term is
defined in proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G(1) under any
employment, severance or termination agreement, other compensation arrangement
or Eastern Employee Plan (as defined in Section 3.14 of this Agreement)
currently in effect will not be characterized as an "excess parachute payment"
(as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code).

 



18 (f) There has been no disallowance of a deduction under Section 162(m) of the
Code for employee remuneration of any amount paid or payable by Eastern or
any Eastern Subsidiary under any contract, plan, program, arrangement or
understanding.

 

(g) There is no dispute or claim concerning any tax liability of Eastern or
any Eastern Subsidiary except as disclosed in Section 3.13(g) of the Eastern
Disclosure Schedule. Section 3.13(g) of the Eastern Disclosure Schedule
identifies the last Tax Returns that have been audited by the taxing authority
with whom they were filed, and indicates those Tax Returns that currently are
the subject of an audit procedure or that Eastern or any Eastern Subsidiary
has received notice will be subject to an audit procedure. Eastern has made
available to ProAssurance correct and complete copies of all federal income
tax returns (including amendments thereto) of, all examination reports of,
and statements of deficiencies assessed against or agreed to by, Eastern or
any Eastern Subsidiary for any tax year commencing after December 31, 2008.

 

(h) Except as set forth in Section 3.13(h) of the Eastern Disclosure Schedule,
Eastern and/or any Eastern Subsidiary will not have any taxable income or
gain as a result of prior inter-company transactions that will be taken into
account as a result of the changes in ownership contemplated herein.

 

(i) Eastern Re Ltd., SPC is a noncontrolled foreign corporation under the Code
and has duly filed all Tax Returns required to be filed by it on or prior to
the date of this Agreement (all such Tax Returns being accurate and complete
in all material respects) and has duly paid or made sufficient provisions for
the payment of all Taxes shown thereon as owing on or prior to the date of
this Agreement (including, if and to the extent applicable, those due in
respect of its properties, income, business, capital stock, premiums,
franchises, licenses, sales and payrolls) other than Taxes which are not yet
delinquent or are being contested in good faith and have not been finally
determined for which adequate reserves have been made in the Eastern GAAP
Financial Statements.

 

3.14 _Employee Plans; Labor Matters._

 

(a) Section 3.14(a) of the Eastern Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list of all of the Employee Plans (as defined in Section 9.16(a) of
this Agreement) for employees of Eastern and any Eastern Subsidiary ("Eastern
Employee Plans"). Those Eastern Employee Plans which cover only employees of
Eastern or a Eastern Subsidiary are separately identified. Those Eastern
Employee Plans which are non-qualified deferred compensation plans for
purposes of Section 409A of the Code are separately identified and are in
compliance with the requirements of Section 409A and the regulations
promulgated thereunder. Except with respect to the Eastern Employee Plans,
neither Eastern nor any Eastern Subsidiary sponsors, maintains or contributes
to, or has any ongoing obligation or liability whatsoever with respect to:
(i) any employee benefit plan as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), or (ii) any
other program, plan, trust agreement or arrangement for any bonus, severance,
hospitalization, vacation, sick pay, incentive, deferred compensation,
pension, profit sharing, post-employment, retirement, payroll savings, stock
option, stock purchase, group insurance, self-insurance, death benefit,
fringe benefit, welfare or any other employee benefit plan or fringe benefit
arrangement of any nature whatsoever

 



19  including those for the benefit of former employees. Neither Eastern nor any
Eastern Subsidiary has any agreement, arrangement, commitment, or
understanding, whether legally binding or not, to create any additional
Eastern Employee Plan or to continue, modify, change, or terminate, in any
material respect, any Eastern Employee Plan except as may be required by the
Code or ERISA. ProAssurance may modify, amend and/or terminate any
Eastern Employee Plan after the Effective Time, subject to applicable law and
the terms of such Eastern Employee Plan.

(b) Eastern has heretofore delivered or made available to ProAssurance true
and complete copies of each Eastern Employee Plan and certain related
documents, including: (i) the plan document and the related trust agreement or
annuity contract for such Eastern Employee Plan; (ii) the summary plan
description and material employee communication document for such Eastern
Employee Plan; (iii) the actuarial report for such Eastern Employee Plan (if
applicable) for each of the last two years; (iv) all determination letters
from the IRS (if applicable) for such Eastern Employee Plan; (v) all insurance
policies relating thereto and any written materials used by Eastern to
describe employee benefits to employees of Eastern and the
Eastern Subsidiaries; (vi) the most recent annual return on Form 5500
(including all schedules thereto along with the accompanying auditors
opinion, if applicable) and tax return (Form 990) for such Eastern Employee
Plan; (vii) the most current actuarial, valuation, and trustees reports (as
applicable) for such Eastern Employee Plan; and (viii) all material
communications with any governmental entity or agency (including the
Department of Labor, the Internal Revenue Service, the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation, and the Securities and Exchange Commission) with respect
to such Eastern Employee Plan. Each such actuarial or valuation report
correctly shows the value of the assets of such Eastern Employee Plan as of
the date thereof, the total accrued and vested liabilities, all contributions
by Eastern and the Eastern Subsidiaries, and the assumptions on which the
calculations are based.

 

(c) Except as set forth in Section 3.14(c) of the Eastern Disclosure Schedule,
each of the Eastern Employee Plans has been operated and administered in all
material respects in compliance with applicable laws, including, but not
limited to, ERISA and the Code. To the Knowledge of Eastern, there has not
been any material violation of the reporting and disclosure provisions of
the Code and ERISA. There has not been any termination or partial termination
(including any termination or partial termination attributable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) of such plans. Neither Eastern
nor any Eastern Subsidiary nor any of their respective ERISA affiliates, nor
any predecessor thereof, contributes to, or has within the past six years
contributed to, any multiemployer plans, as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA,
or any multiple employer welfare arrangements, as defined in Section 3(40) of
ERISA. Neither Eastern nor any Eastern Subsidiary nor any of their respective
ERISA affiliates, nor any predecessor thereof, sponsors, participates in, or
contributes to, or has at any time in the past sponsored, participated in, or
contributed to (i) any plan which is subject to the funding standards or
requirements described in Section 412 of the Code, or (ii) any plan which is
subject to any of the requirements, obligations, and liabilities imposed by
Title IV of ERISA.

(d) Each Eastern Employee Plan which is intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and has received a favorable
determination letter or has pending or has time remaining in which to file, an
application for such determination from the IRS, and Eastern is not aware of
any reason why any such determination letter should be revoked or not be
reissued, and any related trust is exempt from taxation under Section 501(a)
of

 



20  the Code. Except as set forth in Section 3.14(d) of the Eastern Disclosure
Schedule, each Eastern Employee Plan has been maintained in material
compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by any and all
applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to ERISA and the
Code. No prohibited transaction within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code, or breach of fiduciary duty under Title I of ERISA
has occurred with respect to any Eastern Employee Plan or with respect to
Eastern or any Eastern Subsidiary. No events have occurred with respect to any
Eastern Employee Plan that could result in payment or assessment by or
against Eastern or any Eastern Subsidiaries of any material excise taxes under
Sections 4972, 4975, 4976, 4977, 4979, 4980B, 4980D, 4980E or 5000 of the
Code.

 

(e) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement
(whether or not written) by Eastern or any Eastern Subsidiary or of their
affiliates relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage under,
any Eastern Employee Plan which would increase materially the expense of
maintaining Eastern Employee Plans above the level of the expense incurred in
respect thereof for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012. To the Knowledge
of Eastern, no event has occurred or circumstances exist that could result in
a material increase in the premium costs of Eastern Employee Plans that are
insured, or a material increase in benefit costs of the Eastern Employee
Plans that are self-insured.

(f) Except as set forth in Section 3.14(f) of the Eastern Disclosure
Schedule, there is no action, suit, investigation, audit or proceeding pending
against or involving or, to the Knowledge of Eastern, threatened against or
involving any Eastern Employee Plan before any court or arbitrator or any
state, federal or local governmental body, agency or official, except as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Eastern. Other than claims for benefits submitted
by participants or beneficiaries in the ordinary course, no claim against, or
legal proceeding involving, any Eastern Employee Plan is pending or
threatened.

 

(g) Except as provided in Sections 1.6 and 6.4(a) of this Agreement and as
described in Section 3.14(g) of the Eastern Disclosure Schedule, neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will (i) result in any material
payment (including severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute
or otherwise) becoming due to any director or employee of Eastern or any of
its Subsidiaries from Eastern or any of its Subsidiaries under any Eastern
Employee Plan or otherwise; (ii) materially increase any benefits otherwise
payable under any Eastern Employee Plan; (iii) result in any acceleration of
the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits to any material extent (in
each case under clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) whether or not such payment or
benefit would constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section
280G of the Code); (iv) constitute an acceleration of the payment or vesting
of deferred compensation in violation of the requirements of Section 409A of
the Code; or (v) constitute a prohibited transaction within the meaning of
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, or breach of fiduciary duty
under Title I of ERISA.

 

(h) Neither Eastern nor any Eastern Subsidiary has any direct or indirect
material liability or obligation under any Eastern Employee Plan other than
as described in the terms of such Eastern Employee Plans. There are no
circumstances arising out of the sponsorship of any Eastern Employee Plan
which will result in any direct or indirect material 

 



21  liability to Eastern or any Eastern Subsidiary, other than liability for
contributions, benefit payments, administrative costs and liabilities incurred
in accordance with the terms of the Eastern Employee Plans consistent with
past practice.

(i) Eastern and each Eastern Subsidiary have made all employer contributions
for employee benefits; including deferred compensation obligations, and all
such benefits under any Eastern Employee Plan have been paid or provided for
in accordance with plan documents, or other arrangements disclosed on Section
3.14(i) of the Eastern Disclosure Schedule. There are no funded benefit
obligations under any Eastern Employee Plan for which contributions have not
been made or properly accrued, and there are no unfunded benefit obligations
that have not been accounted for by reserves, or otherwise properly footnoted
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles on the financial
statements of Eastern and each Eastern Subsidiary.

 

(j) Each Eastern Employee Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA that is not qualified under
Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code is exempt from Parts 2, 3, and 4 of Title
I of ERISA as an unfunded plan that is maintained primarily for the purpose of
providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly
compensated employees, pursuant to Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3), and 401(a)(1)
of ERISA. Except as set forth in Section 3.14(j) of the Eastern Disclosure
Schedule, no assets of Eastern or any Eastern Subsidiary are allocated to or
held in a "rabbi trust" or similar funding vehicle.

(k) Each Eastern Employee Plan that is a "group health plan" (as defined in
Section 607(1) of ERISA or Section 5001(b)(1) of the Code) has been operated
at all times in compliance with the provisions of Section 4980B of the Code
and Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA ("COBRA"), with the provisions
of the Code and ERISA enacted by the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA"), and with the provisions of any
applicable similar state law.

 

(l) Except as set forth in Section 3.14(l) of the Eastern Disclosure Schedule,
no Eastern Employee Plan provides benefits to current or former employees
beyond their retirement or other termination of service (other than coverage
mandated by COBRA, the cost of which is fully paid by the current or former
employee or his or her dependents).

 

(m) Neither Eastern nor any Eastern Subsidiary has the obligation to maintain,
establish, sponsor, participate in, or contribute to any Employee Plan for
the benefit of any employee, former employee, director or consultant of either
Eastern or any Eastern Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate who performs services
outside of the United States.

 

(n) Eastern has delivered to ProAssurance true and correct copies of (i) each
of the qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans sponsored by
Eastern and the amendment to such plans which froze the benefits under each
such plan, and (ii) the most recent actuarial report for such plans. The
liability for unfunded benefits with respect to the qualified
and nonqualified defined benefit plans as reflected in the Eastern GAAP
Financial Statements is consistent with the indicated liability in said
actuarial reports. With respect to Easterns qualified defined benefit plans,
neither Eastern nor any Eastern Subsidiary (i) has failed to timely pay
premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or (ii) has engaged in
any transaction which give rise to liability under Section 4069 or 4212(c) of
ERISA. No reportable event that would require notice (either advance or post
event) under Section 4043 of ERISA has occurred.

 



22 (o) Each Eastern Employee Benefit Plan that is or was a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and
associated Treasury Department guidance has (i) been operated between January
1, 2005 and December 31, 2008, in good faith compliance with Section 409A of
the Code and Notice 2005-01 and (ii) since January 1, 2009 (or such later
date permitted under applicable guidance), been operated in compliance with,
and is in documentary compliance with, in all respects, Section 409A of the
Code and IRS regulations and guidance thereunder. No compensation payable
under any such Eastern Employee Benefit Plan has been reportable as
nonqualified deferred compensation in the gross income of any individual or
entity, and subject to an additional tax, as a result of the operation of
Section 409A of the Code and no arrangement exists with respect to a
nonqualified deferred compensation plan that would result in income inclusion
under Section 409A(b) of the Code.

 

3.15 _Employees._

names of the employees of Eastern and the Eastern Subsidiaries, their birth

employment laws, Eastern and the Eastern Subsidiaries have the right to
terminate the employment of any of their respective employees at will and

3.20 _Real Property; Environmental Liability._

 

(a) Neither Eastern nor any Eastern Subsidiary owns any right, title or
interest in any real property except as described on Section 3.20(a) of the
Eastern Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the "Eastern Real Property").
Section 3.20(a) of the Eastern Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and
accurate list and general description of all material leases for real
property ("Eastern Real Property Leases") to which Eastern or any Eastern
Subsidiary is a party or by which any of them are bound. Eastern or an Eastern
Subsidiary has a valid leasehold interest in each Eastern Real Property
Leases, in each case free and clear of all Liens except for (i) rights of
lessors, co-lessees, mortgagees, or sublessees that are reflected in each
Eastern Real 

 



29  Property Lease; (ii) current taxes not yet due and payable; (iii) Liens of
public record; and (iv) such nonmonetary imperfections of title and
encumbrances, if any, as do not materially detract from the value of or
materially interfere with the present use of the subject property. To the
Knowledge of Eastern, the activities of Eastern and the Eastern Subsidiaries
with respect to all Eastern Real Property Leases used in connection with
their operations are in all material respects permitted and authorized by
applicable zoning laws, ordinances and regulations.

 

(b) Eastern and the Eastern Subsidiaries enjoy peaceful and undisturbed
possession under all Eastern Real Property Leases. Eastern has made available
to ProAssurance complete and correct copies of all of the Eastern Real
Property Leases. Each Eastern Real Property Lease is in full force and effect
and is legally valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with its terms
(except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,
reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and
the availability of equitable remedies). There are no monetary defaults and no
material nonmonetary defaults by Eastern or any Eastern Subsidiary, or, to
the Knowledge of Eastern, any other party, under any Eastern Real Property
Lease. Neither Eastern nor any Eastern Subsidiary has received notice of any
default, offset, counterclaim or defense under any Eastern Real Property
Lease. Except as set forth in Section 3.5(b)(ii)(y) of the Eastern Disclosure
Schedule, no condition or event has occurred which with the passage of time or
the giving of notice or both would constitute a default or breach by
Eastern or any Eastern Subsidiary, or, to the Knowledge of Eastern, any other
party, under the terms of any Eastern Real Property Lease. All rent, security
deposits, reserve funds, and other sums and charges that have become due and
payable under the Eastern Real Property Leases have been paid in full. To the
Knowledge of Eastern, there are no purchase contracts, options or other
agreements of any kind whereby any Person has acquired or will have any basis
to assert any right, title or interest in, or right to the possession, use,
enjoyment or proceeds of, any part or all of the interests in the real
property subject to the Eastern Real Property Leases. Except as disclosed on
Section 3.20(a) of the Eastern Disclosure Schedule, Eastern has never had any
ownership interest in any real property that is currently subject to a Eastern
Real Property Lease.

(c) Eastern and the Eastern Subsidiaries are and have been in compliance with
all Environmental Laws (as defined in Section 9.16(a) of this Agreement) and
all Environmental Permits (as defined in Section 9.16(a) of this Agreement) in
all material respects. There are no legal, administrative, arbitral or other
proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action, private environmental
investigations or remediation activities or governmental investigations of any
nature seeking to impose on Eastern or any Eastern Subsidiary, or to the
Knowledge of Eastern, that could reasonably be expected to result in the
imposition on Eastern or any Eastern Subsidiary of, any liability or
obligation arising under any Environmental Law which would have a
Material Adverse Effect on Eastern. To the Knowledge of Eastern, there is no
reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action, investigation or
remediation activity. Neither Eastern nor any Eastern Subsidiary is subject to
any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by or with any
Governmental Authority or private Person imposing any liability or obligation
under any Environmental Law that would have a Material Adverse Effect on
Eastern.

 

(d) No Hazardous Materials (as defined in Section 9.16(a) of this Agreement)
have been used, stored or otherwise handled in any manner by Eastern or any
Eastern Subsidiary, under, in, from or affecting property subject to the
Eastern Real Property Leases, other than in

 



30  the ordinary course of business and in compliance with Environmental Laws.

property subject to the Eastern Real Property Leases has used Hazardous
Materials on, under, in, from or affecting any real property subject to a

violations (nor do they know of any existing violations) of any applicable
laws governing the use, storage, treatment, transportation, manufacture,
refinement, handling, production or disposal of Hazardous Materials on, under,
in, from or affecting any property subject to the Eastern Real Property Leases
and there are not any legal actions or proceedings commenced or, to the
Knowledge of either Eastern or any Eastern Subsidiary, threatened by any
person with respect to any such violations.

 

(f) All property subject to the Eastern Real Property Leases is currently

Eastern Subsidiary in accordance with, and in compliance with all applicable
Environmental Laws.

3.21 _Personal Property._

 

(a) Except for statutory deposits required by law, none of the personal
property owned by Eastern or any Eastern Subsidiary is subject to, or as of
the Closing Date will be subject to, any Lien the existence of which would be
material to the conduct of the Business.

(b) Section 3.21(b) of the Eastern Disclosure Schedule lists each personal
property lease to which Eastern or any Eastern Subsidiary is a party that is
not cancelable upon ninety (90) days notice without penalty and has monthly
rent that exceeds $8,000 (collectively, the "Eastern Personal Property
Leases"). Eastern has made available to ProAssurance complete and correct
copies of all of the Eastern Personal Property Leases. To the Knowledge of
Eastern, each Eastern Personal Property Lease is in full force and effect and
is legally valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with its terms (except
as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or
similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and the availability
of equitable remedies). There are no material defaults by Eastern or any
Eastern Subsidiary, or, to the Knowledge of Eastern, any other party, under
any Eastern Personal Property Lease. Neither Eastern nor any Eastern
Subsidiary has received written notice of any material default, offset,
counterclaim or defense under any Eastern Personal Property Lease. To the
Knowledge of Eastern, no condition or event has occurred which with the
passage of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute a material
default or breach by Eastern or any Eastern Subsidiary, or, to the Knowledge
of Eastern, any other party under of the terms of any Eastern Personal
Property Lease. All rent, security deposits, reserve funds, and other sums
and charges that have become due and payable under the Eastern Personal
Property Leases have been paid in full. To the Knowledge of Eastern, there are
no purchase contracts, options or other agreements of any kind whereby any
Person has acquired or will have any basis to assert any right, title or

Personal Property Leases.

 



31 3.22 _State Takeover Laws_. The Board of Directors of Eastern has approved the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and if ProAssurance and its
affiliates do not own, in the aggregate, 10% or more of the outstanding shares
of Eastern Common Stock, the provisions of the PBCL and any other provisions
of any state or local "takeover" law applicable to Eastern will not impede or
restrict the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. ProAssurance understands and acknowledges that the Insurance Laws
applicable to Eastern regulate and apply to the change in the ownership of
Eastern as contemplated by this Agreement.

3.23 _Insurance Matters._

 

(a) Except as set forth in Section 3.23(a) of the Eastern Disclosure Schedule,
all policies, binders, slips, certificates and other agreements of insurance
in effect as of the date hereof (including all applications, endorsements,
supplements, riders and ancillary agreements in connection therewith) issued
by the Eastern Insurance Subsidiaries, and any and all marketing materials,
to which Eastern or any Eastern Subsidiary is a party, are, to the extent
required under applicable law, on forms approved by the Insurance Regulators
or have been filed with and not objected to by such Insurance Regulators
within the period provided for objection, and all of such forms comply with
the Insurance Laws in all material respects. As to premium rates established
by the Eastern Insurance Subsidiaries which are required to be filed with or
approved by any Insurance Regulators, the rates have been so filed or
approved, the premiums charged conform thereto, and such premiums comply with
the Insurance Laws in all material respects. Section 3.23(a) of the Eastern
Disclosure Schedule sets forth all increases in premium rates for workers
compensation insurance submitted by the Eastern Insurance Subsidiaries which
have been disapproved by any Insurance Regulators since December 31, 2012.
Section 3.23(a) of the Eastern Disclosure Schedule lists all correspondence
or communications from any Insurance Regulator received by Eastern or any of
the Eastern Insurance Subsidiaries after December 31, 2012, that requests or
suggests that its premium rates, if applicable, for workers compensation
insurance should be reduced below the current approved premium levels.

(b) Except as set forth in Section 3.23(b) of the Eastern Disclosure
Schedule, the Eastern Insurance Subsidiaries have not issued any participating
policies or any retrospectively rated policies of insurance.

 

(c) All ceded reinsurance treaties or agreements, including retrocessional
agreements, to which any Eastern Insurance Subsidiary is a party or under
which an Eastern Insurance Subsidiary has any existing rights, obligations or
liabilities are listed on Section 3.23(c) of the Disclosure Schedule (the
"Eastern Ceded Reinsurance Treaties"). Eastern has provided ProAssurance with
correct and complete copies of all of such Eastern Ceded Reinsurance Treaties
and all such Eastern Ceded Reinsurance Treaties are in full force and effect,
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not result in the termination of any Eastern Ceded Reinsurance Treaties. The
Eastern GAAP Financial Statements accurately reflect all ceded premiums and
all amounts recoverable on the Eastern Ceded Reinsurance Treaties in
accordance with GAAP as of December 31, 2012 and for the year then ended. To
the Knowledge of Eastern there is no material adverse change in the financial
condition of its reinsurers that might raise concern regarding their ability
to honor their reinsurance commitments, except as set forth in Section
3.23(c) of the Eastern Disclosure Schedule. No party to any of the Eastern
Ceded Reinsurance Treaties has given notice to Eastern or any Eastern
Insurance Subsidiary that such party intends to terminate or cancel any of
the

 



32  Eastern Ceded Reinsurance Treaties as a result of or following consummation
of the Merger. Since January 1, 2012, no Eastern Ceded Reinsurance Treaty has
been terminated and there has not been any change in the retention level
under any such Eastern Ceded Reinsurance Treaty that is material to the
conduct of the Business.

 

(d) Section 3.23(d) of the Eastern Disclosure Schedule lists each insurance
policy issued by a Eastern Insurance Subsidiary that has been reinsured by a
reinsurance treaty issued by a segregated portfolio reinsurance cell ("Eastern
Assumed Reinsurance Treaties") and together with Eastern Ceded Reinsurance
Treaties collectively referred to as "Eastern Reinsurance Treaties") and
identifies each such segregated portfolio reinsurance cell in which Eastern or
an Eastern Subsidiary holds preferred stock or another equitable security or
interest ("Eastern Participation Interest"). Eastern has provided
ProAssurance true and correct copies of all such Eastern Assumed Reinsurance
Treaties and such Eastern Participation Interests. Except as set forth on
Schedule 3.23(d), none of the Eastern Insurance Subsidiaries is a party to a
reinsurance agreement or treaty in which the Eastern Insurance Subsidiary has
assumed the obligations of any insurance company other than a segregated
portfolio reinsurance cell. All Eastern Assumed Reinsurance Treaties are in
full force and effect and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will not result in the termination of any Eastern Assumed
Reinsurance Treaties. The Eastern Participation Interests have been duly and
validly issued and are held by Eastern or a Eastern Subsidiary free and clear
of all Liens and restrictions on transfer other than as described on Section
3.23(d) of the Eastern Disclosure Schedule.

 

(e) Each Eastern Reinsurance Treaty is valid and binding on each party
thereto, and none of Eastern, and, to the Knowledge of Eastern, any other
party thereto, is in default in any material respect with respect to any such
reinsurance agreement or treaty. No Eastern Reinsurance Treaty contains any
provision providing that the other party thereto may terminate the same by
reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or contains any
other provision which would be altered or otherwise become applicable by
reason of such transactions.

 

(f) Each of the Eastern Insurance Subsidiaries have assets that qualify as
admitted assets under the Insurance Laws in an amount at least equal to the
sum of all its reserves and liability amounts and its minimum statutory
capital and surplus as required by such Insurance Laws. The 2012 Eastern
Balance Sheet sets forth all of the reserves for losses and loss reserve
expenses, gross of reinsurance, as of the date thereof (the "Eastern
Reserves") in accordance with GAAP. The Eastern Reserves were determined in
accordance with GAAP and generally accepted actuarial principles consistently
applied, were computed on the basis of methodologies consistent with those
used in prior periods, and were fairly stated in accordance with sound
actuarial and GAAP accounting principles. The Eastern Reserves are adequate to
cover the estimated present value of the ultimate net loss and loss
adjustment expenses of the Eastern Insurance Subsidiaries (under generally
accepted actuarial standards consistently applied and fairly stated in
accordance with sound actuarial principles) under all insurance contracts
under which the Eastern Insurance Subsidiaries have or are reasonably
expected to have any liability on the date of the 2012 Eastern Balance Sheet.
Eastern has provided or made available to ProAssurance copies of all work
papers used as the basis for establishing the Eastern Reserves. Except for
regular periodic assessments based on developments that are publicly known
within the insurance industry no claim or assessment is pending or threatened
against 

 



33  Eastern or any Eastern Insurance Subsidiary which is peculiar or unique to
Eastern or such Eastern Insurance Subsidiary by any state insurance guaranty
association in connection with such associations fund relating to insolvent
insurers.

(g) Section 3.23(g) of the Eastern Disclosure Schedule lists each actuary,
independent or otherwise, that has reviewed, on behalf of Eastern or any
Eastern Subsidiary, the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses of
Eastern or the Eastern Insurance Subsidiaries and their premium rates for
liability insurance in each of the years commencing after December 31, 2009
(collectively the "Eastern Actuaries" and separately a "Eastern Actuary").
Section 3.23(g) of the Eastern Disclosure Schedule lists each and every
actuarial report, and all attachments, supplements, addenda and modifications
thereto prepared for or on behalf of Eastern or any Eastern Subsidiary by the
Eastern Actuaries, or delivered by the Eastern Actuaries to Eastern or
any Eastern Subsidiary, since December 31, 2009, in which an Eastern Actuary
has (i) either expressed an opinion on the adequacy of such reserves for
losses and loss adjustment expenses loss reserves or made recommendations as
to either the amount of reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses that
should be maintained by Eastern or the Eastern Insurance Subsidiaries, or (ii)
expressed an opinion as to the adequacy of such premiums or made a
recommendation as to the premiums that should be charged by Eastern or the
Eastern Insurance Subsidiaries for liability insurance (collectively, the
"Eastern Actuarial Analyses"). To the Knowledge of Eastern the information and
data furnished by Eastern or any Eastern Subsidiary to the Eastern Actuaries
in connection with the Eastern Actuarial Analyses were accurate in all
material respects. Each Eastern Actuarial Analysis was based upon an accurate
inventory of policies in force for Eastern and the Eastern Insurance
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, at the relevant time of preparation and, to
the Knowledge of Eastern, was prepared using generally accepted actuarial
principles consistently applied. Eastern has made available to ProAssurance
a true and correct copy of each of the Eastern Actuarial Analyses.

(h) Except as set forth in Section 3.23(h) of the Eastern Disclosure
Schedule, to the Knowledge of Eastern, there are no facts or circumstances
related to the Business that could reasonably be expected to result in
Eastern, any Eastern Subsidiary, NEWCO or ProAssurance being liable for any
bad faith claim or any market conduct claim with respect to their respective
(i) claims-making procedures or (ii) marketing and sale of insurance products.

 

(i) All benefits claimed by any Person under any insurance contract written or
assumed by the Eastern Insurance Subsidiaries have in all material respects
been paid (or provision for payment thereof has been made) in accordance with
the terms of the contracts under which they arose, such payments were not
materially delinquent and were paid (or will be paid) without fines
or penalties, except for any such claim for benefits for which Eastern
reasonably believes or believed that there is a reasonable basis to contest
payment and is taking such action.

 

(j) Except as disclosed on Section 3.23(j) of the Eastern Disclosure Schedule,
no outstanding insurance contract issued, reinsured, or underwritten by the
Eastern Insurance Subsidiaries entitles the holder thereof or any other person
to receive dividends, distributions, or to share in the income of Eastern or
to receive any other benefits based on the revenues or earnings of Eastern or
any other Person.

 



34 (k) To the extent required by the Insurance Laws of each state in which any
Eastern Insurance Subsidiary issues insurance policies, such Eastern
Insurance Subsidiary is participating in each risk sharing plan, pool,
insurance joint underwriting association or similar arrangement maintained in
such state and has paid all assessments and required contributions on or
before the date such payments are due. Except for regular periods or special
arrangements based on developments that are publicly known with the insurance
industry generally or the workers compensation liability insurance industry,
to the Knowledge of Eastern, no claim or assessment is pending or threatened
against Eastern or any Eastern Insurance Subsidiary which is peculiar or
unique to Eastern or such Eastern Insurance Subsidiary by any state
insurance guaranty association in connection with such associations fund
relating to insolvent insurers.

(l) Each insurance agent or broker, at the time such agent or broker wrote,
sold or produced business for the Eastern Insurance Subsidiaries, to the
extent required by law, was duly appointed to act as agent and was, to the
Knowledge of Eastern, duly licensed as an insurance agent or broker (for the
type of business written, sold or produced by such insurance agent or broker)
in the particular jurisdiction in which such agent or broker wrote, sold or
produced such business. The terms and provisions between an Eastern
Insurance Subsidiary and any managing general agent or reinsurance
intermediary comply in all material respects with the Insurance Laws.

3.24  _Computer Hardware and Software._

(a) The computer hardware and software systems of Eastern and the Eastern
Subsidiaries are functioning in all material respects in accordance with
their respective functional specifications.

(b) Such computer hardware and software systems are sufficient to meet in all
material respects all current management information, financial reporting,
underwriting and claims processing needs.

through a valid lease or license, all material rights necessary to use such
computer hardware and software systems in the manner and for the purposes they
are currently used.

(d) Eastern and the Eastern Subsidiaries are currently obtaining maintenance
services sufficient to keep such computer hardware and software systems in
good operating condition.

 

(e) Eastern and the Eastern Subsidiaries, through daily back-ups, are
currently storing all computerized data at off-site premises adequate for
such purpose.

3.25 _Adverse Communications_. Except as set forth on Section 3.25 of the
Eastern Disclosure Schedule, neither Eastern nor any of the Eastern Insurance
Subsidiaries has received after December 31, 2011 or is aware of since such
date:

that the Eastern Insurance Subsidiaries will retain an A.M. Best group rating

Eastern or any Eastern Subsidiary was or is to be a participant and the amount
involved exceeds $25,000, and in which any related person has or will have a
direct or indirect material interest. For the purposes of this Section 3.26,

by this Agreement or have a Material Adverse Effect on ProAssurance.

in Article 3 of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the

necessary to file with the SEC and have cleared by the SEC any amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement so as to correct the same and to cause the
Proxy Statement as corrected to be distributed to the shareholders of Eastern
to the extent required by applicable law. To the extent that any disclosure
regarding the tax consequences of the Merger is required with respect the
Proxy Statement, Eastern will be responsible for any tax opinion in support of
the disclosure of the material tax consequences.

written communications, letters, reports or other documents relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation,
to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as
promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations
of all third parties and Governmental Authorities which are necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of all
such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such Governmental
Authorities. ProAssurance and Eastern shall have the right to review in
advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in
each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information,
all the information relating to ProAssurance or Eastern, as the case may be,

Eastern or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Authority
in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(g) ProAssurance and Eastern shall promptly advise each other upon receiving
any communication from any Governmental Authority whose consent or approval

their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees,
accountants, counsel and other representatives of the other party, reasonable
access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Closing
Date, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records and,
during such period, each of ProAssurance and Eastern shall, and shall cause

ProAssurance or Eastern, as the case may be, is not permitted to disclose
under applicable law or by agreement); (ii) all other information concerning
its business, properties and personnel as such party may reasonably request;
and (iii) any other information, confidential or otherwise, relating to the
Merger which has not been provided to the other party and is necessary
for disclosure in the Proxy Statement, including, but not limited to, the
confidential portions of the minutes of Eastern and Eastern Subsidiaries that
was not provided pursuant to Section 3.3 of this Agreement. Neither
ProAssurance nor Eastern nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of ProAssurances or
Easterns, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client and
work product privileges of the entity in possession or control of such
information or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree,
fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.

 



47 (b) Each of ProAssurance and Eastern agrees to keep confidential, and not
divulge to any other party or person (other than employees of, and attorneys,
accountants, financial advisors and other representatives for, any said party
who agree to be bound by the Confidentiality Agreement), all non-
public documents, information, records and financial statements received from
the other and, in addition, any and all reports, information and financial
information obtained through audits or other reviews conducted pursuant to
this Agreement (unless readily ascertainable from public or published
information, or trade sources, or already known or subsequently developed by a
party independently of any investigation or received from a third party not
under an obligation to the other party to keep such information
confidential), and to use the same only in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and if the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are not consummated for any reason, each party agrees to
promptly return to the other party all written materials furnished by the
other party, and all copies thereof, in connection with such investigation,
and to destroy all documents and records in its possession containing extracts
or summaries of any such non-public information.

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their
respective representatives shall affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or conditions of the other set forth in this Agreement.

6.3  _Eastern Shareholder Approval_. Eastern shall call a meeting of its
shareholders to be held as soon as reasonably practicable for the purpose of
obtaining the requisite Eastern shareholder approval required in connection
with this Agreement and the Merger. Eastern will, through its Board of
Directors, subject to its fiduciary obligations as determined by its Board of
Directors, recommend to its shareholders approval of this Agreement and the
Merger.

 

6.4 _Continuing Employees and Employee Plans._

 

(a) As of the date of Closing, the Eastern Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the
"ESOP") shall terminate by its terms. Prior to the Closing, Eastern shall
deliver to ProAssurance a schedule setting forth the number of shares of
Eastern Common Stock allocated to each participants account, the number of
unallocated shares of Eastern Common Stock held by the trustee of the ESOP,
the outstanding balance of the ESOPs outstanding indebtedness, and the method
for allocating the unallocated shares to the participants account upon
termination of the ESOP. As soon as practicable following the execution
of this Agreement, Eastern shall file all necessary documents with the IRS to
request a favorable determination letter that the ESOP is, upon its
termination (and as amended in accordance with this Section 6.4(a)), qualified
under the provisions of Sections 401(a), 409, and 4975(e)(7) of the Code. As
soon as practicable after the receipt of a final favorable determination
letter from the IRS, the account balances in the ESOP, including any surplus
in its expense account after full payment of the outstanding ESOP loan and
all of the ESOPs administrative expenses that are payable from the ESOPs
related trust, shall be distributed to participants and beneficiaries in
accordance with the provisions of the Code, applicable law and the terms of
the ESOP. Prior to Closing, contributions to the ESOP and payments on the ESOP
loan shall be made consistent with past practices on the regularly-scheduled
contribution or payment dates; provided, however, that Eastern shall make a
contribution to, and payment on, the ESOP loan with respect to the period from
January 1, 2013 through the date of the Closing (or if the Closing occurs
after December 31, 2013, the period from January 1, 2014 through the date of
the Closing) but no further contributions shall be made to the ESOP after
Closing or with respect to any period after the Closing.

 



48 (b) Within a reasonable period (but in no event more than five days) after
receipt by the ESOPSs related trust of the Merger Consideration with respect
to the shares held under the ESOP, Eastern, the applicable committee or the
trustee (as the case may be under the terms of the applicable ESOP document)
shall cause any outstanding ESOP loan balances and accrued interest thereon,
to be repaid in full, and subsequently shall allocate any remaining
unallocated amounts to the accounts of participants and beneficiaries under
the ESOP in accordance with the terms of the ESOP and applicable law.

(c) It is understood that ProAssurance and its Subsidiaries are "at-will"
employers. Nothing in this Section 6.4 shall be interpreted as preventing
ProAssurance from terminating the employment of any individual or from
amending, modifying or terminating any ProAssurance Employee Plans, or Eastern
Employee Plan, or any benefits under any ProAssurance Employee Plans or any
Eastern Employee Plans, or any other contracts, arrangements, commitments or
understandings, in accordance with their terms and applicable law, subject to
the commitments provided in Section 6.4(d), (e), and (f) of this Agreement.
ProAssurance has no plans to consolidate any functions or operations that
would result in a loss of jobs within the first twelve (12) months after the
Closing Date for the employees of Eastern who are employed by Eastern as of
the Closing Date and who continue as employees of Eastern after the Closing
Date (the "Continuing Employees"). Furthermore, ProAssurance agrees that no
Continuing Employee shall be terminated prior to the twenty-fourth (24th)
month after the Closing Date without first consulting Easterns president. Any
Continuing Employee who is involuntarily terminated without cause within the
first eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date shall receive severance
equal to six (6) months of such terminated employees then current base
compensation.

 

(d) In the event of any termination or consolidation of any Eastern health
plan with any ProAssurance health plan, ProAssurance shall make available to
Continuing Employees and their dependents employer-provided health coverage on
substantially the same basis as it provides such coverage to ProAssurance
employees. Except in the case of a Continuing Employee and/or a dependent of
a Continuing Employee (i) who affirmatively terminates coverage under a
Eastern health plan prior to the time that such Continuing Employee and/or
dependent becomes eligible to participate in the corresponding ProAssurance
health plan, or (ii) who has an event which, under the terms of the Eastern
health plan, results in a loss of coverage (which may include a sale or other
disposition of a Eastern Subsidiary or substantially all of the business
operations thereof), no coverage of any of the Continuing Employees or their
dependents shall terminate under any of the Eastern health plans prior to the
time such Continuing Employees and their dependents become eligible to
participate in the health plans, programs and benefits common to similarly
situated employees of ProAssurance and their dependents. In the event of a
termination or consolidation of any Eastern health plan, terminated Eastern
employees (whether terminated before or after the Effective Time) and
qualified beneficiaries will have the right to continued coverage under group
health plans of ProAssurance in accordance with Code Section 4980B(f),
consistent with the provisions below. In the event of any termination of any
Eastern health plan, or consolidation of any Eastern health plan with any
ProAssurance health plan, any coverage limitation under the ProAssurance
health plan due to

 



49  any pre-existing condition shall be waived by the ProAssurance health plan
to the degree that such condition was covered by the Eastern health plan
and such condition would otherwise have been covered by the ProAssurance
health plan in the absence of such coverage limitation. All Eastern Employees
who cease participating in a Eastern health plan and become participants in a
comparable ProAssurance health plan during any plan year shall receive credit
toward the applicable deductible under the ProAssurance health plan for any
amounts paid by the employee under Easterns health plan during the applicable
plan year, upon substantiation, in a form satisfactory to ProAssurance that
such payments have been made.

(e) ProAssurance shall, with respect to each Continuing Employee, as of
Closing (i) continue to maintain the current Employee Plans, for such
Continuing Employees in accordance with their terms after the Closing Date for
the transition period described in Code Section 410(b)(6)(C) including
health insurance coverage with deductibles and other terms, in the aggregate,
no less favorable than those being provided prior to the Closing Date except
that the ESOP shall be terminated as of the Effective Time and the benefits
under the qualified and nonqualified defined benefit plans shall continue to
be frozen as provided as of the date of this Agreement until terminated by
ProAssurance; and (ii) honor accrued paid time off (including vacation, sick
leave and other paid time off) benefits on the date of this Agreement for
each Continuing Employee. On or before March 1, 2014, ProAssurance shall pay
or cause Eastern to pay to the Eastern employees entitled thereto such bonuses
or other awards to which such employees are entitled under the terms of
Easterns Management Annual Incentive Plan based on the performance factors
established by Easterns Compensation/Human Resources Committee for calendar
year 2013 and excluding any expenses, including retention payments made to
Eastern employees, incurred by Eastern in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(f) After the expiration of the transition period described in Code Section
410(b)(6)(C), Continuing Employees who remain employed by ProAssurance shall
be given credit for all purposes (including vacation accrual) under the
employee benefit plans, policies, programs and arrangements maintained from
time to time by ProAssurance, for such employees service with Eastern
(including any deductibles, or co-insurance limits under any employee welfare
benefit plan, as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA, but not for benefit
accruals under any ProAssurance retirement plan), to the same extent and for
the same purposes that such service was taken into account under a
corresponding Eastern Employee Plan as of the Closing Date and identified in
Section 3.14(a) of the Eastern Disclosure Schedule; provided, however, that no
such service shall be credited to the extent that it would result in a
duplication of benefits.

 

(g) [Intentionally Omitted].

 

(h) ProAssurance and Eastern acknowledge and agree that nothing contained
herein, whether express or implied, (i) shall be treated as an amendment to
or other modification of any Employee Plan or any other employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement or, (ii) subject to the provisions of Section 6.4(a)
above, shall limit the right of ProAssurance to amend, terminate,
or otherwise modify (or cause to be amended, terminated or otherwise
modified) any Employee Plan, program or arrangement following the expiration
of the transition period described in Code Section 410(b)(6)(C).

 



50 (i) The persons named in Section 6.4(i) of the Eastern Disclosure Schedule
(the "Eastern Executives") have entered into Employment Agreements with
Eastern that provide for the payment of certain benefits on involuntary
termination (or, in certain cases, "good reason" termination) after a change
of control of Eastern as described in Section 6.4(i) of the Eastern Disclosure
Schedule (the "Eastern Executive Agreements"). ProAssurance has offered and/or
entered into a retention and severance agreement with each of the Eastern
Executives (the "Retention and Severance Compensation Agreement") that
includes the terms set forth on Exhibit 6.4(i). The execution of the Retention
and Severance Compensation Agreement by an Eastern Executive will terminate
the applicable Eastern Executive Agreement as of the Effective Time. If an
Eastern Executive does not sign a Retention and Severance Compensation
Agreement, ProAssurance shall cause Eastern or the applicable
Eastern Subsidiary to honor its obligations to pay any Eastern Executive the
change of control or severance benefit provided in the Eastern Executive
Agreements; provided that Eastern shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause each Eastern Executive who does not sign a Retention and Severance
Compensation Agreement to execute a resignation and release of claims against
Eastern and ProAssurance with respect to their severance benefits.

 

(j) Section 6.4(j) of the Eastern Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all
Persons (other than the Eastern Executives) who are entitled to change of
control or severance benefits under the terms of their respective agreements
with Eastern or an Eastern Subsidiary, which list sets forth the name of each
Person entitled to such benefits and the amounts payable to each of
such Persons on a change of control and/or separation from employment.
ProAssurance shall cause Eastern or the applicable Eastern Subsidiary to honor
its obligations to pay to any Person listed in Section 6.4(j) of the Eastern
Disclosure Schedule the change of control and severance benefits described in
Schedule 6.4(j) of the Eastern Disclosure Schedule; provided that ProAssurance
shall require in connection with such payments that each officer or employee
receiving a payment shall execute a resignation and release of claims against
Eastern and ProAssurance with respect to their severance benefits.

6.5  _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance._

(a) ProAssurance shall cause the individuals serving as officers and
directors of Eastern and the Eastern Subsidiaries, immediately prior to the
Effective Time to be covered for a period of six (6) years from the Effective
Time (or the period of the applicable statute of limitations, if longer)
by the directors and officers liability insurance policy maintained by
Eastern or the Eastern Subsidiary (provided that ProAssurance may substitute
therefore policies of the same or substantially similar coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous in any
material respect than such policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time which were committed by such officers and
directors in their capacity as such; provided, however, that in no event
shall ProAssurance be required to expend more than 400% of the current amount
expended by Eastern or the Eastern Subsidiary (the "Insurance Premium Amount")
to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto; and provided
further, that if ProAssurance is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance
called for by this Section 6.5, ProAssurance shall use its best efforts to
obtain as much comparable insurance as available for an amount equal to 400%
of the Insurance Premium Amount.

 



51 (b) In addition to the indemnification under Section 6.5(a), ProAssurance and
Eastern shall jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
person who is now, or who has been at any time before the date hereof or who
becomes before the Effective Time, an officer, director or employee of Eastern
or an Eastern Subsidiary (the "Indemnified Parties") against all losses,
claims, damages, costs, expenses (including attorneys fees), liabilities or
judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, or
administrative (each a "Claim"), in which an Indemnified Party is, or is
threatened to be made, a party or witness in whole or in part on or arising in
whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director,
officer or employee of Eastern or an Eastern Subsidiary if such Claim pertains
to any matter of fact arising, existing or occurring at or before the
Effective Time (including, without limitation, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby), regardless of whether such Claim is
asserted or claimed before, or after, the Effective Time (the "Indemnified
Liabilities"), to the fullest extent Eastern is permitted under applicable
law, and in accordance with the terms of indemnification provisions under,
Easterns Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws as of the date of this
Agreement. ProAssurance shall pay expenses in advance of the final disposition
of any such action or proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the full extent
provided in Easterns Articles of Incorporation as of the date of this
Agreement. The Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory
to them after consultation with ProAssurance; provided, however, that (i)
ProAssurance shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and upon such
assumption ProAssurance shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any
legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred
by any Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, except that
if ProAssurance elects not to assume such defense the Indemnified Party may
retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to him after consultation with
ProAssurance, and ProAssurance shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
such counsel for the Indemnified Party, (ii) ProAssurance shall be obligated
pursuant to this paragraph to pay for only one firm of counsel for all
Indemnified Parties except to the extent representation by a single firm or
attorney is, in the absence of an informed consent by the Indemnified Party,
prohibited by ethical rules relating to lawyers conflicts of interest, (iii)
ProAssurance shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), (iv)
ProAssurance shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when
and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such
determination shall have become final and nonappealable, that indemnification
of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated by this Agreement is
prohibited by applicable law, and (v) ProAssurance shall have no obligation
hereunder to any Indemnified Party for which and to the extent payment is
actually and unqualifiedly made to such Indemnified Party under any insurance
policy, any other agreement for indemnification or otherwise. Any Indemnified
Party wishing to claim Indemnification under this Section 6.5, upon learning
of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify
ProAssurance thereof, provided that the failure to so notify shall not affect
the obligations of ProAssurance under this Section 6.5, except to the extent
such failure to notify materially prejudices ProAssurance. ProAssurances
obligations under this Section 6.5 continue in full force and effect for a
period of six (6) years from the Effective Time (or the period of the
applicable statute of limitations, if longer); provided, however, that all
rights to indemnification in respect of any Claim asserted or made within
such period shall continue until the final disposition of such Claim.

 



52 (c) In the event that Eastern as the surviving corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any person (including by dissolution), then,
and in each such case, ProAssurance shall cause proper provision to be made so
that the successors and assigns of Eastern assume and honor the obligations
set forth in this Section 6.5. The agreements and covenants contained herein
shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which any such
present or former director or officer is entitled, whether pursuant to
Pennsylvania law, contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement
is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any
rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is
or has been in existence with respect to Eastern or any of the Eastern
Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors and employees, it being
understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section
6.5 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under any such
policies.

 

6.6 _Advice of Changes._

 

(a) ProAssurance and Eastern shall give prompt notice to the other party as
soon as practicable after it has actual Knowledge of (i) the occurrence, or
failure to occur, of any event which would or would be likely to cause any
partys representations or warranties contained in this Agreement to be untrue
or incorrect in any material respect at any time from the date of
this Agreement to the Closing Date, or (ii) any failure on its part or on the
part of any of its or its Subsidiaries officers, directors, employees,
representatives or agents (other than persons or entities who are such
employees, representatives or agents only because they are appointed
insurance agents of such parties) to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by such party under this Agreement. Each party shall have the right to
deliver to the other party a written disclosure schedule as to any matter of
which it becomes aware following execution of this Agreement which would
constitute a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of this
Agreement by such party, identifying on such disclosure schedule the
representation, warranty or covenant which would be so breached, provided that
each such disclosure schedule shall be delivered as soon as practicable after
such party becomes aware of the matter disclosed therein.

(b) ProAssurance shall update the ProAssurance Disclosure Schedule
(the "Closing Date ProAssurance Disclosure Schedule") to a date that is no
earlier than ten (10) business days prior to the Closing Date and no later
than seven (7) business days prior to the Closing Date and shall deliver
the Closing Date ProAssurance Disclosure Schedule to Eastern not less than
three (3) business days prior to the Closing Date. Eastern shall update the
Eastern Disclosure Schedule (the "Closing Date Eastern Disclosure Schedule")
to a date that is no earlier than ten (10) business days prior to the Closing
Date and no later than seven (7) business days prior to the Closing Date and
shall deliver the Closing Date Eastern Disclosure Schedule to ProAssurance
not less than three (3) business days prior to the Closing Date. The
obligation of ProAssurance to deliver to Eastern the Closing Date ProAssurance
Disclosure Schedule as provided above shall be a material obligation for
purposes of Section 7.3(b) hereof, and the obligation of Eastern to deliver to
ProAssurance the Closing Date Eastern Disclosure Schedule shall be a material
obligation for purposes of Section 7.2(a) hereof.

 



53 6.7 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of ProAssurance and a
Subsidiary of Eastern) or to vest ProAssurance or any of its Subsidiaries with
full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and
franchises of any of the parties to this Agreement or the Merger, the proper
officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their respective
Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be reasonably
requested by, and at the sole expense of, ProAssurance.

6.8 _Negotiations with Other Parties._

 

(a) So long as this Agreement remains in effect and no notice of termination
has been given under this Agreement, Eastern shall not authorize or knowingly
permit any of its representatives, directly or indirectly, to initiate,
entertain, solicit, encourage, engage in, or participate in, negotiations with
any Person or any group of Persons other than the other party to
this Agreement or any of its affiliates (a "Potential Acquiror") concerning
any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 6.8(c) of this Agreement)
other than as expressly provided in this Agreement. Eastern will promptly
inform ProAssurance of any serious, bona fide inquiry it may receive with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal and shall furnish to ProAssurance a copy
thereof.

Directors from making such disclosures to its shareholders as are required
under the Securities Act or by the Nasdaq Global Market or from taking and
disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Board of Directors of Eastern from either furnishing information
to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, any Person or group of
Persons regarding any Acquisition Proposal, or approving and recommending to
the shareholders of Eastern an Acquisition Proposal from any Person or group
of Persons, if the Board of Directors of Eastern determines in good faith that
such action is appropriate in furtherance of the best interests of
the corporation in accordance with the PBCL. In connection with any such
determination, (i) Eastern shall direct its officers and other appropriate
personnel to cooperate with and be reasonably available to consult with any
such person, entity or group, (ii) Eastern will disclose to ProAssurance that
it is furnishing information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations
with, such Person or group of Persons, which disclosure shall describe the
terms thereof (but need not identify the person, entity or group making the
offer), (iii) prior to furnishing such information to such Person or group of
Persons, Eastern shall enter into a written agreement with such Person or
group of Persons which provides for, among other things, (A) the furnishing
to Eastern of information regarding such Person or group of Persons that is
relevant to its ability to finance and otherwise perform its obligations under
its Acquisition Proposal; (B) the confidentiality of all non-public
information furnished to such Person or group of Persons by Eastern; and (C)
procedures reasonably satisfactory to Eastern that are designed to restrict or
limit the provision of information regarding Eastern that could be used to
the competitive disadvantage of Eastern, or in a manner that would be
detrimental to the interests of its shareholders; (iv) Eastern will not
furnish any non-public information regarding ProAssurance or the transactions
contemplated hereby; and (v) Eastern will keep ProAssurance informed of the
status of any such discussions or negotiations (provided that Eastern shall
not be required to disclose to ProAssurance confidential information
concerning the business or operations of such Person or group of Persons).

 



54 (c) As used in this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means (i) any proposal
pursuant to which any Person or group of Persons, other than ProAssurance or
Eastern, would acquire or participate in a merger or other business
combination involving Eastern or any of the Eastern Subsidiaries, directly or
indirectly; (ii) any proposal for a transaction or series of transactions
that would result in any Person or group of Persons, other than ProAssurance
or Eastern, having the right to vote, or direct the vote of, 10% or more of
the capital stock of Eastern or any of the Eastern Subsidiaries entitled to
vote thereon for the election of directors; (iii) any proposal for a
transaction or series of transactions that would result in any Person
acquiring 10% or more of the assets of Eastern or any of the Eastern
Subsidiaries, other than in the ordinary course of business; (iv) any proposal
for a transaction or series of transactions that would result in any Person
being the beneficial owner of more than 10% of the outstanding capital
stock of Eastern or any of the Eastern Subsidiaries, other than as
contemplated by this Agreement; or (v) any proposal for a transaction similar
to the foregoing.

 

6.9 _Accountants Consent_. ProAssurance currently has filed registration
statements with the SEC to register its securities under the Securities Act
that incorporate by reference information from reports filed by ProAssurance
pursuant to the Exchange Act. Eastern consents to the incorporation by
reference in any such registration statement of the Eastern GAAP Financial
Statements filed with the Eastern SEC Reports pursuant to the applicable
accounting requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Eastern
agrees to use commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain consents
PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP as required by the SEC to include its report on
the Eastern GAAP Financial Statements in such ProAssurance registration
statements and to consent to the reference to said accountants as experts in
such registration statements with respect to the matters included in such
reports.

to this Agreement, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto, or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained in this Agreement; provided, however, that after any approval of the

there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any extension
or waiver of this Agreement or any portion thereof which reduces the amount or
changes the form of the consideration to be delivered to the shareholders
of Eastern under this Agreement other than as contemplated by this Agreement.
Any agreement on the part of a party to this Agreement to any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on
strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall
not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or
other failure.

 

8.5 _Liquidated Damages; Termination Fee_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, in the event that any of the following
events or circumstances shall occur, Eastern shall, within ten (10) days after
notice of the occurrence thereof by ProAssurance, pay to ProAssurance a sum
equal to (A) four percent (4%) of the Merger Consideration and (B) the amount
of the direct, out-of-pocket aggregate costs incurred by ProAssurance in
connection with the negotiation and performance of this Agreement not to
exceed $1,000,000 (which the parties agree and stipulate as reasonable and
full liquidated damages and reasonable compensation for the involvement of
ProAssurance in the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, is not a
penalty or forfeiture, and will not affect the provisions of this Section
8.5): 

 



59  (i) at any time prior to termination of this Agreement a Eastern Acquisition
Event shall occur; (ii) ProAssurance shall terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.1(d) and Eastern enters into an agreement with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal within twelve (12) months after such termination of this
Agreement; (iii) ProAssurance shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(e); (iv) Eastern shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(i); or (v) ProAssurance shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(j). For purposes of this Agreement a "Eastern Acquisition
Event" shall mean that Eastern shall have authorized, recommended, approved,
or entered into an agreement with any Person (other than any of the parties to
this Agreement) to effect an Acquisition Proposal or shall fail to publicly
oppose a tender offer or exchange offer by another person based on an
Acquisition Proposal. Upon the making and receipt of such payment under this
Section 8.5, Eastern shall have no further obligation of any kind under this
Agreement and neither ProAssurance nor NEWCO shall have any further
obligation of any kind under this Agreement, except in each case under Section
8.2 of this Agreement, and no party shall have any liability for any breach or
alleged breach by such party of any provision of this Agreement.

61 9.6 _Remedies Cumulative_. Unless expressly made the exclusive remedy by the
terms of this Agreement, all remedies provided for in this Agreement are
cumulative and shall be in addition to any and all other rights and remedies
provided by law and by any other agreements between the parties.

 

9.7 _Presumptions_. It is expressly acknowledged and agreed that all parties
have been represented by counsel and have participated in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement, and that there shall be no presumption against any
party on the ground that such party was responsible for preparing this

in, and/or attached to, this Agreement is an integral part of this Agreement
and is incorporated in this Agreement by this reference.

9.9 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections,
Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit or
Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The headings contained
in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be
deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". No provision of this
Agreement shall be construed to require ProAssurance, Eastern or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or affiliates to take any action which would violate
any applicable law, rule or regulation. 

9.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart. The exchange of copies of executed signature pages
by facsimile or by electronic mail in PDF format will constitute effective
execution and delivery of this Agreement.

instruments referred to in this Agreement) constitutes the entire agreement
and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any

application of such laws would be inconsistent with or in contravention of
the laws of the State of Delaware

 



62 9.13 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

9.14 _Publicity_. ProAssurance and Eastern shall develop a joint
communications plan and each party shall (i) ensure that all press releases
and other public statements and communications (including any communications
that would require a filing under Rule 14a-2, Rule 14a-12 or Rule 14e-2 under
the Exchange Act) with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint communications plan
and (ii) unless otherwise required by applicable law or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of the NYSE and the Nasdaq
Global Market, consult with each other for a reasonable time before
issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement or
communication (including any communications that would require a filing with
the SEC), and mutually agree upon any such press release or any such public
statement or communication, with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. In addition to the foregoing, except to the
extent disclosed in the Proxy Statement, unless otherwise required by
applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of the NYSE and the Nasdaq Global Market, neither ProAssurance nor
Eastern shall issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement
or disclosure concerning the other party or the other partys business,
financial conditions or results of operations without the consent of the
other party.

9.15 _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations shall be assigned by any of the
parties to this Agreement (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without
the prior written consent of the other parties to this Agreement. Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors
and assigns. Except for the provisions of Sections 6.4(c) and 6.5, this
Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to in this
Agreement) is not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties to
this Agreement any rights or remedies under this Agreement.
