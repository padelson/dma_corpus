deemed effective for all purposes hereunder as of 12:01 A.M. Eastern time on
the Closing Date. At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay the Closing Purchase
Price, minus the Escrow Amount, to the Paying Agent by wire transfer of
immediately available funds in U.S. Dollars, for further remittance to
Sellers, to such account(s) and in the proportions to each Seller designated
by Seller Representative to Purchaser by written notice, with such written
notice accompanied by the Unit Ledger Certificate, at least five (5) Business
Days before the Closing Date. Simultaneously, (a) Purchaser will deliver an
aggregate amount equal to $75,000,000 (the " _Escrow Amount_ ") to Citibank,
N.A., as escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") under the Escrow Agreement, by

equal to the Escrow Amount, and (b) Sellers will assign and transfer to
Purchaser all of Sellers right, title and interest in and to the Interests.
At the Closing, Purchaser and Sellers shall cause to be delivered to the other
the documents and instruments required to be delivered under _Article IX_ and

2.04 _Adjustments to Purchase Price_.

 

(a) _Estimated Closing Statement_. Not later than five (5) Business Days
before the Closing Date, Seller Representative shall deliver to Purchaser a
statement (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ") setting forth Sellers good
faith estimate of (i) Closing Date Working Capital prepared in accordance with
(1) GAAP, using the same accounting principles, policies and methods as have
historically been used by the Acquired Companies in preparation of the
Financial Statements, and (2) the line items set forth on _Annex A_, (the "
_Estimated Working Capital_ "); _provided_ that, solely for the purposes of
the payments to be made to Sellers at Closing, the Closing Purchase Price
shall not be

 



23  adjusted upwards at Closing in respect of Estimated Working Capital in an
amount greater than $15,000,000; _provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing
shall not restrict or limit the calculation of Closing Date Working Capital
or the Final Working Capital Adjustment pursuant to the terms of this _Section
2.04_; (ii) the aggregate amount of any Transaction Fees and Expenses that
will remain unpaid following the Closing (the " _Estimated Transaction Fees
and Expenses_ "); and (iii) the aggregate amount of Credit Agreement
Indebtedness that will remain unpaid following the Closing (the " _Estimated
Credit Agreement Indebtedness_ "), in each case together with Seller
Representatives supporting calculations and reasonable supporting
documentation. In the event that, no fewer than three (3) Business Days prior
to the anticipated Closing Date, Purchaser notifies Seller Representative of
any errors that Purchaser believes are contained in such Estimated Closing
Statement, Seller Representative shall in good faith consider Purchasers
comments relating to such errors and make any amendments to its estimate of
such Estimated Closing Statement if there is in fact such an error; _provided_
that, for the avoidance of doubt, in the event of a conflict, Sellers
determination of the Estimated Closing Statement shall prevail for purposes
of calculating the Closing Purchase Price.

(b) _Final Closing Statement_. Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Seller
Representative not later than seventy-five (75) days after the Closing Date a
statement (the " _Final Closing Statement_ ") setting forth (i) the relevant
calculations of Closing Date Working Capital and the result of Closing Date
Working Capital _minus_ Estimated Working Capital (such difference, which may
be positive or negative, the " _Final Working Capital Adjustment_ "), (ii) the
Closing Date Transaction Fees and Expenses and the result of Closing Date
Transaction Fees and Expenses _minus_ Estimated Transaction Fees and Expenses
(such difference, which may be positive or negative, the " _Final Transaction
Fees and Expenses Adjustment_ ") and (iii) the Closing Date Credit Agreement
Indebtedness and the result of Closing Date Credit Agreement Indebtedness
_minus_ Estimated Credit Agreement Indebtedness (such difference, which may be
positive or negative, the " _Final Credit Agreement Indebtedness Adjustment_
"), together with any supporting work papers and source documents with respect
to the calculations reflected in the Final Closing Statement, if requested by
Seller Representative. The Final Working Capital Adjustment set forth on the
Final Closing Statement shall be prepared in good faith, in accordance with
(i) GAAP, using the same accounting principles, policies and methods as have
historically been used by the Acquired Companies in their preparation of the
Financial Statements, and (ii) the line items set forth on _Annex A_. After
the Closing, (x) Purchaser agrees, upon reasonable notice, to give Seller
Representative and its Representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours to Purchasers and the Acquired Companies employees, asset
managers, accountants, financial advisors, (including the offices and other
facilities of each Acquired Company) and to Purchasers books and records as
are reasonably necessary for purposes of the review, verification and audit of
the calculations contained in the Final Closing Statement and (y) Seller
Representative agrees, upon reasonable notice, to give Purchaser and its
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to Seller
Representatives employees, accountants, financial advisors, in each case, who
assisted in the preparation, review, verification and audit of the Final
Closing Statement, and to Seller Representatives books and records used in
the preparation, review, verification and audit of the calculations contained
in the Final Closing Statement; _provided_ that no Party shall be 

 



24  obligated to deliver any accountant work papers where the accounting firm
does not consent to the delivery thereof, so long as such Party has used its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consent.

(c) _Dispute Resolution with Respect to Post-Closing Adjustments_.

 

(i) If Seller Representative objects to any item set forth on the Final
Closing Statement prepared and delivered in accordance with _Section
2.04(b)_, Seller Representative must notify Purchaser in writing of its
objections in reasonable detail on or before the thirtieth (30th) day after
Seller Representatives receipt of the Final Closing Statement.

(ii) Except to the extent Seller Representative so objects, the Final Closing
Statement and the calculations of the Final Working Capital Adjustment, Final
Transaction Fees and Expenses Adjustment and the Final Credit Agreement
Indebtedness Adjustment as prepared and delivered in accordance with 
_Section 2.04(b)_ shall be final and binding on Purchaser, Sellers and Seller
Representative (and all other Persons claiming through them) as of the day
immediately following the thirtieth (30th) day after Seller Representatives
receipt of the Final Closing Statement. If Seller Representative does so
object, and if Purchaser and Seller Representative have not agreed on
a resolution of those objections within thirty (30) days following the date
of delivery of Seller Representatives notice of objection pursuant to
_Section 2.04(c)(i)_, Purchaser or Seller Representative shall submit the
items in dispute to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or, if PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP is unable to serve, Purchaser and Seller Representative shall appoint by
mutual agreement an impartial nationally recognized firm of independent
certified public accountants (the " _Independent Accountant_") within five
(5) Business Days following the expiration of the foregoing 30-day period (or,
in the absence of agreement between Seller Representative and Purchaser by the
close of business on such fifth (5th) Business Day, as selected by the
American Arbitration Association) who shall, acting as an expert and not an
arbitrator, render a determination thereof, which (absent manifest error)
shall be final and binding on the Parties. The result of such determination
by the Independent Accountant shall be reflected in a definitive final
statement of the Final Working Capital Adjustment, the Final Transaction Fees
and Expenses Adjustment and the Final Credit Agreement
Indebtedness Adjustment (as applicable), as determined by the Independent
Accountant, together with a statement from the Independent Accountant
confirming that such statement correctly reflects the items in dispute as of
the Closing Date. The Independent Accountant shall make its determination as
soon as practicable and in any event within thirty (30) days after the
submission of the dispute to it, and shall (x) base its determination solely
on information provided to it by Purchaser and Seller Representative and (y)
consider only those items and amounts in Purchasers and Seller
Representatives respective calculations that are identified as being items
and amounts to which Purchaser and Seller Representative have been unable to
agree; _provided_ , _however_ , to the extent the determination of value of
any unresolved item affects any other item used in calculating the amounts set
forth in the Final Closing Statement, such effect may be taken into account
by the Independent Accountant. Further, in resolving any such objection, the
Independent Accountant may not assign a value to any particular item greater
than the greatest value for such item claimed by either Party or less than the
lowest value for such item claimed by either Party.

 



25 (d) _Settlement_.

 

(i) If the sum of the Final Working Capital Adjustment, the Final Transaction
Fees and Expenses Adjustment and the Final Credit Agreement Indebtedness
Adjustment (as finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.04(c)_) is positive,
then on or before the second (2nd) Business Day after such final
determination, Purchaser shall pay to the Paying Agent, for
further remittance to Sellers, an aggregate amount equal to such sum by wire
transfer of immediately available funds in U.S. Dollars; and

 

(ii) If the sum of the Final Working Capital Adjustment, Final Transaction
Fees and Expenses Adjustment and Final Credit Agreement Indebtedness
Adjustment (as finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.04(c)_) is negative,
then on or before the second (2nd) Business Day after such final
determination, Purchaser and Seller Representative shall deliver to the
Escrow Agent joint written instructions directing the Escrow Agent to release
to Purchaser from the Escrow Account an aggregate amount equal to the absolute
value of such negative sum to such account(s) as specified by Purchaser.

 

(iii) All Purchase Price adjustments made pursuant to this _Section 2.04(d)_
shall be treated by all parties for tax purposes as adjustments to the
Purchase Price. The payments described in _Section 2.04(d)(ii)_ shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser for any and all claims arising
under this Agreement with respect to this  _Section 2.04_.

(e) _Fees of the Independent Accountants_. Purchaser shall pay a portion of
the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant equal to one hundred
percent (100%) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount
of disputed amounts submitted to the Independent Accountant that are resolved
in favor of Sellers (that being the absolute value of the difference between
the Independent Accountants determination and Purchasers determination) and
the denominator of which is the total amount of disputed amounts submitted to
the Independent Accountants (that being the sum total by which Seller
Representatives determination and Purchasers determination differ from the
determination of the Independent Accountants). Sellers shall pay that portion
of the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants that the Purchaser is
not required to pay hereunder.

2.05 _Further Assurances; Post-Closing Cooperation_. 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at any time or from
time to time after the Closing, each of the Parties hereto shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to execute, acknowledge and deliver such other
documents and instruments, provide such materials and information, and take
such other actions as may reasonably be necessary, proper or advisable, to
the extent permitted by Law, to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.

 



26 (b) Subject in each case to applicable confidentiality obligations to
third parties, following the Closing, Seller Representative and Purchaser
shall, and Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Companies to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to afford the other Party, its counsel and its accountants,
during normal business hours, reasonable access to the books, records and
other data, documents or reports relating to the business or financial or
operating condition of the Acquired Companies in their possession with respect
to periods prior to the Closing Date and the right to make copies and
extracts therefrom, in each case solely to the extent that such access may
reasonably be required by the requesting Party in connection with (i)
compliance with the requirements of any Governmental or Regulatory Authority
or (ii) in connection with any actual or threatened Action or Proceeding;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the
Acquired Companies) shall not be required to make available their income
Tax Returns. Further, Seller Representative and Purchaser shall not, and
Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Companies to not, for a period extending
seven (7) years after the Closing Date, or such longer period as such books,
records and other data remain relevant to open Tax years or to any pending
investigation by a Governmental or Regulatory Authority or any pending
litigation if such investigation or litigation relates in any material respect
to matters occurring prior to the Closing, destroy or otherwise dispose of
any such books, records and other data unless such Party shall first offer by
notice to the other to surrender such books, records and other data to the
notifying Party, to be held subject to appropriate confidentiality
restrictions as applicable, and such other Party shall not agree in writing to
take possession thereof during the ten (10) day period after such offer is
made.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section
2.05_, if the Parties are in an adversarial relationship in any Action or
Proceeding, the furnishing of information, documents or records in accordance
with any provision of this _Section 2.05_ shall be subject to applicable
rules relating to discovery.

 

2.06 _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing, Seller Representative shall
designate the Escrow Agent or another nationally recognized financial
institution reasonably acceptable to Purchaser to act as paying agent (the "
_Paying Agent_ "), pursuant to a customary paying agency agreement, at the
cost and expense of Sellers, to receive and remit any amounts due
from Purchaser to Sellers under this Agreement, including the Closing
Purchase Price and any payments that may be owed by Purchaser to Sellers
pursuant to _Section 2.04(d)(i)_ or _Article XI_ , but excluding the Payment
(if any). At the Closing, or as soon as practicable thereafter, upon delivery
on behalf of a Seller of such documents as the Paying Agent may require, the
Paying Agent shall pay to such Seller, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds in U.S. Dollars, its respective proportion of the Closing
Purchase Price at such account(s) and in such proportion designated by Seller
Representative in accordance with _Section 2.03_. As soon as practicable
after receipt of any other payment under this Agreement to be further
remitted to Sellers, subject to delivery on behalf of a Seller of any
documents as the Paying Agent may require, the Paying Agent shall remit to
such Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds in U.S.
Dollars, its respective proportion of such payment to such account(s) as
designated by Seller Representative to the Paying Agent. Delivery of a payment
to the Paying Agent for further remittance to Sellers shall be deemed to
satisfy Purchasers obligation to make such payment to Sellers for all
purposes under this Agreement. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on the
payments payable to Sellers after such payment is made to the Paying Agent for
further remittance to Sellers.

 



27 2.07 _Withholding_. If any amount is required by Law to be deducted or
withheld on account of any Tax with respect to payments made under this
Agreement to Sellers, such Tax shall be deducted by Purchaser, the Paying
Agent or the Escrow Agent, as applicable, from the amounts required to be paid
under this Agreement and such Person shall promptly remit such deduction or
withholding on account of any Tax (if any) to the relevant Governmental or
Regulatory Authority and shall promptly provide the relevant Seller(s) with
the appropriate receipts for such payments. All Tax amounts deducted or
withheld from payments pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be treated as
having been actually paid to the relevant Seller(s) for purposes of this
Agreement.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER

 

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by Purchaser to
Sellers concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the "
_Purchaser Disclosure Schedule_ "), Purchaser hereby represents and warrants
to Sellers as follows:

5.01  _Legal Existence_. Purchaser is a limited liability company duly
formed, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of
Delaware. Purchaser is qualified to do business and is in good standing in the
states in which the conduct of its business or locations of its assets and
properties makes such qualification necessary, except where failure

 



45  to be so qualified or to be in good standing would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to Purchasers ability to
perform its obligations hereunder or under other agreements and instruments
to be executed and delivered by Purchaser in connection with this Agreement
(the " _Purchaser Transaction Documents_ "). Purchaser has all requisite power
and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this
Agreement and the Purchaser Transaction Documents, including to purchase the
Interests pursuant hereto.

 

5.02 _Authority_. The execution and delivery by Purchaser of, and the
performance by Purchaser of its obligations under, this Agreement and the
Purchaser Transaction Documents and the consummation by Purchaser of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly and validly
authorized by all required action on the part of Purchaser. This Agreement and
each of the Purchaser Transaction Documents has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by Purchaser and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery thereof by the other parties hereto and thereto,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Purchaser enforceable
against Purchaser in accordance with its terms, except as the same may be
limited by the Enforceability Limitations.

 

5.03 _No Conflicts_. Except as described on _Section 5.03 of the Purchaser
Disclosure Schedule_, and assuming all filings, notices, consents, approvals,
authorizations, and other actions described in _Section 5.04 of the Purchaser
Disclosure Schedule_ have been obtained, the execution and delivery by
Purchaser of, and the performance of its obligations under, this Agreement,
the Purchaser Transaction Documents and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby will not:

 

(a) conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of the organizational documents of Purchaser;

(b) conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any term or provision
of any Law or Order applicable to Purchaser or any of its assets and
properties; or

(c) (i) conflict with or result in a material violation or material breach
of, (ii) constitute (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) a material
default (or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration) under, or (iii) require Purchaser to obtain any consent,
approval or action of, make any filing with or give any notice to any Person
as a result or under the terms of, any material Contract, Permit or
Governmental or Regulatory Approval to which Purchaser is a party or by which
any of its assets and properties is bound.

5.04 _Governmental or Regulatory Approvals_. Except as set forth in _Section
5.04 of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule_, no Governmental or Regulatory
Approval on the part of Purchaser is required in connection with the execution
and delivery by Purchaser of this Agreement, the Purchaser Transaction
Documents or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby.

5.05 _Legal Proceedings_. There are no Actions or Proceedings pending or, to
the Knowledge of Purchaser, threatened in writing or, to the Knowledge of
Purchaser, orally

 



46  against Purchaser or any of its assets or properties that would reasonably
be expected to result in the issuance of an Order restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting, delaying or making illegal the purchase by Purchaser
of the Interests under this Agreement or the performance by Purchaser of its
obligations under this Agreement or the Purchaser Transaction Documents.

 

5.06 _Investment Representations_. Purchaser is a knowledgeable and
sophisticated investor experienced (or owned or managed by
Persons experienced) in evaluating investments and, in particular (either on
its own or with advisors), power generation facilities and has the knowledge,
experience and resources to enable it to evaluate and to bear the risks of the
investment contemplated hereunder. Purchaser understands that (i) the
purchase and sale of the Interests under this Agreement will not be registered
or qualified under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any state
securities or blue sky Laws, (ii) there is no public market for the Interests
and it is not anticipated that there shall be and (iii) the Interests must be
held, and Purchaser must continue to bear the economic risk of the investment
in the Interests, until the Interests or the sale thereof, as applicable, are
subsequently registered under the Securities Act and any applicable state or
non-U.S. securities Laws or an exemption from registration is available. The
Interests are being acquired by Purchaser for its own account for the purpose
of investment and not with a view to distribution in violation of the
Securities Act, as amended, or any applicable state securities or blue sky
Laws.

 

5.07 _Brokers_. No broker, finder or agent acting on behalf of Purchaser or
its Affiliates is entitled to any fee or commission with respect to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby that would be payable by Sellers or their
Affiliates.

 

5.08 _Financing_. Purchaser has received and accepted an executed commitment
letter dated as of the date hereof (as amended, modified, supplemented,
replaced or extended from time to time after the date of this Agreement in
compliance with _Section 7.07_, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ") from the
lenders party thereto (including any lenders who become party thereto by
joinder in accordance with the terms thereof) (collectively, the " _Lenders_
") pursuant to which the Lenders have agreed, subject to the terms and
conditions thereof, to provide the debt amounts set forth therein, which
is the full amount of the debt financing required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (such debt financing and any
permitted Alternative Debt Financing, the " _Debt Financing_ "). Purchaser has
delivered to Seller Representative true, complete and correct copies of the
executed Debt Commitment Letter and a customary redacted version of the fee
letter referred to in the Debt Commitment Letter (none of such redacted
portions would adversely affect the amount, conditionality or availability of
the Debt Financing) (each as amended, modified, supplemented, replaced or
extended from time to time after the date of this Agreement in compliance with
_Section 7.07_, the " _Fee Letter_ "). The Debt Commitment Letter has not
been amended or modified prior to the date of this Agreement and no such
amendment or modification that could reasonably be expected to impact the
conditionality or aggregate amount of the Debt Financing is contemplated. As
of the date of this Agreement, (a) the respective commitments contained in the
Debt Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, modified, amended, terminated
or rescinded in any respect and (b) no such withdrawal, termination,
rescission, amendment or modification is contemplated (other than amendments
and modifications permitted under _Section 7.07_). Except as set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter, there are no conditions precedent to the obligations
of the Lenders to

 



47  provide the Debt Financing or any contingencies that would permit the
Lenders to reduce the total amount of the Debt Financing. There are no
agreements, side letters or other arrangements relating to the Debt Financing
to which Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is a party that could impose
conditions to the funding of the Debt Financing, other than those set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter (or in the unredacted portions of the Fee Letter)
or the Existing Credit Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt
Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and constitutes the legal, valid
and binding obligations of Purchaser and, to the Knowledge of Purchaser,
the other parties thereto. Assuming the Debt Financing is funded in
accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter and the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Sellers and the Company set forth in this
Agreement and performance by each of them of their respective obligations
hereunder, as of the date of this Agreement, Purchaser is able to, and does
not have any reason to believe that it will be unable to, satisfy on a timely
basis any term or condition to the initial funding of the Debt Financing on
the Closing Date contained in the Debt Commitment Letter required to be
satisfied by it. Subject to its terms and conditions, the Debt Financing, when
funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter, will provide Purchaser
with cash on the Closing Date, together with available cash, sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including making
all necessary payments of fees and expenses in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby). As of the date of this Agreement,
Purchaser has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees required
to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letters or Fee Letter on or
before the date of this Agreement, and will pay in full any such amounts due
on or before the Closing Date when such amounts are due.

5.09 _Exon-Florio_. Purchaser is not deemed a "foreign person" for purposes
of Section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, or any
executive orders, rules or regulations relating thereto.

6.01 _Investigation by Purchaser_. From the date hereof until the earlier of
the Closing and the date that this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
its terms, Sellers and the Company shall, and shall cause the Acquired
Companies to, provide Purchaser and its Representatives with reasonable
access, upon reasonable prior notice and during normal business hours, to all
officers, employees, consultants, contractors, agents and accountants of the
Acquired Companies and their respective assets, properties, books and records,
but only to the extent that such access does not unreasonably interfere with
the business and operations of any Acquired Company. Purchaser shall indemnify
and hold harmless Sellers, their Affiliates and their respective
Representatives for any and all liabilities and Losses incurred by Sellers,
the Company, their Affiliates or their respective Representatives caused by
Purchaser as a result of providing such access. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Sellers and the Company shall not be required to, and shall not be required
to cause any Acquired Company to, furnish any such information where the
furnishing of such information would (w) violate any Law, Order, Permit

 



48  or Governmental or Regulatory Approval applicable to Sellers or any Acquired
Company or any of their Affiliates, assets and properties, including the
Projects, (x) result in the loss of attorney-client privilege with respect to
such information, (y) result in a breach of a Contract to which Sellers, any
Acquired Company or any of their respective Affiliates are a party or (z)

representative present at all times during any such inspection, interview or
examination by Purchaser and/or its Representatives conducted at or on the
offices or other facilities or properties of the Acquired Companies and to
impose reasonable restrictions and requirements for liability and safety
purposes. Nothing in this _Section 6.01_ shall entitle Purchaser to collect
any air, soil, surface water or ground water samples or perform any invasive
or destructive sampling on any Real Property owned or leased by any Acquired
Company without Seller Representatives prior written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 

6.02 _Conduct of Business_. From the date hereof until the Closing, Sellers
shall cause each Acquired Company to, and the Company shall, conduct its
business in accordance with Good Industry Practice and in the ordinary course
consistent with past practice. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Sellers will cause each Acquired Company to, and the Company shall,
use commercially reasonable efforts to (a) maintain such Acquired Companys
assets and properties in good working order and condition, ordinary wear and
tear excepted, and (b) maintain the goodwill of key Persons with whom such
Acquired Company otherwise has significant business relationships; _provided_
, _however_ , no Acquired Company shall be required to make any payments or
enter into or amend any contractual agreements, arrangements, or
understandings to satisfy the foregoing obligation other than in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice or as required by Good
Industry Practice.

reason. This power of attorney shall not be affected by the death, illness,
dissolution, disability, incapacity or other inability to act of the principal

designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or
instruction as being a notice or communication to or by, or a decision,

be liable to any Seller in its capacity as Seller Representative for any
liability of a Seller or for any error of judgment, or any act done or step
taken or omitted by it that it believed to be in good faith or for any mistake
in fact or law, or for anything which it may do or refrain from doing in
connection with this Agreement and the Transaction Documents. Sellers
shall severally, but not jointly, pro rata in accordance with their
respective proceeds from the sale of the Interests, indemnify and hold
harmless, Seller Representative from any and all losses, liabilities and

obtain the waiver of) on a timely basis, taking into account the expected
timing of the Marketing Period, all conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter,
Fee Letter and such Definitive Agreements (including payment of all fees and
expenses) and comply with its obligations thereunder, (iii) maintain in
effect the Debt Commitment Letter and Fee Letter in accordance with their
terms and (iv) enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter, the Fee
Letter and the Definitive Agreements, as applicable, in the event of any
breach or purported breach thereof. Purchaser shall not and shall cause its
Affiliates not to take or refrain from taking, directly or indirectly, any
action that could reasonably be expected to result in a default under or
failure of any of the conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter or
in any Definitive Agreement related to the Debt Financing.

(b) Purchaser shall use, and shall cause its Affiliates to use, its
reasonable best efforts to comply with its obligations, and enforce its
rights, under the Debt Commitment Letter and any Definitive Agreements.
Purchaser shall give Seller Representative prompt notice of any material
breach (or alleged or purported material breach) by any party to the Debt
Commitment Letter of which Purchaser has become aware or any termination (or
alleged or purported termination) of the Debt Commitment Letter. Purchaser
shall keep Seller Representative informed on a reasonably current basis in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to obtain the proceeds of the
Debt Financing and shall not permit any amendment or modification to, or any
waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letter
if such amendment, modification, waiver or remedy (x) would materially delay
the occurrence of the Closing, taking into account the expected timing of
the Marketing Period, (y) reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing
(except as contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter) or (z) adds new
conditions or amends the existing conditions to the drawdown of the Financing,
unless Purchaser has available cash sufficient to consummate the Closing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, failure to obtain the Debt Financing and
compliance by Purchaser with this

 



66   _Section 7.07(b)_ shall not relieve Purchaser of its obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement whether or not the
Debt Financing is available.

 

(c) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions (including any "flex provisions") contemplated in
the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter, regardless of the reason
therefor, Purchaser will (i) as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
alternative debt financing (the " _Alternative Debt Financing_ ") (in an
amount sufficient, when taken together with any then-available Debt Financing
pursuant to any then-existing Debt Commitment Letter, to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related fees and
expenses earned, due and payable as of the Closing Date) on terms not less
favorable in the aggregate to Purchaser than those contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter that the Alternative Debt Financing
would replace (taking into account any flex provisions) from the same or other
sources and which do not include any incremental conditionality to the
consummation of such Alternative Debt Financing that are more onerous to
Purchaser, Sellers and the Acquired Companies (in each case, in the aggregate)
than the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter in effect as of
the date of this Agreement and (ii) as soon as commercially
practicable notify Seller Representative of such unavailability and the
reason therefor.

(d) For purposes of the foregoing  _Section 7.07(a)_ through _Section
7.07(c)_, the term "Debt Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include any
commitment letter (or similar agreement) with respect to any Alternative Debt
Financing arranged in compliance herewith (and any Debt Commitment Letter
remaining in effect at the time in question), (ii) the term "Fee Letter" shall
be deemed to include any fee letter (or similar agreement) and engagement
letter (or similar agreement) with respect to any Alternative Debt Financing
arranged in compliance with this _Section 7.07_, and (iii) the term "Lenders"
shall be deemed to include any lenders providing the Alternative Debt
Financing arranged in compliance herewith. Purchaser shall keep Seller
Representative reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status
of its efforts to consummate the Debt Financing. Purchaser shall provide
Seller Representative with reasonably prompt notice of (i) any breach, or
default by any Financing Source party to any Debt Commitment Letters of which
the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Executive Officer or General Counsel of
Purchaser gains actual knowledge and which such Chief Financial Officer,
Chief Executive Officer or General Counsel reasonably believes would result in
a Debt Financing Failure and (ii) the receipt of written notice or oral notice
(only to the extent that the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Executive Officer
or General Counsel of Purchaser has actual knowledge of such oral notice) from
any Financing Source party to any Debt Commitment Letters with respect to any
breach or default or, termination or repudiation by such Financing
Source resulting in a Debt Financing Failure.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything contained in this
Agreement, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not conditional upon the
receipt by Purchaser of the proceeds of the Debt Financing.

event, a " _Casualty Loss_ "), and the sum of (x) the cost of restoring,
repairing or replacing such damaged or destroyed Assets to a condition
reasonably comparable to their prior condition, plus (y) the amount of any
lost profits, in each case, to the extent such costs and lost profits are
reasonably expected to accrue after the Closing as a result of such Casualty
Loss (net of and after giving effect to any insurance proceeds
actually received by the Acquired Companies for such restoration and lost
profits) (such costs and lost profits with respect to any Purchased Assets as
determined by an independent qualified firm reasonably acceptable to Purchaser
and Sellers, the " _Restoration Cost_ ") is greater than $20,000,000 but does
not exceed $130,000,000, Seller Representative may elect to (i) reduce the
amount of the Purchase Price by the estimated Restoration Cost (as estimated
by an independent qualified firm reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and
Sellers) or (ii) restore, repair or replace the assets or properties relating
to such Casualty Loss to a condition reasonably comparable to their prior
condition, in each case by notice to Purchaser. If Seller Representative
elects to reduce the Purchase Price pursuant to clause (i) above, such

restore, repair or replace the assets or properties pursuant to clause (ii)
above, the Seller Representative will complete or cause to be completed, using
good faith diligent efforts, the repair, replacement or restoration of the
damaged assets or property in accordance with Good Industry Practice prior to

rights under _Article XI_ , there shall be no reduction in the amount of the
Purchase Price. In the event of a Casualty Loss, Sellers shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
collect amounts due (if any) under available insurance arrangements in
respect of any such Casualty Loss and shall cause any such insurance proceeds
to be contributed or assigned to the applicable Acquired Company that has
suffered such Casualty Loss ( _provided_ that in the event the Purchase Price
is reduced due to such Casualty Loss, and such Purchase Price reduction does
not take into account such insurance proceeds, then any such insurance
proceeds that are received by the Acquired Companies following the
Closing shall be promptly remitted to Sellers).

(b) To assist Purchaser in its evaluation of any and all Casualty
Losses (including Restoration Costs), Sellers shall provide Purchaser such
access to the properties and assets and such information as Purchaser may
reasonably request in connection therewith.

Purchased Assets as determined by an independent qualified firm reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser and Sellers, the " _Condemnation Value_ ") is greater
than $20,000,000 but does not exceed $130,000,000, Seller Representative may
elect to (i) reduce the Purchase Price by such Condemnation Value or (ii)
restore or replace the assets or properties relating to such Condemnation to a
condition reasonably comparable to their prior condition, in each case by
notice to Purchaser. If Seller Representative elects to reduce the Purchase
Price pursuant to clause (i) above, such Condemnation shall not affect the
Closing. If Seller Representative elects to restore or replace the assets or
properties pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Seller Representative will
complete or cause to be completed, using good faith diligent efforts, the
replacement or restoration of the assets or property relating to such
Condemnation in accordance with Good Industry Practice prior to the Closing
and the Closing Date shall be postponed for the amount of time reasonably
necessary to complete the restoration, repair or replacement of such property
or assets as reasonably agreed among Purchaser and Seller Representative (
_provided_ that such postponement shall not extend beyond the date that is
five (5) Business Days prior to the Termination Date). If Seller
Representative does not make any such election within forty-five (45) days
after the date of such Condemnation, Purchaser may elect to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 12.01(b)(iii)_ within ten (10) Business Days
after such forty-five (45) day period by written notice to Seller
Representative. If the Condemnation Value is in excess of $130,000,000, then
either Seller Representative or Purchaser may, by notice to the other Party,
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 12.01(b)(iii)_. If the
Condemnation Value is $20,000,000 or less, (1) neither Purchaser nor Sellers
shall have the right or option to terminate this Agreement pursuant to

XI_ , there shall be no reduction in the amount of the Purchase Price. In the
event of any Condemnation, Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to collect amounts due (if
any) under any applicable condemnation award in respect of any such
Condemnation and shall cause any such condemnation award to be contributed or
assigned to the applicable Acquired Company that has suffered such
Condemnation ( _provided_ that in the event the Purchase Price is reduced due
to such Condemnation, and such Purchase Price reduction does not take into
account such condemnation award, then any condemnation award that is received
by the Acquired Companies following the Closing shall promptly be remitted to
Sellers).

 

(b) To assist Purchaser in its evaluation of any and all Condemnation
(including Condemnation Value), Sellers shall provide Purchaser such access
to the properties and assets and such information as Purchaser may reasonably
request in connection therewith.

 



69 8.03 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Purchaser and Sellers shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates, and their Affiliates respective officers, employees,
agents, auditors and other Representatives to reasonably cooperate, in
preparing and filing all Tax Returns and any Tax contest, including
maintaining and making available to each other all records necessary
in connection with resolving all disputes and audits with respect to all
taxable periods relating to Taxes. Purchaser and Sellers and their respective
Affiliates each recognize that the other may need access, from time to time,
after the Closing Date, to certain accounting and Tax records and information
held by it, to the extent such records and information pertain to events
occurring prior to the Closing Date; therefore, Purchaser and Sellers agree,
(i) to properly retain and maintain such records until the earlier of (x)
such time as Purchaser and Sellers agree in writing that such retention and
maintenance is no longer necessary or (y) the expiration of the statute of
limitations and (ii) to allow each of the other Parties and their respective
agents, auditors and other Representatives, at times and dates mutually
acceptable to the Parties hereto, to inspect, review and make copies of such
records as such Party or its agents, auditors or other Representatives may
deem necessary or appropriate from time to time.

(b) Subject to Section 11.04(a), from and after the Closing, Sellers, on a
several but not joint basis, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Purchaser Indemnified Parties, without duplication of any other provision of
this Agreement (including _Article XI_ ), from and against, and reimburse
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for, any Losses incurred or suffered by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties (whether or not involving a Third-Party Claim)
arising out of, relating to or resulting from (i) any Taxes attributable to,
arising out of, or related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, and with respect to
any Straddle Period, any Taxes attributable to the portion of such Straddle
Period ending on and including the Closing Date; (ii) the Transaction Transfer
Taxes for which the Sellers are responsible for pursuant to _Section
8.03(e)_ (to the extent not included in the Final Transaction Fees and
Expenses Adjustment); and (iii) any Taxes imposed on any Acquired Company, or
for which any Acquired Company may otherwise be liable, by reason of contract
or other arrangement, assumption, transferee or successor liability, operation
of Law or otherwise to the extent incurred, entered into or otherwise applied
with respect to (as the case may be) any taxable periods (period or a portion
thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date. Liabilities for Taxes for any
Straddle Period shall be apportioned as follows: (A) property and similar ad
valorem Taxes shall be apportioned on a ratable daily basis; and (B) all
other Taxes shall be apportioned based on an interim closing of the books of
the Acquired Companies as of the Closing Date. The Parties hereto shall, to
the extent permitted under applicable Law, elect with the relevant Tax
Authority to treat for all Tax purposes the Closing Date as the last day of
the taxable year or period of the Acquired Companies.

 



70 (c) The Parties acknowledge and agree that income Tax deductions, if any, of
the Company associated with the payment of expenses incurred in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any sale,
change of control or similar bonus or payments triggered by the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are payable by any
Acquired Company contingent upon the Closing), any unamortized capitalized
financing costs and expenses relating to any Acquired Companys outstanding
Indebtedness that will be paid at Closing (including any loan fees,
prepayment penalties and similar costs and any accrued (and not previously
deducted) original issue discount on any outstanding Indebtedness of any
Acquired Company that will be redeemed as of the Closing in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby and to the extent borne economically by
the Sellers in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, shall, for
purposes of this agreement, be treated as if such income Tax deduction
was incurred in a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

(d) Any Tax refund actually received (including any interest with respect
thereto) by any Acquired Company or any reduction of the Companys actual
cash Tax liability (each a " _Tax Refund_ ") for the taxable period (or
portions thereof) after the Closing Date as a result of an overpayment of Tax
during the Pre-Closing Tax Period, shall be for the benefit of Sellers,
except for the following Tax Refunds which shall be for the benefit of the
Purchaser (i) any Tax Refund to the extent accurately reflected as a Tax asset
account in the calculation of any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant
to _Section 2.04_, and (ii) any Tax Refund resulting from the carryback (or,
with respect to any Straddle Period, any other utilization) of any net
operating losses, capital losses, tax credits, or similar tax attributes from
a taxable period (or portions thereof) ending after the Closing Date. Any
other Tax Refunds (including any interest with respect thereto) relating to
the Acquired Companies shall be for the benefit of Purchaser. Tax Refunds for
a Straddle Period shall be apportioned based on the Taxes for such period that
were paid by or on behalf of Purchaser and Sellers. At the expense of the
requesting Party, the Parties and their Affiliates shall reasonably cooperate
with the requesting Party in connection with obtaining any Tax Refunds as set
forth in this _Section 8.03(d)_. If a Party receives a Tax Refund to which
the other Party is entitled, the Party receiving the Tax Refund shall pay
it to the Party entitled to the Tax Refund within fifteen (15) Business Days
after such receipt, _provided_ that if such Tax Refund is subsequently
challenged or revoked, the Party entitled to the Tax Refund shall promptly
indemnify or reimburse the other Party. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, if the outstanding claims of indemnity against Sellers under this
Agreement (taking into account the sums described in _Section 11.08(a)(ii)_
and  _Section 11.08(a)(iii)_ or _Section 11.08(b)(i)_ and _Section
11.08(b)(ii)_, as applicable), are in excess of the funds then outstanding in
the Escrow Account, any Tax Refund that Sellers are entitled to under this 
_Section 8.03(d)_ shall be deposited into the Escrow Account.

(e) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, recording, registration,
controlling interest transfer and other similar Taxes and fees (including any
penalties and interest) (the " _Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the 

 



71  transactions contemplated hereby, if any, and reasonable out of pocket
expenses incurred in connection with the preparation of any Tax returns with
respect thereof (collectively, the " _Transaction Transfer Taxes_ "), shall
be borne fifty percent (50%) by Purchaser, on the one hand, and fifty percent
(50%) by Sellers on the other. Subject to the obligation of the Sellers to pay
fifty percent (50%) of the Transaction Transfer Taxes, Purchaser shall remit
the payment for all of the Transaction Transfer Taxes and file all Tax Returns
and other documentation required to be filed by Purchaser with respect to any
such Transaction Transfer Taxes, and, if required by applicable Law, Seller
Representative and Sellers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, join in
the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. The parties
shall cooperate in good faith to take such commercially reasonable actions as
will minimize or reduce the amount of such Transaction Transfer Taxes.

(f) From the date hereof until the Closing, Sellers shall cause each Acquired
Company to duly and timely prepare, or cause to be duly and timely prepared,
all Tax Returns that are due (taking into account valid extensions) on or
before the Closing Date. To the extent the Company is required to file a Form
3115 (Application for Change in Accounting Method) with its federal income Tax
Return for the taxable year ending December 31, 2014 which includes a positive
Code section 481(a) adjustment associated therewith, Sellers shall cause the
Company to prepare and file elections in the form and manner described in
section 7.03(3)(d) of Revenue Procedure 2015-13 (2015-5 I.R.B. 419) to cause
any such Code section 481(a) adjustments to be recognized in the taxable year
ending December 31, 2014, to the extent permitted by Law. In addition, Sellers
shall (x) in the case of federal income Tax items described in clause (A) and
(B) below cause the Acquired Companies to deliver to Purchaser, and (y) in
all other cases covered by clause (A) and (B) below use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Acquired Companies to deliver to Purchaser, in
each case promptly after such documentation is ready but in any event no
later than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing, detailed schedules and
related work papers setting forth, as of December 31, 2014, for federal and
Arizona, Massachusetts and New York state and local income Taxes purposes
(if such documentation, schedules and related workpapers are readily
available for such state and localities) (A) for the Company, the tax basis
balance sheet, gross deferred tax balances and any valuation allowances, and
(B) for each other Acquired Company, gross deferred tax basis balance and
detailed depreciation schedules sufficient to calculate deferred tax balances
at such Acquired Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any of the items
described in clause (y) above is not fully completed thirty (30) days prior
to the Closing, Sellers shall cause the Acquired Company to the deliver the
information requested in draft or rough form to Purchaser at that time and to
use commercially reasonable efforts to have such item completed and delivered
to Purchaser as soon as practicable thereafter and in any event at least three
(3) days prior to Closing; _provided_ , _further_ , Purchaser shall, promptly
upon request of any Acquired Company, reimburse Sellers, the Acquired
Companies (prior to the Closing) or their Affiliates, as the case may be, for
all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Sellers, the
Acquired Companies (prior to the Closing) or their Affiliates (including
those of its accountants, consultants, legal counsel, agents and other
Representatives) that were approved by Purchaser in connection with the
cooperation required by clauses (A) and (B) this  _Section 8.03(g)_
including for the preparation of any such documentation, schedules or
workpapers not previously prepared and not otherwise required to be prepared
by the Acquired Companies by applicable Law.

 



72 (g) From the date hereof until the Closing, Sellers shall cause each
Acquired Company to deliver any Tax Returns related to federal and Arizona,
Massachusetts and New York state and local income Taxes that are due (taking
into account valid extensions) or otherwise will be filed on or prior to the
Closing Date to Purchaser for its review and comment promptly after such Tax
Returns (and other documentation) are ready but in any event no later than
thirty (30) days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return
(together with all related schedules and work papers) for Seller
Representatives review, comment, and consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. Purchaser shall be deemed to
have provided such consent unless Purchaser provides comments to
Seller Representative within fifteen (15) days of receipt of such Tax Return
and schedules. If Purchaser provides comments to Seller Representative within
such fifteen (15) day period, Seller Representative shall consider in good
faith any such comments and the Parties shall, in good faith, cooperate to
promptly resolve any remaining dispute prior to the due date for the filing of
such Tax Return (taking into account valid extensions). If the Parties are
unable to resolve any remaining disputes, such disputes shall be promptly
submitted to a senior Tax partner at the Independent Accountant for
resolution. In such case, the relevant provisions of Section 2.04(c)(ii) and
Section 2.04(e) shall apply with appropriate adjustments.

(h) After the Closing and until the Escrow Amount is released in accordance
with  _Section 11.08(b)_, Purchaser shall (i) deliver any federal and
Arizona, Massachusetts and New York state and local income Tax Return of the
Acquired Companies relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period to Seller
Representative promptly after such Tax Returns (and other documentation) are
ready but in any event no later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date
(taking into account valid extensions) for the filing of such Tax Return for
Seller Representatives review, comment, and consent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. All such Tax Returns shall
be prepared and filed in a manner that is consistent with the prior past
practice of the Company and its subsidiaries, as applicable, except as
required by Law. Seller Representative shall be deemed to have provided such
consent unless Seller Representative provides comments to Purchaser within
fifteen (15) days of receipt of such Tax Return. If Seller Representative
provides comments to Purchaser within such fifteen (15) day period, Purchaser
shall consider in good faith any such comments and the Parties shall, in good
faith, cooperate to promptly resolve any remaining dispute prior to the due
date (taking into account valid extensions) for the filing of such Tax Return.
If the Parties are unable to resolve any remaining disputes, such disputes
shall be promptly submitted to a senior Tax partner at the Independent
Accountant for resolution. In such case, the relevant provisions of _Section
2.04(c)(ii)_ and _Section 2.04(e)_ shall apply with appropriate adjustments.

 

(i) _FIRPTA Certificate_. The Company shall provide written notice to the
Purchaser and the Paying Agent as to whether the Company can (or cannot)
deliver a Non-USPRHC Certificate (as defined below) promptly upon such
determination being made and in any event no later than fourteen (14) days
prior to the Closing Date. If the Company provides Purchaser and the Paying
Agent with a notice that it can deliver a

 



73  Non-USRPHC Certificate, then on or before the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Purchaser and the Paying Agent (A) a certificate dated as of
the Closing Date, substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C1_ ,

Revenue Service regarding the delivery of the Non-USRPHC Certificate above
that is dated as of the Closing Date, substantially in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit C2_ and in compliance with the requirement of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.897-2(h)(2). If the Company provides Purchaser and the
Paying Agent with a notice that it _cannot_ deliver a Non-USRPHC Certificate,
_then_ , (x) the Seller Representative shall deliver to Purchaser and the
Paying Agent at least two (2) days prior to the Closing Date, from each
Seller that is not a foreign person for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, a
duly executed certificate in the form prescribed by Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1445-2(b) and reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser and the Paying
Agent (a " _Non-Foreign Certificate_ "), which certificate shall set forth all
information required by, and shall otherwise be executed in accordance with
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b)(2), and (y) Seller Representative,
Sellers and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver
to Purchaser and the Paying Agent promptly (and in any event at least two (2)
days before the Closing Date) information that would allow Purchaser and/or
the Paying Agent to properly complete IRS Form 8288-A and such other
information regarding each Seller that is a foreign person for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes as may reasonably be requested by Purchaser or the Paying
Agent in order to properly report and remit any Tax withheld with respect to
such Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement to the IRS. If the Company provides a Non-USRPHC Certificate to
Purchaser in accordance with this  _Section 8.03(i)_ then Purchaser shall
not deduct or withhold from any payment made under this Agreement under
Section 897 or Section 1445 of the Code (or any similar Tax Law including any
similar provision of state, local, or foreign Tax Law) (" _FIRPTA_ ") except
as provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3)(ii). If the Company
does not provide a Non-USRPHC Certificate to Purchaser in accordance with this
Section 8.03(i) and Sellers that are not foreign persons for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes provide Non-Foreign Certificates in accordance with this
_Section 8.03(i)_, the Purchaser shall not deduct or withhold from any
payment made under this Agreement to each such Seller that provides a Non-
Foreign Certificate under FIRPTA except as provided in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1445-2(b)(4).

 

(j) The obligations of the parties set forth in this _Section 8.03_ shall
remain in effect until the Escrow Amount is finally released in accordance
with _Section 11.08_.

documentation pertaining to the Credit Agreement and any Hedging Arrangements,
in each case, subject to Purchasers payment of the Closing Purchase Price at
the Closing.

9.11 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. Purchaser may not rely on the

such representations and warranties were made on and as of the Closing Date
(or, to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to an
earlier date, on and as of such earlier date), except in the case of this
clause (b) where the failure of such representations and warranties to be
true and correct (in each case disregarding all qualifications and exceptions
contained therein relating to materiality, material adverse effect or word of

ARTICLE XI

 

INDEMNIFICATION; NO OTHER REPRESENTATIONS

 

11.01 _Survival_. The representations and warranties and pre-Closing covenants
and agreements of Purchaser, Sellers and the Company contained in this
Agreement will survive the Closing until the fifteen (15) month anniversary of
the Closing Date and all other covenants and agreements will survive until
fully performed or one (1) year after otherwise terminated in accordance with
the terms hereof, except that (i) the Seller Fundamental Representations and
the Purchaser Fundamental Representations will survive the Closing until the
six (6) year anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement that would otherwise terminate in accordance
with this _Section 11.01_ will continue to survive if the requisite claim
notice shall have been timely given in good faith based on facts reasonably
expected to establish a valid claim under this _Article XI_ on or prior to
such termination date, until the related claim for indemnification shall have
been satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided in this _Article XI_. 

 



77 11.02 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 11.02(b)_, from and after the Closing:

 

(i) Sellers, on a several but not joint basis, shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Purchaser and its respective Affiliates and their respective
Representatives (collectively, the " _Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ ") from
and against, and reimburse the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for, all Losses
incurred or suffered by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties (whether or not
involving a Third-Party Claim) arising out of, relating to or resulting from
(A) any representation or warranty of Sellers or the Company contained in
_Article III_ or _Article IV_ of this Agreement not being true and correct
when made and as of the Closing Date (except that those representations and
warranties that are made as of a specific date will be deemed for purposes of
this _Section 11.02(a)(i)(A)_ to have been made by Sellers or the Company,
as applicable, only as of such specific date) or (B) any breach of any
covenant or agreement of Sellers or the Company contained in this Agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, any claim with respect to any representation or
warranty of the Company contained in _Section 4.15_ (including the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.15(l)_ (the " _Tax
Attributes Representation_ ")) failing to be true and correct shall be
governed by  _Section 11.02(a)(i)(A)_. Any claim for indemnification under
this _Section 11.02(a)(i)(A)_ by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties with
respect to the Tax Attributes Representation must arise or result from (x)
such Tax Attributes Representation being inconsistent with any Tax Return
filed with respect to a period ending on or before the Closing Date in
compliance with _Section 8.03(g)_ or (y) an audit, investigation, inquiry or
any other process or action initiated solely by a Taxing Authority (a " _Tax
Audit_ "); _provided_ , _further_ that Sellers shall have no obligation under
the indemnity provided in clause (y) of this _Section 11.02(a)(i)(A)_ to
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any Losses resulting from the Tax
Attributes Representation not being true and correct to the extent such Tax
Audit is intentionally initiated or instigated by any of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties. For the avoidance of doubt, any filing, disclosure or
other similar action taken by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in order to
comply with applicable Laws, GAAP financial reporting requirements or other
regulatory requirements (except, in each case, for filing of Tax Returns
other than Tax Returns filed in accordance with past practice or otherwise in
compliance with the provisions governing filing of Tax Returns under this
Agreement) shall not be considered as intentionally initiating or instigating
a Tax Audit. If Purchaser asserts pursuant to this _Section 11.02(a)(i)_ a
claim for indemnification as a result of the Tax Attributes Representation
failing to be true and correct, Purchaser shall provide Seller
Representative a proposed schedule of Losses (" _Tax Attributes Schedule_ ")
providing sufficient detail of the calculation of such Losses incurred (or to
be incurred) by Purchaser as a result of the Tax Attributes Representation
failing to be true and correct. The Parties acknowledge and agree that such
Tax Attributes Schedule shall be prepared on a "with and without" basis in a
manner consistent with the assumptions specifically set forth in this _Section
11.02(a)(i)_ and shall take into account factors applicable for such
calculations, including the net present value of any Losses and any

 



78  Tax benefit (including any depreciation and amortization deductions)
resulting from any increase in the amount of Tax Attributes compared with the
amount of Tax Attributes set forth on  _Section 4.15(l)_ including an
increase in Tax basis resulting from an adjustment under Section 481 of the
Code with a corresponding decrease in net operating loss carryforwards, the
impact of any adjustments to the Tax Attributes under Section 481 of the Code
or otherwise on the limitations applicable to the utilization of Tax
Attributes under Section 382 of the Code (including Section 382(h)). The Tax
Attributes Schedules shall be calculated using the following assumptions (x)
a discount rate of ten percent (10%), (y) a federal income tax rate of 35% and
the highest applicable marginal tax rate applicable to corporations applicable
for the relevant state and local income tax purposes, and (z) taxable income
in every applicable year in an amount sufficient for the full utilization of
the Tax Attributes (subject to the applicable annual limitation with respect
thereof). Seller Representative shall provide a written notice of any
objection to the Tax Attributes Schedule (providing sufficient detail of the
calculation of such dispute regarding Losses incurred (or to be incurred) by
Purchaser as a result of the Tax Attributes Representation failing to be true
and correct) within 30 calendar days of the delivery of the Tax Attributes
Schedule. If Seller Representative does not provide a written notice within
such thirty (30) day period, Seller Representative shall be deemed to agree
with the Tax Attributes Schedule. Seller Representative and Purchaser shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve any dispute raised in a notice of objection
(that was delivered by Seller Representative in compliance with the
requirement set forth above) within thirty (30) calendar days after Seller
Representatives delivery of such notice of objection. If the Seller
Representative and Purchaser are unable to resolve any disputes, such disputes
shall be promptly submitted to a senior Tax partner at the Independent
Accountant for resolution. In such case, the relevant provisions of _Section
2.04(c)(ii)_ and _Section 2.04(e)_ shall apply with appropriate adjustments.

 

(ii) Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sellers and their
Affiliates and their respective Representatives (collectively, the " _Seller
Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against, and reimburse the Seller Indemnified
Parties for, all Losses actually incurred or suffered by the Seller
Indemnified Parties (whether or not involving a Third-Party Claim) arising
out of, relating to or resulting from (A) any representation or warranty of
Purchaser contained in _Article V_ of this Agreement not being true and
correct when made and as of the Closing Date (except that
those representations and warranties that are made as of a specific date will
be deemed for purposes of this _Section 11.02(a)(ii)(A)_ to have been made by
Purchaser only as of such specific date), or (B) any breach of any covenant
or agreement of Purchaser contained in this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Party
shall have any liability under Sections 11.02(a)(i)(A) and 11.02(a)(ii)(A) for
the failure of representations and warranties in this Agreement to be true and
correct (other than for failures of the representations and warranties
contained in _Section 4.15_ to be true and correct) until (i) with respect
to any claim thereunder, such claim involves Losses incurred by the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties, as applicable, in
excess of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) (a " _Qualifying Loss_ "), in
which case the indemnifying Party will only be liable for the amount of such
Loss that is a Qualifying Loss and (ii) the aggregate amount of all Qualifying
Losses incurred by the

 



79  Purchaser Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties, as
applicable, equals or exceeds three-fourths of one percent (0.75%) of the Base
Purchase Price (the " _Threshold Amount_ "), in which event the indemnifying
Party shall be liable for such Qualifying Losses only to the extent they are
in excess of the Threshold Amount, and in no event shall the aggregate
liability of the indemnifying Party arising out of or relating to this
_Section 11.02_ (including for failures of the representations and warranties
contained in _Section 4.15_ to be true and correct) exceed the Escrow Amount;
_provided_ , _however_ , nothing contained in this _Section 11.02(b)_ shall
limit the liability of an indemnifying Party for claims relating to fraud or
willful misconduct or the failures of the Seller Fundamental Representations
or the Purchaser Fundamental Representations to be true and correct.

(c) For purposes of determining the amount of any Loss incurred in connection
with any failure of a representation or warranty under _Sections
11.02(a)(i)(A)_ and _11.02(a)(ii)(A)_ to be true and correct or whether such
failure has occurred, all references to "material" or "Company Material
Adverse Effect" or words of similar import contained therein (other than with
respect to (x) the term "Company Material Contract" and (y) the
representations contained in _Section 4.06_ (Financial Statements and
Condition) and  _Section 4.08_ (Absence of Changes)) shall be disregarded.

11.03 _Duty to Mitigate_. A Party that becomes aware of a Loss for which it
may seek indemnification under this _Article XI_ shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate such Loss, including taking any actions
reasonably requested by the other Party, and such other Party shall not be
liable for any Loss to the extent that it is directly attributable to the
failure of the Party seeking indemnification to comply with this _Section
11.03_; _provided_ , that this _Section 11.03_ shall not apply with respect
to matters relating to Tax and shall not be construed as requiring any party
to act or avoid from acting with respect to any matter relating to Tax or
otherwise as interfering with the right of each party to manage its Tax
affairs; provided further, that the foregoing proviso shall not be construed
as otherwise altering the rights and obligations of the parties under this
Agreement with respect to matters relating to Tax including those Tax matters
relating to indemnification under  _Section 11.02(a)(i)_ for Tax Attributes.

11.04 _Exclusive Remedy; Reduction of Benefit_.

 

(a) The Parties acknowledge and agree that from and after the Closing, (i) the
remedies provided in  _Section 2.04_, _Section 8.03_, _Section 13.08_, and
the indemnification provisions in this _Article XI_ shall be the sole and
exclusive remedies for any and all claims against Sellers, the Company or
Purchaser arising under, out of, related to or in connection with this
Agreement and no Person will have any other entitlement, remedy or recourse,
whether in contract, tort or otherwise against Sellers, the Company or
Purchaser, it being agreed that all of such other remedies, entitlements and
recourse are expressly waived and released by the Parties to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, and (ii) subject to remedies available under _Section
13.08_, other than indemnification for any Seller Fundamental Representation
failing to be true and correct which shall not be limited by this clause (ii),
payment from and out of the Escrow Account pursuant to and in accordance with
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy and source of funds available to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties and

 



80  any other Person for any Actions or Proceedings or other claims against
Sellers arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated herein, whether relating to the inaccuracy of a representation
and warranty, or a breach of a covenant, agreement or obligation in this
Agreement and whether based on contract, tort, strict liability, any Laws or
otherwise; _provided_ that, except as set forth in the last sentence of this
_Section 11.04(a)_, nothing in this Agreement shall relieve any Seller, the
Company or Seller Representative from, or limit the right of Purchaser to
bring or maintain any claim, suit, action or proceeding arising out of or in
connection with, any fraud or willful misconduct of Sellers, the Company or
Seller Representative. The provisions of this _Section 11.04(a)_ and the
limited remedies provided in _Section 2.04_, _Section 6.01_,  _Section
6.11_, _Section 7.04_, _Section 8.03_, _Article XI_ , _Section 12.02(b)_
and _Section 13.08_, were specifically bargained for by the Parties and taken
into account by them in arriving at the Base Purchase Price and the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. Subject to the first sentence of this _Section
11.04(a)_, no Party shall be entitled to rescission of this Agreement (or any
related agreements) or, other than as expressly reserved for hereunder, any
further indemnification rights or claims of any nature whatsoever, all of
which are hereby expressly waived by the Parties to the fullest extent
permitted by Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary otherwise
contained herein, no Seller shall have any liability with respect to Losses
that are indemnifiable under this Agreement to the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties in connection with this Agreement in excess of the aggregate amount of
gross proceeds actually received by such Seller pursuant to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Any obligation of Purchaser to indemnify a Seller Indemnified Party or of
Sellers to indemnify a Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be reduced to the
extent of any amounts or benefits (whether in the form of cash, credit or some
other beneficial arrangement) actually received by the applicable indemnified
Party (net of any costs incurred to recover such amount) pursuant to (i) a
warranty or indemnification from a third party, (ii) insurance or (iii) a net
tax benefit that resulted directly from the Loss for which indemnification is
sought but only to the extent the Loss resulted in an effective reduction of
cash tax liability (calculated on a "with and without" basis) in the year in
which such Loss was incurred or the two succeeding years (and reduced by any
costs, including Taxes, incurred in connection with such tax benefit, the
subject matter Loss or the indemnity payment with respect thereto, including,
for the avoidance of doubt, the resulting reduction in the utilization of any
Tax Attributes for the then current year and two (2) succeeding years).

(c) No Losses may be claimed under _Section 11.02_ or _Section 8.03_ by any
Purchaser Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party to the extent such
Losses (and in the case of any Loss related to Tax, the specific item of Tax
that results in such Loss) were clearly and accurately reflected in the
calculation of any adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section
2.04_, as it is the intent of the Parties that the procedures set forth in
_Section 2.04_ provide the sole and exclusive remedy for such claims.

 



81 11.05 _Procedure With Respect to Claims_.

 

(a) No claim may be asserted pursuant to this _Article XI_ for inaccuracy of
any representation and warranty or the breach of any covenant or agreement
contained herein unless written notice of such claim describing the claim, the
amount thereof (if known and quantifiable) and the basis thereof (a " _Demand_
") is delivered by the Party seeking indemnification on or prior to the date
on which the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on which such
claim is based ceases to survive as set forth in this _Article XI_. In the
event an indemnifying Party makes any payments on any claim pursuant to this
_Article XI_, such indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of
such payment, to all rights and remedies of the Purchaser Indemnified Party or
the Seller Indemnified Party, as the case may be, to any insurance benefits
or other claims of the Purchaser Indemnified Party or the Seller Indemnified
Party, as the case may be, with respect to such claim, including any claims
against third parties.

 

(b) A notified indemnifying Party shall reply to a Demand within thirty (30)
days of receipt thereof by written notice to such indemnitee, which notice
shall state in good faith the extent to which such notified indemnifying Party
agrees or disagrees with the claimed Losses and if such notified indemnifying
Party disagrees with any claimed Losses, the basis for such disagreement. If
the Party seeking indemnification is a Purchaser Indemnified Party, then to
the extent that the notified indemnifying Party agrees with any claimed
Losses, Purchaser and Seller Representative shall promptly deliver to the
Escrow Agent joint written instructions directing the Escrow Agent to release
to Purchaser from the Escrow Account an aggregate amount equal to such agreed
Losses, provided that if the Escrow Agreement is terminated and such claims
are not limited to the balance of the Escrow Account in accordance with
_Section 11.04(a)_, Sellers shall promptly deliver to Purchaser an aggregate
amount equal to such agreed Losses by wire transfer of immediately available
funds in U.S. Dollars to such account(s) as specified by Purchaser. If the
Party seeking indemnification is a Seller Indemnified Party, then to the
extent that the notified indemnifying Party agrees with any claimed Losses,
Purchaser shall promptly pay to the Paying Agent, for further remittance to
Sellers, an aggregate amount equal to such sum by wire transfer of immediately
available funds in U.S. Dollars.

 

(c) To the extent that the notice given by the notified indemnifying Party
pursuant to _Section 11.05(b)_ disputes any Losses claimed, the Parties
hereto shall make a reasonable good faith effort to resolve any such disputes
for a period of thirty (30) days following the delivery of such notice.

 

(d) If any Purchaser Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party becomes
subject to a pending or threatened claim of a third party (a " _Third-Party
Claim_ ") and such Person (the " _Claiming Party_ ") believes it has a claim
for indemnification against Purchaser or Sellers, as applicable (the "
_Responding Party_ "), then the Claiming Party shall deliver to the
Responding Party with reasonable promptness a Demand with respect to such
Third-Party Claim. The Responding Party shall notify the Claiming Party as
soon as practicable whether the Responding Party desires to defend the
Claiming Party against such Third-Party Claim. The failure of the Claiming
Party to so notify the Responding

 



82  Party shall not relieve the Responding Party of liability hereunder except
to the extent that the defense of such Third-Party Claim is prejudiced by the
failure to give such notice. In the event that the Responding Party notifies
the Claiming Party that it desires to defend the Third-Party Claim pursuant to
this _Section 11.05(d)_ and acknowledges its obligations to indemnify
hereunder, the Responding Party shall have control of such defense and
proceedings, including any settlement thereof.

(e) If the Responding Party notifies the Claiming Party that it desires to
defend the Third-Party Claim pursuant to _Section 11.05(d)_, then the
Responding Party shall assume control over the Third-Party Claim and work
diligently to defend the Third-Party Claim; _provided_ , that, the Responding
Party shall not (i) be entitled to assume and have control over such Third-
Party Claim if (A) the sole remedy sought in such Third-Party Claim is an
injunction or equitable relief against the Claiming Party or an
Affiliate thereof or (B) such Third-Party Claim arises in connection with a
criminal proceeding against the Claiming Party or an Affiliate thereof or (ii)
without the consent of the Claiming Party, enter into any settlement that (A)
does not include as a term thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff
to the Claiming Party a release from all liability in respect of such Third-
Party Claim, (B) provides for any relief other than the payment of monetary
damages as to which the Claiming Party shall be indemnified in full or (C)
involves the consent to the entry of any Order (other than an Order of
dismissal on the merits without costs); _provided_ , _further_ , that if
requested by the Responding Party, the Claiming Party shall, at the sole cost
and expense of the Responding Party, cooperate with the Responding Party and
its counsel in contesting any Third-Party Claim that the Responding Party
elects to contest, or, if appropriate and related to the Third-Party Claim in
question, in making any counterclaim against the Person asserting the Third-
Party Claim, or any cross-complaint against any Person (other than the
Claiming Party or any of its Affiliates). The Claiming Party may elect
to participate in such proceedings, negotiations or defense at any time at
its own expense ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Responding Party shall pay
the attorneys fees of the Claiming Party if (x) the employment of
separate counsel shall have been authorized in writing by the Responding
Party in connection with the defense of such Third-Party Claim or (y) the
Claiming Partys counsel shall have advised the Claiming Party in writing,
with a copy delivered to the Responding Party, that there is a conflict of
interest that could make it inappropriate under applicable standards of
professional conduct for the Responding Party and the Claiming Party to have
common counsel).

 

(f) Until the Responding Party notifies the Claiming Party that the Responding
Party desires to defend the Third-Party Claim pursuant to _Section
11.05(d)_, the Claiming Party shall (upon reasonable prior notice to the
Responding Party) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or
settlement of such Third-Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Responding Party shall reimburse the Claiming Party for the costs of defending
against such Third-Party Claim (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) and shall remain otherwise responsible for any liability with
respect to amounts arising from or related to such Third-Party Claim, in both
cases to the extent it is ultimately determined that such Responding Party is
liable with respect to such Third-Party Claim under this Agreement. The
Responding Party may elect to participate in such proceedings, negotiations
or defense at any time at its own expense.

 



83 (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Responding Party shall not control Third-Party Claims with respect to Taxes;
_provided_ , _however_ , if the Responding Party acknowledges its obligations
to indemnify hereunder and the balance of the Escrow Account is equal to or
greater than the amount of such Third-Party Claim amount plus the amounts
described in _Section 11.08(a)(ii)_ and _Section 11.08(a)(iii)_ and/or
_Section 11.08(b)(i)_ and _Section 11.08(b)(ii)_, as applicable (the "
_Required Balance_ "), (i) the Responding Party may elect, by providing the
Claiming Party a written notice within twenty-five (25) days, to participate
with the Claiming Party in the control of such proceedings, negotiations or
defense of a Third-Party Claim relating to Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period
at the Responding Partys own expense; _provided_ that in such case (x) the
Parties shall act diligently and in good faith in exercising such joint
control, and (y) neither Party shall compromise or settle such Third-Party
Claim with respect to Taxes without the consent of the other Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The
Claiming Party shall regain sole control of such Third-Party Claims in the
event the balance of the Escrow Account (determined in accordance the first
sentence of this _Section 11.05(g)_) is reduced significantly below the
Required Balance or if the Escrow Account is otherwise terminated. If the
Claiming Party controls proceedings, negotiations or defense of a Third-Party
Claim relating to Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, for as long as there are
funds remaining in the Escrow Account (determined in accordance the first
sentence of this _Section 11.05(g)_), Claiming Party shall not compromise or
settle such Third-Party Claim with respect to Taxes without the consent of the
Responding Party, which consent shall not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

11.06 _Mutual Release_. Effective upon the Closing, (a) Sellers hereby
release and discharge the Acquired Companies and the Indemnified Persons from
any and all obligations and liabilities to Sellers as the equityholders of the
Company of any kind or nature whatsoever, as to facts, conditions,
transactions, events or circumstances prior to the Closing, and Sellers shall
not seek to recover any amounts in connection therewith from any Acquired
Company or any Indemnified Person; _provided_ that, this _Section 11.06_
shall not affect the rights of the Indemnified Persons pursuant to _Section
7.05_ and the rights of Sellers under this Agreement or the Company
Organizational Documents and (b) Purchaser shall cause each Acquired Company
to release and discharge each Seller and the Indemnified Persons from any and
all obligations and liabilities of any kind or nature whatsoever, as to facts,
conditions, transactions, events or circumstances prior to the Closing, and
Purchaser shall ensure that no Acquired Company shall seek to recover any
amounts in connection therewith from any Seller or any Indemnified Person;
_provided_ that this _Section 11.06_ shall not affect the rights of Purchaser
or any Acquired Company under this Agreement.

 

11.07 _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. Any indemnification payments made
pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price paid to Sellers for federal, state and local income Tax purposes.

11.08 _Release of Security_.

 

(a) On the second (2nd) Business Day following the date that is three (3)
months after the Closing Date, Purchaser and Seller Representative shall
provide joint

 



84  written instructions to the Escrow Agent to reduce the amount remaining in
the Escrow Account to, and release to Sellers all of the funds in excess of,
the sum of (i) $50,000,000, (ii) (A) any amounts that Sellers have become
obligated to pay pursuant to the terms of _Section 2.04(d)(ii)_ and this
_Article XI_, but that Purchaser or the applicable Purchaser Indemnified
Party has yet to receive or (B) if the Final Closing Statement indicates that
Sellers would be obligated to pay amounts pursuant to the terms of _Section
2.04(d)(ii)_, but the final determinations required for settlement pursuant
to  _Section 2.04(d)(ii)_ remains pending, any amounts Sellers would be
obligated to pay pursuant to _Section 2.04(d)(ii)_ if the Final Closing
Statement were validated in all respects, and (iii) the aggregate amount of
all Losses specified in any good faith claims for indemnification made in
accordance with this Agreement prior to such date that have not been fully
paid or otherwise fully and finally resolved. After (x) payment of all amounts
finally due pursuant to _Section 2.04(d)(ii)_, if any, and (y) final
resolution and payment, if required, of any such unresolved claims as
contemplated in clause (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Escrow
Agent shall distribute the withheld funds remaining in the Escrow Account
relating to such payment or such claims, as applicable, to the accounts and in
the proportions to each Seller designated by Seller Representative to the
Escrow Agent in writing.

 

(b) On the second (2nd) Business Day following the date that is fifteen (15)
months after the Closing Date, Purchaser and Seller Representative shall
provide joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release to Sellers
all of the funds then remaining in the Escrow Account, minus the sum of (i)
any amounts that Sellers have become obligated to pay pursuant to the terms
of _Section 2.04(d)(ii)_ and this _Article XI_, but that the applicable
Purchaser Indemnified Party has yet to receive and (ii) the aggregate amount
of all Losses specified in any good faith claims for indemnification made in
accordance with this Agreement prior to such date that have not been fully
paid or otherwise fully and finally resolved. After final resolution of any
such unresolved claims as contemplated in the immediately preceding sentence,
after final resolution of any such unresolved claims as contemplated in the
immediately preceding sentence and after the deduction of any amounts payable
to Purchaser, upon such resolution the Escrow Agent shall distribute the
funds remaining in the Escrow Account to the accounts and in the proportions
to each Seller designated by Seller Representative to the Escrow Agent in
writing.

 

ARTICLE XII

 

TERMINATION

12.01  _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated, and the transactions
contemplated hereby may be abandoned, at any time by written notice from
Seller Representative or Purchaser to the other (except for paragraph (a)
below):

 

(a) by mutual written consent of Purchaser and Seller Representative;

 



85 (b) by either Purchaser or Seller Representative:

 

(i) if the Closing has not occurred on or before the six (6) month anniversary
of the date of this Agreement (which date may be extended by any Party, by
notice to the other Parties, for one additional three (3) month period if (A)
one or more applicable Governmental or Regulatory Approvals have not been
obtained by the date that is six (6) months after the date of this Agreement
and (B) the lack of any such Governmental or Regulatory Approvals is the sole
reason that the unwaived conditions set forth in _Article IX_ and _Article
X_ to consummate the Closing are unfulfilled as of the date that is six (6)
months after the date of this Agreement) (the " _Termination Date_ ");
_provided_ that the terminating Party (including Sellers and the Company in
the case that Seller Representative is the terminating Party) is not in
material breach under this Agreement;

(ii) if any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States or other
Governmental or Regulatory Authority shall have issued a Final Order or
enacted any Law or taken any other final action restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and such Order or Law or other action is or shall have become
final and nonappealable; or

(iii) under the circumstances set forth in, and in accordance with, _Section
8.01_ or _Section 8.02_;

(c) at any time before the Closing, by Purchaser if (x) Sellers have failed
to consummate the Closing when required in accordance with this Agreement or
(y) there has been a breach by Sellers or the Company of any covenant,
agreement or obligation contained in this Agreement or if any representation
or warranty of Sellers or the Company is or shall have become untrue, in
either case such that the conditions set forth in _Section 9.01_ or _9.02_
would not be satisfied, and such breach or inaccuracy is not curable, or, if
curable, is not cured within the earlier of (A) thirty (30) days after written
notice of such breach is given to Seller Representative by Purchaser and (B)
the Termination Date;  _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 12.01(c)_ shall not be available to Purchaser at
any time that Purchaser has violated, or is in breach of, any covenant,
representation or warranty hereunder, if such violation or breach has
prevented satisfaction of any of Sellers conditions to Closing hereunder (and
such condition(s) has not been waived by Seller Representative) or, if capable
of being cured, has not been cured by Purchaser;

(d) at any time before the Closing, by Seller Representative if there has been
a breach by Purchaser of any covenant, agreement or obligation contained in
this Agreement or if any representation or warranty of Purchaser is or shall
have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in
_Sections 10.01_ or _10.02_ would not be satisfied, and such breach or
inaccuracy is not curable, or, if curable, is not cured within the earlier of
(A) thirty (30) days after written notice of such breach is given to Purchaser
by Seller Representative and (B) the Termination Date; _provided_ , _however_
, that no cure period shall apply to Purchasers obligation to pay the Closing
Purchase Price. The right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 12.01(d)_ shall not be available to Seller Representative at any
time that Sellers or the Company have violated, or are in breach of, any
covenant, representation or warranty hereunder, if such

 



86  violation or breach has prevented satisfaction of any of Purchasers
conditions to Closing hereunder (and such condition(s) has not been waived by
Purchaser) or, if capable of being cured, has not been cured by Sellers or
the Company; or

(e) at any time before the Closing, by Seller Representative if Purchaser has
failed to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on the date on which
the Closing would have occurred, pursuant to and subject to the provisions of
_Section 2.03_, if Purchaser had not failed to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, and all of the conditions set forth in
_Article IX_ would have been satisfied if the Closing were to have occurred
on such date; _provided_ that, Sellers and the Company are not then in breach
of this Agreement so as to cause the conditions set forth in _Article IX_
not to be satisfied.

12.02 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) Except as provided in this _Section 12.02_, if this Agreement is validly
terminated pursuant to  _Section 12.01_, then this Agreement will forthwith
become null and void and there will be no liability or obligation on the part
of any Party or any other Person in respect of this Agreement other than for
any willful material breach of this Agreement occurring prior to such
termination and for willful misconduct or actual fraud; _provided_ , that this
_Section 12.02_, _Section 6.01_ (solely with respect to Purchasers
indemnification obligations set forth therein), _Section 6.15(b)_ (solely
with respect to Purchasers indemnification obligations set forth therein) and
_Article XIII_ will continue to apply following any termination hereof.

 

(b) In the event that there is a Debt Financing Failure, then Purchaser shall
pay, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in no event later than ten
(10) Business Days following such termination), to Sellers an aggregate amount
equal to $75,000,000 (the " _Payment_ ") by wire transfer of immediately
available funds in U.S. Dollars to the accounts and in the proportions to
each Seller designated by Seller Representative to Purchaser in writing, and
the delivery of such Payment, together with reimbursement of all applicable
expenses pursuant to this _Section 12.02(b)_, shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy for any and all losses, liabilities, obligations, payments,
costs, expenses or damages suffered or incurred by Sellers or any other Person
in connection with this Agreement, the transactions (including the Debt
Financing) contemplated hereby (and the abandonment or termination thereof)
or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of Sellers or
any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, suit,
action or proceeding against Purchaser or any Financing Source arising out of
or in connection with this Agreement, the transactions (including the Debt
Financing) contemplated hereby (and the abandonment or termination thereof) or
any matter forming the basis for such termination, including any claim, suit,
action or proceeding for injunction, specific performance or other equitable
relief as provided in _Section 13.08_; _provided_ that nothing in this
_Section 12.02(b)_ shall limit the right of any Seller, such Sellers
Affiliates and/or their respective Representatives to bring or maintain any
claim, suit, action or proceeding against Purchaser or any of its
Representatives arising out of or in connection with any breach of the
Confidentiality Agreements. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that
the agreements contained in this _Section 12.02(b)_

 



87  are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that, without these agreements, the other Parties would not enter into this
Agreement. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (1) the Parties have
expressly negotiated the provisions of this _Section 12.02(b)_, (2) in light
of the circumstances existing at the time of the execution of this Agreement
(including the inability of the Parties to quantify the damages that may be
suffered by each Seller and its Affiliates) the provisions of this _Section
12.02(b)_ are reasonable, (3) the Payment represents a good faith, fair
estimate of the damages that Sellers and their Affiliates would suffer, and
(4) the Payment shall be payable as liquidated damages (and not as a penalty)
without requiring Sellers or any other Person to prove actual damages. In the
event that Purchaser shall fail to pay the Payment when due, Purchaser shall
reimburse Sellers for reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or
accrued by each Seller and its Affiliates (including reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel) in connection with collection under and enforcement in
full of this _Section 12.02(b)_, together with interest on such amount at a
rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" at large U.S. money center banks in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made (as published by
_The Wall Street Journal_ ) through the date such payment was actually
received. In no event shall this _Section 12.02_ be construed to mean that
receipt of any financing is a condition to Purchasers obligations hereunder.

 

(c) Notwithstanding this _Section 12.02_ or anything else in this Agreement
to the contrary, Purchaser affirms that it is not a condition to the Closing
or to any of its obligations under this Agreement that Purchaser (or any
Acquired Company) obtain financing for or related to any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE XIII

 

MISCELLANEOUS

13.01  _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the agreements and documents
referred to herein contain the entire agreement and understanding between the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, whether written or oral, relating to such
subject matter in any way. The Parties have voluntarily agreed to define their
rights, liabilities and obligations with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms and
provisions of this Agreement, and the Parties expressly disclaim that they are
owed any duties or are entitled to any remedies not expressly set forth in
this Agreement. Furthermore, this Agreement embodies the justifiable
expectations of sophisticated parties derived from arms-length negotiations
and shall not be deemed to create a partnership between Sellers or any of
their Affiliates, on the one hand, and Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, on
the other hand, and no Person has any other special relationship with another
Person that would justify any expectation beyond that of an ordinary buyer and
an ordinary seller in an arms-length transaction.

 

13.02 _Expenses; Payments_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, each Party shall pay its
own costs and expenses, and, other than as provided in _Section 13.02(b)_,
Sellers shall pay the costs

 



88  and expenses of the Acquired Companies incurred in connection with the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(b) Purchaser, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other, shall each pay
fifty percent (50%) of all costs and expenses (other than the costs and
expenses for each Partys own Representatives) associated with (i) filings
under the HSR Act and (ii) obtaining all Governmental or Regulatory Approvals.
Seller shall pay all costs and expenses associated with any third party
consents, including any fees, costs and expenses incurred in respect of the
Credit Agreement and the Credit Agreement Amendments which, for the avoidance
of doubt, shall include the reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred
by the Acquired Companies and their Affiliates in connection therewith.

(c) Each Party agrees that, where not otherwise specified, all amounts
required to be paid hereunder shall be paid in United States currency and,
except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, without discount,
rebate or reduction and subject to no counterclaim or offset, on the
dates specified herein (with time being of the essence). Subject to the
provisions of _Section 2.04_ (which shall govern any dispute arising
thereunder), in the event any Action or Proceeding is commenced or threatened
by any Person to enforce its rights under this Agreement against any other
Person, if the defendant in such Action or Proceeding is the prevailing party
in such Action or Proceeding, all fees, costs and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees and court costs, incurred by such prevailing party
in connection with such Action or Proceeding shall be reimbursed by the non-
prevailing party in such Action or Proceeding; _provided_ that if the
defendant in such Action or Proceeding prevails in part, and loses in part,
the court, arbitrator or other adjudicator presiding over such Action or
Proceeding shall award a reimbursement of the fees, costs and expenses
incurred by such defendant on an equitable basis. For purposes hereof, and
without limitation, the defendant shall be deemed to have prevailed in any
Action or Proceeding if the Person attempting to enforce its rights hereunder
commences or threatens any such Action or Proceeding and (i) such underlying
claim(s) are subsequently dropped, voluntarily dismissed or voluntarily
reduced and/or (ii) such defendant defeats any such claim(s).

13.03  _Confidentiality_.

(a) Each Party will, and will cause its Affiliates and Representatives to,
hold, in strict confidence, all documents and information concerning another
Party or any of its Affiliates furnished to it by another Party or such other
Partys Affiliates or Representatives in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Confidential Information_ "), and
treat all such Confidential Information as proprietary, secret and
confidential; _provided_ , _however_ , from and after the Closing, (x) such
confidentiality obligations of Purchaser and its Affiliates and
Representatives shall terminate with respect to all Confidential Information
other than with respect to any Confidential Information that relates
exclusively to Sellers or Sellers Affiliates (other than any of the Acquired
Companies) and (y) all Confidential Information relating to the Acquired
Companies or their respective businesses or operations shall be deemed to be
the Confidential Information of Purchaser. Except with respect to Purchaser
to the extent

 



89  Purchasers confidentiality obligations are terminated from and after the
Closing pursuant to the previous sentence, in no event shall either Party
distribute to third parties any Confidential Information; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this _Section 13.03_ shall limit the disclosure
by any Party of any Confidential Information:

 

(i) to the extent required by Law or Order ( _provided_ that the disclosing
Party agrees to give the non-disclosing Party prompt and reasonably
sufficient written notice thereof so as to enable the non-disclosing Party to
seek a protective order, oppose any action by the disclosing Party, or pursue
any other appropriate remedy, if so desired by the non-disclosing Party). If
such a protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or if the non-
disclosing Party, in its sole discretion, waives in writing compliance with
this Agreement, the disclosing Party (or such other Person required to
disclose the Confidential Information) may disclose only that portion of the
Confidential Information that it is legally required to disclose to avoid
contempt or other penalty in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the
disclosing Party (or such other Person required to disclose the Confidential
Information), and shall exercise reasonable best efforts to obtain reliable
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential
Information so disclosed;

 

(ii) in an Action or Proceeding brought by a Party in pursuit of its rights or
in the exercise of its remedies under this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby;

(iii) to the extent that such Confidential Information can be shown to have
come within the public domain through no action or omission of the disclosing
Party or its Affiliates or Representatives; and

 

(iv) later acquired by the receiving Party from another source if the
receiving Party is not aware that such source is under an obligation to
another Party hereto to keep such Confidential Information confidential.

(b) To the extent that any Confidential Information may include materials
subject to the attorney-client privilege, no Seller is waiving, and no Seller
will be deemed to have waived or diminished, its attorney work-product
protections, attorney-client privileges or similar protections and privileges
as a result of disclosing any Confidential Information (including Confidential
Information related to pending or threatened litigation) to Purchaser, its
Affiliates or their respective Representatives, regardless of whether such
Seller has asserted or is or may be entitled to assert such privileges and
protections. In furtherance of the foregoing, neither Purchaser nor its
Affiliates shall claim or contend, in proceedings involving either Party, that
such Seller waived its attorney work-product protections, attorney-client
privileges or similar protections and privileges with respect to any
information, documents or other material (whether or not disclosed to
Purchaser or its Affiliates) due to such Sellers disclosure of Confidential
Information (including Confidential Information related to pending or
threatened litigation) to Purchaser, its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives.

 

(c) In the event this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section
12.01_, upon the request of either Party, the other Party will, and will
cause its Affiliates and Representatives to, promptly (and in no event later
than five (5) Business Days after such request) redeliver or destroy and
certify in writing as destroyed, or cause to be redelivered or destroyed and
certified in writing as destroyed (as requested by such Party), all copies of
Confidential Information furnished by such other Party in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and all notes,
memoranda, summaries, analyses, compilations and other writings related to or
based on such information or documents prepared by the Party furnished with
such Confidential Information or its Affiliates or Representatives.

 



90 13.04 _Announcements_. From the date hereof until, or in connection with, the
Closing, Sellers and Purchaser shall not issue or make any reports,
statements or releases to the public or generally to the employees, customers,
suppliers or other Persons to whom any Acquired Company sells goods or
provides services or with whom any Acquired Company otherwise has significant
business relationships with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without the consent of the other Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ that
for purposes of clarity, the foregoing shall not restrict such disclosures (a)
that are necessary for the procurement of any required consents, approvals,
payoff letters and similar documentation, (b) made by a Party to its
Representatives as necessary in connection with the ordinary conduct of its
business or the negotiation and consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereunder or (c) that a Party determines in good faith, after
consultation with legal counsel, is required by Law in order to discharge
such Partys or its Affiliates disclosure obligations; _provided_ , _further_
, that in the case of a disclosure pursuant to clause (c), the disclosing
Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other Parties
reasonable time to comment on such disclosure in advance of making such
disclosure and shall promptly furnish the other Parties with a copy thereof.
Sellers and Purchaser shall also obtain the other Partys prior approval of
any press release to be issued immediately following the Closing announcing
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

13.05 _No Waiver_. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at
any time by the Party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such
waiver shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly
executed by or on behalf of the Party waiving such term or condition. No
waiver by any Party of any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one or
more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or
any other term or condition of this Agreement on any prior or future occasion.

 

13.06 _Amendments_. Any provision of this Agreement may be modified,
supplemented or waived only by an instrument in writing duly executed by
Purchaser and Seller Representative; _provided_ , that the execution of any
amendment to this Agreement by Seller Representative must be approved by a
majority in interest of the Sellers; _provided_ , _further_ , that
any amendment to this _Section 13.06_, or any of _Section 12.02(b)_,
_Section 13.12_, _Section 13.16_, _Section 13.17_ or _Section 13.20_ shall
not adversely affect the Financing Sources without the prior written consent
of the Financing Sources. Any such modification, supplement or waiver shall be
for such period and subject to such conditions as shall be specified in the
instrument effecting the same and shall be binding upon each of Purchaser and
Seller Representative, and any such

 



91  waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purposes
for which given. No course of dealing between or among any Persons having any
interest in this Agreement shall be deemed effective to modify, amend or
discharge any part of this Agreement or any rights or obligations of any
Person under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

13.07 _Addresses for Notices_. All notices and other communications required
or permitted to be given or made under this Agreement shall be given or made
in writing, by physical (including by mail or courier) or facsimile or
electronic mail delivery to the address specified below or such other address
as shall be designated in a notice in writing. Notices will be effective and
deemed to have been given (a) when personally delivered, sent by fax or email
(with hard copy to follow) or sent by reputable overnight express courier
(charges prepaid), or (b) three (3) calendar days following mailing by
certified or registered mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested.

13.08 _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges that the rights of each
Party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are unique and
recognize and affirm that in in the event any of the provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
otherwise are breached, money damages would be inadequate (and therefore the
non-breaching Party would have no adequate remedy at law) and the non-
breaching Party would be irreparably damaged. Accordingly, each Party agrees
that, subject to _Section 12.02, (a)_ each other Party shall be entitled to
specific performance, an injunction or other equitable relief (without posting
of bond or other security or needing to prove irreparable harm or damages) to
prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in any action
instituted in any state or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan,
the City of New York, New York, in addition to any other remedy to which such
Person may be entitled, at law or in equity, (b) the provisions set forth in
_Section 11.04_ are not intended to and do not adequately compensate for the
harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement and shall not be
construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Partys right to
specific performance or other equitable relief and (c) the right of specific
performance and other equitable relief is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and without that right as provided in this
_Section 13.08_, none of the Parties would have entered into this Agreement.
The Parties hereto agree not to assert that a remedy of specific performance
or other equitable relief is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to

 



93  law or inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy of
monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the parties
otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. If, on or prior to the Termination
Date, any Party brings any action, in each case in accordance with the terms
hereof, to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions
hereof by any other Party, the Termination Date shall automatically
be extended (x) for the period during which such action is pending, plus ten
(10) Business Days or (y) by such other time period established by the court
presiding over such action, as the case may be. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, (x) in no event shall this _Section 13.08_, be used,
alone or together with any other provision of this Agreement, to require any
Seller or the Acquired Companies to remedy any inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty made by Sellers herein and (y) each Seller hereby
acknowledges and agrees that it shall not have any right to enforce
specifically the obligation of Purchaser to effect the Closing in the event
that the Payment is payable by Purchaser pursuant to _Section 12.02(b)_
hereof; _provided_ that Purchaser expressly acknowledges that nothing
contained in this sentence shall restrict Seller from enforcing specifically
the obligations of Purchaser set forth in  _Sections 7.07(c)_.

13.09 _Captions_. The captions and section headings appearing in this
Agreement are included solely for convenience of reference and are not
intended to affect the interpretation of any provision of this Agreement.

13.10  _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement or the application of
any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be held to be
prohibited by or invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable law in any
respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or
the remaining provisions of this Agreement, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Furthermore,
in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there shall be
added automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable
provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable
provision as may be possible.

13.11 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
successors and assigns; _provided_ that neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated by
any Party (including by operation of law) without the prior written consent of
the other Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser may assign its
rights, interests and obligations hereunder to any Affiliate or Affiliates
of Purchaser, or to Purchasers lenders for collateral security purposes, but
such assignment shall not release Purchaser from its obligations hereunder.

 

13.12 _No Third-Party Beneficiary_. The terms and provisions of this Agreement
are intended solely for the benefit of each Party hereto and their respective
successors or permitted assigns, and it is not the intention of the Parties to
confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other Person other than with
respect to the Indemnified Persons under _Section 7.05_, the Non-Party
Affiliates identified in _Section 13.13(b)_, KandE under _Section 13.19_, any
Person

 



94  entitled to indemnity or release under _Section 6.01_, _Section 7.04_ and
_Article XI_ and the Financing Sources under _Section 12.02(b)_,  _Section
13.16_, _Section 13.17_, _Section 13.20_ and the proviso of _Section
13.06_, each of which provisions is intended to be for the benefit of the
Persons covered thereby or to be paid thereunder and may be enforced by such
Person.

13.13 _Disclaimer; Non-Recourse_.

 

(a) EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, THE INTERESTS ARE BEING
TRANSFERRED "AS IS, WHERE IS, WITH ALL FAULTS," AND, WITHOUT LIMITING THE
GENERALITY OF _SECTION 7.06_, SELLERS AND THE COMPANY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO
THE CONDITION, VALUE OR QUALITY OF THE INTERESTS OR THE PROSPECTS (FINANCIAL
OR OTHERWISE), RISKS AND OTHER INCIDENTS OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES OR THE
PROJECTS. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, PURCHASER WAIVES,
RELEASES AND FOREVER DISCHARGES ALL CLAIMS AND RIGHTS OF ACTION, WHETHER AT
LAW OR EQUITY, AGAINST SELLERS OR THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES ARISING WITH RESPECT
TO THE PROJECTS OR RELATING TO THE TRANSACTIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT,
INCLUDING ANY CLAIMS OR RIGHTS OF ACTION UNDER ANY ENVIRONMENTAL
LAWS. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, BUT WITHOUT
LIMITING THE OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES OF PURCHASER SET FORTH IN _SECTION

PURSUANT TO _SECTION 8.01_ OR _SECTION 8.02_.

 

(b) All claims or causes of action (whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement,
or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as
an inducement to enter into this 

 



95  Agreement), may be made only against the Persons that are expressly
identified as Parties. No Person who is not a named party to this Agreement,
including any past, present or future direct or indirect director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, manager, partner, equityholder, Affiliate,
agent, attorney or other Representative of any named party to this Agreement
(such Persons, collectively, " _Non-Party Affiliates_ "), shall have any

theory that seeks to impose liability of an entity party against its owners or
Affiliates) for any obligations or liabilities arising under, in connection
with or related to this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or
by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation or execution, and each Party
waives and releases all such liabilities, claims and obligations against any
such Non-Party Affiliates. Non-Party Affiliates are expressly intended as
third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 13.13(b)_.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or provided for
under any applicable Law or Order, except with respect to any such damages
sought by third parties against Purchaser, any Seller or Seller
Representative, no party hereto will, in any event, be liable to any other
party hereto, either in contract or in tort, for any punitive damages or
any damages or Losses resulting from the transactions contemplated hereby in
excess of the Purchase Price.

13.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
instrument and any of the Parties to this Agreement may execute this Agreement
by signing any such counterpart. In the event that any signature is delivered
by facsimile transmission or by e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file,
such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of the Party
executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) with the same force
and effect as if such facsimile or ".pdf" signature page were an original
thereof. This Agreement shall become effective when each Party shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other Parties.

 

13.15 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of New York applicable to a contract
executed and performed in such State, without giving effect to any choice of
law or conflict of law rules or principles thereof that would require the
application of the rules of another jurisdiction.

 

13.16 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) For all purposes of this Agreement (other than _Section 2.04(c)_, which
shall govern all disputes thereunder), and for all purposes of any Action or
Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, each Party hereto submits to the personal jurisdiction of
the state and federal courts within the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New
York, New York, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that any
such Action or Proceeding shall be heard and determined in such New York court
or, to the extent permitted by law, in such federal court;  _provided_ that
each Party hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such Action or
Proceeding may be enforced in any other jurisdiction by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by law or at equity. The Parties further
agree that the mailing by certified or

 



96  registered mail, return receipt requested, of any process required by any
such court shall constitute valid and lawful service of process against them,
without necessity for service by any other means provided by statute or rule
of court; _provided_ that nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right of
any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law or at
equity.

 

(b) Each Party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest
extent it may legally and effectively do so:

 

(i) any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any Action or Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
related matter in any state and federal courts within the Borough of
Manhattan, the City of New York, New York; and

 

(ii) the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Action or
Proceeding in any such court.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and without
limitation of the rights of the Financing Sources set forth in _Section
13.20_, the Parties hereby agree that they will not bring or support, or
permit any of their Affiliates or Representatives to bring or support, any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third party claim of any kind
or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than state and federal courts within
the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York, New York, and hereby
irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such action in any
such court.

 

13.17 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH
PARTY HEREBY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION, SUIT,
OR PROCEEDING (WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) TO ENFORCE OR
INTERPRET THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THAT OTHERWISE RELATES TO THIS
AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND/OR THE
RELATIONSHIPS ESTABLISHED AMONG THE PARTIES HEREUNDER, INCLUDING ANY LEGAL
ACTION, SUIT, OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF UNDER OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THE FINANCING OR ANY CLAIM OR PROCEEDING INVOLVING THE
FINANCING SOURCES.

 

13.18 _Disclosure_. Any fact or item disclosed in any section of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosed in each other section of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule to which such fact or item may apply so long as (a)
such other section is referenced by applicable cross-reference or (b) it is
reasonably apparent that such disclosure is applicable such other section.
The headings contained in the Seller Disclosure Schedule are for convenience
of

 



97  reference only and shall not be deemed to modify or influence the
interpretation of the information contained in the Seller Disclosure Schedule
or this Agreement. The Seller Disclosure Schedule is not intended to
constitute, and shall not be construed as, an admission or indication that any
such fact or item is required to be disclosed. Any fact or item disclosed in
the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall not by reason only of such inclusion be
deemed to be material, to establish any standard of materiality or to define
further the meaning of such terms for purposes of this Agreement and matters
reflected in the Seller Disclosure Schedule are not necessarily limited to
matters required by this Agreement to be reflected herein and may be included
solely for information purposes. No disclosure in the Seller Disclosure
Schedule relating to any possible breach or violation of any Contract, Law or
order shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such breach
or violation exists or has actually occurred. The information contained in the
Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be kept strictly confidential by the Parties
and no third party may rely on any information disclosed or set forth
therein.

13.19 _Legal Representation_. Purchaser agrees and will cause each Acquired
Company to agree, on their own behalf and on behalf of their directors,
managers, members, partners, officers, employees and Affiliates and each of
their successors and assigns (all such parties, the " _Waiving Parties_ "),
that Kirkland and Ellis LLP (" _K andE_") (or any successor thereto) may
represent Sellers or any direct or indirect director, manager, member,
partner, officer, employee, equityholder, Affiliate or other Representative of
Sellers and Seller Representative, in connection with any dispute,
litigation, claim, proceeding or obligation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, any agreement entered into in connection herewith or the
transactions contemplated hereby (any such representation, the " _Post-
Closing Representation_ ") notwithstanding its representation (or any
continued representation) of any Acquired Company, and Purchaser consents
thereto and will cause each Acquired Company to consent thereto on behalf of
itself and the Waiving Parties, and Purchaser irrevocably waives (and will
not assert) and will cause each Acquired Company to irrevocably waive (and not
assert) any conflict of interest or any objection arising therefrom or
relating thereto. Purchaser acknowledges and will cause each Acquired Company
to acknowledge that the foregoing provision applies whether or not KandE
provides legal services to any Acquired Company after the Closing Date.
Purchaser irrevocably acknowledges and agrees and will cause each Acquired
Company to irrevocably acknowledge and agree, for itself and the Waiving
Parties, that all communications among KandE, any Acquired Company, Sellers
and/or any director, officer, manager, member, employee or
other Representative of any of the foregoing and Seller Representative made
in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and
performance under, or any dispute or proceeding arising out of or relating to,
this Agreement, any agreement entered into in connection herewith, the
transactions contemplated hereby or any matter relating to any of the
foregoing, are privileged communications and the attorney-client privilege and
the expectation of client confidence belongs to solely to Sellers and may be
controlled by Sellers and shall not pass to or be claimed by Purchaser or any
Acquired Company and from and after the Closing none of Purchaser, any
Acquired Company or any Person purporting to act on behalf of or through
Purchaser, any Acquired Company or any of the Waiving Parties, will seek to
obtain the same by any process. From and after the Closing, Purchaser, on
behalf of itself and the Waiving Parties, waives and will not assert and will
cause each Acquired Company to waive and not assert any attorney-client
privilege with respect to any communication among KandE, any Acquired Company,
Sellers and/or any director, officer, manager, member, employee or other
Representative of any of the foregoing occurring prior to the Closing in
connection with any

 



98  Post-Closing Representation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that a dispute arises between Purchaser or any Acquired Company, on the one
hand, and a third party other than Sellers, on the other hand, Purchaser and
any Acquired Company may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure of confidential communications to such third party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither Purchaser nor any Acquired Company may waive such
privilege without the prior written consent of Sellers.

13.20 _Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, none of Sellers or any of their Affiliates or Representatives, or
each of their successors or permitted assigns, shall have, and Sellers hereby
waive, any rights or claims against each of the Financing Sources
in connection with this Agreement or the Debt Financing, whether at law or
equity, in contract in tort or otherwise. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Financing Sources shall be beneficiaries of all limitations on remedies and
damages in this Agreement that apply to Purchaser hereto and are express
third party beneficiaries of this _Section 13.20_.

shall have the meanings assigned to them in that certain Purchase and Sale
Agreement, dated as July 18, 2015 (the " _Purchase Agreement_ "), by and

WHEREAS, the Purchase Agreement contemplates the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the deposit by the Purchaser on behalf of the Sellers with
the Escrow Agent of at least $75,000,000 (the " _Escrow Amount_ ") in order to

herein and in the Purchase Agreement.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants
hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1\. _Appointment_. The Parties hereby appoint the Escrow Agent as their escrow
agent for the purposes set forth herein, and the Escrow Agent hereby accepts
such appointment and agrees to act as escrow agent in accordance with the
terms and conditions set forth herein.

 

2\. _Escrow Funds_.

(a) Simultaneous with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Seller Representative or the Purchaser is depositing with the Escrow Agent,
the Escrow Amount in immediately available funds. The Escrow Agent hereby
acknowledges receipt of the Escrow Amount, together with all products and
proceeds thereof, including all interest, dividends, gains and other income
(collectively, the " _Escrow Earnings_ ") earned with respect thereto
(collectively with the Escrow Amount, the " _Escrow Funds_ ") in a separate
and distinct account (the " _Escrow Account_ "), subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. Subsequent to the date hereof, the Purchaser
may, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, deposit additional funds to be added
to the Escrow Amount.

(b) For greater certainty, all Escrow Earnings shall be retained by the
Escrow Agent and reinvested in the Escrow Funds and shall become part of the
Escrow Funds; and shall be disbursed as part of the Escrow Funds in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

3\. _Investment of Escrow Funds_. Unless otherwise instructed jointly in
writing by the Seller Representative and Purchaser, the Escrow Agent shall

Business Days after receipt of a Joint Release Instruction, disburse Escrow
Funds in accordance with such Joint Release Instruction.

 

(ii) If at any time either of the Parties receives a Final Determination (as
defined herein), then upon receipt by the Escrow Agent of a copy of such
Final Determination from any Party, the Escrow Agent shall (A) promptly
deliver a copy of such Final Determination to the other Party and (B) on the
fifth (5th) Business Day following receipt by the applicable Party from
the Escrow Agent of the Final Determination, disburse to Purchaser and/or the
Seller Representative, as applicable, Escrow Funds (but only to the extent
there are Escrow Funds) in accordance with such Final Determination. Subject
to the terms of this Section 4(a), the Escrow Agent will act on such Final
Determination without further inquiry.

(iii) All payments of Escrow Funds to (i) the Purchaser or (ii) the Paying
Agent (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) for further distribution to the
Sellers, as the case may be, shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds or cashiers check as set forth in the Joint Release
Instruction or Final Determination, as applicable.

(iv) In the event a Joint Release Instruction is delivered to the Escrow
Agent, whether in writing, by telecopier or otherwise, the Escrow Agent shall
seek confirmation of such instruction by telephone call back to the person or
persons designated in _Exhibits_   _A-1_ and or _A-2_ annexed hereto (the "
_Call Back Authorized Individuals_ "), and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the
confirmations of anyone purporting to be a Call Back Authorized Individual.
To assure accuracy of the instructions it receives, the Escrow Agent may
record such call backs. If the Escrow Agent is unable to verify the
instructions, or is not satisfied with the verification it receives, it will
not execute the instruction until all such issues have been resolved. The
persons and telephone numbers for call backs may be changed only in writing
actually received and acknowledged by the Escrow Agent.

 



2 (b) _Certain Definitions_.

5\. _Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent undertakes to perform only such duties as
are expressly set forth herein, which shall be deemed purely ministerial in
nature, and no duties shall be implied. The Escrow Agent shall neither be
responsible for, nor chargeable with, knowledge of, nor have any requirements
to comply with, the terms and conditions of any other agreement,
instrument or document between the Parties, in connection herewith, if any,
including without limitation the Purchase Agreement, nor shall the Escrow
Agent be required to determine if any Person has complied with any such
agreements, nor shall any additional obligations of the Escrow Agent be
inferred from the terms of such agreements, even though reference thereto may
be made in this Agreement. The Escrow Agent may rely upon and shall not be
liable for acting or refraining from acting upon any Joint Release
Instruction furnished to it hereunder and believed by it to be genuine and to
have been signed and presented by the proper Party or Parties. Concurrent with
the execution of this Agreement, the Parties shall deliver to the Escrow
Agent authorized signers forms in the form of _Exhibit A-1_ and _Exhibit
A-2_ attached hereto. The Escrow Agent shall be under no duty to inquire into
or investigate the validity, accuracy or content of any such document,
notice, instruction or request. The Escrow Agent shall have no duty to solicit
any payments which may be due it or the Escrow Funds. In the event that the
Escrow Agent shall be uncertain as to its duties or rights hereunder or shall
receive instructions, claims or demands from any Party hereto which, in its
opinion, conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement, it shall be
entitled to refrain from taking any action and its sole obligation shall be
to keep safely all property held in escrow until it shall be directed
otherwise in a Joint Release Instruction or Final Determination. The Escrow
Agent may interplead all of the assets held hereunder into a court of
competent jurisdiction or may seek a declaratory judgment with respect to
certain circumstances, and thereafter be fully relieved from any and all
liability or obligation with respect to such interpleaded assets or any action
or nonaction based on such declaratory judgment. The Escrow Agent may consult
with legal counsel of its selection

 



3  in the event of any dispute or question as to the meaning or construction of
any of the provisions hereof or its duties hereunder. The Escrow Agent shall
have no liability or obligation with respect to the Escrow Funds except for
the Escrow Agents fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence. To the
extent practicable, the Parties agree to pursue any redress or recourse in
connection with any dispute (other than with respect to a dispute involving
the Escrow Agent) without making the Escrow Agent a party to the same.
Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall
the Escrow Agent be liable, directly or indirectly, for any (a)
damages, losses or expenses arising out of the services provided hereunder,
other than damages, losses or expenses which result from the Escrow Agents
fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct, or (b) special, indirect or
consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not
limited to lost profits), even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the
likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.

 

6\. _Resignation and Removal of Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent (a) may resign
and be discharged from its duties or obligations hereunder by giving thirty
(30) calendar days advance notice in writing of such resignation to the
Parties specifying a date when such resignation shall take effect or (b) may
be removed, with or without cause, by the Purchaser and the Seller
Representative acting jointly at any time by providing written notice to the
Escrow Agent. Any corporation or association into which the Escrow Agent may
be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any
corporation or association to which all or substantially all of the escrow
business of the Escrow Agents line of business may be transferred, shall be
the Escrow Agent under this Agreement without further act. The Escrow Agents
sole responsibility after such thirty (30) day notice period expires or after
receipt of written notice of removal shall be to hold and safeguard the Escrow
Funds (without any obligation to reinvest the same) and to deliver the same
(i) to a substitute or successor escrow agent pursuant to a joint written
designation from the Parties, (ii) as set forth in a Joint Release Instruction
or (iii) in accordance with the directions of a Final Determination, at which
time of delivery Escrow Agents obligations hereunder shall cease and
terminate. In the event the Escrow Agent resigns, if the Parties have failed
to appoint a successor escrow agent prior to the expiration of thirty (30)
calendar days following receipt of the notice of resignation, the Escrow
Agent may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of
such a successor escrow agent or for other appropriate relief, and any such
resulting appointment shall be binding upon all of the Parties hereto.

7\. _Fees and Expenses_. All fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent are
described in _Schedule 1_ attached hereto and shall be paid fifty percent
(50%) by the Purchaser and fifty percent (50%) by the Seller Representative on
behalf of the Sellers. The fees agreed upon for the services to be rendered
hereunder are intended as full compensation for the Escrow Agent services as
contemplated by this Agreement; however, that in the event that the conditions
for the disbursement of funds under this Escrow Agreement are not fulfilled,
or the Escrow Agent renders any service not contemplated in this Escrow
Agreement, or there is any assignment of interest in the subject matter of the
Escrow Agreement, or any material modification hereof, or if any material
controversy arises hereunder, or the Escrow Agent is made a party to any
litigation pertaining to the Escrow Agreement or the subject matter hereof,
then the Escrow Agent shall be compensated severally and jointly, by Purchaser
and Seller Representative for such extraordinary services and reimbursed for
all reasonable, documented and out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, occasioned by any such delay,
controversy,

 



4  litigation or event. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Purchaser and the Seller Representative agree, solely as between themselves,
that any obligation for indemnification under this _Section 7_ shall be
borne by the party or parties determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
to be responsible for causing the loss, damage, liability, cost or expense
against which the Escrow Agent is entitled to indemnification or, if no such
determination is made, then one-half by the Purchaser and one-half by the
Seller Representative (on behalf of the Sellers).

 

8\. _Indemnity_. Each of the Parties shall severally and jointly indemnify,
defend and save harmless the Escrow Agent and its affiliates and their
respective successors, assigns, directors, officers, agents and employees (the
" _Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all losses, damages, claims,
liabilities, penalties, judgments, settlements, actions, suits, proceedings,
litigation, investigations, costs or expenses (including the reasonable,
documented and out of pocket fees and expenses of one outside counsel and
experts and their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and
shipment) (collectively " _Escrow Agent Losses_ ") arising out of or in
connection with (a) the Escrow Agents execution and performance of this
Agreement, tax reporting or withholding, the enforcement of any rights or
remedies under or in connection with this Agreement, or as may arise by
reason of any act, omission or error of the Indemnitee, except to the extent
that such Escrow Agent Losses have been caused by the fraud, gross negligence
or willful misconduct of Escrow Agent or any such Indemnitee, or (b) its
following any instructions or other directions from the Seller Representative
or the Purchaser, except to the extent that its following any such instruction
or direction is expressly forbidden by the terms hereof; _provided_ _that_ ,
if the actions of either such Party are finally adjudicated by a court of
competent jurisdiction, to have been the sole cause of the Escrow Agent
Losses, such Party shall be responsible for 100% of such Escrow Agent Losses.
The Parties hereto acknowledge that the foregoing indemnities shall survive
the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent or the termination of this
Agreement. The Parties hereby grant the Escrow Agent a lien on, right of set-
off against and security interest in, the Escrow Funds for the payment of any
reasonable claim for indemnification, expenses and amounts due hereunder. In
furtherance of the foregoing, the Escrow Agent is expressly authorized and
directed, but shall not be obligated, upon prior written notice to the
Parties, to charge against and withdraw from the Escrow Funds for its own
account or for the account of an indemnitee any amounts due to the Escrow
Agent or to an indemnitee under this _Section 8_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, the Purchaser and the Seller Representative agree,
solely as between themselves, that any obligation for indemnification under
this  _Section 8_ (or for reasonable, documented and out-of pocket fees and
expenses of the Escrow Agent described in _Section 7_) shall be borne by the
party or parties determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
responsible for causing the loss, damage, liability, cost or expense against
which the Escrow Agent is entitled to indemnification or, if no such
determination is made, then one-half by the Purchaser and one-half by the
Seller Representative (on behalf of the Stockholder Parties). The provisions
of this _Section 8_ shall survive the resignation or removal of the Escrow
Agent and the termination of this Agreement.

9\. _Tax Matters._

 

(a) For purposes of reporting federal and other applicable state and local
income taxes, Purchaser shall be treated as the owner of any Escrow Earnings
that is taxable income for the calendar year in which it is earned. If
Purchaser is allocated any Escrow Earnings that is taxable income and that is
earned but not distributed to Purchaser in any particular year 

 



5  (the "Deemed Interest"), then the Escrow Agent shall, without requiring the
approval of any Party shall (x) as soon as practicable after December 31 of
such year, release and distribute to Purchaser an amount of funds in the
Escrow Account (a "Tax Distribution") equal to the product of (i) forty five
percent (45%) multiplied by (ii) the Deemed Interest and (y) notwithstanding
anything in any Joint Release Instruction, immediately prior to distribution
of the last of the Escrow Funds, release and distribute to Purchaser a Tax
Distribution for any remaining Deemed Interest. A duly executed IRS Form W-9
for each of Seller Representative and Purchaser shall be provided to the
Escrow Agent upon execution of this Escrow Agreement.

(b) At the end of each calendar year, the Escrow Agent shall duly and timely
prepare and file the appropriate IRS Forms 1099 and shall promptly deliver
copies of such forms to the Purchaser. The Escrow Agent shall withhold any
taxes required to be withheld by applicable law, including but not limited to
required withholding in the absence of proper tax documentation, and shall
remit such taxes to the appropriate authorities.

 

10\. _Covenant of Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent hereby agrees and covenants
with the Purchaser and the Seller Representative that it shall perform all of
its obligations under this Agreement and shall not deliver custody or
possession of any of the Escrow Funds to anyone except pursuant to the express
terms of this Agreement or as otherwise required by law.

 

11\. _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands and other communications
required under this Escrow Agreement shall be in writing, in English, and

11_, such communications shall be deemed to have been given on the date

hereunder may be assigned in whole or in part by any party, except as provided
in _Sections 6_ and  _16_ , without the prior consent of the other parties.
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State
of New York. Each party irrevocably waives any objection on the grounds of

provisions in any other jurisdiction. The parties represent, warrant and
covenant that each document, notice, instruction or request provided by such
Party to Escrow Agent shall comply with applicable laws and regulations.

[See attached.] _CERTIFICATION OF NON-UNITED STATES_

 

 _REAL PROPERTY HOLDING CORPORATION STATUS_

 

Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the " _Code_
") provides that a transferee of a U.S. real property interest must withhold
tax if the transferor is a foreign person. To inform the transferee that
withholding of tax is not required upon the disposition of an interest in MACH
Gen, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the " _Company_ "), the
undersigned hereby certifies the following:



     | 1. | This notice is provided pursuant to the requirements of
Treasury Regulations Sections 1.1445-2(c)(3) and 1.897-2(h); 
---|---|--- 



     | 2. | The Companys U.S. taxpayer identification number is -
;

---|---|---|---|--- 
     |  |



 |  | 
   |  |



 |  |

 |  | 
 



     | 4. | The Company is not and has not been a "United States real
property holding corporation," as defined in Section 897(c)(2) of the Code,
during the period described in Section 897(c) of the Code, and no interest in
the Company constitutes a "United States real property interest," as defined
in Section 897(c)(1) of the Code. 
---|---|--- 
 

The Company understands that this certification may be disclosed to the
Internal Revenue Service by the transferee and that any false statement made
here could be punished by fine, imprisonment or both.

Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined this certification
and to the best of my knowledge and belief it is true, correct and complete,
and I further declare that I have authority to sign this document on behalf of
