the Business prior to the Closing, other than the Assumed Liabilities and,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, shall

SECTION 1.03. _Nontransferable Contracts_. __

At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Lafarge shall
provide to the Purchaser a list of all material Nontransferable Contracts
included in the Assets that it expects will not be assigned to the Purchaser
at the Closing as a result of the provisions of the immediately following
sentence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section
1.01(a)_, the Sellers shall not be required to assign to the Purchaser at the
Closing any Nontransferable Contracts (or any rights related thereto,
including to any Software) if the assignment or attempted assignment thereof
would result in a breach or violation of, or default under, the terms thereof
(any such Nontransferable Contracts being 

 



-8-   hereinafter referred to as " _Retained Contracts_ "). Each of the Sellers,
the Parent and the Purchaser agrees that from and after the Closing Date it
will take, or cause to be taken, all reasonable actions necessary to obtain
as promptly as practicable any required consent, approval or authorization to
the assignment or other transfer of the Retained Contracts to the Purchaser.
If and so long as any required consent, approval or authorization to the
assignment or other transfer of any Retained Contracts to the Purchaser shall
not have been obtained, the parties shall establish an agency-type
relationship or other similar arrangement reasonably satisfactory to the
Sellers and the Purchaser under which (i) the Purchaser is provided with such
rights and benefits under such Retained Contracts as will not result in a
violation or breach of, or constitute a default under, applicable Law or the
terms of such Retained Contracts, including enforcement by the Sellers for
the account of the Purchaser of any and all rights and benefits of the Sellers
under such Retained Contracts, and (ii) as between the Purchaser and the
Sellers, the Purchaser shall assume all obligations of the Sellers under such
Retained Contracts, and all liabilities for the failure to perform such
obligations, to the extent such obligations relate to and are required to be
performed during periods after the Closing, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser will (A) be responsible, as a
subcontractor or service provider to the Sellers, for the completion of any
work or provision of any goods or services thereunder to be performed or
provided after the Closing, (B) bear all Taxes (if any) imposed or levied
solely with respect thereto or arising therefrom and (C) be responsible for
any breach of warranty for goods or services provided by the Purchaser
thereunder or any related repurchase, indemnity or service obligations owed
to the third-party contract party under any such Retained Contract arising out
of Purchasers performance thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, if, as a condition to the assignment of any
Retained Contract, the counterparty thereto requests a parent guaranty by the
Parent of the obligations that would be assumed by the Purchaser and the
Parent refuses to provide such guaranty, then the applicable Seller may,
after sixty (60) days following the later of (i) the Closing Date or (ii) the
date upon which the counterparty requests a parent guaranty, terminate such
Retained Contract if and to the extent permitted under the terms thereof
(without the payment of any penalty or termination fee). The Sellers shall not
be required to exercise any options to extend or renew the term of any
Retained Contracts.

 

SECTION 1.04. _Purchase Price_. __

The consideration to be paid by the Purchaser to the Sellers in consideration
of the sale, conveyance, assignment, transfer and delivery of the Assets shall
be (a) cash in the amount of $445,600,000 (the " _Base Price_ "), as adjusted
pursuant to _Section 1.05_ (the " _Purchase Price_ ") plus (b) the assumption
by the Purchaser of the Assumed Liabilities.

 

SECTION 1.05. _Working Capital Adjustment_.

(a) The following preliminary adjustment to the Purchase Price in respect of
Net Working Capital shall be made at the Closing:

 

(i) No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Lafarge
shall prepare and deliver to the Parent a certificate of the Chief Financial
Officer of Lafarge (the " _Initial CFO Certificate_ ") setting forth an
estimated calculation of the Net

 



-9-   Working Capital as of the Closing Date prepared in accordance with the
Working Capital Principles (" _Estimated Working Capital_ "), together with
reasonable supporting documentation. Thereafter, at the request of the
Parent, Lafarge shall give the Parent reasonable access during normal business
hours to the Books and Records and any other books and records of the Sellers
that relate to the Business that are relevant to the calculation of the
Estimated Working Capital. In addition, the Sellers shall make representatives
of the Sellers reasonably available to answer questions with respect to the
calculation of the Estimated Working Capital. The Sellers and the Parent
shall cooperate in good faith and endeavor to resolve any disputes regarding
the calculation of the Estimated Working Capital. If the parties agree to any
changes to the Estimated Working Capital, the term "Estimated
Working Capital" as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to reflect such
changes.

(ii) At the Closing, (A) if Estimated Working Capital is less than
$31,500,000, then an amount equal to the difference between the Estimated
Working Capital and $31,500,000 shall be subtracted from the Base Price and
(B) if Estimated Working Capital is greater than $31,500,000, then an amount
equal to the difference between $31,500,000 and the Estimated Working Capital
shall be added to the Base Price.

(b) The following final adjustment to the Purchase Price in respect of Net
Working Capital shall be made after the Closing:

 

(i) No later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the Parent shall
prepare and deliver to Lafarge a certificate of the Chief Financial Officer
of the Parent (the " _Final CFO Certificate_ ") setting forth a proposed
calculation of Net Working Capital for purposes of the final adjustment
contemplated by this _Section 1.05(b)_ (" _Final Working Capital"_ )
prepared in accordance with the Working Capital Principles, together with
reasonable supporting documentation. Thereafter, at the request of either
Lafarge or the Parent, the other party shall give Lafarge or the Parent (as
the case may be) access during normal business hours to the Books and Records
and the other books and records of the Sellers relating to the Business that
are relevant to the calculation of Final Working Capital (it being understood
that the obligations of Lafarge pursuant to this sentence shall be limited to
providing access to any books and records retained by it pursuant to this
Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement). In addition, the Parent shall
make its representatives reasonably available to answer questions with
respect to the calculation of the Final Working Capital.

(ii) Lafarge shall be entitled to dispute the calculation of the Final Working
Capital set forth in the Final CFO Certificate if it delivers a written notice
(an " _Objection Notice_ ") to the Parent within sixty (60) days after
delivery of the Final CFO Certificate (the " _Objection Period_ ") in which it
objects to the calculation by the Parent of the Final Working Capital. The
Objection Notice shall contain a reasonably detailed description of any
changes that Lafarge proposes to be made to the calculation of Final Working
Capital set forth in the CFO Certificate. If Lafarge does not deliver an
Objection Notice to the Parent within the Objection Period, Lafarge shall not
be entitled to dispute the calculation of Final Working Capital set forth in
the Final CFO Certificate, which shall be final and binding on each of the
parties.

 



-10-  (iii) If Lafarge delivers an Objection Notice to the Parent within
the Objection Period, the Parent and Lafarge shall attempt in good faith to
agree upon the amount of the Final Working Capital during the period
commencing on the date of delivery of the Objection Notice and ending 30 days
thereafter (the " _Negotiation Period_ "). If the Parent and Lafarge agree in
writing on the Final Working Capital (whether such amounts are the same as or
different from the amounts set forth in the Final CFO Certificate) during the
Negotiation Period, the Final Working Capital shall be the amounts agreed
upon by the parties.

(iv) If the Parent and Lafarge do not agree in writing on the Final Working
Capital prior to the expiration of the Negotiation Period, each party shall
submit to the other, not later than ten days after the end of the Negotiation
Period, a statement containing its calculation of the items in dispute (each,
an " _Arbiter Statement_ "), which shall include only those items set forth in
the Objection Notice that remain in dispute at the expiration of the
Negotiation Period, to KPMG LLP or, if such firm declines to serve as
accounting arbiter or the parties agree in writing not to engage such firm,
such other firm of independent public accountants mutually agreed upon by the
Parent and Lafarge (in either case, the " _Accounting Arbiter_ "), which firm
shall make a final and binding determination as to all matters in dispute as
promptly as practicable after its appointment. In determining the proper
amount of the Final Working Capital, the Accounting Arbiter shall be bound by
the terms of this _Section 1.05_ and may not increase the amount of any item
in dispute above the highest amount set forth in the Arbiter Statements nor
decrease any such amount below the lowest amount set forth in the
Arbiter Statements. The Accounting Arbiter shall send its written
determination of the Final Working Capital, to the Parent and Lafarge, and
such determination and calculation shall be final and binding on the parties,
absent fraud or manifest error. The fees and expenses of the Accounting
Arbiter shall be borne by Lafarge and the Parent in inverse proportion to the
dollar amount of the items in dispute set forth in the Arbiter Statements as
to which such party prevails in the accounting arbitration, which
proportionate allocations shall also be determined by the Accounting Arbiter
at the time it renders its determination on the merits of the matters in
dispute. The Accounting Arbiter may not award damages, interest or penalties
to any party with respect to any matter.

(v) No later than five (5) days after a final and binding determination of
the Final Working Capital has been made in accordance with the applicable
provisions of this _Section 1.05(b)_, (A) if the Purchase Price is greater
than the Base Price, as adjusted pursuant to  _Section 1.05(a)_, then the
Purchaser shall make a payment equal to such difference in immediately
available funds to such account or accounts as is designated in writing by
Lafarge (it being agreed that Lafarge shall be entitled to direct that such
payment be divided between Lafarge, on the one hand, and the other Sellers, on
the other hand) or (B) if the Base Price, as adjusted pursuant to _Section
1.05(a)_, is less than the Purchase Price, then Lafarge and the Sellers shall
make payments in an aggregate amount (to be divided between Lafarge, on the
one hand, and the other Sellers, on the other hand, in such proportions as
Lafarge shall direct) equal to such difference in immediately available funds
to such account or accounts as is designated in writing by the Parent.

 



-11-  SECTION 1.06. _Purchase Price Allocation_.

 

(a) The parties agree that the Purchase Price (adjusted to reflect the
"purchase price" for U.S. federal, state and local tax purposes) shall be
allocated among the Assets and among the Sellers in accordance with an
allocation prepared in compliance with Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Allocation_ "). No later
than 90 days after the Closing Date, the Parent shall deliver a proposed
Allocation to Lafarge, prepared in good faith and in accordance with
applicable Law. Thereafter, at the request of Lafarge, the Parent shall give
Lafarge reasonable access during normal business hours to the books and
records of the Business relevant to the Allocation. In addition,
representatives of the Parent will be reasonably available to answer questions
with respect to the Allocation.

 

(b) If Lafarge has any objections to the proposed Allocation, Lafarge shall
notify the Purchaser in writing of such objections (the " _Allocation
Objections_ ") no later than forty-five (45) days after delivery of the
proposed Allocation. The Allocation Objections, if any, shall set forth in
reasonable detail the basis for any disagreement with the proposed Allocation
prepared by the Parent. If Lafarge does not deliver Allocation Objections to
the Parent by the date specified above, the proposed Allocation delivered by
the Parent to Lafarge shall be final and binding on each of the parties.

 

(c) Upon delivery of the Allocation Objections, the Parent and Lafarge shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve all items in dispute with
respect to the Allocation. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
upon delivery of the Allocation Objections, each of the Parent and Lafarge
shall promptly (but in no event later than five days after delivery of
such objections) designate a senior financial officer of such party to
participate in discussions regarding the Allocation with a senior financial
officer of the other party. Thereafter, the Parent and Lafarge shall cause the
senior financial officers designated by them to meet one or more times (as
necessary under the circumstances) to resolve any differences between the
parties with respect to the Allocation Objections. If the Parent and Lafarge
agree in writing upon the items in dispute within forty (40) days after
delivery of the Allocation Objections, the agreement reached by the parties as
to the Allocation shall be final and binding on the parties. If the Parent and
Lafarge are unable to resolve all items in dispute within forty (40) days
after delivery of the Allocation Objections, each party shall be permitted to
adopt its own position with regard to the Allocation, and neither party shall
have any further obligations to the other with respect to the Allocation
of the Purchase Price among the Assets for Tax purposes.

(d) If the Allocation (as revised by agreement of the parties, if applicable)
becomes final and binding in accordance with the provisions of _Section
1.06(b)_ or _Section 1.06(c)_ (the " _Final Allocation_ "), then (i) the
parties shall follow the Final Allocation for all relevant Tax purposes
(including the filing of any Tax Return), (ii) any subsequent

 



-12-  adjustments to the "purchase price" (as determined for U.S. federal, state or
local law purposes, including to reflect the Final Working Capital determined
pursuant to _Section 1.05_) shall be reflected in the Final Allocation in a
manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury regulations
promulgated thereunder, (iii) the transactions contemplated in this Agreement
shall be reported in a manner consistent with the Final Allocation, and none
of the parties shall, except as required pursuant to a "determination" within
the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any comparable provision of
any state or local law), take any position inconsistent therewith in any Tax
Return, in any refund claim, in any Legal Proceeding, or otherwise, and (iv)
the Sellers, on the one hand, and the Purchaser and the Parent, on the other
hand, (A) shall prepare mutually acceptable and substantially identical IRS
Forms 8594 (and other similar Tax Returns), (B) shall furnish the other with a
copy of such forms within a reasonable period before its filing due date, (C)
shall notify each other and cooperate in case of an audit or other
investigation or dispute with respect to the Final Allocation or the treatment
provided in _Section 8.04(c)_, and (D) shall cooperate and provide the
others promptly with any other information required to complete Form 8594 or
any other applicable Tax Return.

SECTION 1.07. _Receivables Settlement_. __

Within thirty (30) days after the determination of Final Working Capital in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 1.05(b)_ (or, if such
determination is not made within 180 days after the Closing, within five (5)
days after such determination is made), the Parent shall deliver a written
notice to Lafarge (a) identifying any Receivables included in the Final
Working Capital that (i) as of the Closing Date, were aged (180) days or more
from the due date and (ii) the Parent elects in its sole discretion to
require the Sellers to repurchase in accordance with the terms of this
_Section 1.07_ (such trade account receivables being hereinafter referred to
as the " _Repurchased Receivables_ ") and (b) certifying that the Parent and
the Purchaser used reasonable best efforts to collect the Repurchased
Receivable during the period from and after the Closing until delivery of such
notice. Within thirty (30) days after delivery of such notice to Lafarge, (i)
the Purchaser shall transfer to Lafarge, and Lafarge shall acquire and accept
from the Purchaser, the Repurchased Receivables and (ii) Lafarge shall pay to
the Purchaser an amount in cash equal to the excess, if any, of (a) the
aggregate amount of the Repurchased Receivables, less any amount previously
collected in respect thereof by the Purchaser from the obligor thereon, over
(b) the reserve or allowance applicable to such Receivables in the
calculation of Final Working Capital.

provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(A) nothing herein shall require the Sellers to disclose any information if

the Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make alternative
arrangements to provide or make available such information to the Parent and
the Purchaser (or their respective attorneys, accountants and other advisors
and representatives) in a manner that would not jeopardize any such
privilege.

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.02(a)_, during the period

efforts to 

 



-46-   cooperate with the Purchaser and the Title Company in connection with the

record a satisfaction, discharge or release of any Encumbrance that

in any material respect with the operation of the Assets or the conduct of
the Business or with any other business of a Seller or, if applicable, the
business of any of the tenants of such Seller conducted at the Real Property,
or disturb in any material respect the use or occupancy of a Seller or any of
its tenants; or (ii) damage the Real Property. The Purchaser shall schedule
and coordinate all access with the Seller Representative and shall give such
Seller at least one (1) Business Day written notice prior to accessing the

at all times when the Purchaser is exercising its rights to access hereunder.
The Purchaser agrees to pay to the applicable Seller within twenty (20)
Business Days of each Sellers written request the actual cost of repairing
and restoring any damage which the Purchaser or any of its employees, agents,
contractors or other representatives shall cause to the Real Property or
any property of a Seller or any of a Sellers employees, agents, contractors
or representatives located thereon prior to the Closing. All assessment fees,

relates to the Assets, with any Environmental Laws that were not provided to
the Seller prior to the date of this Agreement. At or prior to Closing, the

applicable Law, an appropriate response in compliance with such request, after
consultation with the other parties.

(c) In addition to and without limiting any of the other covenants of the
parties contained in this _Section 5.03_, the parties shall (i) make the
filings required to be made by them (or their "ultimate parent entities")
with the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the Department of
Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the date of this Agreement, (ii) comply, at the earliest practicable date,
with any request for additional information or documentary material received

cooperate with each other in connection with any filing under the HSR Act or
any other Antitrust Laws and with a view to resolving any investigation,
inquiry or objection concerning the transactions contemplated hereby commenced

the Sellers. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Parent
shall not agree to any amendment, supplement or other modification of, or

of the Purchase Price to an amount less than the Minimum Available Credit or
(ii) modify the conditions to the making of borrowings under the Parent Credit

more successful Other Parent Offerings, it being expressly agreed and
acknowledged by each of the parties that the obligations of the Parent and the

SAS 72 (as amended) including standard negative assurance on any Unaudited
Financial Statements it being understood that the Sellers shall have
satisfied their respective obligations set forth in subclauses (i) through
(vi) of this sentence if the Sellers shall have used their reasonable best
efforts to comply with such obligations whether or not any applicable
deliverables are actually obtained or provided. The Parent shall, promptly
upon request by any of the Sellers, reimburse the Sellers for all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Sellers or their advisors

the Sellers set forth in this _Section 5.04(c)_.

effect:

it with sufficient funds for purposes of financing the payment of the
Purchase Price, if any of them shall become aware of any information that
would cause any of the Seller Information to be false or misleading with
respect to any material fact, it shall promptly inform the Parent in writing,
and the Parent shall thereupon use its reasonable best efforts to promptly
amend or supplement the Prospectus Supplement or other applicable Offering
Documentation to correct the applicable misstatement or omission. Except as
specifically provided herein, the Sellers shall not have any liability or
responsibility to the Parent or the Purchaser for the accuracy and
completeness of any Seller Information. Furthermore, the Parent shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Sellers, their Affiliates and any of
their respective directors, officers, employees, advisors and representatives
from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by them as a result
of or based upon any Third Party Claim or any finding or determination in a
Legal Proceeding that any statements included in the Prospectus Supplement or
any other Offering Documentation are false or misleading with respect to any
material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make
the statements therein not false or misleading, except to the extent that the
relevant misstatement or omission is based directly upon the Seller
Information that was knowingly false when provided by the Seller.

 

SECTION 5.05. _Exclusivity_.

During the period from the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date,
neither the Sellers nor any of their Affiliates shall, and each shall take all

or knowingly encourage, or knowingly take any other action to facilitate, any
proposal or offer relating to a transaction involving an acquisition of the
Business or a substantial portion thereof (whether in the form of a merger,

could reasonably be expect to lead to a Competing Proposal or (ii) enter into,
continue or otherwise participate in any discussions, negotiation or
agreements (whether or not legally binding) regarding, or furnish to any
Person (other than the Parent or the Purchaser) any information with respect
to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any Competing Proposal. In
addition, each of the Sellers shall promptly (but in any event within twenty-
four hours) advise the Parent orally and in writing of the receipt of any
Competing Proposal or of any inquiry or request for information that such
parties believe could lead to or contemplates a Competing Proposal.

-52-  (c) The breach by any party of this _Section 5.06_ shall not be deemed to be

representation or warranty of such party whose subject matter is most similar
to that of the fact, event or circumstance described herein giving rise to the
notification obligations provided for in _Section 5.06(a)_ and _(b)_ above.

SECTION 5.07. _Risk of Loss; Casualty Loss_.

(a) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, any of the Real
Property, Improvements on any Real Property or Tangible Personal Property
included in the Assets shall be destroyed or damaged in whole or in part by

Seller agrees, jointly and severally, to either (i) repair, at Sellers
expense, the damage prior to the Closing or (ii) assign to the Purchaser at
Closing all insurance claims and proceeds payable to any Seller as a result of

(b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, any condemnation

pay over to the Purchaser all amounts theretofore received by any Seller (net
of any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses) in connection with such
condemnation.

SECTION 5.08. _Tax Matters_. 

(a) The Sellers shall be liable for and shall pay to discharge when due (i)
all Taxes relating to the direct or indirect ownership or operation of the
Business or the Assets (including any Taxes payable under the Sugar Creek
Lease) which are attributable to any taxable period or portion thereof ending
on or before the Closing Date, (ii) one-half of all transfer Taxes, sales and
use Taxes, goods and services, value added and similar Taxes, and withholding
Taxes, if any, imposed as a result of the sale or transfer of the Assets and
the Business pursuant to this Agreement, and (iii) all income, franchise or
similar Taxes imposed on any of the Sellers (and any consolidated, combined,
or unitary group of which any of the Sellers are a member) on account of the
sale, conveyance, assignment, transfer or delivery of the Assets and the
Business pursuant to this Agreement; but in each case, only to the extent the
amount of such Taxes exceed the amount, if any, accrued for such Taxes and
taken into account when computing Final Working Capital.

 

(b) The Purchaser shall be liable for and shall pay and discharge when due (i)
all Taxes relating to the direct or indirect ownership or operation of the
Business or the Assets (including any Taxes payable under the Sugar Creek
Lease) which are attributable to any taxable period or portion thereof that
begins after the Closing Date and (ii) one-half of all transfer Taxes, sales
and use Taxes, goods and services, value added and similar Taxes, and
withholding Taxes, if any, imposed as a result of the sale or transfer of the
Assets and the Business pursuant to this Agreement. The Purchaser shall cause
to be prepared and duly filed all Tax Returns required to be filed with
respect to any Taxes described in this _Section 5.08(b)_.

 



-53-  (c) With respect to Taxes relating to the direct or indirect ownership or
operation of the Business or the Assets which are attributable to a taxable
period that begins on or before the Closing Date and ends after the Closing
Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "): (i) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on,
or are based in whole or in part on, income, gross receipts, operations or
payroll (such as income and franchise Taxes, payroll Taxes, and sales and use,
value added, and goods and services Taxes), the portion of such Taxes which is
attributable to the portion of such taxable period ending on or before the
Closing Date shall be determined by closing the books of the Business as of
the end of the Closing Date (and for such purpose, any exemption, deduction,
credit or other item that is calculated on an annual basis shall be allocated
to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date on a pro rata
basis determined by multiplying the entire amount of such item allocated to
the Straddle Period by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
Straddle Period); and (ii) in the case of property Taxes, ad valorem Taxes,
and other Taxes imposed on a periodic basis that are not described in
subclause (i) of this _Section 5.08(c)_, the portion of any such Tax that is
attributable to the portion of the period ending on or before the Closing Date
shall be considered to equal the amount of such Taxes for such taxable
period, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
in the portion of such taxable period that ends on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire taxable period
(provided, however, that if the Tax is based on a valuation that pertains to a
Tax period other than that in which the Closing Date occurs, such proration
shall be recalculated at such time as actual Tax bills for such period are
available and the parties shall cooperate with each other in all respects in
connection with such recalculation and pay any sums due in consequence thereof
to the party entitled to recover the same). For purposes hereof, Taxes
attributable to any period or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing
Date shall include Taxes based in whole or in part on income, gain, or
receipts that accrue or are received on or before the Closing Date, payroll
Taxes attributable to compensation for services performed prior to the
Closing Date, sales, use, value added, goods and services and similar Taxes
imposed on sales or gross receipts that accrue or are received prior to the
Closing Date, and Taxes attributable to the ownership of property during
period on to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
shall the Purchaser be liable for any Taxes described in subclause (i) of this
_Section 5.08(c)_ that are imposed upon and payable by any of the Sellers
(or any consolidated, combined or unitary group of which any of the Sellers is
a member). The Purchaser shall cause to be prepared and duly filed all Tax
Returns required to be filed with respect to any Taxes described in this 
_Section 5.08(c)_ and not described in the immediately preceding sentence
(the " _Straddle Period Return_ "). Such Tax Returns shall be true, correct
and accurate. For each Straddle Period Return, the Purchaser shall deliver to
the Sellers, for their review and comment no less than forty-five (45) days
prior to the applicable filing deadline (taking into account applicable
extensions), a copy of the draft return (with copies of any relevant
schedules, work papers and other documentation then available). At least
thirty (30) days prior to the due date for the filing of such return
(including extensions), the Sellers shall notify the Purchaser in writing of
any objections to any items set forth on such returns and the parties shall
address these objections in accordance with _Section 5.08(h)_.

 



-54-  (d) Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, to the extent any refunds
or credits with respect to Taxes paid with respect to the Assets or the
Business are attributable to taxable years or a portion thereof ending before
the Closing Date, such refunds or credits, less Purchasers reasonable
expenses of obtaining such refunds or credits, shall belong to the Seller
that operated the relevant Asset or portion of the Business (provided that the
Purchaser shall pay over such refund, less such expenses, to the party
identified by Lafarge). Except as provided in the immediately preceding
sentence, to the extent that any refunds or credits with respect to Taxes paid
with respect to the Assets or the Business are attributable to taxable years
or a portion thereof commencing on or after the Closing Date, such refunds or
credits, less the Sellers reasonable expenses of obtaining such refunds or
credits, shall belong to the Purchaser. The Sellers and the Purchaser shall
equitably apportion any refund or credit, net of expenses of obtaining
such refunds or credits, with respect to Taxes for any Straddle Period in a
manner consistent with the principles set forth in _Section 5.08(c)_.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.08(d)_ to the contrary, refunds
or credits, less the Sellers reasonable expenses of obtaining such refunds
or credits, with respect to Taxes paid with respect to the Assets or the
Business shall belong to the Purchaser if (and to the extent) such refunds or
credits were taken into account when computing the Final Working Capital. The
Purchaser shall forward to the Sellers or reimburse the Sellers for the amount
of such refunds or credits belonging to the Sellers under this _Section
5.08(d)_ within thirty (30) Business Days from receipt thereof by the
Purchaser (provided that, for such purpose, a credit shall be deemed received
on the due date for the Taxes it is actually applied against). The Sellers
shall forward to the Purchaser or reimburse the Purchaser for the amount of
any refunds or credits belonging to the Purchaser under this _Section 5.08(d)
_within thirty (30) Business Days from receipt thereof by the Sellers
(provided that, for such purpose, a credit shall be deemed received on the
due date for the Taxes it is actually applied against).

(e) Without the review and consent of the Sellers (which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), none of the Purchaser, the
Parent nor any of their Affiliates shall file or make a formal or informal
claim for refund or file any amended Tax Returns attributable to the Business
or the Assets for any taxable years or periods ending before the Closing Date
or for a Straddle Period.

(f) On and after the Closing Date, each of the Sellers and the Purchaser
shall:

(i) use commercially reasonable efforts (x) to cooperate fully in preparing
for any audits of, or disputes with Governmental Authorities regarding, any
Tax Returns relating to the Assets or the Business, (y) to cooperate fully to
obtain refunds or credits with respect to Taxes paid with respect to the
Assets or the Business and (z) make available to the other and to any
Governmental Authority as reasonably requested all information, records, and
documents relating to liabilities for Taxes associated with the Business or
the Assets as set forth in this Agreement, at the expense of the requesting
party;

 



-55-  (ii) make available to the requesting party (at the expense of the requesting
party), as reasonably requested and available, personnel responsible for
preparing or maintaining information, records and documents in connection with
Taxes as well as any related litigation; and

 

(iii) preserve all such information, records, and documents until the
expiration of any applicable statutes of limitation or extensions thereof and
as otherwise required by Law.

(g) Tax Claims.

 

(i) In case of any claim, audit, investigation, court proceeding or other
dispute with respect to any Tax matter that affects the Business or the
Assets (a " _Tax Claim_ ") which, if successful, might result in an indemnity
payment under _Article VIII_ , the indemnified party shall notify the
indemnifying party of such claim no later than ten (10) Business Days after
written notice of such Tax Claim is received by the indemnified party;
_provided, however_ , that the failure to provide timely notice shall not
affect the indemnified partys right to indemnification hereunder except to
the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced thereby.

(ii) With respect to any Tax Claim relating to (A) Taxes attributable to (1)
the Excluded Assets for any and all periods or (2) the Business or the Assets,
in each case, for any and all periods ending before the Closing Date; or (B)
any other Taxes for which the Sellers might be entirely liable, the Sellers
shall have the right (but not the duty) to control any resulting proceedings
and to determine whether and when to settle any such claim, assessment, or
dispute.

 

(iii) The Sellers on the one hand and the Purchaser on the other hand shall
jointly control and participate in all proceedings in connection with (A) any
Tax Claim relating to Taxes for any Straddle Period and (B) any Tax Claim
which may result in a liability both for the Sellers and the Purchaser. The
costs incurred by the Sellers and the Purchaser in connection with such
proceedings shall be borne by the Sellers and the Purchaser in proportion to
their liability for the Taxes asserted in the Tax Claim. Neither the Sellers
nor the Purchaser shall settle or compromise any such Tax Claim without the
prior written consent of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(iv) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 5.08_, the Purchaser shall
control all proceedings with respect to Tax Claims attributable to the
Business and the Assets for any taxable year or period beginning on or after
the Closing Date.

(v) This _Section 5.08_ (and not  _Section 8.04_) shall govern with respect
to any Tax matter.

(h) If the Sellers and the Purchaser disagree as to the amount of Taxes for
which each is liable under this Agreement, the Sellers and the Purchaser shall
promptly consult each other in an effort to resolve such dispute. If any such
dispute cannot be resolved within fifteen (15) days after the initial date of
consultation, then each party shall

 



-56-  deliver simultaneously to the Accounting Arbiter such work papers and other
reports and information relating to the disputed matter(s) as the Accounting
Arbiter may request and shall be afforded the opportunity to discuss the
disputed matter(s) with the Accounting Arbiter. The Accounting Arbiter shall
have thirty (30) days to carry out its review and prepare a written statement
of its determination regarding the disputed matter(s) (including a statement
regarding the Accounting Arbiters determination of the prevailing party in
any such disputed matter that provides the Accounting Arbiters reasons for
and an explanation of such determination), which determination shall be final
and binding upon the parties. Any fees and expenses of the Accounting Arbiter
incurred in resolving the disputed matter(s) shall be borne equally by the
parties; _provided, however_ , that a party shall bear all of the costs of
such resolution if the Accounting Arbiter determines that such partys
position was in bad faith or without merit.

 

SECTION 5.09. _Proration of Certain Amounts and Utilities_.

 

(a) The parties agree to prorate as of 11:59 p.m. Central Standard Time on the
day of the Closing (the " _Effective Time_ ") any utilities, expenses and
other items (other than (i) the allocation and proration of Taxes provided for
in _Section 5.08_ and (ii) any amounts to be reflected in Net Working Capital
pursuant to the Working Capital Principles) that are customarily prorated in
connection with transactions similar to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including operating expenses payable by the owner of the Assets and
rent paid pursuant to the Leases for the Leased Real Property (collectively,
the " _Proration Items_ "). Proration Items attributable to the period prior
to the Effective Time will be for the account of the Sellers and Proration
Items attributable to the period after the Effective Time will be for the
account of the Purchaser and each party will be responsible for the payment of
its prorated share of the Proration Items. If the actual amounts of the
Proration Items are not known as of the Effective Time, the prorations will
be made at Closing on the basis of the best evidence then available;
thereafter, when the actual amount of any such Proration Item is received (and
in no event later than 30 days after the receipt of such amount), a re-
proration will be made on the basis of the actual amount and the parties
shall reimburse each other accordingly.

(b) Promptly after the Closing (but in any event, no later than 30 days
thereafter), the Purchaser shall notify all relevant utilities that the name
of the Purchaser (or the name of an Affiliate of the Purchaser designated by
it) should replace the name of the Sellers on all utility bills and that the
Purchaser or such designee will be responsible for payment of all utility
bills going forward.

SECTION 5.10.  _Certain Employee Matters_.

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall update the list of the Employees
as disclosed on  _Schedule 5.10(a)_ hereto to reflect new hires and
terminations of employment between the date of this Agreement and November 2,
2012.

(b) Prior to or on November 16, 2012, the Purchaser or an Affiliate thereof
(each a " _Purchaser Benefit Party_ ," and collectively, " _Purchaser Benefit
Parties_ ") shall make offers of employment in writing to the Employees who
are set forth on the list

 



-57-  described in _Section 5.10(a)_, which offers shall be for employment with the
Purchaser or a Purchaser Benefit Party commencing on the applicable Employee
Commencement Effective Time and otherwise on the terms and conditions set
forth in this _Section 5.10_. Each such Employee shall have five (5) Business
Days from the receipt of such an offer to accept. Neither the Sellers nor any
of its Affiliates (each a " _Seller Benefit Party_ ," and collectively, "
_Seller Benefit Parties_ ") shall induce or otherwise attempt to influence any
such Employee to resign or to not accept his or her offer of employment from
the Purchaser. Each Employee, who shall have accepted the Purchasers offer of
employment and who shall meet the Purchaser Benefit Parties conditions of
employment described in _Schedule 5.10(b)(i)_ hereto (the " _Purchaser
Employment Conditions_ ") shall be hired by the applicable Purchaser Benefit
Party, it being understood that (i) such Employee will thereafter become an
employee of such Purchaser Benefit Party (" _Purchaser Employee_ ") for
purposes of this _Section 5.10_ effective as of the applicable Employee
Commencement Effective Time and (ii) the parties hereto and their Affiliates
will cooperate in good faith to effect the hiring of any Employees set forth
on the list described in _Section 5.10(a)_, who (x) are absent from work due
to short or long-term disability or an authorized leave of absence and return
to work within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, and (y) shall
meet the Purchaser Employment Conditions (any such Employee, a " _Leave
Employee_ "). If any Employee requires a work permit or employment pass as
disclosed on  _Schedule 5.10(b)(ii)_ hereto for his or her employment with
the Purchaser or any of the Purchaser Benefit Parties, the Purchaser shall,
and shall cause the Purchaser Benefit Parties to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause any such permit or pass to be obtained and in effect prior
to the Employee Commencement Effective Time, and the Sellers shall, and shall
cause the Seller Benefit Parties to, take all reasonably necessary or
appropriate action at the Purchasers expense, as reasonably requested by the
Purchaser, to assist in obtaining any such permit or pass prior to the
Employee Commencement Effective Time.

(c) The Purchasers offers of employment to each Employee shall provide for
employment on the following terms and conditions, which terms and conditions
the Purchaser shall maintain or cause the applicable Purchaser Benefit Party
to maintain for each Purchaser Employee for at least twelve (12) months
following the Closing Date (or such shorter period as a Purchaser Employee is
employed by the Purchaser following the Closing Date): (i) employment in a
comparable position to the position such Employee held with the Sellers or
their Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii) the same or
greater base salary or rate of pay as in effect immediately prior to the
Closing Date, (iii) other compensation and employee benefits that are
substantially equivalent in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits
that are provided by Sellers and its Affiliates to such Employee immediately
prior to the Closing Date, and (iv) severance payments and benefits that are
substantially equivalent to the severance benefits provided to Employees under
Lafarge North America Inc. Severance Pay Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the terms and conditions of the Purchaser Employees who are covered by the
Labor Agreements (the " _Represented Employees_ ") shall be as set out in the
applicable Labor Agreement until such Labor Agreements expiration,
modification or termination in accordance with its terms or applicable Law.

 



-58-  (d) Prior to the Closing, the Sellers and the Purchaser shall cooperate and
the Purchaser shall take all action reasonably necessary in order for the
Purchaser to assume, effective for periods after the Closing, the Labor
Agreements; _provided_ , that the liabilities and obligations under the Labor
Agreements shall be assumed only to the extent that such liabilities and
obligations arise, relate to and are required to be performed during periods
after the Closing. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall the Purchaser Benefit Parties become responsible
for liabilities or other obligations under the Labor Agreements that arise or
otherwise relate to periods occurring prior to the Closing. The Purchaser
shall give written notice to the counterparties to the Labor
Agreements regarding Purchasers assumption of the Labor Agreements when and
as required by the Labor Agreements.

 

(e) As soon as practicable following the Closing, the Purchaser shall enter
into arrangements with the Multiemployer Plans described in _Schedule
5.10(e)_ hereto (" _Covered Multiemployer Plans_ ") to become a new
contributing employer therein with respect to the Business and effective for
periods on and after the Closing. With respect to the Covered Multiemployer
Plans, the parties acknowledge and agree that they do not intend for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to constitute a withdrawal from
the Covered Multiemployer Plans but instead intend to satisfy the
conditions set forth in Section 4204 of ERISA in respect of the Covered
Multiemployer Plans. In furtherance thereof, the parties agree that they will
cooperate in supplying information, documents and communications with the
Covered Multiemployer Plans involved, and that the Purchaser shall maintain,
for a period of five (5) plan years commencing with the first (1st) plan year
beginning after the Closing Date, either a bond issued by a corporate surety
company that is an acceptable surety for purposes of Section 412 of ERISA or
an amount held in escrow by a bank or similar financial institution,
satisfactory to such Covered Multiemployer Plan (as applicable, " _4204 Bond_
"), which bond or escrow will be paid to the applicable Covered Multiemployer
Plan if the Purchaser withdraws from the Covered Multiemployer Plan or fails
to make a contribution when due at any time during the first five (5) plan
years beginning after the Closing Date, in an amount equal to the greater of:

(i) the average annual contribution required to be made by the Sellers and
Seller Benefit Parties to the Covered Multiemployer Plan with respect to the
operations under the applicable Labor Agreement for the three (3) plan years
preceding the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs; and

(ii) the annual contribution that the Sellers and Seller Benefit Parties were
required to make to the Covered Multiemployer Plan with respect to the
operations under the applicable Labor Agreement for the last plan year prior
to the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs.

 

The Sellers acknowledge and agree that they will be secondarily liable to each
Covered Multiemployer Plan for withdrawal liability if the
Purchaser withdraws from either Covered Multiemployer Plan within five (5)
years and does not pay its withdrawal liability and any such withdrawal
liability shall be considered an Assumed Liability under this Agreement and
the Parent and the Purchaser shall indemnify the Sellers for any such
amounts.

 



-59-  The Sellers further acknowledge and agree that if the Purchaser (or its
Affiliate) incurs any withdrawal liability related to a Covered Multiemployer
Plan due to a Non-Purchaser Withdrawal Event (as defined below) and the 4204
Bond is to be paid to the Covered Multiemployer Plan due to such Non-Purchaser
Withdrawal Event, then the Sellers shall indemnify and promptly pay to the
Purchaser the 4204 Bond amount paid to the Covered Multiemployer Plan. For
purposes of this _Section 5.10(e)_, a " _Non-Purchaser Withdrawal Event_ "
means any event or action that triggers a withdrawal liability with respect
to a Covered Multiemployer Plan during the period that the 4204 Bond is
required other than due to the Purchasers (or its Affiliates) withdrawal
from the Covered Multiemployer Plan, which events or actions shall include,
but are not limited to, (i) a collective bargaining representatives
disclaimer of interest in representing the employees of the Purchaser (or its
Affiliate) who participate in the Covered Multiemployer Plan; (ii) a "mass
withdrawal," as defined in 29 Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) § 4001.2,
from the Covered Multiemployer Plan; (iii) a decertification of the collective
bargaining representative to which the Covered Multiemployer Plan relates; or
(iv) the termination of the Covered Multiemployer Plan pursuant to Sections
4041A(a) or 4042 of ERISA and any rules and regulations issued thereunder.

 

(f) As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, and
notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the parties shall
commence, and shall cooperate in connection with, the drafting of separate
plan documents and related contracts thereto that shall be substantially
similar to the Seller DB Retirement Plans described in _Schedule 5.10(f)_
hereto (the " _Mirror Plans_ "). Subject to this _Section 5.10(f)_, the
Mirror Plans shall provide benefits that are substantially identical to the
benefits provided immediately prior to the Closing to the Purchaser Employees
under the Seller DB Retirement Plans described in _Schedule 5.10(f)_ hereto,
it being understood that in no event shall the Mirror Plans be construed to
provide any duplication of benefits to the Purchaser Employees with respect to
any accrued benefits or other obligations to which the Purchaser Employees
are otherwise entitled under such Seller DB Retirement Plans. In furtherance
of the foregoing, the benefits to be provided to a Purchaser Employee under
the Mirror Plans shall be determined based on such Purchaser Employees total
service with the Sellers and Seller Benefit Parties and their respective
predecessors (to the extent required to be taken into account under the
applicable Seller DB Retirement Plans described in _Schedule 5.10(f)_ hereto)
and with the Purchaser and Purchaser Benefit parties, less the value of any
accrued benefits as of the Closing Date under the Seller DB Retirement Plans
(such accrued benefits frozen as of the Closing Date), with respect to each
such Purchaser Employee under such Seller DB Retirement Plans. As soon as
practicable following the Closing Date, each Mirror Plan shall be adopted by
one or more of the Purchaser Benefit Parties, and modified as necessary, as a
new employee benefit plan for the benefit of the applicable Purchaser
Employees who participated immediately prior to the Closing Date in the
applicable Seller DB Retirement Plans described in _Schedule 5.10(f)_ hereto.
For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding any provision herein to the
contrary, with respect to any Seller DB Retirement Plan that is not described
in _Schedule 5.10(f)_ hereto, the Seller Benefit Parties shall retain all
responsibility for all liabilities or other obligations under such Seller DB
Retirement Plan.

 



-60-  (g) The Sellers will be responsible for discharging all obligations in respect
of Employees under the WARN Act and similar applicable state or local Laws
for the notification of any "employment loss" within the meaning of the WARN
Act and similar applicable state or local Laws which occurs on or prior to the
Closing. The Purchaser will be responsible for discharging all obligations in
respect of the Purchaser Employees under the WARN Act and similar applicable
state or local Laws for the notification of any "employment loss" within the
meaning of the WARN Act and similar applicable state or local Laws which
occurs after the Closing. The Sellers will provide the Purchaser at Closing a
list of Employees whose employment has been involuntarily terminated or who
have been notified of their termination by Seller (other than as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) during the 90-day period
ending on the Closing Date.

(h) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date and with respect to the
Benefit Plans described in _Schedule 3.21(a)_ hereto that are qualified
defined contribution plans, the Purchaser and the Purchaser Benefit Parties
shall permit the Purchaser Employees to roll over their account balances and
outstanding loan balances, if any, thereunder into any applicable "eligible
retirement plan" within the meaning of Section 402(c)(8)(B) of the Code
maintained by a Purchaser Benefit Party thereof after the Closing, subject to
any restrictions on loan balance transfers under such plan.

(i) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
permit the Purchaser Employees, as well as dependents of such employees
(collectively, with the Purchaser Employees, the " _Affected Participants_ ")
to commence participation in the applicable employee benefit plans, programs
or policies, if any, maintained by the Purchaser Benefit Parties (each, a "
_Purchaser Plan_ "); _provided_ , that, with respect to the Purchaser Plans
that provide health benefits (i.e., medical, dental, prescription drug and
vision benefits) (the " _Purchaser Health Plans_ "), the Affected Participants
shall be permitted to commence participation in the Purchaser Health Plans on
the later of (i) January 1, 2013 and (ii) the Closing Date with respect to
periods occurring on and after such date. The Purchaser shall waive any
evidence of insurability, waiting period and preexisting condition
limitations with respect to the participation and coverage requirements under
the Purchaser Health Plans except to the extent that any limitations were in
effect immediately prior to the Closing Date under the analogous Benefit
Plan. In the event the parties waive any applicable conditions and the Closing
occurs after December 31, 2012, with respect to each Purchaser Health Plan,
the Purchaser shall honor any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket
maximums incurred by the Affected Participants under the health plans in
which they participated immediately prior to the Closing Date during the
portion of the calendar year prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any
deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums under Purchaser Health
Plans in the same plan year in which such deductibles, co-payments or out-of-
pocket maximums were incurred. With respect to each such Purchaser Plan, the
Purchaser shall cause each Purchaser Employee to receive full credit for such
Employees service with the Sellers and the Seller Benefit Parties and any of
their respective predecessors for purposes of eligibility, vesting and, to the
extent necessary under _Section 5.10(f)_, benefit accruals, under any
Purchaser Plans in which any such Purchaser Employee participates to the same
extent recognized by the Sellers and the Seller Benefit Parties immediately
prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service shall
not be recognized to the extent

 



-61-   that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits with respect
to the same period of service. It is also understood that, except as otherwise
provided herein, the Purchaser Benefit Parties reserve the right to change,
modify, discontinue or terminate any or all of its own welfare benefit plans
(including welfare benefit plans that are established pursuant to the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement) at any time following the
Closing Date.

(j) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if the Closing
occurs prior to December 1, 2012, Sellers shall provide the Purchaser
Employees with COBRA continuation coverage required under the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, or similar state Law ("
_COBRA_ ") through December 31, 2012, pursuant to the Transition Services
Agreement and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, subject in each case
to such Purchaser Employees timely election in accordance with applicable
Law. The Sellers shall provide the Purchaser Employees with information
regarding their entitlement to make, and the process for making, COBRA
elections, and the Purchaser shall provide reasonable assistance and
cooperation to the Sellers to the extent necessary to effectuate the parties
intentions in respect of this provision. The Purchaser shall reimburse the
Sellers, directly or indirectly, for all costs incurred by the Sellers in
connection with the provision of COBRA continuation coverage to Purchaser
Employees. During any calendar month in which a Purchaser Employee
participates in COBRA continuation coverage and pursuant to the Transition
Services Agreement, the Purchaser shall be responsible for paying with respect
to such Purchaser Employee one hundred two percent of monthly COBRA premiums
charged by the Sellers, net of the Employee Premium (the " _Purchaser COBRA
Premium_ ," and collectively the " _Purchaser COBRA Premiums_ "). For purposes
of this  _Section 5.10_, "Employee Premium" shall be equal to the employee
contribution payable by a Purchaser Employee to Sellers or Seller Benefit
Parties immediately prior to the Closing Date in connection with the
employees participation in Benefit Plans that provide health benefits (i.e.,
medical, dental, prescription drug and vision benefits). The Sellers or
Sellers service provider, Aetna, shall provide to the Purchaser a monthly
invoice for the Purchaser COBRA Premium in respect of all Purchaser Employees
participating in COBRA continuation coverage, and the Purchaser shall pay the
amounts stated in the invoice in full pursuant to the procedure set forth in
the Transition Services Agreement but in any event no later than thirty days
of the invoice being issued to an account designated by the Purchaser. After
information regarding payments of claims for eligible expenses incurred by
Purchaser Employees in connection with any medical, vision, dental and
prescription drug claims becomes available for the month in respect of which
the invoice for Purchaser COBRA Premiums has been issued, the Sellers or
Sellers service provider, Aetna, shall calculate, and shall provide to
the Purchaser a true-up invoice for, the COBRA True Up Amount (unless such
amount is zero), and the Purchaser shall pay the COBRA True Up Amount in full
pursuant to the procedure set forth in the Transition Services Agreement but
in any event no later than thirty days of the true-up invoice being issued to
an account designated by the Purchaser. For purposes of this _Section 5.10_,
the " _COBRA True-Up Amount_ " shall be, in respect of a calendar month, an
amount equal to the excess, if any, of all payments of claims for eligible
expenses incurred during such month by Purchaser Employees participating in
COBRA continuation coverage in connection with any medical, vision, dental and
prescription drug claims over the aggregate amount of Purchaser COBRA
Premiums for such month.

 



-62-  (k) Subject to the Transition Services Agreement, the Seller Benefit Parties
shall be solely responsible for offering and providing any COBRA continuation
coverage, with respect to any Employee (whether current, former or retired)
who experiences a qualifying event on or prior to the Closing without regard
to whether the coverage loss occurs before, on or after the Closing, and for
any Employee who does not become a Purchaser Employee and who experiences a
qualifying event after the Closing or who otherwise loses eligibility for
coverage in connection with the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser Benefit Parties shall
be solely responsible for offering and providing any COBRA continuation
coverage required with respect to any Purchaser Employee who experiences
a qualifying event after the Closing. "Qualify _i_ ng event" and
"continuation coverage" are as defined in Section 4980B of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder.

 

(l) The parties to this Agreement agree to furnish each other with such
information concerning employees and employee benefit plans, including, but
not limited to, copies of administrative service agreements and other
contracts that may relate to Seller DB Retirement Plans described in _Schedule
5.10(f)_ hereto and are reasonably requested by Seller (or if such
documents cannot be provided pursuant to their terms or the provision of such
documents would be impractical, information regarding the vendors who are
parties to such arrangements and the material terms thereof, to the extent
such information may be disclosed by Seller under applicable Law and the
terms of such arrangements), and to take all such other action, as is
necessary and appropriate to effect the transactions contemplated by this
_Section 5.10_, subject to any applicable restrictions under the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and other
federal and state privacy Laws. Where any required information is in the
possession of third parties controlled by a Seller Benefit Party, such as
insurers or trustees, the Seller Benefit Parties shall use reasonable efforts
to cause those third parties to cooperate in providing any such information to
the Purchaser or Purchaser Benefit Party. The parties will reasonably
cooperate with respect to any communications to Employees regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Purchaser will provide the
Sellers with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
communications intended for the Employees (including regarding its offers of
employment) that it desires to send to Employees prior to the Closing Date.

(m) The Sellers shall be, or shall cause the Seller Benefit Parties to be,
responsible, either directly or through insurance policies maintained by the
Sellers or the Seller Benefit Parties, for all (i) medical, vision, dental and
prescription drug claims for eligible expenses incurred by any Purchaser
Employee or his or her dependents (x) during the month in which the Closing
Date occurs, if the Closing occurs in November 2012 or December 2012 or (y)
prior to the applicable Employee Commencement Effective Time, if the parties
waive any applicable conditions and the Closing occurs after December 31,
2012, (ii) claims for short-term and long-term disability income benefits
incurred by any Purchaser Employee prior to the applicable Employee
Commencement Effective Time, and (iii) claims for group life, travel and
accident, and accidental death and

 



-63-   dismemberment insurance benefits incurred by any Purchaser Employee prior to
the applicable Employee Commencement Effective Time; _provided_ that if the
Closing occurs in November 2012 or December 2012, the Purchaser shall
promptly reimburse the Seller for the amounts equal to the eligible expenses
incurred by Purchaser Employees in connection with any medical, vision, dental
and prescription drug claims arising from the Closing Date through the end of
the month in which the Closing occurs (net of pro rata portion of aggregate
Employee Premiums) upon the presentation by Seller of an invoice setting forth
its costs. The Purchaser shall be, or shall cause the Purchaser
Benefit Parties to be, responsible for all (A) medical, vision, dental and
prescription drug claims for eligible expenses incurred by any Purchaser
Employee or his or her dependents (x) during any month that follows the month
in which the Closing Date occurs, if the Closing occurs in November 2012 or
December 2012 (provided that any claims incurred by Purchaser Employees
participating in COBRA continuation coverage will be paid by the Sellers and
reimbursed by the Purchaser in accordance with _Section 5.10(j)_ of this
Agreement) or (y) after the applicable Employee Commencement Effective Time,
if the parties waive any applicable conditions and the Closing occurs after
December 31, 2012, (B) claims for short-term and long-term disability income
benefits incurred by any Purchaser Employee on or after the applicable
Employee Commencement Effective Time, and (C) claims for group life, travel
and accident, and accidental death and dismemberment insurance benefits
incurred by any Purchaser Employee on or after the applicable Employee
Commencement Effective Time. Except in the event of any claim for workers
compensation benefits, for purposes of this Agreement, the following claims
and liabilities shall be deemed to be incurred as follows: (i) medical,
vision, dental and/or prescription drug benefits (including hospital
expenses), upon provision of the services or supplies comprising any such
benefits; and (ii) short and long-term disability, life, accidental death and
dismemberment and business travel accident insurance benefits, upon the death,
illness, injury or accident giving rise to such benefits. The Sellers and the
Seller Benefit Parties shall be responsible for all claims for workers
compensation benefits that are incurred prior to the applicable Employee
Commencement Effective Time by any Purchaser Employee. The Purchaser and the
Purchaser Benefit Parties shall be responsible for all claims for workers
compensation benefits that are incurred on or after the applicable Employee
Commencement Effective Time by any Purchaser Employee. A claim for workers
compensation benefits shall be deemed to be incurred when the event giving
rise to the claim occurs.

(n) Lafarge hereby waives compliance by the Parent and the Purchaser with the
non-solicitation and other restrictions contained in Section 11 of that
certain letter agreement, dated July 2, 2011, between the Parent and Lafarge,
and Section 10 of the Confidentiality Agreement solely with respect to any
solicitation of or offers of employment made to the Employees in accordance
with the terms of this _Section 5.10_ in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(o) From and after the Closing Date, each Seller hereby waives any non-
competition obligations or any other restriction on the activities of any
Purchaser Employee that arise pursuant to any employment or other agreement
between any such employee and any Seller that would otherwise prevent or
restrict in any way such employee from at any time performing his or her
obligations or responsibilities (as they may exist from time to time as
determined by the Purchaser) to or for the Purchaser or its Affiliates.

 



-64-  (p) Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this _Section 5.10_, the
Purchaser shall be, and shall cause the Purchaser Benefit Parties to be,
responsible for any employment-related claims, liabilities or obligations to
the extent such claim, liabilities or obligations arise or otherwise relate to
periods occurring after the Closing, and the Sellers shall, and shall cause
the Seller Benefit Parties to, remain responsible for any and all employment-
related claims, liabilities or obligations to the extent such claim,
liabilities or obligations arise or otherwise relate to periods occurring
prior to the Closing.

(q) Purchaser shall assume the obligation to pay and shall pay, and shall
cause Purchaser Benefit Parties to pay, to the Purchaser Employees accrued
bonuses in respect of 2012 consistent with the principles of the Sellers
bonus program (as specified on _Schedule 5.10(q)_ hereto) and the calculation
of Net Working Capital pursuant to the Working Capital Principles.

(r) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this _Section 5.10_ with respect to employees are included for the sole
benefit of the respective parties hereto and shall not create any right (i) in
any other person, including any employees, former employees, any participant
in any Benefit Plan or Purchaser Plan or any beneficiary thereof or (ii) to
continued employment with any of the Seller Benefit Parties or Purchaser
Benefit Parties, or particular benefits or coverage in any Benefit Plan or
Purchaser Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, (A) the provisions of this
_Section 5.10_ shall not constitute an amendment to any Benefit Plan or
Purchaser Plan, and (B) in no event shall any employee, former employee, any
participant in any Benefit Plan or Purchaser Plan or any beneficiary thereof
or any other person described herein be a third party beneficiary for purposes
of this Agreement.

SECTION 5.11. _Industrial Revenue Bonds; Sugar Creek Lease_.

(a) During the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending on
the Closing Date, except as expressly permitted or required by any other

(i) the Sellers shall not, directly or indirectly, (A) redeem or tender any of
the Series B Bonds, (B) accept any amounts as a prepayment in full of the
principal balance owing to any of the Sellers in respect of the Series B Bonds
or (C) agree or commit to take the actions specified in subclause (A) or (B)
above;

 

(ii) the Sellers shall not, directly or indirectly, without the prior written
consent of the Purchaser (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or

take the actions specified in clause (A) above;

 

(iv) notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 5.08_, the Sellers shall
comply with the Sugar Creek Tax Compliance Agreement and shall not take any
action or permit any action to be taken that would adversely affect the
exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes of the interest on
the Series A Bonds and will take whatever action, or refrain from taking
whatever action, necessary to comply with the requirements of the Code to
maintain the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes of
the interest on the Series A Bonds, and the Sellers will pay or provide

Lafarge shall cooperate with the Parent in connection therewith) be fully
released and discharged from all Assumed Liabilities under the IRB Bond
Indenture, the Sugar Creek Guaranty, the Sugar Creek Lease and the Sugar Creek
Development Agreement (including by offering guarantees of all

from all such Assumed Liabilities, the parties shall use reasonable best
efforts to enter into reasonably satisfactory alternative arrangements
designed to limit the liability of Lafarge to all such Assumed Liabilities as
much as reasonably practicable.

SECTION 5.12. _Related Party Matters_. __

At or prior to the Closing, the Sellers will cause to be terminated any
Contract or other arrangement relating to the Business solely between or
among the Sellers or any of their Affiliates that would otherwise be binding
on or affect the Purchaser after the Closing and none of the Sellers, on the
one hand, nor the Parent or the Purchaser, on the other, will have any
obligations to the other thereunder. After the Closing, no services,
commitments or other arrangements existing prior to Closing between the
Business, on the one hand, and any other business of any Seller or any of
its Affiliates, on the other hand, will continue to be binding or effective.
Notwithstanding the previous sentences of this _Section 5.12_, the Sellers
shall not be required to terminate the National Contracts, which are Excluded
Assets. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 5.12_ does not apply to
the Ancillary Agreements.

 



-66-  SECTION 5.13. _Confidential Information_.

 

(a) Each of the Sellers hereby acknowledges that by reason of its ownership
and operation of the Business, it has acquired, and may acquire in connection
with the transactions and arrangements contemplated hereby, confidential or
proprietary information relating to the affairs, operations, assets,
liabilities, personnel, results of operations and financial condition of
the Business (" _Business Confidential Information_ "), and that the Parent
and the Purchaser may be irreparably damaged if at any time after the Closing
any Business Confidential Information possessed by any Seller or any of
its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, representatives or agents
were disclosed to or used by any Person other than the Purchaser, the Parent
or any of its their respective Affiliates. From and after the Closing, each
Seller covenants and agrees that it will not, and will not permit its
Affiliates to, and that it will use reasonable efforts to cause its officers,
directors, employees, representative and agents not to, use or disclose any
such Business Confidential Information without the prior written consent of
the Purchaser, except in the performance of the terms of the Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements, in the enforcement of its rights under the Agreement or
the Ancillary Agreements or with the prior written consent of the Purchaser.
The provisions of the prior sentence shall not apply to any portion of the
Business Confidential Information that (i) is or becomes generally known by
the public, other than as a result of a disclosure in breach of this 
_Section 5.13(a)_, (ii) is independently obtained on a non-confidential basis
after the Closing from sources that are not known by any of the Sellers to be
in violation of any legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation to the
Parent or the Purchaser with respect thereto or otherwise prohibited by Law,
contract or fiduciary duty from disclosing such information or (iii) is
independently developed after the Closing by the Sellers without the use of or
reference to any Business Confidential Information. If any Seller is
requested or required by any Governmental Authority to disclose any of such
Business Confidential Information, then such Seller will provide the Purchaser
with prompt written notice of such request or requirement. Each Seller shall
reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser, at the Purchasers expense, in
attempting to obtain any reasonable protective relief that the Purchaser
chooses to seek in its sole discretion; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that none
of the Sellers shall be obligated to undertake any Legal Proceeding. If after
the Purchaser has had a reasonable opportunity to seek such relief, the
Purchaser fails to obtain such relief, or if any Seller is compelled by Law
to disclose any Business Confidential Information, then the applicable Seller
may disclose only the portion of such Business Confidential Information which
its legal counsel advises it is legally compelled to disclose, and the
applicable Seller shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts, at the
Purchasers expense, to obtain assurances that the Business Confidential
Information will be accorded confidential treatment.

 

(b) The Purchaser hereby acknowledges that it may acquire, pursuant to the
rights granted in _Section 1.01(a)(xvii)_ or otherwise in connection with
the transactions and arrangements contemplated hereby, confidential or
proprietary information relating to the affairs, operations, assets,
liabilities, personnel, results of operations and financial condition of
the Sellers (such information, excluding all Business Confidential
Information, is referred to as the " _Seller Confidential Information_ ") and
that the Sellers may be irreparably damaged if at any time after the Closing
any Seller Confidential Information acquired by the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, officers, directors,

 



-67-   employees, representatives or agents were disclosed to or used by any Person
other than the Purchaser, the Parent or any of its their respective
Affiliates. From and after the Closing, the Purchaser covenants and agrees
that it will not, and will not permit its Affiliates to, and that it will use
reasonable efforts to cause its officers, directors, employees, representative
and agents not to, use or disclose any such Seller Confidential Information
without the prior written consent of Lafarge, except in the performance of the
terms of the Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, in the enforcement of its
rights under the Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or with the prior
written consent of Lafarge. The provisions of the prior sentence shall not
apply to any portion of the Seller Confidential Information that (i) is
already independently in the Purchasers or its Affiliates possession on
a non-confidential basis (to a third-party) at the time of disclosure
thereof, (ii) is or becomes generally known by the public, other than as a
result of a disclosure in breach of this _Section 5.13(b)_, (iii) is
independently obtained on a non-confidential basis after the Closing from
sources that are not known by the Purchaser to be in violation of any legal,
contractual or fiduciary obligation to the Sellers with respect thereto or
otherwise prohibited by Law, contract or fiduciary duty from disclosing such
information or (iv) is independently developed after the Closing by the
Purchaser or its Affiliates without the use of or reference to any Seller
Confidential Information. If the Purchaser is requested or required by any
Governmental Authority to disclose any of such Seller Confidential
Information, then the Purchaser will provide Lafarge with prompt written
notice of such request or requirement. The Purchaser shall reasonably
cooperate with the Sellers, at the Sellers expense, in attempting to obtain
any reasonable protective relief that the Sellers choose to seek in its sole
discretion; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser shall not be obligated
to undertake any Legal Proceeding. If after the Sellers have had a reasonable
opportunity to seek such relief, the Sellers fail to obtain such relief, or if
the Purchaser is compelled by Law to disclose any Seller Confidential
Information, then the Purchaser may disclose only the portion of such Seller
Confidential Information which its legal counsel advises it is legally
compelled to disclose, and the Purchaser shall exercise commercially
reasonable efforts, at the Sellers expense, to obtain assurances that the
Seller Confidential Information will be accorded confidential treatment.

(c) The obligations of the Parent and its Affiliates pursuant to the
Confidentiality Agreement or any other confidentiality or non-disclosure
agreement among any of the Sellers or any of their Affiliates, on the one
hand, and the Parent or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, in respect
of Business Confidential Information shall terminate as of the Closing and
cease to be of any further force or effect.

 

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.13_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall alter or otherwise affect the obligations of the Parent, Lafarge or
Lafarge S.A. under the confidentiality agreement, dated as of July 2, 2011
among such parties.

 

SECTION 5.14. _Delivery of Cash; Certain Communications_.

(a) If, on or after the Closing Date, any Seller (or any of its Affiliates)
receives any checks or any other amounts in cash in respect of any Assets or
otherwise arising from or relating to the operation of the Business from and
after the Closing, other than checks or other amounts in cash in respect of
Taxes or any Repurchased Receivables, such checks

 



-68-   or cash (i) shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Purchaser, (ii)
shall be segregated from the other property or funds of such Seller (or any of
its Affiliates, as applicable), (iii) in the case of checks, shall be duly
and properly endorsed to the Purchaser in accordance with such instruction as
the Purchaser shall from time to time furnish to Lafarge or such Seller, (iv)
in the case of checks, shall be promptly forwarded to the Purchaser using a
nationally recognized overnight delivery service for next-day delivery to the
Purchaser, and (v) in the case of cash in a form other than a check, shall be
promptly forwarded to the Purchaser in such manner as the Purchaser shall
from time to time direct.

(b) If, on or after the Closing Date, the Purchaser (or any of its
Affiliates) receives any checks or any other amounts in cash in respect of
any Excluded Assets (unless such amounts are included in the calculation of
the Final Working Capital or in respect of Taxes), such checks or cash (i)
shall be held in trust for the benefit of Lafarge, (ii) shall be segregated
from the other property or funds of the Purchaser (or any of its Affiliates,
as applicable), (iii) in the case of checks, shall be duly and properly
endorsed to Lafarge in accordance with such instruction as Lafarge shall from
time to time furnish to the Purchaser, (iv) in the case of checks, shall be
promptly forwarded to Lafarge using a nationally recognized overnight delivery
service for next-day delivery to Lafarge, and (v) in the case of cash in a
form other than a check, shall be promptly forwarded to Lafarge in such manner
as Lafarge shall from time to time direct.

(c) If, on or after the Closing Date, any Seller (or any of its Affiliates)
receives any mail, courier package, telegraph message, facsimile transmission,
purchase order, service request or other document that relates to the Assets
or the Business, such documents shall be promptly forwarded, using a
nationally recognized overnight delivery service for next-day delivery, to the
Purchaser.

 

(d) If, on or after the Closing Date, the Purchaser (or any of its Affiliates)
receives any mail, courier package, telegraph message, facsimile
transmission, purchase order, service request or other document that relates
to the Excluded Assets, such documents shall be promptly forwarded, using a
nationally recognized overnight delivery service for next-day delivery, to
Lafarge. 

SECTION 5.15. _Access to Information_.

(a) For a period of seven (7) years from and after the end of the year in
which the Closing occurs (or such longer period as is provided for in _Section
5.15(c)_), the Parent shall, and shall cause the Purchaser to, (i) afford to
the Sellers and their advisors and representatives, upon reasonable prior
notice and during normal business hours at such times as may be reasonably
convenient to the Purchaser and the Parent, reasonable access to and to copy,
for any proper purpose, including for making any Tax or regulatory filing, or
prosecuting or defending any Legal Proceeding (other than any Legal Proceeding
in which the Sellers on the one hand and the Parent or the Purchaser on the
other hand are adverse parties), all Books and Records, at the sole cost and
expense of the Sellers; (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts (without
undertaking any undue burden or expense) to make available to the
Sellers upon written request the personnel of the Parent or the Purchaser to
assist the Sellers in locating and obtaining any Books and Records for any

 



-69-   proper purpose described in clause (i) above and (iii) not dispose of or
destroy any material Books and Records relating to tax or other regulatory
matters in connection with the Business without first offering to turn over
possession thereof to the Sellers by written notice to the Sellers at least
ninety (90) days prior to the proposed date of such disposition or
destruction. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, nothing contained in this
_Section 5.15_ shall require the Parent or the Purchaser to disclose
information that relates to businesses or assets other than the Business and
the Assets.

 

(b) For a period of seven (7) years from and after the end of the year in
which the Closing occurs (or such longer period as is provided for in
_Section 5.15(c)_ below), the Sellers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates
to, (i) afford to the Parent and their advisors and representatives, upon
reasonable prior notice and during normal business hours at such times as may
be reasonably convenient to the Sellers, reasonable access to and to copy, for
any proper purpose, including for making any Tax or regulatory filing, or

in which the Sellers on the one hand and the Parent or the Purchaser on the
other hand are adverse parties), all books and records in the possession or
control of the Sellers or their Affiliates relating to the Business or the
Assets (the " _Seller Books and Records_ "), at sole costs and expense of
Parent; and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts (without undertaking any
undue burden or expense) to make available to the Parent upon written request
the personnel of the Sellers to assist the Parent in locating and obtaining
any Seller Books and Records for any proper purpose described in clause (i)
above and (iii) not dispose of or destroy any material Seller Books and
Records relating to tax or other regulatory matters in connection with the
Business without first offering to turn over possession thereof to the Parent
by written notice to the Parent at least ninety (90) days prior to the
proposed date of such disposition or destruction. Notwithstanding the
previous sentence, nothing contained in this _Section 5.15_ shall require the
Sellers to disclose information that relates to businesses or assets other
than the Business and the Assets.

 

(c) The seven (7) year period referred to in _Section 5.15(a)_ and _Section
5.15(b)_ above shall be extended if the applicable party requiring access to
the Books and Records or the Seller Books and Records (as the case may be)
advises the other parties in writing that any Legal Proceeding (other than any
Legal Proceeding in which the Sellers on the one hand and the Parent or the
Purchaser on the other hand are adverse parties) that involves or may require
disclosure of the Books and Records or the Seller Books and Records (as the
case may be) is pending or threatened at the termination of such
seven (7)-year period, in which case such extension shall continue until any
such Legal Proceeding has been finally resolved or settled through a final,
non-appealable judgment or otherwise is no longer pending or threatened. All
confidential or proprietary information received by, or made available to,
the Sellers pursuant to this _Section 5.15_ shall be kept confidential to the
extent required by and in accordance with _Section 5.13_.

 

SECTION 5.16. _Bulk Sales Laws_. __

The parties hereby waive compliance with any applicable Bulk Sales Laws in
connection with the sale, conveyance, assignment, transfer and delivery of the
Assets by the Sellers to the Purchaser and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



-70-  SECTION 5.17. _Title Matters_.

 

(a) The Purchaser acknowledges having received written copies of the title
reports issued by the Title Company as of various dates in August and
September 2012 and delivered to the Purchaser prior to the date of this
Agreement with respect to all the Real Property (including the real property
that the Wichita Terminal is a part of) (the " _Current Title Reports_ ") and
that as of midnight at the end of the Business Day prior to the date of this
Agreement the Current Title Reports identify no matters of record that are not
Permitted Encumbrances other than the title defects identified on _Schedule
5.17(a)_  (" _Identified Title Defects_ ") and the standard title exceptions
customarily deleted by a title company upon receipt of a survey or an
affidavit of the seller (the " _Standard Exceptions_ "). In addition, the
Purchaser shall have the right to object in writing at any time prior to the
Closing to any title matters not set forth in the Current Title Reports,
including any matters disclosed in amendments to the Current Title Reports and
the surveys of the Real Property obtained by the Purchaser; _provided_ that
such matters are not shown on a Prior Survey and that a reasonable purchaser
of real property would object to such matters as having a potential material
and adverse effect on the ownership, use or operation of the subject Owned
Real Property or the lessor in the subject Leased Real Property (collectively,
" _Additional Title Defects_ "). As used herein, the term " _Title Defect_ "
means any Identified Title Defects and Additional Title Defects, subject to
the provisions of _Section 5.17(b)_.

(b) If, between the date of this Agreement and three (3) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, the Purchaser identifies any Title Defects, the Purchaser
shall provide to Sellers prompt written notice (and in any event, no later
than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date) of such Title
Defects, which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of such
Title Defects. If (i) the Title Company is willing to insure over or provide
affirmative insurance against any such Title Defect without any additional
cost (unless the Sellers are willing to pay, and pay for at Closing, such
additional cost) or (ii) such Title Defect is extinguished prior to or at the
Closing by the Sellers, at the Sellers sole cost and expense, then the same
shall not constitute Title Defects or any breach of the Sellers
representations hereunder.

(c) The Sellers shall use good faith efforts to cause to be removed or cured,
at their expense prior to the Closing, all Title Defects so that no Title
Defects appear on the Title Policies. If the Sellers fail to remove any Title
Defects or the Sellers are unable to do so, the Purchaser shall nonetheless
be required to accept title subject to the uncured Title Defects, subject only
to the conditions set forth in _Section 6.02_; _provided, however_ , that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.17_ or elsewhere
in this Agreement, the Parent or the Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates, directors, officers, shareholders, employees, agents or other
representatives shall have the right to seek indemnification from the Sellers
from and after the Closing under _Article VIII_ in respect of such uncured
Title Defects.

 



-71-  SECTION 5.18. _Use of Seller Marks_.

 

(a) Each of the Parent and the Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, after
the Closing, it shall not use the Excluded Marks, and shall remove any such
Excluded Marks from the Assets as soon as reasonably practicable, and in any
event, no later than sixty (60) days following the Closing Date. Without
limiting this _Section 5.18(a)_, promptly after the Closing, the Purchaser
shall register all of the railcars using the Purchasers unique markings
(including railcar identification numbers) and shall cease using the Sellers
unique markings (including railcar identification numbers).

 

(b) Each of the Sellers acknowledges and agrees that, after the Closing, it
shall not use the Acquired Mark, and shall remove any such Acquired Mark from
any Excluded Assets as soon as practicable, and in any event, no later than
sixty (60) days following the Closing Date.

SECTION 5.19. _Use of Software_. __

(a) The Purchaser shall not use (or allow any of its Affiliates to use) any
Installed Software or any proprietary software of the Sellers that is
installed on computer systems that are included in the Assets, unless the
Purchaser has obtained prior to such use all required licenses and consents
(at Purchasers sole expense), or otherwise has the right to use such software
(including pursuant to _Sections 5.03(d)_ or _5.19(b)_ , the Transition
Services Agreement or the Software License Agreement).

 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Sellers hereby
grant to the Purchaser and its Affiliates that are involved in the operation
of the Cement Plants a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-
transferrable (except as expressly set forth in this clause (b)) royalty-free
license to use, copy, modify and adapt the First Level Control
interface developed by the Sellers and identified in Schedule 3.12(a), solely
in connection with the operation of the Cement Plants and solely on the
premises of such Cement Plants. The foregoing license shall be non-assignable
and non-transferrable, except to the purchaser of all or substantially all of
any Cement Plant at which the First Level Control interface is deployed. This
clause (b) does not constitute a transfer or sale of the Sellers ownership
rights in or to the First Level Control interface, which is an Excluded
Asset. THE FIRST LEVEL CONTROL INTERFACE IS BEING PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND
"WHERE IS" BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY,
INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR THE PURCHASERS PURPOSE, ACCURACY, OR SYSTEM INTEGRATION. THERE IS
NO WARRANTY AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR AGAINST
INFRINGEMENT.

 

SECTION 5.20. _Air Quality Consent Decree_. __

Each of the Parent and the Purchaser has received a copy of the Air Quality
Consent Decree and, effective as of the Closing, consents pursuant to
paragraph 4(a) thereof to undertake the obligations required to be performed
by the Defendants (as defined in the Air Quality Consent Decree) thereunder
and to be substituted for the Defendants in respect thereof, in each case,
only with respect to the kilns at the Cement Plants and only to the extent of
the obligations of the Defendants arising out of the operation of the kilns at
the Cement Plants from and after the Closing. The substitution of the Parent
and the Purchaser

 



-72-  for the Defendants as contemplated by this _Section 5.20_ and paragraph 4(a)
of the Air Quality Consent Decree shall be effected pursuant to an amendment
to the decree in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the United
States, the Affected States (as defined in the Air Quality Consent Decree),
the Defendants, the Parent and the Purchaser.

SECTION 5.21. _Certain Environmental Matters_. __

 

For a period of five (5) years after the Closing Date, neither the Parent nor
the Purchaser shall perform any invasive or destructive sampling or testing
at any of the Real Property included in the Assets, unless such sampling or
testing is (a) required by any Environmental Law, a Governmental Authority, or
the landlord for any Leased Real Property; (b) reasonably necessary in order
to avoid a Legal Proceeding threatened by a Governmental Entity or other
Person under any Environmental Law; (c) reasonably necessary in order to
evaluate, prevent or mitigate an imminent and substantial endangerment to
human health or the environment; or (d) undertaken in good faith and in manner
consistent with a reasonable and prudent business person (without
consideration of the benefit of any indemnification provided by Lafarge) (i)
as part of the Parents normal operations during the continued use of the
plants and facilities (including the performance of capital improvements,
operations and maintenance, and reasonable construction and renovation
activities) or (ii) as part of an environmental investigation or other due
diligence activity (including any Phase I or Phase II assessment) by or in
satisfaction of the reasonable requirements of a lender or a bona fide
prospective purchaser, assignee, lessee or sublessee of the plants or other
facilities.

SECTION 5.22. _Wichita Terminal_.

 

(a) At the Closing, Lafarge and the Purchaser shall enter into the Wichita
Terminal Lease Agreement.

 

(b) As soon as practicable after the Closing, the Sellers and the Purchaser
shall cooperate to take all reasonable actions necessary to partition and
subdivide the area of land identified in _Schedule 5.22_ from the parcel of
real property located at 106 W Macarthur Road, Wichita KS 67217 (the "
_Wichita Property_ ") on which the Sellers currently conduct operations as
part of its cement business (such area identified in _Schedule 5.22_ , the "
_Wichita Terminal_ "), including the Sellers granting to the Purchaser and the
Purchaser granting to the Sellers access (including rail and road access),
utilities and any other easements reasonably necessary for the newly
subdivided parcels to maintain substantially the same uses they would support
currently as part of the Wichita Property (the " _Easements_ "). The parties
shall equally pay all costs and expenses in connection with such partition and
subdivision including, without limitation, the cost of a survey. At Closing,
the Sellers shall deliver into escrow with the Title Company, to the
extent applicable, (i) the documents described in _Section 2.02(a)(i)_,
_Section 2.02(a)(v)_, _Section 2.02(a)(vii)_, _Section 2.02(a)(x)_ and
_Section 2.02(a)(xvii)_, (ii) an affidavit described in _Section
5.02(b)(iii)_, and _(iii)_ easement agreements for the Easements in
recordable form and reasonably acceptable to both Sellers and Purchaser
(collectively, the " _Wichita Closing Documents_ "), in each case duly
executed and acknowledged, if applicable, with all exhibits completed except
for any exhibits setting forth the legal description of the Wichita Terminal.
At Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall deliver joint

 



-73-  escrow instructions to the Title Company instructing the Title Company to hold
the Wichita Closing Documents in escrow until the partition and subdivision
of the Wichita Terminal from the Wichita Property is completed in compliance
with all applicable laws. Promptly following the completion of such partition
and subdivision, (i) the Sellers and Purchaser shall instruct the Title
Company to insert the legal description of the Wichita Terminal approved by
the applicable Governmental Authorities in connection with the partition and
subdivision on all applicable Wichita Closing Documents and to record the
Deed and the documents creating the Easements, and (ii) in consideration
therefor, the Purchaser shall pay to the Sellers an amount in cash equal to
the product of (A) $25,000 and (B) the number of acres included in
the Wichita Terminal (the " _Wichita Conveyance_ ") by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Sellers, in each
case, on the terms and subject to the conditions relating thereto contained in
this Agreement . Upon the completion of the Wichita Conveyance, the Wichita
Terminal shall, without any further action, be deemed to be an Asset under
this Agreement as of such date and the Wichita Terminal Lease Agreement shall
automatically terminate. To the extent the Purchaser desires to obtain title
insurance (at Purchasers sole cost and expense), the provisions of _Section
5.17_ shall apply as applicable.

 

SECTION 5.23. _Interim Financial Statements_. __

If the Closing does not occur on or before November 7, 2012, then, at least

changes in net parent investment and statement of cash flows of the Business
for the quarterly periods ended on such dates (collectively, the " _Third
Quarter Unaudited Financial Statements_ "), which Third Quarter Unaudited
Financial Statements shall include footnotes (to the extent required to meet
the standards described in _Section 3.05(c)_) and shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with the preparation of the Unaudited Balance Sheets
described in _Section 3.05(b)_. Any such Third Quarter Unaudited Financial
Statements shall be deemed to be included in the defined term "Unaudited
Financial Statements" solely for purposes of _Section 3.05_.

SECTION 5.24. _Bonds; Letters of Credit_. __

The Parent and the Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with the Sellers in
obtaining a release of the bonds or letters of credit that the Sellers have
provided to Governmental Authorities or other third parties with respect to
the Assumed Liabilities (the " _Sellers Bonds or Letters of Credit_ "),
including by providing such Governmental Authorities or third parties bonds or
letters of credit in the amounts specified and on terms substantially similar
to the relevant Sellers Bonds or Letters of Credit. If such Governmental
Authorities or other third parties do not release the Sellers from the Sellers
Bonds or Letters of Credit, then for so long as such unreleased Sellers Bonds
or Letters of Credit remain outstanding, the Parent shall provide to the
Sellers such bonds or letters of credit in favor of the Sellers, in the same
amount and on the same terms, as the unreleased Sellers Bonds or Letters of
Credit from a third party with the same or higher credit rating as
the provider of the unreleased Sellers Bonds or Letters of Credit.

 



-74-  SECTION 5.25. _Vehicle, Equipment and Rail Car Leases_.

 

(a) _Schedule 5.25_ hereto lists each vehicle, piece of equipment, rail car or
other Tangible Personal Property that is used exclusively in the conduct of
the Business but leased by the Sellers pursuant to a National Contract. At or
prior to the Closing, the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to
(i) establish, in the Purchasers name, new Leases (on terms reasonably
satisfactory to the Purchaser) between the Purchaser and the applicable lessor
of such Tangible Personal Property required to be listed in _Schedule 5.25_
hereto, and (ii) transfer and deliver such leased Tangible Personal Property
to the Purchaser. If the Purchaser does not enter into new master Leases in
the Purchasers name at or prior to the Closing, then the Purchaser may, at
its option, (A) purchase such Tangible Personal Property according to
the terms required by the Lease between the Sellers and such lessor, (B)
treat such Lease as a Retained Contract to which the provisions of _Section
1.03_ shall apply or (C) implement any other reasonable arrangement acceptable
to the Sellers _, provided_ that if, at Closing, no reasonable arrangement
that is acceptable to the Sellers is implemented and the Purchaser has not
purchased such Tangible Personal Property, then such lease for such Tangible
Personal Property shall be deemed a Retained Contract.

(b) If the Sellers receive any invoices for payment of maintenance, property
taxes, insurance or loss related to the railcars included in the Assets that
are for periods after the Closing, and if the Sellers pay such invoices, then
the Purchaser shall promptly reimburse the Seller for any such payments.

 

SECTION 5.26. _Estoppel; Releases._

The parties shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain, prior to Closing, an
estoppel certificate, substantially in the form of _Exhibit I_ hereto, from
each of the Persons identified in _Schedule 5.26_ hereto and a release from
each of the lessors under Leases.

SECTION 5.27. _Fredonia_. __

 

If, during the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending on
the first (1st) anniversary thereof, any of the Sellers propose to sell, or
otherwise dispose of, to any third party all or any portion of any of the
Sellers real property located at the Fredonia Cement Plant or the silos
located at such plant (collectively, the " _Fredonia Property_ "), then the
Sellers shall, prior to accepting an offer to sell any of the Fredonia
Property to any third party, offer the Parent a preferential opportunity to
purchase the Fredonia Property or such portion thereof on the terms
and conditions offered by such third party. If the Purchaser notifies the
Sellers within ten (10) days of receipt of such offer that it is interested in
acquiring the Fredonia Property or such portion thereof on such terms, the
Sellers shall negotiate with the Parent in good faith for the sale thereof to
the Parent or a designated subsidiary of the Parent. If (i) the Purchaser
fails to notify the Sellers that it is interested in acquiring the Fredonia
Property of such portion thereof within ten (10) days of receipt of such
offer or (ii) the parties fail to enter into a definitive agreement for the
sale of the Fredonia Property or such portion thereof by the end of the
thirtieth (30th) day after the Purchaser notified the Sellers that it was
interested in acquiring such property, then the Parent shall be deemed to have
waived its rights under this _Section 5.27_ and the Sellers may negotiate and
enter into a definitive agreement for the sale of the Fredonia Property or
any portion thereof with any third party.

 



-75-  SECTION 5.28. _Certain Real Properties._

 

(a) At the Closing, except to the extent otherwise requested in writing by the
Purchaser within thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement, the
Sellers shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Purchaser a Deed with
respect to each of the properties described on _Schedule 5.28(a)_ hereto.

(b) The Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the real estate sale agreements between
Quicksilver 2005 LLC and each of Animals Best Friends, Paul Marion Demo, Jr.
Revocable Trust and Cherry Creek Enterprises LLC (collectively, the " _North
Allen Road Agreements"_ ) and to obtain a customary title insurance policy and
survey of such property to be used in connection with such title insurance
naming the Sellers as the insured party under such title policies and surveys.
If the transactions contemplated by the North Allen Road Agreements are
completed on or prior to the Closing, then, at the Closing, (i) the
Sellers shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Purchaser a Deed and
any other applicable closing documents (including an endorsement of such title
insurance and survey to the Purchaser) set forth in _Section 2.02(a)_ with
respect to the property acquired pursuant to the North Allen Road Agreements
and (ii) the Parent shall cause the Purchaser to pay to the Sellers (in such
proportions as the Sellers shall specify in writing) an amount in cash equal
to (x) the purchase price paid by the Sellers pursuant to the North Allen
Road Agreements and (y) the cost of any premiums incurred by the Sellers for
such title policies (including the cost of any endorsements to the title
policies) and the cost of any such surveys. If the transactions contemplated
by the North Allen Road Agreements do not occur prior to the Closing, then, at
the Closing, the Sellers shall, subject to the Sellers obtaining consent from
the sellers under the North Allen Road Agreements, assign the North Allen
Road Agreements to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall assume all rights
and obligations of the Sellers under the North Allen Road Agreements. If the
Sellers are unable to obtain such consent to assignment prior to
Closing, then Sellers shall convey such property pursuant to the provisions
of clause (i) and (ii) promptly upon Sellers acquisition of such property.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Sellers
make no representations or warranties with respect to, and the indemnification
provisions of _Section 8.02(a)_ or  _Section 8.02(c)_ shall not apply to
the North Allen Road Agreements or any of the properties that may be
transferred pursuant to this _Section 5.28_.

SECTION 5.29. _Current Title Reports Amendments._

Prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall deliver evidence to the Title Company
satisfactory for the Title Company to issue amendments to the Current Title
Reports reflecting that title to each tract of real property identified on
_Schedule 1.01(a)(i)_ hereto is vested in Lafarge or one of the Other
Sellers.

 



-76-  SECTION 5.30. _Mix Design License._

 

After the Closing, the Purchaser shall have the right to access and use all
Mix Designs necessary for the production of Retained Proprietary Products
that are produced in or sold by the Ready Mix Plants solely for the purpose of
fulfilling customer purchase orders for Retained Proprietary Products that are
open as of the Closing Date, as well as any orders for Retained Proprietary
Products that may be placed by customers of the Business in receipt of a
Seller bid that is pending as of the Closing. As soon as is reasonably
practicable following the Purchasers fulfillment of all such pending orders,
the Purchaser shall cease all use of the foregoing Mix Designs, and shall
delete or destroy (or or cause to be deleted or destroyed) the applicable
portions of any books and records containing such Mix Designs.

be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of the Parent and Lafarge;

(b) by either the Parent or Lafarge, if there shall be promulgated any Law

_Termination Date_ "); _provided, however_ , that the Parent shall not be
permitted to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 7.01(c)(i)_ if the
failure of the Closing to occur is caused in whole or in substantial part by a
breach by the Parent or the Purchaser of any covenant or obligation in this

inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the Parent or the Purchaser
made herein;

(ii) there has been a breach by any Seller of any representation, warranty,

-79-   and (B) is incapable of being cured or is not cured within thirty (30)
Business Days after receipt of written notice thereof from the Parent (which
notice shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of such breach);
_provided, however_ , that the Parent shall not have a right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.01(c)(ii)_ if it is then in breach of

caused in whole or in substantial part by a breach by any Seller of any
covenant or obligation in this Agreement required to be performed by any
Seller or the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of any Seller made
herein; or

 

(ii) there has been a breach by the Parent or the Purchaser of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Parent or the
Purchaser contained in this Agreement and such breach (A) if it occurred or

condition to the obligations of the Sellers specified in _Article VI_ and (B)
is incapable of being cured or is not cured within thirty (30) Business Days
after receipt of written notice thereof from Lafarge (which notice shall
specify in reasonable detail the nature of such breach); _provided, however_

notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other parties specifying the
provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made, and all further
obligations of the parties to this Agreement shall terminate without further
liability of any party to another except that (a) the agreements contained in
this _Section 7.02_ and _Article X_ shall survive the termination hereof and
(b) no such termination shall relieve any party thereto of any liability for
damages actually incurred arising from any breach or default on the part of
such party prior to the date of termination of this Agreement or be deemed to
constitute a waiver of any available remedy (including specific performance if
available) for any such breach.

(a) In the case of any Claims asserted against or imposed upon an Indemnitee

under this _Article VIII_ (" _Third-Party Claims_ "), the obligations of the
Indemnitor in respect of such Third-Party Claims shall be performed in
accordance with the following procedures:

 

(i) The Indemnitee shall give the Indemnitor written notice of any such Third-
Party Claim, which notice shall specify in reasonable detail (based on the
information then available to the Indemnitee) the nature of such Third-Party
Claim, promptly following the earlier of the written assertion thereof or the
service of any notice of commencement of, or other first legal process
relating to, any Legal Proceeding in which such Third-Party Claim is asserted;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, if the Indemnitee fails to notify the
Indemnitor of a Third-Party Claim promptly as contemplated by this  _Section
8.04(a)(i)_, the Indemnitor shall not be relieved of its obligations in
respect of such Third-Party Claim except to the extent (and only to the
extent) that the Indemnitor is actually and materially prejudiced by such
failure. 

(ii) Promptly after notification of a Third-Party Claim as contemplated by
_Section 8.04(a)(i)_, the Indemnitor may elect to control the defense and,
subject to subclause (D) herein, the compromise and settlement of such Third-
Party Claim with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (A) if the Indemnitor fails, within forty-five (45) calendar
days after receipt of written notice of such Third-Party Claim, to assume the
defense and, subject to subclause (D) herein, the compromise and settlement
thereof on the terms set forth in this _Section 8.04(a)(ii)_, the Indemnitee
shall have the right to undertake the defense, and subject to subclause (E)
herein, the compromise and settlement of such Third-Party Claim on behalf of
and for the account and risk of the Indemnitor (subject to the limitations
contained in _Section 8.05_) and the Indemnitor shall pay the reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel to the Indemnitee, (B) if, (1) in the reasonable
judgment of the Indemnitee, there exists a conflict of interest between the
Indemnitee and the Indemnitor with respect to such Third-Party Claim or there
are any material defenses available to the Indemnitee that differ from or are
in addition to those available to the Indemnitor or (2) the Third-Party Claim
would reasonably be expected to result in an injunction or other equitable
relief against the Indemnitee that, in the reasonable judgment of the
Indemnitee, would be expected to materially and adversely affect the business
activities or operations of the Indemnitee, the Indemnitee shall (upon
notifying the Indemnitor of its election to do so) have the right to undertake
the defense, and subject to subclause (E) herein, the compromise and
settlement of such Third-Party Claim with counsel reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnitor on behalf of and for the account and risk of the Indemnitor
(subject to the limitations contained in _Section 8.05_) and the Indemnitor
shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnitee, (C)
to the extent that the Indemnitee does not have the right to undertake the
defense, and subject to subclause (E) herein, the compromise and settlement of
such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnitee, if it in its sole discretion so
elects, shall be entitled to employ separate counsel and to participate in the
defense of such Third-Party Claim, but (1) the fees and expenses of counsel so
employed shall 

 



-83-   (except as otherwise provided in subclauses (A) and (B) above) be borne
solely by the Indemnitee and (2) the Indemnitee and its counsel shall
cooperate with the Indemnitor and its counsel (who, to the extent provided in
subclauses (A) and (B) above, shall have the right to control the defense of
the Third-Party Claim) in the defense of such Third-Party Claim, (D) the
Indemnitor shall not settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim or consent to
the entry of any judgment in respect thereof that does not include the grant
by the claimant or plaintiff to each Indemnitee of a full and unconditional
release from any and all liability in respect thereof and (E) the Indemnitee
shall not settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim in any manner, or consent
to the entry of any judgment in respect thereof, without the prior written
consent of the Indemnitor, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

(b) In the event an Indemnitee has an Indemnity Claim against an Indemnitor
that is not a Third-Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ "), the Indemnitee shall
deliver written notice of such Direct Claim, which notice shall specify in
reasonable detail (based on the information then available to the Indemnitee)
the nature of such Direct Claim, to the Indemnitor promptly after it
determines that it is entitled to seek indemnification for such Direct Claim.
The failure by the Indemnitee to so notify the Indemnitor hereunder shall not
relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent (and
only to the extent) that the Indemnitor is actually and materially prejudiced
by such failure. If the Indemnitor does not notify the Indemnitee within
forty-five (45) calendar days following its receipt of such notice that the
Indemnitor disputes its liability to the Indemnitee, such Direct Claim
specified by the Indemnitee in such notice shall be conclusively deemed a
liability of the Indemnitor and the Indemnitor shall promptly pay the amount
of such liability to the Indemnitee on demand or, in the case of any notice
in which the amount of the Direct Claim (or any portion thereof) is estimated,
on such later date when the amount of such Direct Claim (or such portion
thereof) becomes finally determined.

(c) The parties hereto agree that, unless otherwise required by Law, any
payment of Losses to an Indemnitee made pursuant to this _Article VIII_ shall
be treated as an adjustment to the purchase price paid by the Purchaser for
Tax purposes.

SECTION 8.05. _Certain Limitations_.

(a) The obligations of the Sellers in respect of Purchaser Indemnity Claims
pursuant to _Section 8.02(a)_ (other than Purchaser Indemnity Claims in
respect of a breach of any Fundamental Representations or that arise from
fraud by or on behalf of any Seller, which shall not be subject to the
limitations set forth in this _Section 8.05_) (" _Covered Purchaser Indemnity
Claims_ ") shall become operative and effective only if and to the extent that
the aggregate amount of all Losses incurred by the applicable Indemnitees
arising from Covered Purchaser Indemnity Claims exceeds $5,000,000 (the "
_Basket Amount_ "). Covered Purchaser Indemnity Claims shall accumulate until
such time as the aggregate amount of all Losses arising therefrom exceeds the
Basket Amount, at which time the Sellers shall be obligated to indemnify the
applicable Indemnitees against such Losses, but only to the extent the
aggregate amount thereof exceeds the Basket Amount.

 



-84-  (b) The obligations of the Parent and the Purchaser in respect of Seller
Indemnity Claims pursuant to _Section 8.03(a)_ (other than Seller Indemnity
Claims in respect of a breach of any Fundamental Representations or that arise
from fraud or an intentional and material misrepresentation by or on behalf of
the Purchaser or the Parent, which shall not be subject to the limitations
set forth in this _Section 8.05_) (" _Covered Seller Indemnity Claims_ ")
shall become operative and effective only if and to the extent that the
aggregate amount of all Losses incurred by the applicable Indemnitees arising
from Covered Seller Indemnity Claims exceeds the Basket Amount. Covered Seller
Indemnity Claims shall accumulate until such time as the aggregate amount of
all Losses arising therefrom exceeds the Basket Amount, at which time the
Parent and the Purchaser shall be obligated to indemnify the applicable
Indemnitees against such Losses, but only to the extent the aggregate amount
thereof exceeds the Basket Amount.

 

(c) The maximum obligation of the Sellers to provide indemnification in
respect of Covered Purchaser Indemnity Claims shall not exceed $56,000,000
(the " _Cap Amount_ ").

(d) The maximum obligation of the Parent and the Purchaser to
provide indemnification in respect of Covered Seller Indemnity Claims shall
not exceed the Cap Amount.

(e) The obligations of the Sellers in respect of any Covered Purchaser
Indemnity Claim shall not apply if the amount of Loss incurred by the
applicable Indemnitees related to such individual Covered Purchaser Indemnity
Claim, together with all related Covered Purchaser Indemnity Claims, totals
less than $45,000 (the " _De Minimis Threshold_ ").

(f) The obligations of the Parent and the Purchaser in respect of Covered
Seller Indemnity Claims shall become operative and effective only if and to
the extent that the amount of Loss incurred by the applicable Indemnitees
related to each individual Covered Seller Indemnity Claim or series of
related Covered Purchaser Indemnity Claims exceeds the De Minimis Threshold.

(g) Each of the parties hereby acknowledges and agrees that the limitations
provided for in _Section 8.05(a)_ through _Section 8.05(f)_ above apply only
to Covered Purchaser Indemnity Claims or Covered Seller Indemnity Claims (as
the case may be), and do not apply to any other rights to indemnification
provided for in this _Article VIII_ , including rights to indemnification
against Retained Liabilities or Assumed Liabilities (as the case may be).

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Article VIII_
, the Sellers shall have no obligation to indemnify the Purchaser or its
Affiliates under _Section 8.02(a)_ or _Section 8.02(c)_ with respect to any
liabilities or obligations arising from the Release of Materials of
Environmental Concern to the Environment if such liabilities or obligations
constitute Excluded Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities. In addition, the
obligation of the Sellers to provide indemnification pursuant to _Section
8.02(a)_ or _Section 8.02(c)_ with respect to any clean up costs or costs of
remediation arising from the Release

 



-85-   of Materials of Environmental Concern to the Environment shall be limited to
costs associated with clean up and remediation actions that are (i) required
by applicable Environmental Law or an Order issued by a Governmental
Authority, reasonably necessary in order to avoid a Legal Proceeding
threatened by a Governmental Entity or other Person under any Environmental
Law or reasonably necessary in order to prevent or mitigate an imminent and
substantial endangerment to human health or the environment and (ii) taken in
good faith and in a manner consistent with the actions that would be taken by
a reasonable and prudent business person who owns the applicable
Real Property (without consideration of the benefit of any indemnification
provided by the Sellers).

(i) Any Losses for which any Indemnitee would be entitled to indemnification
under this _Article VIII_ shall be reduced by (i) the amount of insurance
proceeds actually received or recovered under any insurance policies for the
benefit of such Indemnitee (including the Title Policies) and any cash
payments, setoffs or recoupment of any payments recovered by such Indemnitee
in respect of such Losses (other than pursuant to any indemnification or
similar arrangements that the Indemnitee has purchased following the Closing
Date), and (ii) any Tax Benefit. To the extent required by principles of
applicable Delaware contract law, each Indemnitee shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate losses for which such Indemnitee is subject
to indemnification under this _Article VIII_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the previous Section, if an Indemnitee believes that coverage for
Losses is likely to be available under the Title Policies, such Indemnitee
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue any insurance proceeds
available to such Indemnitee pursuant to any Title Policies. If, after the
Indemnitor has made an indemnification payment to an Indemnitee in
satisfaction of its obligations under this  _Article VIII_ with respect to
any Third-Party Claim or Direct Claim pursuant to this _Article VIII_ , the
Indemnitee actually recovers from any third parties amounts in respect of such
Losses of the type described in the first sentence of this _Section
8.05(i)_, it shall as promptly as practicable forward to the Indemnitor such
amounts (less the full amount of expenses incurred in procuring such recovery,
including any applicable deductibles or retentions), but not in excess of the
indemnification payment received by the Indemnitee.

(j) For the avoidance of doubt, if any Loss was included as a current
liability in the calculation of the Final Working Capital in accordance with
the provisions of _Section 1.05_, the amount of such Loss may not be
recovered under this _Article VIII_ , but the amount, if any, of any such
Loss that exceeds the amount included as a current liability in the
calculation of Final Working Capital may be recovered on and subject to the
terms and conditions of this _Article VIII_.

 

SECTION 8.06. _Exclusive Remedy_

From and after the Closing, (a) the provisions of this _Article VIII_ and of
_Section 1.05(b)_ shall constitute the exclusive remedy on the part of any
party hereto in respect of the subject matter of this Agreement, the Deeds,
or the transactions contemplated hereby and (b) neither the Parent nor the
Purchaser, on the one hand, nor any of the Sellers, on the other, shall seek
any indemnification, contribution, repayment or other remedy or recourse
directly or indirectly from the other party or parties or their Affiliates
with respect to

 



-86-   the subject matter of this Agreement, the Deeds or the transactions
contemplated hereby (whether on the basis of a claim sounding in tort,
contract, statute or otherwise) outside the provisions of this _Article VIII_
; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) nothing herein shall limit the right of
any party to seek specific performance or injunctive relief in connection with
a breach by another party of its obligations under this Agreement or any
Ancillary Delivery that occurs after the Closing Date and (ii) nothing herein
shall limit the rights of any party under any of the Ancillary Agreements or
in respect of a breach of any of the provisions thereof, which rights shall
not be subject to or limited by this _Article VIII_. Notwithstanding the
previous sentence or any other provision of this _Article VIII_ , nothing
contained in this _Article VIII_ shall be construed to limit any liability on
the part of any party hereto for fraud; _provided_ , that in no event shall
any party be liable for (A) punitive or exemplary damages, except to the
extent that such damages are imposed on or incurred by a party as a result of
a Third-Party Claim or (B) any consequential or indirect damages, lost
profits, diminution in value, damages to reputation or loss to goodwill except
to the extent recoverable under applicable principles of Delaware contract law
because they were the reasonably foreseeable consequence of the relevant
breach or action and were not occasioned by the special circumstances relating
to the Indemnitee.

SECTION 8.07. _Investigation_

An Indemnitees right to indemnification, payment of Losses or other remedies
based on any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of another party
contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement, any Deed shall not be
affected by any investigation conducted by such Indemnitee or any of its
representatives or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) by
any such Indemnitee or its representatives, in each case, at any time prior to
or after either the date of this Agreement or the Closing Date.

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person,
other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns and, with respect to the provisions of _Article VIII_ , the Persons
expressly identified therein as Indemnitees, any rights, benefits or remedies
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, and no other
Person shall be deemed a third-party beneficiary under or by reason of
this Agreement. No party may assign this Agreement or its rights, interests
or obligations hereunder to any Person without the prior written consent of
each of the other parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that each of the
Parent and the Purchaser may (a) assign this Agreement or its rights,
interests or obligations hereunder (including the right of the Purchaser to
acquire all or any part of the Assets at the Closing) to any subsidiary of the
Parent or to any successor to all or substantially all of the business of the
Parent and (b) collaterally assign its rights and interests hereunder to any
lender or other financing source of the Parent (and such rights and interests
may be assigned or further assigned in connection with any foreclosure or

Sellers for the performance of its obligations hereunder unless Lafarge

transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 10.07. _Governing Law_. __

 

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of Delaware, without regard to the principles of conflicts of
law that would require the application of the laws of another jurisdiction,
except to the extent that mandatory principles of conflicts of law require the
application of the laws of another jurisdiction wherein any of the Assets
are located to determine the validity or effect of the sale, conveyance,
transfer, assignment and delivery thereof in accordance with _Article I_.

SECTION 10.08. _Choice of Forum; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

(a) All disputes, controversies or Legal Proceedings arising in connection
with or commenced by or on behalf of any party to this Agreement in connection
with or relating to this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Deliveries or any
matters described or contemplated herein or therein (other than with respect
to the matters, if any, to be submitted to the Accounting Arbiter in
accordance with _Section 1.05(b)_) shall be instituted in the courts of the
State of Delaware. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware for all purposes
related to any such dispute, disagreement or Legal Proceeding.

(b) In connection with any disputes, controversies or Legal Proceedings
described in _Section 10.08(a)_, each party to this Agreement irrevocably (i)
submits itself to the personal jurisdiction of any court within the State of
Delaware, (ii) waives any

 



-108-  defense or objection it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any Legal Proceeding in the courts of the State of Delaware, and (iii) waives
any claim that any Legal Proceeding under this Agreement brought in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party hereto agrees that
a judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

(c) THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT THAT THEY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY
JURY OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION, OR IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING, DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

SECTION 10.09. _Severability_. __

 

If any provision contained herein shall be held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable for any reason, the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
thereof shall not affect any other provision hereof, and, to the extent
permitted by Law, this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein.

 

SECTION 10.10. _Specific Performance_. __

The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
the terms and conditions set forth herein. Accordingly, the parties agree
that each of them shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief to prevent
breaches of the terms of this Agreement without the necessity of proving
actual damages or of posting any bond, and to enforce specifically
the provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy now or hereafter
available at law or in equity, or otherwise.

SECTION 10.11. _Press Releases_. __

No party hereto (nor any of its Affiliates) shall issue any press release or
other public announcement relating to the subject matter of this Agreement
without the prior written approval of (i) in the case of a public announcement
by the Sellers (or any of their Affiliates), the Parent or (ii) in the case of
a public announcement by the Parent or the Purchaser (or any of their
Affiliates), Lafarge; _provided, however_ , that any party hereto may make any
such public disclosure to the extent such party reasonably determines such
public disclosure to be required by applicable Law or the rules of any stock
exchange or by any regulatory body or agency having jurisdiction over it or
its Affiliates (but in any such case the disclosing party shall, if
practicable in the circumstances, use reasonable efforts to allow the other
parties reasonable time to comment on such disclosure in advance of its
issuance). The Sellers will consult with the Parent prior to making any
announcement relating to the subject matter of this Agreement to the
employees of the Business and allow the Parent a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on such announcement prior to the release thereof.

 



-109-  SECTION 10.12. _Headings_. __

 

The headings herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute a
part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit, extend or otherwise
affect the meaning of any of the provisions hereof.

SECTION 10.13. _Counterparts_. __ 

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original (whether such counterpart is originally executed
or an electronic copy of an original), and all of which taken together shall
constitute one instrument binding on all the parties, notwithstanding that all
the parties are not signatories to the original or the same counterpart.
