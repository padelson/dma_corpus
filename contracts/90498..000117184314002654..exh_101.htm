outstanding share of LBI Stock, subject to adjustment as provided in Section
2.03.

Stock, if any, which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the
shares of LBI Stock or the LBI Stock Options so held in accordance with
Sections 2.02 and 2.03, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares of SFNC Stock
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.04, plus any dividends
or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.04(c).

  


 

  

 

(iii) "Average Closing Price" of SFNC Stock shall be the average of the
closing price per share of SFNC Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (as
reported in The Wall Street Journal or, if not reported thereby, another
alternative source as chosen by SFNC) for the twenty (20) consecutive trading

(iv) "Minimum Merger Consideration" shall be the product of (x) $29.80

shall be converted into the right to receive that number of shares of SFNC
Stock as shall equal the Exchange Ratio. All shares of LBI Stock shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each Certificate, as defined in Section 2.04,
previously evidencing any such shares shall thereafter represent the right to

(c) SFNC shall take all requisite action to assume the outstanding LBI Stock
Options such that: (i) the number of shares of SFNC to be issued for each such
option shall be equal to the product of the number of shares remaining to be
exercised under each such option multiplied by the Exchange Ratio and (ii) the
strike price for each such option shall be the strike price of the LBI Stock
Option divided by the Exchange Ratio. All other terms and conditions of the
LBI Stock Options shall remain in full force and effect after the Effective
Time, including but not limited to the applicable vesting schedule and the
option expiration dates. As of the Effective Time, LBI shall certify to SFNC

thereto.

  

  

 

Section 2.03. Adjustment to Computation of Merger Consideration.

  

 

  

 

(a) The aggregate number of shares of SFNC Stock to be exchanged for each
share of LBI Stock shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect any change in
the number of shares of SFNC Stock by reason of any stock dividends or splits,
reclassification, recapitalization or conversion with respect to SFNC Stock,
received or to be received by holders of SFNC Stock, when the record date or
payment occurs prior to the Effective Time. No adjustment of the Exchange
Ratio shall occur by reason of issuance of (i) any SFNC Comp. Shares under the
SFNC Stock Comp. Plans, (ii) the issuance of any SFNC stock in any other
merger or other acquisition transaction or (iii) the issuance of any SFNC
Stock for cash in a public or private stock offering.

  

 

  

(b) The aggregate number of shares of SFNC Stock to be exchanged for each
share of LBI Stock shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect any change in
the number of shares of LBI Stock by reason of any stock dividends or splits,
reclassification, recapitalization or conversion with respect to LBI Stock,
received or to be received by holders of LBI Stock, when the record date or
payment occurs prior to the Effective Time. The Exchange Ratio set forth in
Section 2.02 (a) above is based upon 5,247,187 shares of LBI Stock, consisting
of 5,146,962 shares of LBI Stock outstanding and LBI Stock Options outstanding
for 100,225 shares of LBI Stock, all as of the Effective Time. If the sum of
the number of outstanding shares of LBI Stock, plus the number of shares of
LBI Stock specified in the LBI Stock Options outstanding and in effect, as of
the Effective Time, differs from the foregoing, then the Exchange Ratio shall
mean the number (computed to four decimal places) that shall equal the
quotient of (A) 5,247,187, divided by (y) the sum of the number of shares of
LBI Stock outstanding plus the number of shares of LBI Stock specified in the
LBI Stock Options outstanding and in effect, as of the Effective Time.

  

  

(c) In the event (i) the Average Closing Price of SFNC Stock shall be less
than $29.80; and (ii) the difference between:

  

 


 

  

the percentage change of (A) $40.06 (the average of the closing price of the
PowerShares KBW Regional Banking Portfolio ("KBWR") for the twenty (20)
consecutive trading days ending on and including March 31, 2014 and (B) the
average of the closing price of the KBWR (as reported in The Wall Street
Journal or, if not reported thereby, another alternative source as chosen by
SFNC) for the twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending on and including the
tenth (10th) trading day preceding the Effective Date,

  


 

  

and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

the percentage change of (Y) $37.24 (the average of the closing price of SFNC
Stock for the twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending on and including
March 31, 2014) and (Z) the Average Closing Price

  


 

 

  

 

is greater than twenty percent (20%)

 

  

 


 

  

then LBI may give notice of its intent to terminate this Agreement as provided
in Section 7.01(e) hereof; subject to SFNC's right, in its sole and absolute
discretion, to maintain the Exchange Ratio and opt to pay an amount of cash so
that, as a result of such adjustment, the Merger Consideration, based on the
Average Closing Price, shall be no less than the Minimum Merger Consideration.
If SFNC elects to make the SFNC Walkaway Counter Offer (as defined in Section
7.01(e)), it shall give prompt written notice to LBI of such election (the
"Walkaway Counter Offer Notice"). The Walkaway Counter Offer Notice, if given,
shall set forth the amount of the cash to be paid and shall include a
calculation of the adjusted Merger Consideration.

 

  

 


 

 

  

 

(d) Upon the occurrence of any adjustment pursuant to this Section 2.03, any
references in this Agreement to any defined term whose calculation is affected
by such adjustment shall thereafter be deemed to refer to the defined term as
calculated after giving effect to such adjustment.

  

 

  

Section 2.04 Exchange of Certificates.

  

  

(a) Promptly after the Effective Time, SFNC shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited, with Registrar and Transfer Company ("Transfer Agent"), for the
benefit of the holders of shares of LBI Stock, for exchange in accordance with
this Article II, through the Transfer Agent, (i) certificates evidencing a
number of shares of SFNC Stock equal to the sum of the shares of SFNC required
to be issued as Merger Consideration to the shareholders of LBI, and (ii) cash
in the amount of $20,000.00 ("Fractional Share Fund"). In the event the
initial sum deposited into the Fractional Share Fund is insufficient to
satisfy all payments required to be paid from such fund, then SFNC shall
immediately deposit funds to remedy such deficiency.

  

  

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, SFNC will instruct the Transfer Agent
to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced outstanding shares of LBI
Stock (other than Dissenting Shares) ("Certificates"), (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as SFNC may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates
evidencing shares of SFNC Stock and any cash payable hereunder. Upon surrender
of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other customary documents as
may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) certificates
evidencing that number of whole shares of SFNC Stock which such holder has the
right to receive in respect of the shares of LBI Stock formerly evidenced by
such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.02, (B) cash in lieu of
fractional shares of SFNC Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.02, (C) any cash payable pursuant to Section 2.03(c), and (D) any
dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.04(c) and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of LBI Stock which
is not registered in the transfer records of LBI, a certificate evidencing the
proper number of shares of SFNC Stock may be issued and cash paid in
accordance with this Article II to a transferee if the Certificate evidencing
such shares of LBI Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by
all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence
that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.04, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective
Time with respect to SFNC Stock with a record date after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to
the shares of SFNC Stock evidenced thereby, and no other part of the Merger
Consideration shall be paid to any such holder, until the holder of such
Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of
applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be
delivered and paid to the holder of the certificates (i) certificates
evidencing whole shares of SFNC Stock issued in exchange therefor, (ii) the
cash portion of the Merger Consideration, if any, payable to such holder,
including the amount of any cash payable with respect to a fractional share of
SFNC Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.04(b), any
cash payable pursuant to Section 2.03(c) and the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such whole shares of SFNC Stock, and (iii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, with a record
date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date
occurring after surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of SFNC
Stock. No interest shall be paid on the Merger Consideration.

  

  

(d) All shares of SFNC Stock issued and cash paid in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of LBI Stock.

  

  

(e) Any portion of the Fractional Share Fund which remains undistributed to
the holders of LBI Stock on the date six months following the Effective Time
shall be delivered to SFNC, upon demand, and any holders of LBI Stock who have
not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look directly
to SFNC for the Merger Consideration to which they are entitled.

  

  

(f) SFNC shall not be liable to any holder of shares of LBI Stock for any
Merger Consideration, whether shares of SFNC Stock, cash or dividends or
distributions with respect to SFNC Stock, delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

  

  

(g) SFNC shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of LBI
Stock such amounts as SFNC is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by SFNC, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of LBI Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by SFNC.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7

Agent or SFNC for any reason shall be converted into the Merger Consideration.

  

  

Section 2.06 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of LBI Stock that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by shareholders who
shall have not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing
and who shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such shares
(collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") in accordance with Section 351.455 of
the Revised Missouri Statutes shall not be converted into or represent the
right to receive the Merger Consideration. Such shareholders shall be entitled
to receive payment of the fair value of such shares of LBI Stock held by them
in accordance with the provisions of such statute, except that all Dissenting
Shares held by shareholders who shall have failed to perfect or who
effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to judicial
determination of the value of the shares of LBI Stock under such statute shall
have been converted into and to have become exchangeable, as of the Effective
Time, for the right to receive, without any interest thereon, the Merger
Consideration, as if such shares of LBI Stock, upon surrender, in the manner
provided in Section 2.04, of the Certificate or Certificates that formerly
evidenced such shares of LBI Stock.

  

  

Section 2.07 Lost LBI Stock Certificates. In the event any Certificate for LBI
Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon receipt of appropriate
evidence as to such loss, theft or destruction and to the ownership of such
Certificate by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and the receipt by SFNC of appropriate and customary
indemnification, SFNC will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, a certificate of shares of SFNC Stock and the cash
payment, if any, deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance
with this Article II.

that none of LBI's or Bank's executive management, consisting of Gary E.
Metzger, Garry L. Robinson, Daxton Chance, Caroline Butler, Lawrence Clos,
Emily Clayton and Kristin Carlton, knows of any circumstances, events,
commitments, instruments or facts that are known to be misrepresented or
intentionally omitted from any instrument, file, or other record of LBI or any
of its subsidiaries, with respect to loans to borrowers which are payable to
LBI or any of its subsidiaries either directly or as a participant. To the
knowledge of LBI and its subsidiaries and except for such imperfections in
documentation which when considered as a whole would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on the business, operations or financial condition of LBI or
Bank:

  

  

(a) All loans were made for good, valuable and adequate consideration in the
normal and ordinary course of business, and the notes and other evidences of
indebtedness and any loan agreements or security documents executed in
connection therewith are true and genuine and constitute the valid and legally
binding obligations of the borrowers to whom the loans were made and are
legally enforceable against such borrowers in accordance with their terms
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, and
similar debtor relief laws from time to time in effect, as well as general
principles of equity applied by a court of proper jurisdiction, regardless of
whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law;

  

  

(b) The amounts represented to SFNC as the balances owing on the loans are the
correct amounts actually and unconditionally owing, are undisputed, as of the
date reported and are not subject to any offsets, credits, deductions or
counterclaims;

  

  

(c) The collateral securing each loan as referenced in the loan file or a loan
officer worksheet, loan summary report or similar interoffice loan
documentation is in fact the collateral held by LBI or Bank to secure each
loan;

  

  

(d) LBI or its subsidiaries have possession of all loan document files and
credit files for all loans held by them containing promissory notes and other
relevant evidences of indebtedness with original signatures of their borrowers
and guarantors;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

 

  

(e) LBI or its subsidiaries hold validly perfected liens or security interests
in the collateral granted to them to secure all loans as referenced in the
loan officer worksheets, loan summary reports or similar interoffice loan
documentation and the loan or credit files contain the original security
agreements, mortgages, or other lien creation and perfection documents unless
originals of such documents are filed of public record;

  

  

(f) Each lien or security interest of LBI or its subsidiaries in the
collateral held for each loan is properly perfected in the priority described
as being held by LBI or its subsidiaries in the loan officer worksheets, loan
summary reports or similar interoffice loan documentation contained in the
loan document or credit files;

  

  

(g) LBI and its subsidiaries are in possession of all collateral that the loan
document files or credit files indicate they have in their possession;

  

  

(h) All guaranties granted to LBI or its subsidiaries to insure payment of
loans constitute the valid and legally binding obligations of the guarantors
and are enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, and similar debtor relief
laws from time to time in effect, as well as general principles of equity
applied by a court of proper jurisdiction, regardless of whether in a
proceeding in equity or at law; and

  

  

(i) With respect to any loans in which LBI or any of its subsidiaries have
sold participation interests to another bank or financial institution, none of
the buyers of such participation interests are in default under any
participation agreements.

TERMINATION

approval by the shareholders of LBI and SFNC:

  

  

(a) By the mutual consent of SFNC and LBI, by action of their respective
boards of directors;

  

  

(b) By SFNC or LBI, if its Board of Directors so determines by vote of a
majority of the members of its entire Board, in the event of the failure of
the shareholders of either LBI or SFNC to approve this Agreement at its
meeting called to consider such approval, or a material breach by the other
party hereto of any representation, warranty or agreement contained herein
which is not cured or not curable within 45 days after written notice of such
breach is given to the party committing such breach by the other party hereto;

  

  

(c) By SFNC or LBI, if its Board of Directors so determines by vote of a
majority of the members of its entire Board, in the event that the Merger is
not consummated by December 31, 2014; provided, however, that such date may be
extended to not later than April 30, 2015 by either SFNC or LBI, by written
notice to the other party if a reason the Merger shall not have been
consummated is because of failure to obtain a regulatory approval that is to
be obtained pursuant to Section 6.01(b) or (c) or because the Registration
Statement is not effective as is required pursuant to Section 6.01(g) ;
provided further that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
7.01(c) shall not be available to any party whose action or failure to act has
been the cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to be consummated
on or before such date and such action or failure to act constitutes a breach

(e) By the Board of Directors of LBI at any time during the three (3) business

Notice to LBI within three (3) business days following receipt of the
termination notice previously sent by LBI, whereupon such notice of
termination shall be null and void and of no effect, LBI shall no longer have
the right to terminate the Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(e) and this
Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms (except for the
adjustments to the Exchange Ratio and Merger Consideration). Any references in
this Agreement to the "Exchange Ratio" and "Merger Consideration" shall
thereafter be deemed to refer to the Exchange Ratio and Merger Consideration
after giving effect to any adjustment set forth in the Walkaway Counter Offer
Notice. If either SFNC or LBI declares or effects a stock dividend,

a competing proposal or other circumstances, termination of this Agreement is
required in order for LBI's Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary
duties to LBI shareholders under applicable law, provided that LBI shall pay
SFNC a fee, in immediately available funds, in the amount of $8,000,000 in
advance of or concurrently with such termination.

  

  

Section 7.02 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement by either SFNC or LBI, as provided above, this Agreement shall
thereafter become void and there shall be no liability on the part of any
party hereto or their respective officers or directors, except (i) as set
forth in Section 9.01, and (ii) that any such termination shall be without
prejudice to the rights of any party hereto arising out of the willful breach
by any other party of any covenant or willful misrepresentation contained
herein.

EXPENSES, INDEMNIFICATION, INSURANCE

  

  

Section 10.01 Indemnification. In the event the Merger is consummated, SFNC
shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer
of LBI and of Bank (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against any cost
or expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding, or investigation arising out of or pertaining to matters
related to this Agreement as well as acts prior to the Merger. SFNC shall
advance expenses as incurred provided the person to whom expenses are advanced
provides a satisfactory undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification. The
obligations of SFNC provided under this Section 10.01 are intended to be
enforceable against SFNC directly by the Indemnified Parties and shall be
binding on all successors and assigns of SFNC.

  

  

Section 10.02 DandO Insurance. Directors\' and officers' liability insurance for
acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Date will be continued
through existing policies or provided by SFNC through its blanket policy in an
amount not less than the coverage provided by LBI prior to the consummation of
the Merger for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective
Date, provided that SFNC shall not be required to expend, on an annualized
basis, more than 300% of the current annual premium paid as of the date hereof
by LBI for such insurance ("Premium Limit") and if such premiums for such
insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Limit, SFNC shall cause to be
maintained policies of insurance which in SFNC\'s good faith determination
provide maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium
Limit. Coverage for acts and omissions occurring after the Effective Date will
be provided to directors and officers of Bank on the same basis as provided to
the other subsidiary banks of SFNC.

LOCK-UP AGREEMENT

  

  

This LOCK-UP AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is made as of the ____ day of __________,
2014, by _________________________ ("Holder"), in connection with his or its
ownership of shares of Simmons First National Corporation ("Company"), an
Arkansas corporation.

  

  

RECITALS:

  

  

WHEREAS, the Company has entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated
May __, 2014 ("Merger Agreement") with Liberty Bancshares, Inc. ("LBI"), a
Missouri corporation, pursuant to which LBI shall merge with and into the
Company ("Merger");

  


 

  

WHEREAS, the Company has negotiated certain terms of the Merger Agreement,
which require the execution of this Agreement as a condition precedent to
closing of the Merger; and

  


 

  

WHEREAS, the Holder is willing to enter into this Agreement in connection with
the Merger on the terms provided herein.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of these presents and for such other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Holder agrees as follows:

  

  

1. Background. (a) Holder is the beneficial owner of _______ shares of the common stock, $0.01 par value, of the Company, and this Agreement will apply to 20,000 of such shares ("Shares") and not any other shares held or acquired by Holder hereafter.

  

  

(b) Holder understands that, as a condition to closing the Merger, the Company
has agreed to obtain an agreement from Holder to refrain from selling the
Shares from the date of this Agreement until the second anniversary of the
Effective Time of the Merger ("Restriction Period"), except as specified in
Section 2 below.

  


 

  

2. Sale Restriction. (a) Holder hereby agrees that during the Restriction Period, Holder will not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any of the Shares. Holder further agrees that the Company is authorized to (x) place a restrictive legend on any certificates issued during the Restriction Period evidencing the Shares, and (y) to place "stop orders" on its books and with its transfer agent to prevent any transfer of Shares of the Company held by Holder in violation of this Agreement. The Company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts not to allow any transaction inconsistent with this Agreement, but in the event of a material adverse change in financial circumstances of the Holder where there may be a liquidity need of the Holder, Company agrees to work with Holder in meeting Holder\'s liquidity needs.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions on transfer, Holder may, at any
time and from time to time during the Restriction Period, transfer all or a
portion of the Shares (i) as bona fide gifts or transfers by will or intestacy
and (ii) to any trust for the direct or indirect benefit of the undersigned or
the immediate family of the Holder, provided that any such transfer shall not
involve a disposition for value; provided, that, in the case of any gift or
transfer described in clauses (i) and (ii), each donee or transferee agrees in
writing to be bound by the terms and conditions contained herein in the same
manner as such terms and conditions apply to the undersigned.

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

(c) All restrictions under this Agreement will terminate immediately if the
Holder (or another Holder with whom the Holder is affiliated) is a director of
the Company or its subsidiaries, and either (i) the Holder ceases to be a
director as a result of Holder\'s death, disability as defined under the
Company\'s disability insurance plan, or removal as a director by the Company
or its subsidiaries without cause.

  


 

  

(d) All restrictions under this Agreement will terminate immediately if there
is a merger, acquisition, or other transaction which results in the Company
not being the surviving corporation or in the event that any action is taken
to delist the Shares on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (except for actions to
list the Shares on a more widely traded platform).

  


 

  

(e) In the event of any stock dividend, stock split or consolidation of shares
or any like capital adjustment of any of the outstanding securities of the
Company, all new, substituted or additional securities or other property to
which Holder becomes entitled by reason of ownership of the Shares shall be
subject to restriction with the same force and effect as the Shares subject to
restriction immediately before such event.

  

  

3. Miscellaneous. (a) At any time, and from time to time, after the signing of this Agreement, Holder will execute such additional instruments and take such action as may be reasonably requested by the Company to carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement.

  


 

  

(b) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Arkansas without regard to principles of conflicts of
laws. Any action brought by either party against the other concerning the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be brought only in the state
courts of Arkansas or in the federal courts located in the State of Arkansas.
The parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably waive any objection to
jurisdiction and venue of any action instituted hereunder and shall not assert
any defense based on lack of jurisdiction or venue or based upon forum non
conveniens. The parties executing this Agreement and other agreements referred
to herein or delivered in connection herewith agree to submit to the in
personam jurisdiction of such courts and hereby irrevocably waive trial by
jury. The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the other party
its reasonable attorney\'s fees and costs. In the event that any provision of
this Agreement or any other agreement delivered in connection herewith is
invalid or unenforceable under any applicable statute or rule of law, then
such provision shall be deemed inoperative to the extent that it may conflict
therewith and shall be deemed modified to conform with such statute or rule of
law. Any such provision which may prove invalid or unenforceable under any law
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of any
agreement.

  

  

(c) All notices, demands, requests, consents, approvals, and other
communications required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and, unless
otherwise specified herein, shall be (i) personally served, (ii) deposited in
the mail, registered or certified, return receipt requested, postage prepaid,
(iii) delivered by reputable courier service with charges prepaid, or (iv)
transmitted by hand delivery or facsimile, addressed as set forth below or to
such other address as such party shall have specified most recently by written
notice. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be given
hereunder shall be deemed effective (a) upon hand delivery or delivery by
facsimile, with accurate confirmation generated by the transmitting facsimile
machine, at the address or number designated below (if delivered on a business
day during normal business hours where such notice is to be received), or the
first business day following such delivery (if delivered other than on a
business day during normal business hours where such notice is to be received)
or (b) on the second business day following the date of mailing by express
courier service, fully prepaid, addressed to such address, or upon actual
receipt of such mailing, whichever shall first occur. The addresses for such
communications shall be: (i) if to the Company, to: Simmons First National

(d) The restrictions on transfer described in this Agreement are in addition
to and cumulative with any other restrictions on transfer otherwise agreed to
by Holder or to which Holder is subject under applicable law.

  

  

(f) This Agreement shall be binding upon Holder, its legal representatives,
successors, and assigns.

  

  

(g) This Agreement may be executed in counterparts each of which shall be
deemed to constitute an original, but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument.

  

  

(h) The Company agrees not to take any action or allow any act to be taken
that would be inconsistent with this Agreement.

  

  

(i) Holder acknowledges that this Agreement may not be amended without the
written consent of the Company, which consent may be withheld, delayed, or
denied for any reason or for no reason.
