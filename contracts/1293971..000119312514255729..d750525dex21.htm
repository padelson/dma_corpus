by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount of cash equal to
the Equityholder Representative Fund to provide for

 



\- 11 -  the reimbursement of expenses incurred by the Representative in connection
with the performance of its duties under this Agreement. The deposit of the
Equityholder Representative Fund by Buyer to the Escrow Agent shall
completely discharge Buyers obligations with respect to such amount, and in
no event shall Buyer have any responsibility or liability whatsoever for the
manner in which the Representative administers the
Equityholder Representative Fund, or for causing or ensuring that all or any
portion of the Equityholder Representative Fund is ultimately paid or
distributed to the Equityholders.

 

2.6. _Tax Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained

or entitled by Buyer to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code, or any provision of any applicable Tax law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted by Buyer or the Company
hereunder, such amounts withheld or deducted shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Equityholder, MCOP
Participant or Burks, as applicable, with respect to which such withholding or
deduction was made. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of
the Equityholders and MCOP Participants who are listed on Exhibit I hereto
agree and acknowledge that the Closing Distributable Shares are issued to the
Equityholders and MCOP Participants net of the number of Buyer Shares equal
in value (based on the Buyer Per Share Price) to the amount(s) indicated next
to each such Equityholders and MCOP Participants name on the Closing Cash
Allocation Schedule, and such amounts will be (a) with respect to such
individuals who were employees of the Company immediately prior to the
Closing, remitted by Buyer to the appropriate Tax authorities on behalf of

employee service providers of the Company immediately prior to the Closing,
delivered to such individuals by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the accounts designated by such individuals.

Company Shares shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer certificates
representing all of the Company Shares owned by such Equityholder, in exchange
for Buyer Shares payable in accordance with _Section 2.1_. Such stock
certificates shall be duly endorsed in blank for transfer or shall
be presented with stock powers duly executed in blank, with such signature
guarantees and such other documents as may be reasonably required by Buyer to
effect a valid transfer of such Company Shares by such Equityholder, free and
clear of any and all Liens. Each Equityholder by execution of this Agreement
hereby appoints Buyer as such Equityholders attorney-in-fact to effectuate
transfer of the Company Shares at the Closing.

 

2.8. _Treatment of Stock Options; Termination of Stock Option Plan_.
Immediately prior to the Closing, each Option that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Closing, whether or not then vested or
exercisable, shall be, by virtue of the Closing and without any action on the
part of the Company, Buyer, the Optionholder or any other Person, cancelled in
its entirety and each Optionholder shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto other than the right to receive payments under this Agreement,
in an amount based on the Percentage Share listed next to such persons name
on _Exhibit A_. Immediately prior to the Closing, such Optionholders shall
not exercise such Options. Effective upon the Closing, the Stock Option Plan

 



\- 12 -  shall be terminated in its entirety and all Optionholders shall have no
other rights thereunder except as specifically set forth in this _Section
2.8_.

 

2.9. _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing")
shall take place at the offices of Goodwin Procter LLP, 53 State Street,
Boston, MA 02109, at 10:00 a.m., Boston time, on the third Business Day
following satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the obligations of the
Parties set forth in _Sections 6.1_ and _6.2_ , or at such other place or at
such other time or on such other date as may be mutually agreeable to Buyer
and the Company. The date of the Closing is herein referred to as
the "Closing Date."

2.10. _Contingent Payments_. In addition to the payments on the Closing Date
and any Holdback Amount, upon achievement of the performance goals listed in
_Exhibit B_ attached hereto (which is incorporated herein by reference), and
subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, Buyer shall pay to the
Equityholders and the MCOP Participants the amounts, if any, earned in
accordance with the terms of _Exhibit B_ (the "Contingent Payments"). Any
amount to be so paid shall be delivered to the Equityholders and the MCOP
Participants by check or wire transfer of immediately available funds to such
addresses or accounts as may be designated by the Equityholders and the MCOP
Participants, in each case net of any applicable Taxes as described in
_Section 2.6_, on the date set forth on  _Exhibit B_ ; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if there is a dispute regarding the calculation of any
Contingent Payment, Buyer shall not be obligated to make such Contingent
Payment until such dispute shall have been finally resolved in accordance
with the provisions of _Section 10.13_. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that payment by Buyer of the Contingent
Payments, if any, in accordance with the terms hereof shall not be dependent
upon the continued employment with Buyer or the Company of any Equityholder
or any MCOP Participant.

2.11. _Working Capital Estimate_. At least two Business Days prior to the
Closing, the Company will prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement setting
forth its good faith estimate of the Working Capital of the Company as of the
Closing (the "Estimated Closing Working Capital").

2.12. _Closing Statement; Post-Closing Adjustments to Purchase Price_.

 

(a) _Closing Statement_. Promptly, but in any event within 90 days after the
Closing, Buyer shall furnish to the Representative a written statement (the
"Closing Statement") setting forth as of the Closing the Working Capital (the
"Closing Working Capital"). Unless within the 30-day period following the
Representatives receipt of the Closing Statement, the Representative
delivers written notice to Buyer (the "Dispute Notice") setting forth in
reasonable detail any and all items of disagreement related to the Closing
Statement, including the amount thereof (each, an "Item of Dispute"), the
Closing Statement shall be conclusive and binding upon each of the Parties;
provided that the only basis on which the Representative shall be permitted to
submit an Item of Dispute is that such Item of Dispute was not prepared in
accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement or
the Closing Statement contains a mathematical or clerical error or errors. The
Parties shall and shall cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate fully
with Buyer in connection with the preparation of the Closing Statement. After
the delivery of the Closing Statement, Buyer shall cooperate with the

 



\- 13 -  Representative in connection with its review of the Closing Statement,
including, without limitation, by providing the Representative and its
accountants reasonable access during normal business hours to materials used
in the preparation of the Closing Statement.

(b) _Dispute Resolution by the Parties_. If the Representative delivers the
Dispute Notice to Buyer within the required 30-day period, Buyer and the
Representative shall use reasonable efforts to resolve their differences
concerning the Items of Dispute, and if any Item of Dispute is so resolved,
the Closing Statement shall be modified as necessary to reflect such
resolution; provided that no Item of Dispute shall be resolved so that it is
more than the amount thereof shown in the calculation delivered by the
Representative nor less than the amount thereof shown in the calculation
delivered by Buyer. If all Items of Dispute are so resolved, the Closing
Statement (as so modified) shall be conclusive and binding on all Parties.

 

(c) _Determination by Independent Accounting Firm_. If any Item of Dispute
remains unresolved for a period of 30 days after Buyers receipt of the
Dispute Notice, Buyer and the Representative shall, within 10 days thereafter,
submit the dispute to a mutually agreed upon independent accounting firm (the
"Independent Accounting Firm"). If Buyer and the Representative are unable to
mutually agree upon such an accounting firm within such 10-day period, then
Buyer and the Representative shall, within five days thereafter, each select a
nationally recognized accounting firm. Within five days after their
selection, those two accounting firms shall select a third nationally
recognized accounting firm, which third accounting firm shall act as the
Independent Accounting Firm. Such third nationally recognized accounting firm
shall not be an accounting firm that has performed accounting or similar
services for Buyer or the Representative in the past three years. Buyer and
the Representative shall each provide their respective calculations of the
Closing Working Capital and the Items of Dispute in writing to the
Independent Accounting Firm and shall request that the Independent Accounting
Firm render a written determination, which determination (i) shall be solely
based on whether each such Item of Dispute was prepared in accordance with
the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement or whether each such
Item of Dispute contains a mathematical or clerical error or errors and (ii)
shall not be resolved so the final amount determined by the
Independent Accounting Firm is more than the larger amount thereof shown in
the calculation of the Item of Dispute delivered by the Representative or
Buyer, as the case may be, or less than the smaller amount thereof shown in
the calculation delivered by the Representative or Buyer, as the case may be,
as to each unresolved Item of Dispute as soon as reasonably practicable, but
in no event later than 30 days after its retention, and the Parties shall
cooperate fully with the Independent Accounting Firm so as to enable it to
make such determination as quickly and as accurately as practicable. The
Independent Accounting Firms determination as to each Item of Dispute
submitted to it shall be in writing and shall be conclusive and binding
upon the Parties, absent manifest error or willful misconduct, and the
Closing Working Capital shall be modified to the extent necessary to reflect
such determination. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm
shall be paid by the Party whose calculation of the Closing Working Capital
is furthest from the determination rendered by the Independent Accounting
Firm.

(d)  _Final Closing Working Capital_. The Closing Working Capital shall be
deemed final for the purposes of this _Section 2.12_ upon the earliest of (x)
the failure of the Representative to provide Buyer with a Dispute Notice
within 30 days of Buyers delivery of the Closing Statement, (y) the
resolution of all Items of Dispute pursuant to _Section 2.12(b)_ by the
Representative and Buyer and (z) the resolution of all Items of Dispute,
pursuant to  _Section_

 



\- 14 -   _2.12(c)_ , by the Independent Accounting Firm. Upon the final
determination of the Closing Working Capital as set forth in this paragraph
(d), Buyer shall adjust, if applicable, the Closing Statement accordingly,
and such adjusted Closing Statement shall be deemed final.

(e) _Working Capital Adjustment_. If the amount of the Closing Working
Capital as reflected on the final Closing Statement is less than the Estimated
Closing Working Capital, then the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount
equal to such shortfall (the "Shortfall"). The Shortfall shall be paid by
deducting such number of Holdback Shares equal to the dollar amount of the
Shortfall divided by the Buyer Per Share Price, rounded down to the nearest
whole share, and the Representative shall authorize any payment in respect of
such claims. If the amount of the Closing Working Capital as reflected on the
final Closing Statement is greater than the Estimated Closing Working Capital,
then the Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount equal to such
excess. Buyer shall issue to the Equityholders and the MCOP Participants an
aggregate number of the Buyer Shares having a value equal to such excess
(calculated by dividing the dollar amount of such excess by the Buyer Per
Share Price), which amount shall be allocated among the Equityholders and
MCOP Participants in the same manner as were the Buyer Shares received by such
persons at Closing. Any such payment shall be made within 10 Business Days
after the Closing Statement becomes final and binding upon the Parties.

2.13. _Transfer Taxes_. Any transfer taxes, fees and duties under applicable
law incurred in connection with the sale and transfer of the Company Shares
under this Agreement will be borne and paid by the Equityholders, and the
Equityholders shall promptly reimburse the Company and Buyer for any such tax,
fee or duty which any of them is required to pay under applicable law.

2.14. _Agreement as to Allocation of Consideration_. Each of the Equityholders
and the MCOP Participants hereby acknowledges and agrees that upon the
Closing, the allocation of total consideration among the Equityholders and the
MCOP Participants based on the Percentage Shares, the MCOP Participation
Percentages and the Closing Cash Allocation Schedule set forth on _Exhibit A_
and _Exhibit I_ and in accordance with this _ARTICLE II_ shall represent and
be treated by all such recipients as the correct and proper allocation of
consideration under this Agreement.

jurisdiction outside the United States.

and operated in all material respects in accordance with the laws applicable
with respect to such Employee Program and all agreements related to such
Employee Program. No

 



\- 31 -  litigation or governmental administrative proceeding (or investigation) or
other proceeding (other than those relating to routine claims for benefits) is
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect to any
Employee Program. All payments and/or contributions required to have been made
(under the provisions of any agreements or other governing documents or

for any period for which such Employee Program would not otherwise be covered

of Section 4001(a)(15) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
("ERISA")) for which the Company or any Affiliate could incur liability under
Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA or a plan maintained by more than one employer
as described in Section 413(c) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any
Affiliate has ever maintained any Employee Program that is or was subject to
Title IV of ERISA, Section 412 of the Code, Section 302 of ERISA or is a
Multiemployer Plan and neither the Company nor any Affiliate has incurred any
liability under Title IV of ERISA that has not been paid in full. None of the
Employee Programs provides health care or any other non-pension benefits to
any employees after their employment is terminated (other than as required by

has never promised to provide such post-termination benefits.

 

(e) Each Employee Program that is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan
within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code has been operated and
maintained in operational and documentary compliance with Section 409A of the
Code and applicable guidance thereunder. No payment to be made under any
Employee Program is, or to the knowledge of the Company, will be, subject to
the penalties of Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code.

(f) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby could (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event) (i) result in, or cause the accelerated vesting payment,

benefit to any employee, officer, director or other service provider of the
Company or any of its Affiliates; or (ii) result in any "parachute payment" as
defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (whether or not such payment is
considered to be reasonable compensation for services rendered).

3.19. _Insurance_. _Schedule 3.19_ lists each insurance policy
currently maintained by or on behalf of the Company with respect to its
properties, assets and business, together with a claims history for the past
three years. All of such insurance policies are in full force and effect, and
the Company has never been (i) in default with respect to its Liabilities
under any such insurance

 



\- 32 -  policies or (ii) denied insurance coverage. The Company does not have any
self-insurance or co-insurance programs, and the reserves set forth on the
Latest Balance Sheet are adequate to cover all anticipated Liabilities with
respect to any such self-insurance or coinsurance programs.

3.20. _Suppliers_. _Schedule 3.20_ lists each vendor, supplier, service
provider and other similar business relation of the Company from whom the
Company purchased greater than $10,000 in goods and/or services over the
course of fiscal year 2013 or the interim period of fiscal year 2014, the
amounts owing to each such Person, and whether such amounts are past due. The
Company has not received any indication from any such Person to the effect
that, and the Company has no reason to believe that, such supplier will stop,
materially decrease the rate of, or materially change the terms (whether
related to payment, price or otherwise) with respect to, supplying materials,
products or services to the Company (whether as a result of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents or otherwise).

3.21. _Affiliate Transactions_. Except as disclosed on _Schedule 3.21_ , no
officer, director, employee, stockholder or other Affiliate of the Company or
any individual related by blood, marriage or adoption to any such Person or
any entity in which any such Person owns any beneficial interest
(collectively, the "Insiders"), is a party to any Contract or transaction with
the Company or which pertains to the Business, or has any interest in any
property, real or personal or mixed, tangible or intangible, used in or
pertaining to the Business. _Schedule 3.21_ hereto describes all affiliated
services provided to or on behalf of the Company by any Equityholder or its
Affiliates and to or on behalf of any Equityholder and its Affiliates by the
Company and all affiliate transactions or Contracts among the Company, on the
one hand, and any Equityholder or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand
(including, in each case, the costs charged to or by the Company).

 

3.22. _Compliance with Laws_. The Company has complied in all material
respects with and is in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and
ordinances of foreign, federal, state, municipal and local governments and all
agencies thereof that are applicable to the Company, the Business, the
Companys business practices (including, but not limited to, the Companys
design, production, marketing, sales and distribution of its products and
services) or any owned or leased properties of the Company and to which the
Company may be subject, and no claims have been filed against the Company
alleging a violation of any such law or regulation, and the Company has not
received notice of any such violation.

3.23. _Environmental Matters_. The Company has complied in all respects with
and is currently in compliance with all Environmental Requirements, except
where the failure to comply has not had or could not reasonably be expected to
have or result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect, and has no Liabilities, including, without limitation, corrective,
investigatory or remedial obligations arising under Environmental
Requirements, and the Company has not received any notice, report
or information regarding any Liabilities, including, without limitation,
corrective, investigatory or remedial obligations arising under Environmental
Requirements which relate to the Company or any of its properties or
facilities. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company has
obtained and complied in all material respects with, and is currently in
compliance with, all Permits and other authorizations that may be required
pursuant to any Environmental Requirements for the occupancy of its

 



\- 33 -  properties or facilities or the operation of the Business. Neither this
Agreement nor the other Transaction Documents nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall impose any Liabilities on
the Company or Buyer or otherwise for site investigation or cleanup, or
notification to or consent of any government agencies or third parties under
any Environmental Requirements.

 

3.24. _Powers of Attorney; Guarantees_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.24_
, there are no outstanding powers of attorney executed on behalf of the
Company. The Company is not a guarantor or otherwise liable for any
Indebtedness of any other Person other than endorsements for collection in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.

 

3.25. _Banking Relations_. All of the arrangements that the Company currently
has with any banking institution are completely and accurately described on
_Schedule 3.25_ , indicating with respect to each of such arrangements the
type of arrangement maintained (such as checking account, borrowing
arrangements, safe deposit box, etc.) and the Person or Persons authorized
in respect thereof.

3.26. _Disclosure_. None of this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents
and any of the Schedules, attachments or Exhibits hereto, contains any untrue
statement of a material fact or omits a material fact necessary to make each
statement contained herein or therein, not misleading in light of the
circumstances in which they were made. Except for the representations and
warranties contained in this _ARTICLE III_ (including the related Schedules),
neither the Company nor the Existing Equityholders nor any other Person has
made or makes any other express or implied representation or warranty, either
written or oral, on behalf of the Company, including any representation or
warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the
Business furnished or made available to the Buyer or as to the future
revenue, profitability or success of the Business, or any representation or

following the Closing Date:

(a) _Straddle Periods_. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever it is
necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of the Company for any taxable
period of the Company that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a
"Straddle Period"), the determination of the Taxes of the Company for the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including, and the portion of
the Straddle Period beginning after, the Closing Date shall be determined by
assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable years or periods,
one which ended at the close of the Closing Date and the other which began at
the beginning of the day following the Closing

 



\- 41 -  Date, and items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit, and state and
local apportionment factors of the Company for the Straddle Period, shall be
allocated between such two taxable years or periods on a "closing of the
books basis" by assuming that the books of the Company were closed at the
close of the Closing Date; _provided however_ , that (i) exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the
deduction for depreciation, and (ii) periodic taxes such as real and personal
property taxes, shall be apportioned ratably between such periods on a daily
basis.

 

(b) _Responsibility for Preparing and Filing Certain Tax Returns_.

 

(i) Buyer shall, at its own expense, cause to be prepared and duly and timely
filed all Tax Returns of the Company that are required to be filed after the
Closing Date with respect to Tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date
(any Tax Returns described in this sentence, collectively, "Pre-Closing
Company Returns"), and, to the extent any Taxes due with such Tax Returns are
not provided for by Company or otherwise taken into account as components of
Current Liabilities in the Working Capital calculation, shall cause the
Equityholders to pay to the Company an amount equal to all Taxes required to
be paid with any such Pre-Closing Company Returns. All Pre-Closing Company
Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the Companys past
practice unless otherwise required by applicable law. Not later than thirty
(30) days prior to the due date for filing of any Pre-Closing Company Returns
(including extensions), Buyer shall provide Representative with a copy of such
Pre-Closing Company Return. The Representative shall notify Buyer of any
reasonable objections to any items set forth on such draft Pre-Closing
Company Return at least 10 days prior to the due date for filing, and Buyer
shall consider in good faith such changes to the Pre-Closing Company Return as
Representative may reasonably request.

 

(ii) After the Closing Date, Buyer shall have the right to amend, modify or
otherwise change all Tax Returns of the Company for all pre-closing Tax
periods, provided, however, the Equityholders shall not be responsible under
this Agreement for any increase in Taxes of the Company resulting from any
amendment, modification or change by Buyer to any Pre-Closing Company
Returns, unless such amendment, modification or change to any such Pre-
Closing Company Return is required by applicable law or consented to by the
Representative in writing.

 

(iii) Buyer shall cause to be prepared and timely filed all Tax Returns of the
Company that are required to be filed with respect to any Straddle Period
(collectively the "Straddle Period Company Returns"). All Straddle Period
Company Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the Companys
past practice unless otherwise required by applicable law. Not later than
thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing of any Straddle Period
Company Returns, Buyer shall provide the Representative with a copy of any
such Straddle Period Company Return. The Representative shall notify Buyer of
any reasonable objections to any items set forth on such draft Straddle
Period Company Return at least 10 days prior to the due date for filing, and
Buyer shall consider in good faith such changes to a Straddle Period Company
Return that is provided to the Representative pursuant to the preceding
sentence as the Representative may reasonably request.

(c) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

 



\- 42 - (i) Buyer and the Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and information
that are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other
Proceeding.

 

(ii) Buyer and the Representative further agree, upon request, to use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(iii) Buyer and Representative shall notify the other party in writing within
thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of written notice of any pending or
threatened Tax examination, audit or other administrative or judicial
proceeding (a "Tax Contest") that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or to
the Straddle Period.

 

(d) _Other Tax Matters_. No indemnification shall be provided under this
Agreement, and the Equityholders shall not otherwise be liable, for any
election under Section 338 that is filed with respect to the purchase and sale
described herein. If, as a result of the Closing, the Company shall join the
consolidated federal income Tax return of Buyer or its Affiliates, all
Company deductions accrued for federal income Tax purposes on or before the
Closing Date (including, without limitation the deductions set forth on
_Schedule 7.3(d)_ ) shall be reported on the Companys final Pre-Closing
Company Return and shall not be allocated to the federal income Tax Return of
Buyer (or its Affiliates) consolidated group under Treasury Regulation
1.1502-76 or other applicable law to the extent permitted by applicable law.
For tax reporting purposes, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the
Parties shall report payments made under _ARTICLE II_ as: (i) payments made in
exchange for Company Shares, to the extent such payments are allocated under
this Agreement to the sale of such Shares by the Existing Equityholders; and
(ii) compensatory payments, to the extent such payments are Option
cancellation payments under _Section 2.8_ or are otherwise paid in accordance
with the Management Compensation Plan.

 

ARTICLE VIII

INDEMNIFICATION AND RELATED MATTERS

8.1. _Survival_.

 

(a) _Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements_. All
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or in any certificate delivered in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall survive the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
Party shall be entitled to recover for any Loss pursuant to _Section
8.2(a)(i)_, _Section 8.2(b)(i)_ or _Section 8.2(c)(i)_ unless written notice
of a claim thereof (a "Claim") is delivered to the other Party no later than
the Applicable Limitation Date. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Applicable Limitation Date" means the date of expiration of the Holdback
Period;

 



\- 43 -  provided that the Applicable Limitation Date shall be (x) the date of
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including any extensions
thereto to the extent that such statute of limitations may be tolled) with
respect to the following Losses: (i) with respect to any Loss arising from or
related to a breach of the representations and warranties of the Company and
the Equityholders set forth in _Section 3.2_ (Organization; Corporate Power;
Capitalization), _Section 3.3_ (Authorization of Transactions), _Section
3.12_ (Intellectual Property) and _Section 3.23_ (Environmental Matters), and

representations and warranties of the Equityholders set forth in _Section

and (y) the date described below with respect to any Loss arising from or
related to a breach of the representations and warranties of the Company and
the Equityholders set forth in _Section 3.10_ (Taxes).

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the representations
and warranties set out in _Section 3.10_ (Taxes) shall survive for a period
of 90 days following the expiration of all periods allowed for objecting to or
appealing from the final determination of any proceedings relating to any
assessment, reassessment or additional assessment of the Company by any
governmental authority in respect of any Tax period ending on or prior to the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall in no circumstances be
allowed to voluntarily extend any such periods, even if requested to do so by
a governmental authority, without the consent of the Representative not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. For these purposes, a final
determination means (i) the expiry of the period to appeal from or object to
the relevant assessment, reassessment or additional assessment by a taxing
authority if no appeal is taken or no objection is made, (ii) the entering
into of any agreement by the Company and such a taxing authority in full
settlement of a dispute regarding such assessment, reassessment, additional
assessment or proposed assessment, reassessment or additional assessment or
(iii) the decision by a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction regarding
the relevant assessment, reassessment or additional assessment from which no
appeal may be taken or the period during which an appeal may be taken has
expired and no appeal has been taken.

 

(b) _Special Rule for Intentional Misrepresentation and Fraud_.
Notwithstanding anything in this _ARTICLE VIII_ to the contrary, in the event
any Party to this Agreement perpetrates a fraud on another Party hereto or
makes an intentional misrepresentation hereunder, then any Party that suffers
any Loss by reason thereof shall be entitled to seek recovery therefor without
regard to any limitation set forth in this Agreement (whether a temporal
limitation, a dollar limitation or otherwise).

8.2.  _Indemnification_.

(a) _Equityholders  Indemnification for Company-Related Claims_. Subject to
each of the limitations set forth in this _ARTICLE VIII_ , the Equityholders
shall, jointly and severally, indemnify Buyer and its officers, directors,
employees, agents, representatives, Affiliates, successors and permitted
assigns (collectively, the "Buyer Parties") and hold each of them harmless
from and against and pay on behalf of or reimburse such Buyer Parties in
respect of any loss, Liability, demand, claim, action, cause of action, cost,
damage, deficiency, Tax, penalty, fine or expense, whether or not arising out
of third party claims (including, without limitation, interest, penalties,
reasonable attorneys, accountants and other professionals fees and
expenses, court costs and all amounts paid in investigation, defense or
settlement of any of

 



\- 44 -  the foregoing) (collectively, "Losses" and individually, a "Loss") which any
such Buyer Party may suffer, sustain or become subject to, as a result of,
in connection with, relating or incidental to or by virtue of:

(i) any misrepresentation or the breach of any representation or
warranty made by the Company or the Equityholders contained in _ARTICLE III_
of this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or any certificate
delivered in connection herewith; or

 

(ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement by the Company contained in this
Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or any certificate delivered in

contemplated hereby based upon any alleged agreement, arrangement or
understanding between the claimant and the Company or any Equityholder or any
of their agents or representatives;

(iv) any liability of the Company for Taxes arising from an event
or transaction prior to the Closing or as a result of the Closing which has
not been paid or provided for or reserved against by the Company including,
without limitation, any increase in Taxes due to the unavailability of any
loss or deduction claimed by the Company;

(v) the failure of any item set forth in Exhibit A or the Closing Cash
Allocation Schedule to be accurate, true and correct in all respects as of
the Closing (subject to the assumptions set forth therein with respect to Tax
estimates);

(vi) any claim by or on behalf of an Equityholder or MCOP Participant
asserting that the allocation of consideration as among the Equityholders and
the MCOP Participants as set forth in this Agreement is in any way inaccurate,
inequitable or otherwise unacceptable; or

(vii) the item set forth on _Schedule 8.2(a)(vii)_.

 

(b) _Equityholders  Indemnification_. Each Equityholder shall on a several
basis indemnify the Buyer Parties and hold the Buyer Parties harmless from
and against and pay on behalf of or reimburse the Buyer Parties in respect of
any Loss which the Buyer Parties may suffer, sustain or become subject to, as
a result of, in connection with, relating to or incidental or by virtue of:

(i) any misrepresentation or the breach of any representation or warranty made
by such Equityholder contained in this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents or any certificate delivered in connection herewith;

(ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement made by such Equityholder
contained in this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or any
certificate delivered in connection herewith;

 



\- 45 - (iii) any claim for payment of fees and/or expenses as a broker or finder in
connection with the origin, negotiation or execution of this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby based upon any alleged agreement, arrangement or
understanding between the claimant and such Equityholder or any of its agents
or representatives (it being agreed and understood that, for purposes of this
_Section 8.2(b)(iii)_, the Company shall not be considered an agent or
representative of any Equityholder); or

 

(iv) the assertion against any Buyer Party of any Liability in the nature of
or relating to Taxes of such Equityholder, regardless of when incurred.

(c) _Buyer Indemnification_. Buyer shall indemnify the Equityholders, the
Representative and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
representatives, Affiliates, successors and permitted assigns (collectively,
the "Seller Parties") and hold each of them harmless from and against and pay
on behalf of or reimburse the Seller Parties in respect of any Loss which any
such Seller Party may suffer, sustain or become subject to, as the result of,
in connection with, relating to or incidental to or by virtue of:

 

(i) the breach by Buyer of any representation or warranty made by Buyer
contained in this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or
any certificate delivered in connection herewith;

(ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement made by Buyer contained in this
Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or any certificate delivered in
connection herewith;

(iii) any claim for payment of fees and/or expenses as a broker or finder in
connection with the origin, negotiation or execution of this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby based upon any alleged agreement, arrangement
or understanding between the claimant and Buyer or any of their respective
agents or representatives; or

(iv) the assertion against any Seller Party of any Liability in the nature of
or relating to Taxes of the Company, Buyer or its Affiliates arising from an
event or transaction occurring after the Closing.

 

(d) _Limitations on Indemnity_. Subject to _Section 8.1(b)_, the
indemnification provided for in _Sections 8.2(a)_ ,  _8.2(b)_ and _8.2(c)_
above is subject to the following limitations:

(i) No Party shall be liable hereunder with respect to Claims referred to in
_Sections 8.2(a)_ , _8.2(b)_ and _8.2(c)_ above unless the other Party gives
written notice thereof on or before the Applicable Limitation Date.
Notwithstanding any implication to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
so long as a Party delivers written notice of a Claim on or before the
Applicable Limitation Date, the other Party shall be required to indemnify
hereunder for all Losses that such Parties may incur (subject to clause
(d)(ii) below, to the extent applicable) in respect of the matters that are
the subject of such Claim, regardless of when incurred.

 



\- 46 - (ii) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary (but
subject to the remainder of this _Section 8.2(d)(ii)_), no Indemnifying
Party shall be liable to the Buyer Parties or the Seller Parties, as the case
may be, (A) for any Loss arising under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_, _8.2(b)(i)_ or 
_8.2(c)(i)_ above unless the aggregate amount of all Losses incurred by the
Buyer Parties or the Seller Parties, as applicable, exceeds $75,000 (the
"Basket"), in which case such Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the
full amount of all such Losses or (B) for any Loss arising under _Section
8.2(a)(i)_, _8.2(b)(i)_ or _8.2(c)(i)_ to the extent that the aggregate amount
of all such Losses exceeds the Purchase Price plus up to $6.0 million
of Contingent Payments earned or (C) for any Loss arising under Section
8.2(a)(vii) to the extent that the aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds
the Purchase Price plus up to $15.0 million of Contingent Payments earned or
(D) for any Loss arising under _Section 8.2(a)(ii)-(a)(vi),_
_8.2(b)(ii)-(iv)_ , or _8.2(c)(ii)-(iv)_ to the extent that the aggregate
amount of all such Losses exceeds the Purchase Price plus any Contingent
Payments earned and payable (the limitations set forth in _Sections
8.2(d)(ii)(B)-(D)_ shall be referred to as the "Cap"). The Buyer Parties
shall first satisfy Claims for indemnification pursuant to this _ARTICLE VIII_
by deducting such number of Holdback Shares equal to the amount paid pursuant
to this _Section 8.2(d)(ii)_ divided by Buyer Per Share Price, it being
agreed and understood that the number of Holdback Shares remaining to offset
indemnifiable Losses shall not limit or otherwise impair the Buyer Parties
right to recover for any indemnifiable Losses pursuant to this _ARTICLE VIII_.
Subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section 8.2(d)_, and in
addition to all other rights and remedies that a Buyer Party may have
(including, without limitation, the right to collect directly from such
Equityholder after no Holdback Shares remain available to offset indemnifiable
Losses), a Buyer Party may set off Claims for Losses against Contingent
Payments currently due, or which may become due thereafter, to the
Equityholders under this Agreement (including, without limitation, any
Contingent Payment payable after the Applicable Limitation Date; provided,
however, that for the sake of clarity, it is acknowledged and agreed that the
ability of a Buyer Party to recover from the Contingent Payments shall not be
deemed in any manner to extend any Applicable Limitation Date).
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Basket shall not apply with respect to any Loss arising from or related to a
breach of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.2_
(Organization; Corporate Power; Capitalization),  _Section 3.3_
(Authorization of Transactions), _Section 3.10_ (Taxes), _Section 3.12_
(Intellectual Property), _Section 3.14_ (Brokerage), _Section 3.23_
(Environmental Matters), _ARTICLE IV_  (Representations and Warranties of the
Existing Equityholders), _Section 5.2_ (Authorization of Transaction) and
_Section 5.8_ (Brokerage).

 

(iii) Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to _Section 8.2_ in respect
of any Loss shall be limited to the amount of any liability or damage that
remains after deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds and any indemnity,
contribution or other similar payment actually received by the Indemnified
Party in respect of any such Claim.

 

(iv) Under no circumstances (other than as set forth in _Section 8.1(b))_
will any individual Equityholder be subject to indemnification for Losses
under this Agreement in an aggregate amount in excess of the Purchase Price
paid to such Equityholder (either in its capacity as an Equityholder or a MCOP
Participant) plus any Contingent Payments earned and payable to such
Equityholder (either in its capacity as an Equityholder or a MCOP
Participant).

(e) _Procedure_. If a Party seeks indemnification under this _ARTICLE VIII_ ,

 



\- 47 -  such Party (the "Indemnified Party") shall give written notice to the other
Party(ies) (the "Indemnifying Party") promptly after receiving written notice
of any action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim against it
(if by a third party) or discovering the liability, obligation or facts giving
rise to such claim for indemnification, describing the claim, the amount
thereof (if known and quantifiable), and the basis thereof; provided that the
failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party promptly shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its Liabilities hereunder except to the extent such
failure shall have materially prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. In that
regard, if any action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim shall
be brought or asserted by any third party that, if adversely determined, would
entitle the Indemnified Party to indemnity pursuant to  _ARTICLE VIII_ , the
Indemnified Party shall notify promptly the Indemnifying Party of the same in
writing, specifying in reasonable detail the basis of such Claim, and the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to control the defense of such action,
lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim giving rise to the
Indemnified Partys claim for indemnification at the Indemnifying Partys
expense, and at the Indemnifying Partys option (subject to the limitations
set forth below) shall be entitled to appoint lead counsel of such defense
with a reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party;
provided that, in the event that the Indemnifying Party elects to control such
defense, such Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have agreed to be fully
responsible (with no reservation of rights) for all Losses relating to such
claim, subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 8.2(d)(ii)_.

 

Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the contrary, the
Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume control of such defense
and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by the
Indemnified Party, if the Claim over which the Indemnifying Party seeks to
assume control (i) seeks non-monetary relief, (ii) involves criminal
or quasi-criminal allegations, (iii) involves a Claim to which the
Indemnified Party reasonably believes an adverse determination would have a
material and adverse effect on the Indemnified Partys reputation or future
business prospects, (iv) involves a Claim with respect to Taxes, (v) involves
a Claim that the Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to vigorously
prosecute or defend or (vi) involves a claim that is reasonably expected to
result in liability to the Indemnified Party in excess of the result of (A)
the value of the remaining Holdback Shares calculated by multiplying such
shares by the Buyer Per Share Price minus (B) the sum of all other Losses
specified in any then unresolved indemnification claims made by the Buyer
Parties pursuant to this _ARTICLE VIII_.

If the Indemnifying Party exercises the right to control the defense of any
third-party claim as provided above, then the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to employ its own counsel in any such action and to participate in the
defense thereof at its own expense, unless the Indemnifying Party has
specifically authorized the employment of such counsel in writing, in which
case the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by the Indemnifying
Party. Similarly, if the Indemnified Party controls the defense of any such
claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to employ its own
counsel in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof at its
own expense. If the Indemnified Party determines in its reasonable discretion
that there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest
that would make it inappropriate for the same counsel to represent both the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to retain its own counsel in each jurisdiction for which the
Indemnified Party reasonably determines counsel is required, at the expense of
the Indemnifying Party.

 



\- 48 - In the event that the Indemnifying Party exercises the right to control the
defense of any third-party claim as provided above, then the Indemnified
Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense. Similarly,
in the event that the Indemnified Party is, directly or indirectly,
controlling the defense of any such claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall
cooperate with the Indemnified Party in such defense. The Indemnifying Party
shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party before
entering into any settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend such claim.

(f) _Payments_. Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or finally
adjudicated to be payable pursuant to this _ARTICLE VIII_ , to the extent
that the Indemnified Party is the Buyer, then the Buyer shall first recover
the Loss by set off against the Holdback Shares as described above. If the
Loss that is to be recovered by a Buyer Party pursuant to the provisions of
this _ARTICLE VIII_ (and subject to the limitations set forth herein) exceeds
the value of the then-remaining Holdback Shares or if the Indemnified Party is
one of the Seller Parties, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the Indemnified
Party in immediately available funds promptly after the Indemnified Party
provides the Indemnifying Party with written notice of a Claim hereunder and
the Indemnifying Party agrees in writing to pay such Claim.

 

(g) _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. The Parties hereto agree to treat
all payments made pursuant to this _ARTICLE VIII_ as adjustments to the
Purchase Price for Tax purposes and that such treatment shall govern for
purposes hereof, except to the extent inconsistent with the laws of a
particular jurisdiction.

 

(h) _Contribution_. If and to the extent any provision of this _ARTICLE VIII_
is unenforceable for any reason, the Indemnifying Party hereby agrees to make
the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of any Loss for which
indemnification is provided for in this _ARTICLE VIII_ that is permissible
under applicable legal requirements. Following the Closing, none of the
Equityholders shall have any right of indemnification, contribution or
subrogation against the Company with respect to any indemnification made by or
on behalf of such Equityholder under this _ARTICLE VIII_.

 

(i) _Exclusive Remedy_. Subject to _Section 8.1(b)_, from and after the
Closing, the indemnification provided pursuant to this  _ARTICLE VIII_ shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy hereto for any Loss resulting from, with
respect to or arising out of any breach or claim in connection with this
Agreement, any Exhibit or Schedule hereto or any certificate or
writing delivered in connection with this Agreement, regardless of the cause
of action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement
shall limit a Partys right to pursue equitable remedies, including, without
limitation, injunctive relief and specific performance in accordance with
_ARTICLE IX_ hereof.

ARTICLE IX

 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

9.1. _Press Releases and Announcements_. No press releases related to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, or other announcements to
the employees of the

 



\- 49 -  Company, shall be issued without Buyers prior written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 

9.2. _Further Assurances_. Each Equityholder shall execute and deliver such
further instruments of conveyance and transfer and take such additional
action as Buyer may reasonably request to effect, consummate, confirm or
evidence the sale and transfer to Buyer of the Company Shares and any other
transactions contemplated hereby. In the event of any Claim brought or
asserted by Buyer against a third party or brought or asserted by a third
party against Buyer, each Equityholder shall cooperate with Buyer and shall
provide to Buyer such information, documents or other instruments, and shall
do and perform such other acts and things as may be reasonably necessary or
desirable, in Buyers discretion, to assist with or defend against such Claim.

9.3.  _Specific Performance_. Each Equityholder acknowledges that the
Companys business is unique and recognizes and affirms that in the event of a
breach of this Agreement by the Company or such Equityholder, money damages
may be inadequate and Buyer may have no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly,
each Equityholder agrees that Buyer shall have the right, in addition to any
other rights and remedies existing in its favor, to enforce its rights and the
Company and each such Equityholders obligations hereunder not only by an
action or actions for damages but also by an action or actions for specific
performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief, in each case without
the requirement of posting a bond or proving actual damages. If any such
action is brought by Buyer to enforce this Agreement, each Equityholder hereby
waives the defense that there is an adequate remedy at law.

 

9.4. _Expenses_. Each of the Parties shall pay all of its own fees, costs and
expenses (including, without limitation, fees, costs and expenses of legal
counsel, investment bankers, brokers or other representatives and consultants
and appraisal fees, costs and expenses) incurred in connection with the
negotiation of the Letter of Intent, this Agreement, the other
Transaction Documents, the performance of its obligations hereunder and
thereunder, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby.

 

9.5. _Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation and Confidentiality_.

 

(a) _Non-Competition_. During the period beginning on the Closing Date and
ending on the third anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Non-Compete
Period"), except as necessary for a Founder Equityholder to perform his
services pursuant to any contract between such Founder Equityholder and Buyer
(or with the Company or any Affiliate of Buyer), the Founder Equityholders
shall not, and shall not authorize any of their respective Affiliates to,
directly or indirectly, engage (whether as an owner, operator, manager,
employee, officer, director, consultant, advisor, representative or otherwise)
anywhere in the world in any business or activities that the Company conducts
or proposes to conduct as of the Closing Date, including, without limitation,
(i) developing, implementing, marketing, distributing and selling products and
other services competitive with the Business and (ii) the development or sale
of any products or services that are competitive with the Products, the
Company Intellectual Property Assets or the Business; provided that neither
(a) the ownership of less than 2% of the outstanding stock of any publicly
traded corporation nor (b) with respect to Dr. Andrew Scharenberg, M.D., any
activities related to Dr. Scharenbergs faculty obligations to the University
of Washington or 

 



\- 50 -  Seattle Childrens Hospital, shall be deemed to be "engaging" solely by
reason thereof in any of such business or activities.

 

(b) _Non-Solicitation_. Each Founder Equityholder agrees that, during the Non-
Compete Period, without the prior written consent of Buyer, such Founder
Equityholder shall not, and shall not authorize any of his Affiliates to,
directly or indirectly:

(i) contact, approach or solicit for the purpose of offering employment to or
hiring (whether as an employee, consultant, agent, independent contractor or
otherwise) or actually hire any employee of the Company or of Buyer and its
Affiliates introduced to such Founder Equityholder in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder;

(ii) solicit or attempt to induce any business relation of Buyer into any
business relationship which might materially harm the Company, Buyer or any of
their respective Affiliates, or to divert any such business relation to any
other entity or Person; or

 

(iii) disparage the Company, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates or
any of their respective officers, directors, principals or employees.

(c) _Confidentiality_. Each Equityholder shall treat and hold as confidential
any information concerning the business and affairs of the Company that is
transferred hereby that is not already generally available to the public,
including any notes, analyses, compilations, studies, forecasts,
interpretations or other documents that are derived from, contain, reflect
or are based upon any such information (the "Confidential Information"),
refrain from using any of the Confidential Information except in connection
with this Agreement, and deliver promptly to Buyer, at the request and option
of Buyer, all tangible embodiments (and all copies) of the Confidential
Information which are in its possession or under its control. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Confidential Information shall not include information that is
(i) generally available to the public other than as a result of a breach of
this _Section 9.5(c)_ or other act or omission of any Equityholder or (ii)
rightfully received after the Closing Date from a third party not under any
obligation of confidentiality with respect to such information. In the event
that any Equityholder is requested or required (by oral question or request
for information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena,
civil investigative demand, or similar process) to disclose any Confidential
Information, such Person shall notify Buyer promptly of the request or
requirement so that Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order or waive
compliance with the provisions of this  _Section 9.5(c)_. If, in the absence
of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, any Equityholder
is, on the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any Confidential
Information to any tribunal or else stand liable for contempt, such Person
may disclose the Confidential Information to the tribunal; provided that such
disclosing Person shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain, at the request
of Buyer, an order or other assurance that confidential treatment shall be
accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information required to be
disclosed as Buyer shall designate.

(d) _Non-disclosure_. The Parties shall keep confidential the subject matter
described herein and the fact that negotiations are taking place until the
content and timing of a public announcement are mutually agreed upon or until
the Closing, whichever is earlier, and, in

 



\- 51 -  such case such public announcement shall be made only pursuant to _Section
9.1_ except if otherwise required by applicable law, in which case the Party
required to make a public disclosure agrees to inform the other Party prior
to any disclosure and such disclosure shall be prepared jointly by the
Representative and Buyer.

 

(e) _Remedy for Breach_. Each Equityholder acknowledges and agrees that in the
event of a breach by it (or any of its Affiliates) of any of the provisions
of this _Section 9.5_, monetary damages shall not constitute a sufficient
remedy. Consequently, in the event of any such breach and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, Buyer and/or its successors
or assigns may, in addition to other rights and remedies existing in their
favor, apply to any court of law or equity of competent jurisdiction for
specific performance and/or injunctive or other relief in order to enforce or
prevent any violations of the provisions hereof, in each case without the
requirement of posting a bond or proving actual damages.

(f) _Enforcement_. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
declares that any term or provision of this _Section 9.5_ is invalid or
unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making the determination of
invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope,
duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or
phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of
the time within which the judgment may be appealed.

 

(g) _Acknowledgment_. Each Equityholder acknowledges and agrees that (i) the
restrictions contained in this _Section 9.5_ are reasonable in all respects
(including, without limitation, with respect to the subject matter, time
period and geographical area) and are necessary to protect Buyers interest
in, and value of, the Company, (ii) the Equityholders are primarily
responsible for the creation of such value, and (iii) Buyer would not have
consummated the transactions contemplated hereby without the restrictions
contained in this _Section 9.5_.

 

(h) _Obligations_. The Company and each Equityholders obligations under this
_Section 9.5_ are several and not joint. 

9.6. _Transitional Assistance_. No Equityholder shall in any manner take any
action which is designed, intended or would reasonably be anticipated to have
the effect of discouraging suppliers, vendors, service providers, employees,
lessors, licensors and other business relations of the Company from
maintaining the same business relationships with the Company, Buyer and
its Affiliates after the date of this Agreement.

9.7. _Appointment of Representative_.

 

(a) _Powers of Attorney_. Each Equityholder irrevocably constitutes and
appoints Dr. Andrew Scharenberg, M.D. (the "Representative") as such
Equityholders true and lawful agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact and agent and
authorizes the Representative acting for such Equityholder and in such
Equityholders name, place and stead, in any and all capacities to do and
perform every act and thing required or permitted to be done by such
Equityholder or the

 



\- 52 -  Representative hereunder or otherwise in connection with the agreements and
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as fully to all intents and
purposes as such Equityholder might or could do in person, including, without
limitation:

(i) deliver all notices required to be delivered by such Equityholder under
this Agreement, including, without limitation, any notice of a Claim for
which indemnification is sought under _Section 8.2_;

(ii) receive all notices required to be delivered to such Equityholder under
this Agreement, including, without limitation, any notice of a Claim for which
indemnification is sought under _Section 8.2_;

 

(iii) take any and all action on behalf of such Equityholder from time to time
as the Representative may deem necessary or desirable to defend, pursue,
resolve and/or settle disputes or claims under this Agreement, including,
without limitation, Claims for indemnification under _Section 8.2_ or,
subject to _Section 2.10_ and _Exhibit B_ , claims related to any Contingent
Payment;

(iv) vote or consent on behalf of the Equityholders with respect to matters
under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby;

(v) administer the Equityholder Representative Fund;

 

(vi) subject to _Section 2.10_ and _Exhibit B_ , receive payment of any
Contingent Payment from Buyer and make payment of such amounts to the
Equityholders in accordance with the terms hereof; and

(vii) to engage and employ agents and representatives (including accountants,
legal counsel and other professionals) and to incur such other expenses as he
deems necessary or prudent in connection with the administration of the
foregoing.

 

Each Equityholder grants unto said attorney-in-fact and agent full power and
authority to do and perform each and every act and thing necessary or
desirable to be done in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, as fully to all intents and purposes as the undersigned might or
could do in person, hereby ratifying and confirming all that the
Representative may lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof. The
foregoing authorization is granted and conferred in consideration for the
various agreements and covenants of the Equityholders and each Equityholder,
by executing this Agreement, agrees that such agency, proxy and power of
attorney are coupled with an interest, and are therefore irrevocable without
the consent of the Representative and Buyer and shall survive the death,
incapacity, or bankruptcy of such Equityholder. Each
Equityholder acknowledges and agrees that upon execution of this Agreement,
any delivery by the Representative of any waiver, amendment, agreement,
opinion, certificate or other documents executed by the Representative or any
decisions made by the Representative pursuant to this _Section 9.7_, such
Person shall be bound by such documents or decision as fully as if such
Equityholder had executed and delivered such documents or made such decisions.

 

(b) _Liability_. The Representative shall not have by reason of this Agreement
a

 



\- 53 -  fiduciary relationship in respect of any Equityholder, except in respect of
amounts received on behalf of such Equityholder. The Representative shall not
be liable to any Equityholder for any action taken or omitted by him or any
agent employed by him hereunder or under any other Transaction Document, or in
connection therewith, except that the Representative shall not be relieved of
any liability imposed by law for willful misconduct. The Representative shall
not be liable to the Equityholders for any apportionment or distribution of
payments made by him in good faith, and if any such apportionment or
distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in error the
sole recourse of any Equityholder to whom payment was due, but not made,
shall be to recover from the other Equityholders any payment in excess of the
amount to which they are determined to have been entitled. The Representative
shall not be required to make any inquiry concerning either the performance
or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement.

(c)  _Replacement of the Representative_. Upon the death, disability or
incapacity of the initial Representative appointed pursuant to _Section
9.7(a)_ above, each Equityholder acknowledges and agrees that such
Representatives executor, guardian or legal representative, as the case may
be, shall appoint a replacement reasonably believed by such person (and
reasonably approved by Buyer) as capable of carrying out the duties and
performing the obligations of the Representative hereunder within 30 days. In
the event that the Representative resigns for any reason, the Representative
shall, subject to Buyers approval which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, select another representative to fill such vacancy. Any substituted
representative shall be deemed the Representative for all purposes of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.

 

(d) _Actions of the Representative; Liability of the Representative_. The
Company and each Equityholder agrees that Buyer shall be entitled to rely on
any action taken by the Representative, on behalf of the Equityholders,
pursuant to _Section 9.7(a)_ above (each, an "Authorized Action"), and that
each Authorized Action shall be binding on each Equityholder as fully as if
such Equityholder had taken such Authorized Action. Each of the Equityholders
severally and not jointly, on a pro-rata basis based on their respective
Percentage Share agree to pay, and to indemnify and hold harmless, each of
the Buyer Parties from and against any Losses which they may suffer, sustain,
or become subject to, as the result of any claim by any Person that an
Authorized Action is not binding on, or enforceable against, the Equityholders
(and each Equityholder expressly waives and disclaims any such claim against
the Buyer Parties). In addition, the Equityholders hereby release and
discharge Buyer from and against any liability arising out of or in connection
with the Representatives failure to distribute any amounts received by the
Representative on the Equityholders behalf to the Equityholders.

(e)  _Indemnification of Representative_. The Representative will receive no
compensation for services as the Representative; provided, however, that the
Representative shall be entitled to reimbursement of its expenses from the
Equityholder Representative Fund. Each Equityholder severally and not
jointly, on a pro rata basis based on their respective Percentage Shares,
indemnifies the Representative and its agents and holds the Representative and
its agents harmless against any Loss incurred in good faith by or on behalf
of the Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance
or administration of the Representatives duties hereunder, including the
reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the
Representative.

 



\- 54 - (f) _Distribution of Equityholder Representative Fund_. Upon either (x) the
expiration of the Holdback Period, or (y) in the event that as of the date of
the expiration of the Holdback Period, Claims have been made against the
Holdback Shares that remain subject to dispute, after the date on which (i)
the amount of any payment required to be made on account of such disputed
Claim is determined by mutual agreement of Buyer and the Representative or
(ii) both such amount and the Equityholders obligation to pay such amount
have been determined by a final judgment of a court having jurisdiction over
such proceeding pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Representative
shall distribute (or cause to be distributed) any funds remaining in the
Equityholder Representative Fund to the Equityholders and the MCOP
Participants, allocated in accordance with their respective Percentage Shares
and MCOP Participant Percentages, respectively, in the same manner as were the
Buyer Shares received by such persons at Closing (less applicable
withholding Taxes, if applicable).

a waiver of any subsequent breach or waiver of the same term or condition or
as a waiver of any other term or condition of this Agreement. The failure of
any Party to assert any of its rights under this _Section 10.2_ shall not
constitute a waiver of any of such rights. No course of dealing between or
among any Persons having any interest in this Agreement shall be deemed
effective to modify, amend or discharge any part of this Agreement or any
rights or obligations of any Party under or by reason of this Agreement. All
rights and remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not

10.4. _Binding Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the
provisions hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns; _provided_ that
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder may be assigned by the Company, any Equityholder or the
Representative, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written
consent of Buyer. This Agreement shall be assignable by Buyer so long as Buyer
remains fully responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder.

10.5. _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be
prohibited by or invalid under applicable law or public policy, such provision

invalidity, and all other terms of this Agreement shall remain in full force
and effect for so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
Party.

 

10.6. _Construction_. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to
be the language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no
rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Party. Nothing in the
Schedules attached hereto shall be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to
a representation or warranty made herein unless the Schedule identifies the
exception with reasonable particularity and describes the relevant facts in
reasonable detail. The Parties intend that each representation, warranty and
covenant contained herein shall have independent significance. If any Party
has breached any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein in any
respect, the fact that there exists another representation, warranty or
covenant relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative
levels of specificity) that the Party has not breached shall not detract from
or mitigate the fact that the Party is in breach of the first representation,
warranty or covenant. The word

 



\- 56 -  "including" means including without limitation regardless of whether such
words are included in some contexts but not others.

 

10.7. _Captions_. The captions used in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement and shall not
be deemed to limit, characterize or in any way affect any provision of this

10.8. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the Exhibits and Schedules
hereto, and the documents referred to herein contain the entire agreement
between the Parties and supersede any prior understandings, agreements or
representations by or between the Parties, written or oral, which may have
related to the subject matter hereof in any way, including, without
limitation, the Letter of Intent.

10.9. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same instrument.

10.10. _Governing Law_. All questions concerning the construction, validity
and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts applicable to
contracts executed in and to be performed in the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts.

10.11. _Parties in Interest_. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
is intended to confer on any Person other than the Parties and their
respective successors and assigns any rights or remedies under or by virtue of
this Agreement; provided, however, that the MCOP Participants shall be third-
party beneficiaries of this Agreement to the extent of their interest as
such.

10.12. _CONSENT TO JURISDICTION_. SUBJECT TO _SECTION 10.13_ , THE PARTIES
AGREE THAT JURISDICTION AND VENUE IN ANY ACTION BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY PURSUANT
TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL PROPERLY AND EXCLUSIVELY LIE IN ANY FEDERAL OR STATE
COURT LOCATED IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS. BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY
OF THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE
JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY WITH
RESPECT TO SUCH ACTION. THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AGREE THAT VENUE WOULD BE
PROPER IN SUCH COURT, AND HEREBY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION THAT SUCH COURT IS AN
IMPROPER OR INCONVENIENT FORUM FOR THE RESOLUTION OF SUCH ACTION. THE PARTIES
FURTHER AGREE THAT THE MAILING BY CERTIFIED OR REGISTERED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT
REQUESTED, OF ANY PROCESS REQUIRED BY ANY SUCH COURT SHALL CONSTITUTE
VALID AND LAWFUL SERVICE OF PROCESS AGAINST THEM, WITHOUT NECESSITY FOR
SERVICE BY ANY OTHER MEANS PROVIDED BY STATUTE OR RULE OF COURT.

10.13.  _Arbitration_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, any
dispute, controversy or claim arising under or relating to this Agreement or
any breach or threatened

 



\- 57 -  breach thereof ("Arbitrable Dispute") shall be resolved by final and binding
arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under its
Commercial Arbitration Rules, subject to the following:

(a) Any Party may demand that any Arbitrable Dispute be submitted to binding
arbitration. The demand for arbitration shall be in writing, shall be served
on the other Party in the manner prescribed herein for the giving of notices,
and shall set forth a short statement of the factual basis for the claim,
specifying the matter or matters to be arbitrated.

(b) The arbitration shall be conducted by a panel of three arbitrators, one
selected by Buyer, one selected by the Representative and the third to be
selected jointly by the arbitrators selected by Buyer and the Representative
(collectively, the "Arbitrators") who shall conduct such evidentiary or other
hearings as they deem necessary or appropriate and thereafter shall make
their determination as soon as practicable. Any arbitration pursuant hereto
shall be conducted by the Arbitrators under the guidance of the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Evidence, but the Arbitrators
shall not be required to comply strictly with such Rules in conducting any
such arbitration. All such arbitration proceedings shall take place in the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

 

(c) Except as provided herein (including pursuant to _ARTICLE VIII_ to the
extent such items constitute Losses):

 

(i) each Party shall bear its own "Costs and Fees," which are defined as all
reasonable pre-award expenses of the arbitration, including travel expenses,
out-of-pocket expenses (including, but not limited to, copying and telephone)
witness fees, and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses;

 

(ii) the fees and expenses of the Arbitrators and all other costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the arbitration shall be borne equally by the
Parties; and

(iii) notwithstanding the foregoing, the Arbitrators shall be empowered to
require any one or more of the Parties to bear all or any portion of such
Costs and Fees and/or the fees and expenses of the Arbitrators in the event
that the Arbitrators determine such Party has acted unreasonably or in bad
faith.

 

(d) The Arbitrators shall have the authority to award any remedy or relief
that a court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts could order or grant,
including, without limitation, specific performance of any obligation created
under the Transaction Documents, the awarding of Losses, the issuance of an
injunction, or the imposition of sanctions for abuse or frustration of the
arbitration process. The Arbitrators shall render their decision and award
upon the concurrence of at least two of their number. Such decision and award
shall be in writing and counterpart copies thereof shall be delivered to each
Party. The decision and award of the Arbitrators shall be binding on all
Parties. In rendering such decision and award, the Arbitrators shall not add
to, subtract from or otherwise modify the provisions of the Transaction
Documents and shall make their determinations in accordance therewith. Any
Party to the arbitration may seek to have judgment upon the award rendered by
the Arbitrators entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

 



\- 58 - (e) Each Party agrees that it will not file any suit, motion, petition or
otherwise commence any legal action or proceeding for any matter which is
required to be submitted to arbitration as contemplated herein except in
connection with the enforcement of an award rendered by the Arbitrators. Upon
the entry of an order dismissing or staying any action or proceeding filed
contrary to the preceding sentence, the Party which filed such action or
proceeding shall promptly pay to the other Party the reasonable attorneys
fees, costs and expenses incurred by such other Party prior to the entry of
such order.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Party may apply to a court of law or
equity for specific performance and/or injunctive or other relief in order to
enforce or prevent any violations of the provisions hereof.

10.14. _Delivery by Facsimile_. This Agreement and any Transaction Document,
and any amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by
means of a facsimile machine, shall be treated in all manner and respects as
an original contract and shall be considered to have the same binding legal
effects as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.
At the request of any party hereto or to any such contract, each other party
hereto or thereto shall re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to
all other parties. No party hereto or to any such contract shall raise the use
of a facsimile machine to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature
or contract was transmitted or communicated through the use of
facsimile machine as a defense to the formation of a contract and each such
party forever waives any such defense.

10.15. _Independent Legal Advice_. Each of the Equityholders hereby
acknowledges that (a) Goodwin Procter LLP is acting as counsel to Buyer in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (b)
Summit Law Group, PLLC is acting as counsel to Company in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (c) none of such
firms is acting as counsel to any of the Equityholders, and (d) each of the
Equityholders has been encouraged to seek independent legal advice in respect
of their obligations under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
to which such Equityholder is a party and has either sought and received such
advice prior to executing and delivering this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents to which such Equityholder is a party or determined that
it does not require such independent legal advice.
