each of the Buyer Parties from and against any Losses which they may suffer, sustain, or become subject to, as the result of any claim by any Person that an Authorized Action is not binding on, or enforceable against, the Equityholders (and each
Equityholder expressly waives and disclaims any such claim against the Buyer Parties). In addition, the Equityholders hereby release and discharge Buyer from and against any liability arising out of or in connection with the Representative&#146;s
failure to distribute any amounts received by the Representative on the Equityholders&#146; behalf to the Equityholders. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(e)
