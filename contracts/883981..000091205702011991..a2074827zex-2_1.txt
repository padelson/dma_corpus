the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set

Restaurant Group, Inc.", and as so amended shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until further amended in
accordance with the terms thereof and the DGCL, and (d) the By-laws of the
Transitory Subsidiary, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until further amended in

THE MERGER. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this

at such later time as is established by the Parties and set forth in the
Certificate of Merger (the "EFFECTIVE TIME").   1.3. DIRECTORS AND
OFFICERS. The directors of the Transitory Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the
Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation, until
such director\'s successor is duly elected or appointed and qualified or
until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
Certificate of Incorporation and the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation.
The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be,
from and after the Effective Time, the officers of the Surviving Corporation,

Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and the transactions

law) of all of the conditions set forth in Article VI, the closing of the
Merger (the "CLOSING") shall take place at 10:00 a.m. on a date to
be specified by the Parties, which shall be no later than two (2) Business
Days (as defined below) following the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent
permitted by applicable law) of all of the conditions set forth in Article VI
other than such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver (to the extent permitted by
applicable law) of those conditions (the "CLOSING DATE"), at the offices of
Schulte Roth and Zabel LLP, 919 Third Avenue, New York, New York 10022, unless
another date, place or time is agreed to in writing by the Parties. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "BUSINESS DAY" means any day except a

authorized to close in New York, New York.   1.5. ADDITIONAL ACTIONS. The
Surviving Corporation may, at any time after the Effective Time, take any
action (including, without limitation, executing and delivering any document
in the name and on behalf of the Company) in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   ARTICLE II   CONVERSION OF
SECURITIES   2.1. CONVERSION OF CAPITAL STOCK. As of the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any Party or
the holders of any shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company (collectively, the "COMMON STOCK" or the "SHARES" and, individually,
a "SHARE") or holders of any shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Transitory Subsidiary (collectively, the "TRANSITORY SUBSIDIARY
COMMON STOCK"):   (a) CAPITAL STOCK OF THE TRANSITORY SUBSIDIARY. Each
issued and outstanding share of Transitory Subsidiary Common Stock shall be
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall be
the only issued and outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.
From and after the Effective Time, each outstanding certificate theretofore
representing shares of Transitory Subsidiary Common Stock shall be deemed for
all purposes to evidence ownership and to represent the same number of shares
of common stock of the Surviving Corporation;   (b) CANCELLATION OF
TREASURY STOCK AND BUYER-OWNED STOCK. All Shares that are owned by the
Company or by any Subsidiary (as defined in Section 3.1(b)) or held in the
Company\'s treasury and any Shares owned by the Buyer, the Transitory
Subsidiary or any other subsidiary of the Buyer, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; and   (c)
EXCHANGE OF SHARES. Each issued and outstanding Share (other than (i) Shares
to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and (ii) any Appraisal
Shares (as    -3-   defined in Section 2.3(c))) shall be converted into
the right to receive $12.60 in cash without interest (the "CASH MERGER
CONSIDERATION"), payable to the holder thereof. Such Cash Merger
Consideration shall be paid upon surrender of the certificate formerly
representing such Share pursuant to Section 2.2. The Shares converted into
the right to receive the Cash Merger Consideration are hereinafter referred
to collectively as the "CASH MERGER SHARES". All such Cash Merger Shares,
from and after the Effective Time, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate representing any Cash Merger Shares shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Cash Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate
in accordance with Section 2.2, without interest.   2.2. PAYMENT OF CASH
MERGER CONSIDERATION. (a) PAYING AGENT. At or prior to the Effective Time,
the Buyer shall (i) designate a bank or trust company located in the United
States of America to act as paying agent for the holders of the Cash Merger
Shares in connection with the Merger (the "PAYING AGENT") to receive the
funds to which holders of the Cash Merger Shares shall become entitled
pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and (ii) deposit in trust with the Paying Agent
cash in an aggregate amount sufficient to pay the Cash Merger Consideration
and to enable the Paying Agent to make payments pursuant to Section 2.1(c)
and this Section 2.2 (such amount being hereinafter referred to as the
"PAYMENT FUND"). The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by the Buyer (x) in direct obligations of the United States
of America, obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United
States is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest,
commercial paper of an issuer organized under the laws of a state of the
United States of America rated of the highest quality by Moody\'s Investors
Service, Inc., or Standard and Poor\'s Ratings Group, or certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers\' acceptances of a United
States commercial bank having at least $1,000,000,000 in assets
(collectively, "PERMITTED INVESTMENTS"), or (y) in money market funds which
are invested in Permitted Investments, and any net earnings with respect
thereto shall be paid to the Buyer as and when requested by the Buyer. The
Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, make the payments
referred to in Section 2.1(c) and this Section 2.2 out of the Payment Fund.
The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose except as otherwise
agreed to by the Buyer. If the amount of cash in the Payment Fund
is insufficient to pay all of the amounts required to be paid pursuant to
Section 2.1(c) and this Section 2.2, the Buyer from time to time after the
Effective Time shall promptly take all steps necessary to enable and cause
the Surviving Corporation to deposit in trust additional cash with the Paying
Agent sufficient to make all such payments.   (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES.  
(i) Within five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time, the Buyer
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding Cash Merger Shares (collectively, the
"CERTIFICATES"), whose Shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.1(c) into
the right to receive the Cash Merger Consideration, (A) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon actual delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in customary
form), and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for payment of the Cash Merger Consideration.   
-4-    (ii) Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by the Surviving
Corporation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereon, together with
any other items specified by the letter of transmittal or otherwise
reasonably required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Cash Merger Consideration for
each Share formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until so surrendered, each
Certificate shall be deemed, for all corporate purposes, to evidence only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Cash Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect thereof to which the holder thereof is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and this Section 2.2. No interest will be paid or
will accrue in respect of any cash payable upon the surrender of any
Certificate.   (iii) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, then, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person (as defined in Section 9.6) claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Buyer shall cause the Paying Agent to pay in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Cash Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and this Section 2.2; PROVIDED that the
Person to whom any such Cash Merger Consideration is paid shall, as a
condition precedent to the payment thereof, give the Surviving Corporation a
bond in such sum as it may direct or otherwise indemnify the Surviving
Corporation in a manner reasonably satisfactory to it against any claim that
may be made against the Surviving Corporation with respect to the Certificate
claimed to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   (iv) If payment of Cash
Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment that the Certificate so surrendered be properly endorsed or be
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of
the payment of Cash Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to
the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax either has been
paid or is not applicable. Each of the Paying Agent, the Buyer and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to
be deducted and withheld, from any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former
holder of Cash Merger Shares such amounts as may be required to be deducted
and withheld therefrom under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "CODE") or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law or under any other applicable
legal requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid
and shall be paid to the appropriate governmental entity on behalf of such
Person.   (v) The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses
of the Paying Agent in connection with the exchange of the Cash
Merger Consideration for the Cash Merger Shares.    -5-    (c) NO
FURTHER TRANSFER OR OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN THE SHARES. From and after the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with
respect to Shares and there shall be no further registration of transfers of
the Cash Merger Shares on the records of the Company (or the Surviving
Corporation) or its transfer agent of Certificates representing Shares, and
if any such Certificates are presented to the Company (or the Surviving
Corporation) for transfer, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this Article II, subject to applicable law in the case of
Appraisal Shares. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates evidencing ownership of Cash Merger Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable law. All Cash Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II
shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Shares exchanged for Cash Merger Consideration
theretofore represented by such Certificates.   (d) TERMINATION OF FUND; NO
LIABILITY. At any time following the date which is the six (6) month
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including,
without limitation, any and all interest and other income received with
respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and that
have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter, such
holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) with respect to the Cash
Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their
Certificates, without any interest thereon; PROVIDED that such holders shall
have no greater rights against the Surviving Corporation than may be accorded
to general creditors of the Surviving Corporation under applicable laws. Any
portion of the Payment Fund remaining unclaimed as of a date which is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any government entity shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for any amounts delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
other similar laws.   2.3. APPRAISAL RIGHTS. (a) Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement but only to the extent required by
the DGCL, any Shares that constitute Appraisal Shares shall not be converted
into or represent the right to receive the Cash Merger Consideration in
accordance with Sections 2.1(c) and 2.2, and each holder of Appraisal Shares
shall be entitled only to such rights with respect to such Appraisal Shares
as may be granted to such holder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. From
and after the Effective Time, a holder of Appraisal Shares shall not have and
shall not be entitled to exercise any of the voting rights or other rights of
a stockholder of the Surviving Corporation. If any holder of Appraisal Shares
shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise)
such holder\'s right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, then (i) any
right of such holder to a judicial appraisal of such Shares shall be
extinguished, and (ii) such Shares shall automatically be converted into and
shall represent only the right to receive (upon the surrender of the
certificate or certificates representing such Shares) the Cash Merger
Consideration, without interest, in accordance with Sections 2.1(c) and
2.2.    -6-    (b) The Company shall give the Buyer (i) prompt notice of
any demand for appraisal pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company,
withdrawals of such demands and copies of any related documents or
instruments received by the Company, and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Buyer,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or
settle or offer to settle any such demands for appraisal.   (c) For
purposes of this Agreement, "APPRAISAL SHARES" shall refer to any Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by
stockholders who are entitled to demand and who properly demand appraisal of
such Shares pursuant to, and who comply with the applicable provisions of,
Section 262 of the DGCL.   2.4. STOCK OPTIONS. With respect to any options
to purchase Common Stock outstanding on the Closing Date (collectively, the
"OPTIONS"), prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such action
as shall be required to effectuate (i) the cancellation, as of the Effective
Time, of all Options (whether or not then exercisable and without regard to
the exercise price of such Options) granted under any stock option plan or
agreement of the Company or otherwise (collectively, the "STOCK PLANS") and
to cause, pursuant to the Stock Plans, all outstanding Options to represent
solely the right to receive, in accordance with this Section 2.4, a cash
payment in the amount of the Option Consideration (as defined below), if any,
with respect to any such Option and to no longer represent the right to
receive Common Stock or any other equity securities of the Company, the
Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any other Person or any other
consideration, (ii) the termination, as of the Effective Time, of the Stock
Plans and any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance
or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock or equity of
the Company or any affiliate thereof (collectively, with the Stock Plans, the
"STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS") and (iii) the amendment, as of the Effective Time,
of the provisions of any Company Employee Plan (as defined in Section
3.14(a)) or any Executive Agreement (as defined in Section 3.14(b)) providing
for the issuance, transfer or grant of any capital stock or equity of the
Company or any such affiliate, or any interest in respect of any capital
stock or equity of the Company or any such affiliate, to provide
no continuing rights to acquire, hold, transfer or grant any capital stock
or equity of the Company or any such affiliate or any interest in the capital
stock or equity of the Company or any such affiliate. The forgoing actions
shall take effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each holder of an
Option shall receive from the Company, in respect and in consideration of
each Option so cancelled, as soon as practicable following the Effective
Time, an amount (net of applicable taxes) equal to the excess, if any, of the
Cash Merger Consideration over the exercise price of such Option, multiplied
by the number of Shares subject to such Option, without any interest thereon
(the "OPTION CONSIDERATION"). As soon as practicable following the execution
of this Agreement, the Company shall mail to each person who is a holder of
such Options a letter describing the treatment of and payments for such
Options pursuant to this Section 2.4 and providing instructions for use in
obtaining payment for such Options. The Company shall take all steps to
ensure that neither it nor any of its affiliates is or shall be bound by any
Options, other options, warrants, rights or agreements which would entitle
any Person, other than the Buyer or its affiliates, to own any capital stock
or equity of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or to receive any payment
in respect thereof, except as expressly contemplated by this Section 2.4.
Except as otherwise contemplated herein, any then outstanding stock
appreciation rights or    -7-   limited stock appreciation rights, and
any other rights or interest in respect of the capital stock or equity of the
Company or any affiliate thereof issued by the Company or any affiliate
thereof shall be cancelled immediately prior to the Effective Time without
any payment therefor.   2.5. FURTHER ASSURANCES. If at any time after the
Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or
things are necessary, desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of
record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation, its right, title or
interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises,
properties or assets of either of the constituent corporations in the Merger,
or (b) otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the Surviving
Corporation and its proper officers and directors or their designees shall be
authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either of the
constituent corporations in the Merger, all such deeds, bills of sale,
assignments and assurances and do, in the name and on behalf of such

ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   The Company
hereby represents and warrants to the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary
that the statements contained in this Article III are true and correct. The
Company has delivered to the Buyer a Disclosure Letter, dated the date hereof
(the "COMPANY DISCLOSURE LETTER"), receipt of which has been acknowledged in
writing thereon by the Buyer, which Company Disclosure Letter is arranged in
sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered Sections contained in
this Article III (it being understood and agreed that any matter disclosed in
any section of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be disclosed
and incorporated in any other section of the Company Disclosure Letter when
the appropriateness of such disclosure and incorporation is readily apparent
from the context).   3.1. ORGANIZATION. (a) The Company and each of
the Subsidiaries is an entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has all
requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as now being conducted. The Company and
each of the Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is
in good standing as a foreign entity in each jurisdiction where the character
of its properties or assets owned, operated and leased or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be
so qualified or licensed or in good standing has not resulted in and would
not reasonably be likely to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). The Company has, prior to
the date of this Agreement, delivered to the Buyer and the Transitory
Subsidiary (or made available to the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary in
the data room established by the Company for purposes of the due diligence

visited the data room) true, complete and correct copies of the Certificate
of Incorporation and the By-laws of the Company and the comparable
governing    -8-   documents of each of the Subsidiaries, in each case
as amended and in full force and effect as of the date of this Agreement. The
respective certificates of incorporation and by-laws or other organizational
documents of the Subsidiaries do not contain any provision limiting or
otherwise restricting the ability of the Company to control such
Subsidiaries. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "COMPANY MATERIAL
ADVERSE EFFECT" means any event, change, occurrence, effect, fact, violation,
development or circumstance having or resulting in a material adverse effect
on (i) the ability of the Company to duly perform its obligations under this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on a timely
basis or (ii) the business, properties, assets, liabilities, financial
condition or results of operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole; PROVIDED that the following shall not be taken into account in
determining whether there has been or would reasonably be likely to be a
"Company Material Adverse Effect" under this Agreement:   (i) adverse
changes in the stock price of the Company (as quoted on the New York Stock
Exchange), in and of themselves, but only so long as any such adverse changes
do not reflect any other event, change, occurrence, effect, fact, violation,
development or circumstance that has had or would reasonably be likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on (A) the
ability of the Company to duly perform its obligations under this Agreement
or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on a timely basis or
(B) the business, properties, assets, liabilities, financial condition or
results of operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
in each case, other than those events, changes, occurrences, effects, facts,
developments or circumstances described in any of subclauses (x) through (z),
inclusive, of immediately succeeding clause (ii); and   (ii) other than as
may relate to or arise from any disruption in the availability of, or public
health and safety concerns with respect to ordinary consumption of, the
primary foods and/or beverages supplied to or served by the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries, the following:   (x) events, changes, occurrences,
effects,  facts, developments or circumstances generally adversely 
affecting the economy of a city, state, country or  jurisdiction where the
Company and the Subsidiaries operate  and which do not affect the Company and
the Subsidiaries  disproportionately;   (y) events, changes, occurrences,
effects,  facts, developments or circumstances generally adversely 
affecting the United States securities markets or the fine  dining restaurant
industry in general and which do not affect  the Company and the Subsidiaries
disproportionately; and   (z) any failure to meet third party  analysts\'
estimates with respect to the performance or  condition of the Company and
the Subsidiaries, taken as a  whole.   (b) Section 3.1(b) of the Company

federal securities laws and the SEC rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder.   3.6. NO UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. Except as disclosed

has violated any of the terms or conditions under any such lease in any
material respect, and, to the Company\'s Knowledge, all of the covenants to

of ingress and egress for operation of the business of the Company or such
Subsidiary in the ordinary course, except as has not resulted in and

any law, ordinance, regulation, code, permit, license or order, or encroaches
on any property owned by others, except as has not resulted in and would not
reasonably be likely to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. No condemnation, expropriation, eminent
domain or similar proceeding is pending or, to the Company\'s Knowledge,
threatened which would preclude or impair the use of any such Company Real
Property by the Company or such Subsidiary for the purposes for which it is
currently used. None of the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries is obligated
under or bound by any option, right of first refusal, purchase contract, or

distribute (directly or indirectly), transmit, display, perform, license,
rent, lease, and, with respect to Intellectual Property owned by the Company,
assign and sell such Intellectual Property (collectively, the
"COMPANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY"), except where the failures to own, license
or    -19-   have rights to use such Company Intellectual Property have
not resulted in and would not reasonably be likely to result in, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the Company\'s
Knowledge, there is no pending or extant claim, allegation or dispute
asserted in writing regarding the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to
use the Company Intellectual Property as currently used by the Company or any
Subsidiary. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY"
means foreign and domestic (i) patents, registered and unregistered
trademarks, service marks, brand names, trade dress and trade names, domain

pending application, or the substantive equivalent, without regard to the
owner, assignee or registrant thereof. Each item of Registered Company
Intellectual Property owned by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries has not
been abandoned or cancelled, and remains in full force and effect. There are
no actions that must be taken or payments that must be made by the Company or
any of the Subsidiaries within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date
that, if not taken, would reasonably be likely to have a material adverse
effect on any Company Intellectual Property or on the right of the Company or
any Subsidiary to use any Company Intellectual Property as and where used by
the Company or the Subsidiaries.   (c) The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not
result in the breach of, or create on behalf of any third party the right to
terminate or modify, any license, sublicense or other agreement relating to
any Company Intellectual Property, except for such breaches and rights to
terminate or modify that have not resulted in and would not reasonably be
likely to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect, and excluding for the purposes of this Section 3.10(c) all
such agreements between the Company and/or the Subsidiaries. Except as set
forth in Section 3.10 of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company
nor any of the Subsidiaries has received or has Knowledge of any written
notice or claim from any Person challenging the right of the Company or any
of the Subsidiaries to use any of the Company Intellectual Property and (ii)
to the extent any Intellectual Property is used under license in the business
of the Company and/or any of the Subsidiaries, no notice of material default
has been sent or received by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries under any
such license which remains uncured.   (d) Except for those that have not
resulted in and would not reasonably be likely to result in, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) all   
-20-   patents and registrations and applications for registered
trademarks, service marks and copyrights that are held by the Company or any
of the Subsidiaries are valid, enforceable and subsisting and (ii) the
Company and the Subsidiaries have taken reasonable measures to protect the
proprietary nature of the Company Intellectual Property. To the Company\'s
Knowledge, no other Person (including, without limitation, any employee or
former employee of the Company or the Subsidiaries) is infringing, violating
or misappropriating any of the Company Intellectual Property, except for
infringements, violations or misappropriations that have not resulted in and
would not reasonably be likely to result in, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. None of the business or
activities conducted by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries infringes,
violates or constitutes a misappropriation of any Intellectual Property of
any third party, except for infringements, violations or misappropriations
that have not resulted in and would not reasonably be likely to result in,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither
the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has received any written (and the
Company has no Knowledge of any) complaint, claim or notice alleging any such
infringement, violation or misappropriation.   (e) The Company and/or the

indemnity, limited or full, under each such license for costs and liabilities
arising from infringement of third party Intellectual Property rights by the
subject matter of such license, except that no representation is made under
Sections 3.10(e)(ii) and (iii) with respect to licenses where failure of such
representations and warranties have not resulted in and would not reasonably
be likely to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect.   3.11. AGREEMENTS, CONTRACTS AND COMMITMENTS. Except as

incorporated by reference as exhibits to the Company SEC Documents on the

condition or act (including the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby) on the part of the Company or any Subsidiary or, to the Company\'s
Knowledge, on the part of any other party to any Company Material Contract

to the conduct of their businesses or the ownership or operation of their
properties or assets, except for such failures to comply and violations which

RESTAURANT"), along with the address of each such Company Restaurant and the
expiration date of each such Liquor License. To the extent required by
applicable law, rule, regulation or ordinance, each Company Restaurant
currently in operation possesses a Liquor License. The Company has no reason
to believe that it will not be able to obtain Liquor Licenses for restaurants
currently being brought into operation identified in Section 3.16(b) of the
Company Disclosure Letter. Each of the Liquor Licenses has been
validly issued and is in full force and effect and is adequate for the
current conduct of the operations at the Company Restaurant for which it is
issued. Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has received any
written notice of any pending or, to the Company\'s Knowledge, threatened
modification, suspension or cancellation of a Liquor License or any
proceeding related thereto that would reasonably be expected to have any
material adverse impact on any Company Restaurant, the ability to maintain or
renew any Liquor License or the nature or level of discipline imposed on
account of future violations of the laws related to sales and service of
alcoholic beverages. Since January 31, 1999, there have been no such
proceedings relating to any of the Liquor Licenses. There are no pending

the ability to maintain or renew any Liquor License or the nature or level
of discipline imposed on account of future violations of the laws related to
sales and service of alcoholic beverages.   3.17. LABOR MATTERS. Neither

dispute, walkout, work stoppage, slow-down, lockout or organizational effort
involving employees of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries. There is no
unfair labor practice charge or complaint against the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries, either pending or, to the Company\'s Knowledge, threatened that
has resulted in or would reasonably be likely to result in, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect; no union is currently
certified, and there is no union representation question and

written opinion of Greenhill, dated March 26, 2002, a true, complete and
correct signed copy of which shall be delivered to the Buyer promptly after
receipt of a written copy thereof by the Company, to the effect that, as of

Transitory Subsidiary, is fair to such holders from a financial point of
view, and such opinion has not been withdrawn or modified as of the date of
this Agreement. The Company has been authorized by Greenhill to permit the
inclusion of such fairness opinion in the Proxy Statement.   3.27.

contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) to initiate or participate in any way
in any discussions or negotiations with, or furnish or disclose
any information to, any Person (other than the Buyer or the Transitory
Subsidiary) in furtherance of any proposal that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to    -36-   lead to, any Acquisition Proposal,
(iv) to facilitate or further in any other manner any inquiries or the making
or submission of any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, or (v) to grant any waiver or
release under any standstill, confidentiality or similar agreement entered
into by the Company or any of its affiliates or representatives; PROVIDED
that so long as there has been no breach of this Section 5.3(a), prior to the
Special Meeting the Company, in response to an unsolicited Acquisition
Proposal and otherwise in compliance with its obligations under Section
5.3(c), may (x) request clarifications from, or furnish information to, (but
not enter into discussions with) any Person which makes such unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal if (A) such action is taken subject to a confidentiality
agreement with the Company containing customary terms and conditions;
PROVIDED that if such confidentiality agreement contains provisions that are
less restrictive than the comparable provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement, or omits restrictive provisions contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, then the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed
to be automatically amended to contain in substitution for such comparable
provisions such less restrictive provisions, or to omit such restrictive
provisions, as the case may be, and in connection with the foregoing, the
Company agrees not to waive any of the provisions in any such confidentiality
agreement without waiving the similar provisions in the Confidentiality
Agreement to the same extent, (B) such action is taken solely for the purpose
of obtaining information reasonably necessary to ascertain whether such
Acquisition Proposal is, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior
Proposal (as defined in Section 5.3(b)), and (C) the Board of Directors of
the Company reasonably determines in good faith, after receiving advice from
outside nationally recognized legal counsel (which may be its current outside
legal counsel) and based on the good faith recommendation of the Special
Committee, which has also received advice from its outside nationally
recognized legal counsel (which may be its current outside legal counsel),
that it is necessary to take such actions in order to comply with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law or (y) participate in discussions with,
request clarifications from, or furnish information to, any Person which
makes such unsolicited Acquisition Proposal if (A) such action is taken
subject to a confidentiality agreement with the Company containing customary
terms and conditions; PROVIDED that if such confidentiality
agreement contains provisions that are less restrictive than the comparable
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, or omits restrictive provisions
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, then the Confidentiality
Agreement shall be deemed to be automatically amended to contain in
substitution for such comparable provisions such less restrictive provisions,
or to omit such restrictive provisions, as the case may be, and in connection
with the foregoing, the Company agrees not to waive any of the provisions in
any such confidentiality agreement without waiving the similar provisions in
the Confidentiality Agreement to the same extent, (B) the Board of Directors
of the Company reasonably determines in good faith, after receiving advice
from outside nationally recognized legal counsel    -37-   (which may
be its current outside legal counsel), advice from Greenhill or another
independent nationally recognized investment bank and based on the good faith
recommendation of the Special Committee, which has also received advice from
its outside nationally recognized legal counsel (which may be its
current outside legal counsel) and advice from Greenhill or another
independent nationally recognized investment bank, that such Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal and (C) the Board of Directors of the Company
reasonably determines in good faith, after receiving advice from outside
nationally recognized legal counsel (which may be its current outside legal
counsel) and based on the good faith recommendation of the Special Committee,
which has also received advice from its outside nationally recognized legal
counsel (which may be its current outside legal counsel), that it is
necessary to take such actions in order to comply with its fiduciary duties
under applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, the Buyer, the
Transitory Subsidiary and the Company agree that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 5.3(a) by any affiliate, officer,
director, employee, representative, consultant, investment banker, attorney,
accountant or other agent of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or their
respective affiliates (other than any such Person who is an affiliate or
employee of the Buyer or of any of its affiliates), whether or not such
Person is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries or their respective affiliates, shall constitute a breach by
the Company of this Section 5.3(a). The Company shall enforce, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law, the provisions of any
standstill, confidentiality or similar agreement entered into by the Company
or any of the Subsidiaries or their respective affiliates or representatives,
including, without limitation, where necessary, obtaining injunctions to
prevent any breaches of such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions thereof in any court having jurisdiction.   (b) Neither the
Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof (including,
without limitation, the Special Committee) shall (i) withdraw, modify or
amend, or propose to withdraw, modify or amend, in a manner adverse to the
Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary, the approval, adoption or recommendation,
as the case may be, of the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to
approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) cause the Company to
accept such Acquisition Proposal and/or enter into any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar
agreement (each, an "ACQUISITION AGREEMENT") related to such Acquisition
Proposal, or (iv) resolve to do any of the foregoing; PROVIDED that the Board
of Directors of the Company, based on the recommendation of the Special
Committee, may take such actions prior to the Special Meeting if (w) the
Company has complied with its obligations under this Section 5.3, (x) the
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, (y) the Board of Directors of
the Company reasonably determines in good faith, after receiving advice from
outside nationally recognized legal counsel (which may be its current outside
legal counsel) and based on the good faith recommendation of the Special
Committee, which has also received advice from its outside nationally
recognized legal counsel (which may be its current outside legal counsel),
that it is necessary to take such actions in order to comply with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law, all the conditions to the Company\'s
right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(f) have been
satisfied (including the expiration of the five (5) Business Day period
described therein and the payment of all amounts required pursuant to Section
7.3) and (z) simultaneously or substantially simultaneously with
such withdrawal, modification or recommendation, this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with Section 7.1(f).   For purposes of this Agreement, the
term "ACQUISITION PROPOSAL" means (i) any inquiry, proposal or offer
(including, without limitation, any proposal to stockholders of the Company)
from any Person or group relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the consolidated assets of the
Company and the Subsidiaries or fifteen percent (15%) or more of any class of
equity securities of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries in a single
transaction or a series of related transactions, (ii) any tender offer
(including a self tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would
result in any Person or group beneficially owning fifteen percent (15%) or
more of any class of equity securities of    -38-   the Company or any
of the Subsidiaries or the filing with the SEC of a registration statement
under the Securities Act or any statement, schedule or report under the
Exchange Act in connection therewith, (iii) any merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, (iv) any other
transaction the consummation of which could reasonably be expected to impede,
interfere with, prevent or materially delay the Merger or which
could reasonably be expected to materially dilute the benefits to the Buyer
of the transactions contemplated hereby or (v) any public announcement by or
on behalf of the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any of their respective
affiliates (or any of their respective officers, directors, employees,
representatives, consultants, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and
other agents) or by any third party of a proposal, plan or intention to do
any of the foregoing or any agreement to engage in any of the foregoing.  
For purposes of this Agreement, the term "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" means a bona
fide written offer which is binding on the offeror and not solicited by or on
behalf of the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any of their respective
affiliates (or any of their respective officers, directors, employees,
representatives, consultants, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and
other agents) made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, all
of the Shares pursuant to a tender offer followed by a merger, a merger or a
purchase of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and the
Subsidiaries (i) on terms which the Board of Directors of the
Company reasonably determines in good faith, after receiving the advice of
Greenhill or another independent nationally recognized investment bank and
based on the good faith determination of the Special Committee (after
receiving the advice of Greenhill or another independent nationally
recognized investment bank), to be more favorable from a financial point of
view to the Company and its stockholders (in their capacity as such) than the
transactions contemplated hereby (to the extent the transactions contemplated
hereby are proposed to be modified by the Buyer in accordance with Section
7.1(f)), (ii) which is reasonably capable of being consummated (taking into
account such factors as the Board of Directors of the Company and the Special
Committee in good faith deems relevant, including, without limitation, all
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal (including
the terms of any financing and the likelihood that the transaction would be
consummated) and the identity of the Person making such proposal) and (iii)
which is not conditioned on any financing, the obtaining of which in the
reasonable good faith determination of the Board of Directors of the Company
based on the recommendation of the Special Committee is less likely to be
obtained than the effectiveness of the Fifteenth Amendment to Company Senior
Credit Agreement (as defined in Section 6.2(g)).   (c) In addition to the
obligations of the Company set forth in paragraph (a), on the date of receipt
or occurrence thereof, the Company shall advise the Buyer of any request for
information with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or of any Acquisition
Proposal, or any inquiry, proposal, discussions or negotiation with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal, the terms and conditions of such request,
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal, discussion or negotiation and the
Company shall, within one (1) calendar day of the receipt thereof, promptly
provide to the Buyer copies of any written materials received by the Company
in connection with any of the foregoing, and the identity of the Person
making any such Acquisition Proposal or such request, inquiry or proposal or
with whom any discussions or negotiations are taking place. The Company
shall keep the Buyer fully informed of the status and material details
(including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request or
Acquisition Proposal and keep the    -39-   Buyer fully informed as to
the material details of any information requested of or provided by the
Company and as to the details of all discussions or negotiations with respect
to any such request, Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or proposal, and shall
provide to the Buyer within one (1) calendar day of receipt thereof all
written materials received by the Company with respect thereto. The Company
shall promptly provide to the Buyer any non-public information concerning the
Company provided to any other Person in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal, which was not previously provided to the Buyer.   (d) The Company
shall promptly request in writing each Person which has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring
the Company or any portion thereof to return all confidential information
heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company, and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to have such information
returned or destroyed (to the extent destruction of such information is
permitted by such confidentiality agreement).   5.4. ACCESS TO INFORMATION.
The Company shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford to the
Buyer\'s officers, employees, accountants, consultants, financing sources,
counsel and other agents and representatives reasonable access, upon
reasonable advance notice, during normal business hours during the period
prior to the Effective Time, to all of the properties, books, contracts,
commitments, personnel and records and accountants of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall cause each
of the Subsidiaries to) furnish to the Buyer (a) a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it
or any of the Subsidiaries during such period pursuant to the requirements of
federal or state securities laws and (b) all other information concerning
business, properties, assets and personnel of the Company and
the Subsidiaries as the Buyer may reasonably request. The Buyer, the
Transitory Subsidiary and their affiliates and representatives will hold any
such information that is nonpublic in confidence in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement. No information or knowledge obtained in
any investigation pursuant to this Section 5.4 or otherwise shall affect or
be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties to consummate
the Merger.   5.5. SPECIAL MEETING. As promptly as practicable after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company, acting through its
Board of Directors, shall, in accordance with applicable law, duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its stockholders (the
"SPECIAL MEETING"), which meeting shall be held as promptly as practicable
following the preparation of the Proxy Statement, for the purpose of
considering and taking action upon the approval of this Agreement and the
Merger, and the Company agrees that this Agreement and the Merger shall be
submitted at such meeting. Subject to Section 5.3(b), the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to solicit and obtain from its stockholders
proxies, and shall take all other action necessary and advisable to secure
the vote of stockholders required by applicable law and by the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company or the By-laws of the Company to obtain their
adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger, and the Board of
Directors of the Company shall recommend that the stockholders of the Company
vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the
Merger at the Special Meeting, and the Company agrees that it shall include
in the Proxy Statement such recommendation of the Board of Directors of the
Company that the stockholders of the Company adopt this Agreement   
-40-   and approve the Merger. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to the first
sentence of this Section 5.5 shall not be affected by (i) the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company, any of
the Subsidiaries or any of their respective affiliates (or any of their
respective officers, directors, employees, representatives, consultants,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other agents) of any
Acquisition Proposal or (ii) the withdrawal or modification by the Board of
Directors of the Company of its approval or recommendation of this Agreement
or the Merger. The Buyer will cause all Shares owned by the Buyer and its
subsidiaries (including the Transitory Subsidiary), if any, to be voted in
favor of the Merger.   5.6. PROXY STATEMENT. As promptly as practicable
after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company shall:  
(a) prepare and, after consultation with and review by the Buyer, file with
the SEC a preliminary proxy statement relating to the Merger and this
Agreement and use its reasonable best efforts (i) to obtain and furnish the
information required to be included by the SEC in the Proxy Statement
and, after consultation with and review by the Buyer, to respond promptly to
any comments made by the SEC with respect to the preliminary proxy statement
and promptly cause a definitive proxy statement (the "PROXY STATEMENT") to be
mailed to its stockholders and, if necessary, after the definitive Proxy
Statement shall have been so mailed, promptly circulate amended or
supplemental proxy material and, if required in connection therewith,
resolicit proxies; PROVIDED that no such amended or supplemental proxy
material will be mailed by the Company without consultation with and review
by the Buyer and (ii) to obtain the necessary approvals of the Merger and
this Agreement by its stockholders;   (b) promptly notify the Buyer of the
receipt of the comments of the SEC and of any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the preliminary proxy statement or the
definitive Proxy Statement or for additional information, and will promptly
supply the Buyer with copies of all written correspondence between the
Company or its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or members of
its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the preliminary proxy
statement, the definitive Proxy Statement or the Merger;   (c) promptly
inform the Buyer if at any time prior to the Special Meeting any event should
occur that is required by applicable law to be set forth in an amendment of,
or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, in which case, the Company, with the
cooperation of and in consultation with the Buyer, will, upon learning of
such event, promptly prepare and mail such amendment or supplement; and  
(d) it is expressly understood and agreed that (i) the Buyer, the Transitory
Subsidiary and the Company will cooperate with each other in connection with
all aspects of the preparation, filing and clearance by the SEC of the Proxy
Statement (including the preliminary proxy and any and all amendments or
supplements thereto), (ii) the Company shall give the Buyer and its outside
counsel the opportunity to review the Proxy Statement prior to it being filed
with the SEC and shall give the Buyer and its outside counsel the opportunity
to review all amendments and supplements to the Proxy Statement and all
responses to requests for additional information and replies to
comments prior to their being filed with, or sent to, the SEC and each of the
Company and the Buyer agrees to use its reasonable best efforts, after
consultation with    -41-   the other, to respond promptly to all such
comments of and requests by the SEC, (iii) to the extent practicable, the
Company and its outside counsel shall (and the Company shall cause the
Special Committee and its outside counsel to) permit the Buyer and its
outside counsel to participate in all communications with the SEC and its
staff (including, without limitation, all meetings and telephone conferences)
relating to the Proxy Statement, this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated thereby (PROVIDED that in the event that such participation by
the Buyer is not practicable, the Company shall promptly inform the Buyer and
its counsel of the content of all such communications and the participants
involved therein), and (iv) the Company will not file with, or send to, the
SEC the Proxy Statement (including the preliminary proxy statement and any
and all amendments or supplements thereto and any and all responses
to requests for additional information and replies to comments relating
thereto) or mail any Proxy Statement (including the preliminary proxy
statement and any and all amendments or supplements thereto) or use any proxy
material in connection with the Special Meeting, in each case without the
Buyer\'s prior approval (not to be unreasonably withheld).   5.7.
REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS. Subject to the terms and conditions provided herein,
each of the Company, the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary shall, and the
Company shall cause each of the Subsidiaries to, cooperate and use their
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate
action, and do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the other
Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, without
limitation, the satisfaction of the respective conditions set forth
in Article VI), and to make, or cause to be made, all filings necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable laws, rules and regulations to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the
Company, the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary shall, and the Company shall
cause each of the Subsidiaries to, cooperate and use their reasonable best
efforts to promptly:   (a) make any and all filings, recordations,
declarations or registrations with, obtain any and all actions or non-
actions, licenses, permits, consents, approvals, waivers, authorizations,
qualifications and orders of, give any and all notices to, take reasonable
steps to avoid an action or proceeding by, any and all Governmental Entities
(including, without limitation, all filings under the HSR Act) and parties to
contracts with the Company and the Subsidiaries, in each case prior to the
Closing Date, as are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; it being understood and
agreed that:   (i) the Company and the Subsidiaries shall use
their reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the Buyer in any manner
reasonably requested by the Buyer in connection with obtaining at or prior to
the Closing of approvals, consents or waivers (collectively, the "REQUIRED
CONSENTS") under each of the Contracts identified in Section 5.7(a)(i) of the
Company Disclosure Letter (collectively, the "IDENTIFIED CONTRACTS") with
respect to the Merger (including the change of control resulting therefrom)
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (no such Required
Consent to be conditioned on any increase in the amount payable under the
applicable Identified Contract or any reduction in the term thereof or any
other material changes in the provisions thereof, except as may be required
by the express    -42-   terms of the applicable Identified Contract,
and such Required Consent shall otherwise be on terms and conditions
reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer); in connection with the foregoing,
neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries shall, without the prior
written consent of the Buyer, make (or commit to make) any payment or
otherwise provide (or commit to provide) any value or benefit to any Person
in connection with obtaining any Required Consent (except as may be required
by the express terms of the respective Identified Contracts); PROVIDED that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 5.1, with the
prior written consent of the Buyer (not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed; it being understood and agreed that any objection to a
refinancing raised by any lender under the Company Senior Credit Agreement
shall be a reasonable basis for withholding or delaying consent), the Company
shall be permitted to enter into one or more Contracts (collectively, the
"REPLACEMENT CONTRACTS") to refinance any Identified Contract on terms not
materially less favorable (after taking into account any and all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with such refinancing) to the Company (or the
applicable Subsidiary) or the Surviving Corporation than the terms of such
Identified Contract, whereupon the respective Replacement Contract shall be
deemed to be disclosed on Section 5.7(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter
and to constitute an Identified Contract for purposes of this Section
5.7(a)(i) (it being understood and agreed that fees paid to refinance any
Identified Contract as contemplated above shall be counted for purposes of
the last sentence of this Section 5.7).   (ii) each of the Parties shall
expeditiously give and make any and all notices and reports required to be
made by such Party to the appropriate Persons with respect to the Liquor
Licenses and each of the Parties shall, prior to the Effective Time, use its
reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the other in any manner reasonably
requested by the other in connection with obtaining at or prior to the
Closing the regulatory approvals or consents as may be required by any
Governmental Entities in order to obtain and maintain in effect at all times
following the Effective Time all Liquor Licenses and other permits necessary
to maintain continuity of service of alcoholic beverages at each Company
Restaurant; without limiting the foregoing, each of the Parties shall, to the
extent necessary of such Party, (1) duly and promptly file and process any
and all applications necessary to obtain all required regulatory approvals or
consents as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including, without limitation, the amendment of any and all
documents required to be amended with respect to the existing licensees under
the Liquor Licenses, (2) duly and promptly file and process Liquor License
applications with respect to each of the restaurants being brought into
operation at any time prior to the Effective Time and to duly and promptly
file appropriate amendments, if any, as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (3) duly and promptly
file with all appropriate Governmental Entities, and thereafter duly process
renewal applications for all of the licensed Subsidiaries whose licenses will
expire during the period from the date of this Agreement and until all of
the respective applications shall have been approved; PROVIDED that, without
the Company\'s prior consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
neither the Buyer nor the Transitory Subsidiary shall, from and after the
date hereof, until the Effective Time, (1) add any officer or director of the
Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary (other than (x) any individual who is
currently an officer or director of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or
(y) any individual who is an officer or director of an affiliate of Castle
Harlan, Inc., which affiliate has at any time during which such individual is
or was an officer or director of such affiliate received regulatory approval
or consent to obtain, renew or maintain in effect a liquor license) or (2)
issue or sell any equity    -43-   interest in the Buyer or the
Transitory Subsidiary to any Person (other than their current stockholders or
any individual who is currently an officer or director of the Company or any
of the Subsidiaries), if, in the case of either (1) or (2) above, the Buyer
is aware, after due inquiry, that such action would or would be reasonably
likely to materially impede, delay, hinder or make more burdensome the
obtaining and maintaining of any and all authorizations, approvals, consents
or orders from any Governmental Entity or other third party necessary to
maintain continuity of service of alcoholic beverages at each Company
Restaurant in effect for a reasonable period of time following the Effective
Time on terms no less favorable to the Company or the Surviving Corporation
than those in effect on the date of this Agreement; and   (iii) the Company
and its Board of Directors shall (A) take all action within its power to make
any "fair price", "moratorium", "control share acquisition", "business
combination" or other state takeover statute or similar statute, rule or
regulation inapplicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby and (B) if any state takeover statute or
similar statute, rule or regulation becomes applicable to the Merger, this
Agreement or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, take all
action within its power to ensure that the Merger and such other transactions
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute, rule or
regulation on the Merger and such other transactions;   (b) defend any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including seeking to have any stay or temporary
restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated
or reversed); it being understood and agreed that the Company shall promptly
notify the Buyer of any litigation (including any stockholder litigation),
other than where the Buyer is the adverse party, against the Company and/or
its directors relating to any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Company shall give the Buyer the opportunity to participate
in the defense or settlement of any such litigation; PROVIDED that no
settlement with respect to any such litigation shall be agreed to without
the Buyer\'s prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld);
and   (c) execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to fully
carry out the purposes of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing to
the contrary, except as may be required by the Fifteenth Amendment to Company
Senior Credit Agreement (as defined in Section 6.2(g)), no loan agreement or
contract for borrowed money shall be repaid, in whole or in part, except by
payment of an immaterial sum (in any event not to exceed a basket amount
equal to $100,000 in the aggregate with respect to all such loan agreements
and contracts for borrowed money, after taking into account any and all
amounts payable pursuant to the immediately succeeding parenthetical or
pursuant to Section 5.7(a)(i)) or as currently required by its terms, and
no material Contract shall be amended, modified, supplemented or replaced
to increase the amount payable thereunder (other than by an amount not to
exceed a basket amount equal to $100,000 in the aggregate with respect to all
such material Contracts, after taking into account any and all amounts
payable pursuant to the immediately preceding parenthetical or pursuant to
Section 5.7(a)(i)) or otherwise to be more burdensome (other than in an
immaterial manner) to the    -44-   Company or any of the Subsidiaries
in order to obtain any such consent, approval or authorization without first
obtaining the written approval of the Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld.   5.8. PUBLIC DISCLOSURE. The press release announcing
the execution of this Agreement shall be issued only in such form as shall
be mutually agreed upon by the Company and the Buyer and (b) each of the
Company and the Buyer shall consult with, and obtain the consent of, the
other Party before issuing any other press release or otherwise making any
public statement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to
consulting with and obtaining the prior consent of the other Party; PROVIDED
that a Party may, without consulting with or obtaining the prior consent of
the other Party, issue such press release or make such public statement as
may be required by applicable law, rule or regulation or by any listing
agreement with a national securities exchange or automated quotation system
to which the Buyer (or an affiliate thereof) or the Company, as the case may
be, is a party, if such Party has used reasonable best efforts to consult
with the other Party and to obtain such other Party\'s consent, but has been
unable to do so in a timely manner.   5.9. EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. As
of the end of the Offering Period (within the meaning of the Company\'s
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP")) ending March 31, 2002, the ESPP
shall be terminated. Prior to the end of such Offering Period, the Company
shall take all actions (including preventing any payroll deductions under the
ESPP with respect to any period after such Offering Period and, if
appropriate, amending the terms of the ESPP) that are necessary to effect
such termination.   5.10. OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. (a) For a period of one
(1) year following the Effective Time, the Buyer shall or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect employee benefit plans and
arrangements for employees of the Surviving Corporation (to the extent that
such plans and arrangements have heretofore been disclosed by the Company to
the Buyer) that, taken as a whole, provide a level of benefits that is
substantially comparable to the level of the benefits, taken as a whole,
provided by the Company Employee Plans immediately prior to the date of this
Agreement (other than stock option or stock-based plans or arrangements);
PROVIDED that employees covered by collective bargaining agreements need not
be provided with any such benefits. The provisions of this Section 5.10(a)
shall not create in any current or former employee of the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries any rights to employment or continued employment with the
Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the Company or any of their respective
subsidiaries or affiliates or any right to specific terms or conditions of
employment. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
subject to any existing employment contracts disclosed in Section 5.10 of the
Company Disclosure Letter, from and after the Effective Date, the Surviving
Corporation shall have sole discretion over the hiring, promotion, retention,
termination and other terms and conditions of the employment of the employees
of the Surviving Corporation.   (b) The Buyer shall ensure that employees of
the Company as of the Effective Time receive credit (for all purposes
including eligibility to participate, vesting, vacation entitlement and
severance benefits) for service with the Company or the Subsidiaries (to the
same extent such service credit was granted under the Company Employee Plans
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement) under the comparable
employee benefit plans, programs and    -45-   policies of the Buyer and
the Surviving Corporation in which such employees shall become participants
as contemplated by Section 5.10(a) (other than benefit accrual under any
pension plan).   (c) The Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
assume and honor in accordance with their respective terms all written
employment, severance, retention and termination agreements (including any
change in control provisions therein) applicable to employees of the Company;
PROVIDED that nothing herein shall obligate the Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation to maintain any particular plan or arrangement in accordance with
its terms after the Effective Date (other than the existing employment,
severance, retention and termination agreements disclosed in Section 5.10 of
the Company Disclosure Letter).   5.11. DIRECTORS\' AND OFFICERS\'
INSURANCE AND INDEMNIFICATION. (a) After the Effective Time, subject to
Section 5.11(b), the Surviving Corporation (or any successor to the Surviving
Corporation) shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former

no later than the first Business Day next succeeding the date of such
termination; and   (iii) if the Buyer or the Company shall have
terminated this Agreement (but only to the extent such Party is entitled to
do so) pursuant to the circumstances contemplated by Section 7.3(b)(i)(2),
then such amounts shall be paid by the Company to the Buyer by wire transfer
of same day funds on the date on which the Company shall have entered into an
agreement, arrangement or understanding (including a letter of intent) with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or, if earlier, the date of consummation
of any Acquisition Proposal.   (d) The Company acknowledges that the
Termination Fee and Expense Reimbursement provided for in this Section 7.3
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
not a penalty, and that, without the Termination Fee and Expense
Reimbursement provided for above, neither the Buyer nor the Transitory
Subsidiary would enter into this Agreement. Furthermore, nothing in this
Section 7.3 shall be deemed to limit any liability of any Party for any
breach in any material respect of any representations, warranties or
covenants contained in this Agreement that occurs prior to termination of
this Agreement.   7.4. AMENDMENT. To the extent permitted by applicable
law, this Agreement may be amended by the Parties, by action taken or
authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or
after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the
stockholders of the Company; PROVIDED that after any such approval, no
amendment shall be made that by law requires further approval by such
stockholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
Parties.   7.5. EXTENSION; WAIVER. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the Parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards
of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties,
(ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein;
PROVIDED that after the approval of the Merger by the stockholders of the
Company, no extension or waiver shall be made that by law requires further
approval by such stockholders without such further approval. Any agreement on
the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such Party. The failure
of any Party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise
shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.    -56-    ARTICLE

ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter and
the other documents and instruments referred to herein that are to be
delivered at the Closing, together with that certain letter agreement dated
the date hereof among the Parties regarding reimbursement of certain
amendment costs) constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties
and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or
among the Parties, or any of them, written or oral, with respect to the
subject matter hereof; PROVIDED that the Confidentiality Agreement shall
remain in effect in accordance with its terms.   9.4. NO THIRD PARTY
BENEFICIARIES. This Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to
confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, to create any agreement of
employment with any Person or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary

9.5. ASSIGNMENT. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the
prior written consent of the other Parties, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except that the
Buyer may substitute any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Buyer for the Transitory Subsidiary without consent of the Company and, at
any time prior to the first filing or notice made by the Buyer in connection
with obtaining any regulatory consent or approval with respect to Liquor
Licenses required in connection with the Merger, the Buyer may assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement to a newly formed affiliate of
the Buyer; PROVIDED that the Buyer and/or the Transitory Subsidiary, as the
case may be, shall remain liable for all of its obligations under this
Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their
respective successors and assigns.   9.6. INTERPRETATION. When a reference
is made in this Agreement to Sections, such reference shall be to a Section
of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include",
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." As used in this Agreement, (x)
the term "AFFILIATE(S)" shall have the meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2 of the
Exchange Act and (y) the term "PERSON" means and includes an individual, a
partnership, a joint venture, a corporation, a trust, a limited liability
company, an unincorporated organization and a government or other department
or agency thereof.   9.7. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in
two (2) or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the
same agreement and shall become effective when two (2) or more counterparts
have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other
Parties.   9.8. SEVERABILITY. If any term, provision, agreement,
covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, agreements, covenants and restrictions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not effected in any manner
materially adverse to any Party. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.   9.9. GOVERNING LAW. This
Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal
laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict
of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdictions
other than those of the State of Delaware.   9.10. SUBMISSION TO
JURISDICTION. Any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision
of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought
exclusively in any federal or    -62-   state court located in the State
of Delaware, and each of the Parties hereby consents to the jurisdiction of
such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such
suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court
or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has
been brought in an inconvenient form. Process in any such suit, action or
proceeding may be served on any Party anywhere in the world, whether within
or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting
the foregoing, each Party agrees that service of process on such Party as
provided in Section 9.2 as to giving notice hereunder shall be deemed
effective service of process on such Party.   9.11. REMEDIES. Except as
otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred
upon a Party shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other
remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such Party. No failure or
delay on the part of any Party in the exercise of any right hereunder shall
impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any
breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right preclude other or further
exercise thereof or of any other right. The Company agrees that irreparable
damage would occur to the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by
the Company in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Buyer and the Transitory
Subsidiary shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any federal or state court located in the State of
Delaware (as to which the Parties agree to submit jurisdiction of the
purposes of such action), this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity including those set forth in Section
7.3. The Company further agrees to waive any requirement for the securing or
posting of any bond in connection with obtaining any such injunction or other
equitable relief.   9.12. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE BUYER, THE
TRANSITORY SUBSIDIARY AND THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF THE BUYER, THE
TRANSITORY SUBSIDIARY OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION,
PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.   [Remainder of this page
