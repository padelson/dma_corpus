for all shares of Common Stock other than shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(determined as though there are no Dissenting

shall pass, only upon actual delivery of such Common Stock Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such
other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii)&nbsp;instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Certificates

and indemnities with respect to a lost certificate which the Paying Agent and/or the Company&rsquo;s transfer agent may reasonably
require) for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of
such Common Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the shares of Common
Stock theretofore represented by such Common Stock Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section&nbsp;3.1, and the
Common Stock Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or will accrue on the cash payable
upon the surrender of any Common Stock Certificate. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Common Stock that is not registered
in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the Common Stock Certificate
so surrendered is registered, if such Common Stock Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer
and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of such Common Stock Certificate
or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this Section&nbsp;3.2, each Common Stock Certificate (other than Common Stock Certificates representing Dissenting Company Shares
or shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(a)) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the amount of Merger Consideration, without interest, into which the Shares theretofore represented
by such Common Stock Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section&nbsp;3.1. If any Common Stock Certificate shall
not have been surrendered prior to six years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such time on which any payment in
respect hereof would otherwise escheat or become the property of any governmental unit or agency), the payment in respect of such
Common Stock Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free
and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Paying
Agent, Parent, the Company, Sub or the Surviving Corporation or any party hereto shall be liable to any former stockholder of the
Company for any cash or interest delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.
Each of the Paying Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Common Stock (or Common Stock Certificates) such amounts
as it is required to deduct and withhold, if any with respect to the payment of such consideration under all applicable Tax laws
(as hereinafter defined) and pay such withholding amount over to the appropriate Taxing authority. To the extent that amounts are
so properly withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of a Common Stock Certificate formerly representing shares of Common Stock.</P>
