WITNESSETH:

  



  

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and the Company
have approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, Parent has agreed to cause Sub
to make a tender offer (such tender offer, as it may be amended or
supplemented from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the "
_Offer_ ") to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, par
value $.01 per share (the " _Common Stock_ " or " _Shares_ "), of the Company
at a price of $7 per Share, net to the seller in cash, without interest (such
price, as it may be increased, the " _Offer Price_ ");

  



  

WHEREAS, as soon as practicable following the acquisition of Shares pursuant
to the Offer, the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of Sub with and into the Company
shall occur upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein,
with the Merger to be effected under Section 251(h) of the Delaware General

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and the Company,
as applicable, have unanimously approved this Agreement, the Merger, the
Offer, the Tender Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (collectively, the " _Transactions_ ") on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the board of directors of the

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger, each issued and outstanding Share not owned

stockholders to dissent from the Merger and require appraisal of their Shares,
will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price;

  



  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
certain stockholders of the Company are entering into a Tender Agreement with
Parent (the " _Tender Agreement_ "); and

  



  

WHEREAS, Parent and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Offer and the

pay for such Shares.

  



  

(c) Parent and Sub expressly reserve the right to waive, in whole or

(ii) decrease the number of Shares sought to be purchased by Sub in

(vi) otherwise amend, modify or supplement any of the Offer Conditions
or terms of the Offer in a manner that adversely affects, or would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect, the holders of Shares in any
material respect.

  



  

(d) Unless extended as provided in this Agreement, the Offer shall
expire on the date (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ") that is thirty (30)
business days (calculated as set forth in Rule 14dâˆ’1(g)(3) under the Exchange

scheduled to expire, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been
waived, then Sub shall extend the Offer for one or more periods ending no
later than the Outside Date, to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied;
provided, however, that no individual extension shall be for a period of more
than three (3) business days (unless otherwise consented in writing by the
Company), and (iii) if an Acquisition Proposal has been submitted to the
Company, (x) Sub may extend the Offer until six business days following the
rejection by the Company of the Acquisition Proposal and (y) Sub shall extend
the Offer at the request of the Company for no more than ten business days to
permit the Company to take a position with respect to the
Acquisition Proposal (or any amendment thereof) and for three business days
after the Company has taken a position with respect to the

Offer beyond the Outside Date.

ARTICLE III

  



  

CONVERSION OF SHARES

  



  

Section 3.1 _Conversion of Shares_. As of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Sub, the
Company or any holders of Shares:

  



  

(a) Each outstanding share of Common Stock that are held in the
treasury of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time and
any shares of Common Stock owned at the Offer Commencement Date by Parent,
Sub or any other wholly owned Subsidiary (as defined in Section 10.12) of
Parent shall be canceled and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

  



  

(b) Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Common Stock to be
canceled in accordance with Section 3.1(a) and other than Dissenting Company
Shares (as defined in Section 3.3)) shall be converted into the right to
receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All such shares of
Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and each holder of a certificate or
certificates (the " _Common Stock Certificates_ ") representing any such
shares of Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest.

  



  

(c) Each share of common stock (each a " _Sub Share_ ") of Sub,
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
be converted into and become at the Effective Time one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

  



  

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent hereunder
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon
surrender of the Common Stock Certificates. Parent will enter into a paying
agent agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company
prior to the Effective Time. All of the fees and expenses of the Paying
Agent shall be borne by Parent.

  



    

 7

 



    



  

(b) _Surviving Corporation to Provide Funds_. Prior to the filing
of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware, Parent or Sub shall deposit with the Paying Agent cash in an
aggregate amount sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration for all shares of
Common Stock other than shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section
3.1(a)(determined as though there are no Dissenting Company Shares) (such
amounts, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall cause the Exchange
Fund to be (i) held for the benefit of the applicable holders of shares of
Common Stock and (ii) promptly applied to making the payments provided for in
Section 3.1. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not
provided for herein. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the
Exchange Fund, as directed by the Parent, in direct obligations of the United
States of America, obligations for which the full faith and credit of the
United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of all
principal and interest, commercial paper obligations receiving the highest
rating from either Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available), or a
combination thereof, _provided_ _that_ , in any such case, no such instrument
shall have a maturity exceeding three months. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be kept in the Exchange Fund. To the
extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the
Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to
make prompt payments of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby,
Parent shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Exchange Fund
lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange
Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such
payments. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any
interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of such
funds) that remains undistributed to the holders of Shares nine months after
the Effective Time of the Merger shall be delivered to Parent at such time.
Thereafter, holders of shares of Common Stock shall look only to Parent
(subject to the terms of this Agreement) as a general creditor for payment of
the Merger Consideration, without interest, upon the surrender of any Common
Stock Certificates held by them.

  



  

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder
of record of a Common Stock Certificate, other than holders of shares to be
cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(a), (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
such Common Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon actual delivery of such
Common Stock Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have
such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of such Certificates in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Common Stock Certificate (or
delivery of such customary affidavits and indemnities with respect to a lost
certificate which the Paying Agent and/or the Company's transfer agent may
reasonably require) for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other
agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Common Stock Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into
which the shares of Common Stock theretofore represented by such Common Stock
Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 3.1, and the Common
Stock Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest
will be paid or will accrue on the cash payable upon the surrender of any
Common Stock Certificate. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Common
Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment
may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the Common Stock
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Common Stock Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and
the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of such Common Stock Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2, each Common Stock
Certificate (other than Common Stock Certificates representing Dissenting
Company Shares or shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(a)) shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the amount of Merger Consideration, without
interest, into which the Shares theretofore represented by such Common Stock
Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 3.1. If any Common
Stock Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to six years after
the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such time on which any payment
in respect hereof would otherwise escheat or become the property of any
governmental unit or agency), the payment in respect of such Common Stock
Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Paying Agent, Parent, the Company, Sub or the
Surviving Corporation or any party hereto shall be liable to any former
stockholder of the Company for any cash or interest delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Common Stock (or Common
Stock Certificates) such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold, if
any with respect to the payment of such consideration under all applicable Tax
laws (as hereinafter defined) and pay such withholding amount over to the
appropriate Taxing authority. To the extent that amounts are so properly
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of a Common Stock Certificate
formerly representing shares of Common Stock.

Section 3.3 _Dissenting Company Shares_. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if required by the DGCL but only
to the extent required thereby, shares of Common Stock which are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by
holders who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Company Shares_ ")
will not be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
and holders of such shares will be entitled to receive payment of the
appraised value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of such
Section 262 unless and until such holders fail to perfect or effectively
withdraw or lose their rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If,
after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or loses such right, such shares will thereupon be treated as if
they had been converted into and have become exchangeable for, at the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon. Upon the Company's receipt of any appraisal demand in
accordance with the provisions of such Section 262, the Company shall as
promptly as reasonably practicable provide Parent with a copy of such
appraisal demand. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, make any payment with respect to any such appraisal demand or
offer to settle or settle any such appraisal demand.

  



  

Section 3.4 _No Further Ownership Rights in the Shares_. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of shares of Common Stock which
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or by applicable law. All cash paid upon the surrender of Common
Stock Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Common Stock.

  



    

 9

 



    



  

Section 3.5 _Closing of Company Transfer Books_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer
of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, Common Stock
Certificates representing shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this Article III.

  



  

Section 3.6 _Stock Options_. All options (individually, an "
_Option_ " and collectively, the " _Options_ ") outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time under any Company stock option plan (" _Company Stock
Plan_ "), whether or not then exercisable, shall be canceled at the Effective
Time and each holder of an Option will be entitled to receive from the
Surviving Corporation, for each share of Common Stock subject to an Option, an
amount in cash equal to the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over
the per share exercise price of such Option, without interest. All amounts
payable pursuant to this Section 3.6 shall be subject to all applicable
withholding of Taxes and shall be paid promptly following the Effective
Time. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all action
necessary to effectuate the foregoing, including seeking to obtain any
necessary consents of the holders of Options.

  



  

Section 3.7 _Closing_. The closing of the Transactions (the "
_Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Fried, Frank, Harris,
Shriver and Jacobson, One New York Plaza, New York, New York 10004, at 9:00
a.m. local time on the day which is no later than one business day after the
day on which the last of the conditions set forth in Article VIII (other than
those that can only be fulfilled at the Effective Time) is fulfilled or
waived or at such other time and place as Parent and the Company shall agree
in writing. The date on which the closing occurs is referred hereto as the "
_Closing Date_."

organizational or governing documents.

Section 4.3 _Subsidiaries_. Each direct and indirect Subsidiary of
the Company is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its respective jurisdiction of incorporation and has the requisite
power and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and properties and
to carry on its business as it is now being conducted in all material respects
and each subsidiary of the Company is qualified to transact business, and is
in good standing, in each jurisdiction in which the properties owned, leased
or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification necessary; except in all cases where the failure to be so
organized, existing, qualified and in good standing would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity
securities of each Subsidiary of the Company are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights and are owned
directly or indirectly by the Company free and clear of any Liens (other than
Liens arising by operation of law or pledges required or which may be
required under the existing terms of the Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement, dated as of June 19, 2014, by and among Empire Resources, Inc.,
Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank B.A., "Rabobank Nederland",

whatsoever, except, in each case for any directors' qualifying shares. There
are no subscriptions, options, warrants, rights, calls, contracts, voting
trusts, proxies or other commitments, understandings, restrictions or
arrangements relating to the issuance, sale, voting, transfer, ownership or
other rights with respect to any shares of capital stock or other equity
securities of any Subsidiary of the Company, including any right of conversion
or exchange under any outstanding securities, instrument or agreement,
except, in each case for any directors' qualifying shares. Other than the
ownership of the Company's Subsidiaries set forth in Section 4.1(c) of the
Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any
capital stock, membership interest, partnership interest, joint venture
interest or other equity interest in any other Person.

  



  

Section 4.4 _Authority; Non-Contravention_. (a) The Company has
all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and
to consummate the Transactions. Assuming the accuracy of the representations
set forth in Section 5.8, the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
the part of the Company, and, assuming the conditions of Section 251(h) of the
DGCL have been satisfied with respect to the Merger, no other corporate
proceeding on the part of the Company is necessary to adopt or authorize this
Agreement or to consummate the Transactions (other than the filing of the
Certificate of Merger pursuant to Section 2.2). This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Sub, as applicable)
constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as the
enforceability thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws of
general application, now or hereafter in effect, affecting or relating to
enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general principles of equity,
whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity (the " _Bankruptcy and
Equity Exception_ "). At a meeting duly called and held prior to the
execution of this Agreement and the Tender Agreement, the Company Board duly
and unanimously adopted and approved this Agreement, declared this Agreement
advisable, approved the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions, determined that this
Agreement and the Transactions are fair to, and in the best interests of, the
Company and the Company Stockholders, and resolved to recommend (subject to
its right to change its recommendation if required by its fiduciary duties)
that the Company Stockholders accept the Offer and tender their Company Common
Shares pursuant to the Offer.

  



    

 13

 



    



  

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the
consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions
and compliance with the provisions hereof will not, conflict with, or result
in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both) under, or trigger or change any rights or obligations (including any
increase in payments owed) or require the consent of any Person under, or
give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any
obligation or to the loss of a material benefit under, or result in the
creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries under, any provision of (i) the certificate of
incorporation, by-laws or other organizational or governing documents, as
applicable, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including but not
limited to, the Company Charter and the Company By-laws), (ii) any loan or
credit agreement (other than the Credit Agreement), note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, lease, lien or other contract, agreement, instrument, permit or
license (each a " _Contract_ ") to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their respective properties or
assets are bound or affected, or (iii) any law applicable to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, other
than, in the case of clause (ii) or (iii), any such conflicts, violations,
defaults, rights or pledges, liens, charges, mortgages, encumbrances
and security interests (" _Liens_ ") that, individually or in the aggregate,
would not have or reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,
materially impair the ability of the Company and its Subsidiaries to perform
their material obligations hereunder or prevent the consummation of any of
the Transactions. No registration, declaration or filing with (each, a "
_Registration_ ") or authorization, permit, consent or approval (each, a "
_Consent_ ") of any domestic (federal or state), foreign or supranational,
court, arbitrator, commission, governmental body, regulatory or
administrative agency or tribunal (each a " _Governmental Entity_ ") or any
self regulatory organization (including NASDAQ or FINRA) is required by or
with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company or the consummation
by the Company of the Transactions to be completed by it, except for (A)
compliance with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules of any
national securities exchange, (B) the filing of the Certificate of Merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and appropriate documents
with the relevant authorities of other states in which the Company is
qualified to do business, (C) foreign and supranational laws relating to
antitrust and anticompetition clearances, filings or notices, (D) those
matters, including but not limited to, regulatory consents, approvals and
waivers, set forth in Section 4.4(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, (E) as may
be required in connection with the Taxes described in Section 7.10, and (F)
such other Consents or Registrations the failure of which to be obtained or
made would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect, materially impair the ability of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
perform their material obligations hereunder or prevent the consummation of
the Transactions.

  



    

 14

 



    



  

Section 4.5 _SEC Documents_. (a) Since December 31, 2015, the
Company has filed or furnished all documents with the SEC required to be
filed or furnished by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act (the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). As of
their respective dates, the Company SEC Documents complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as
the case may be, and as of their respective dates and except as amended or
supplemented prior to the date hereof, none of the Company SEC Documents
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, except that no representation is made by the Company with
respect to information supplied by Parent, Sub or their respective
Subsidiaries for inclusion in the Company SEC Documents. The audited
consolidated financial statements of the Company, including the related
notes, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and the unaudited financial statements
of the Company included in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the "
_Company 10-Q_ ") for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2016
(collectively, the " _Company Financial Statements_ "), comply as to form in
all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been
prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("
_U.S. GAAP_ ") (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by
Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto) and
fairly present in all material respects the financial position of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as at the dates thereof and the results of their
operations, cash flows and changes in financial position for the periods then
ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments that in the aggregate would not be material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and to any other adjustments set forth
therein). As of the date of this Agreement, (i) there are no outstanding or
unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC staff with
respect to any Company SEC Documents and none of the Company SEC Documents is
the subject of any ongoing SEC review and (ii) there are no formal or, to the
knowledge of the Company, informal inquiries or investigations by the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or any other
governmental inquiries or investigations, or internal investigations pending
or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, in each case involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than as set forth in the Disclosure
Schedule).

  



  

(b) The draft of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
twelve months ended December 31, 2016 provided to Parent prior to the date
hereof ("Draft Form 10-K") complies in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act, and as of the date that it is filed, will
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The audited consolidated financial statements of the Company,
including the related notes, included in the Draft Form 10-K comply as to
form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been
prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP applied on a consistent basis during
the periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes
thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the financial position
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at the dates thereof and the results of
their operations, cash flows and changes in financial position for the
periods then ended.

(d) The Company has made all certifications and statements required
by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the
related rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley
Act_ ") with respect to the Company's filings pursuant to the Exchange Act.
The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure, and
the Company has no reasonable basis to believe such controls and procedures
are not effective to ensure, that material information relating to the
Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known on a timely
basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation of the Company's
filings with the SEC and other public disclosure documents. The Company has
established and maintains a system of internal accounting controls and
financial reporting sufficient to comply with all legal and accounting
requirements applicable to the Company that has been designed by the Company
to be, and the Company has no reason to believe it will not be, effective, in
each case, to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation of internal controls, to the Company's auditors and its
audit committee (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses
within the knowledge of the Company in the design or operation of its
internal accounting controls which are reasonably likely to adversely affect
the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information, and (B) any fraud known to the Company that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in internal controls. Since
December 31, 2015, the Company has not received any complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim in writing regarding the accounting practices,
procedures, methodologies or methods of the Company or its
internal accounting controls, including any such complaint, allegation
assertion or claim that the Company has engaged in questionable accounting or
auditing practices, except as would not have or reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect. As used in this Agreement, "knowledge of the
Company" means the actual knowledge of Nathan Kahn and Sandra Kahn.

Employment Agreement that have been adopted or approved nor has the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries committed (whether or not such commitment is
legally binding) to make any such amendments or to adopt or approve any new
Employee Benefit Plan or Material Employment Agreement that would materially
increase the liability of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

  



  

(c) The Company has, or has applied for, a determination letter with
respect to each Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to be a
"qualified plan" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") and the related trust that covers
the Employee Benefit Plan as amended as of the date of this Agreement, and
there are no circumstances and no events have occurred that adversely affect
the qualified status of any such Employee Benefit Plan or the related
trust, which cannot be cured without a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(d) No Employee Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code, and no Employee Benefit Plan is a
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA). Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any material liability under
Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, nor, to the knowledge of the
Company, is any such material liability reasonably expected to be incurred.

  



  

(e) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect: (i) the Company and
its Subsidiaries (and ERISA Affiliates of the Company) have complied, and are
now in compliance, with all provisions of ERISA, the Code and all laws and
regulations applicable to the Employee Benefit Plans and each Employee Benefit
Plan has been administered in all material respects in accordance with its
terms; (ii) none of the Company and its Subsidiaries nor any other
Person, including any fiduciary, has engaged in any "prohibited transaction"
(as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA), which could
subject any of the Employee Benefit Plans or their related trusts, the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Person that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has an obligation to indemnify, to any Tax or penalty imposed
under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA; (iii) there are no
pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened claims (other than claims
for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations which have been
asserted or instituted against the Employee Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries
thereof with respect to their duties to the Employee Benefit Plans or the
assets of any of the trusts under any of the Employee Benefit Plans which
would reasonably be expected to result in any liability of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the
Department of Treasury, the Department of Labor, any Employee Benefit Plan or
any participant in an Employee Benefit Plan.

  



    

 20

 



    



  

(f) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
Transactions will (either alone or in conjunction with any other
event) result in, cause the accelerated vesting, funding or delivery of, or
increase the amount or value of, any payment or benefit to any employee,
officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than
Options).

  



  

(g) All Employee Benefit Plans that are primarily subject to the
laws of any jurisdiction outside of the United States have been maintained in
compliance with all applicable law (including, if they are intended to qualify
for special Tax treatment, applicable Tax laws), except for noncompliance
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect.

  



  

(h) There are no agreements nor Company Employee Benefit Plan
provisions which will or may provide payments of money or other property,
acceleration of benefits, or provisions of other rights to any officer,
employee, stockholder, independent contractor or highly
compensated individual, or other "disqualified individual" within the meaning
of Section 280G(c) of the Code which will be "parachute payments" under
Section 280G of the Code that are nondeductible to the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company or subject to Tax under Section 4999 of the Code,
but excluding any agreements or Employee Benefit Plan provisions that would
not result in any material nondeductibility or Tax.

wholly-owned Subsidiaries of the Company) or other Persons, on the other

marks, copyrights, processes, formulae, methods, schedules, technology, know-
how, computer software programs and applications and other proprietary
information (" _IP Rights_ ") as are necessary in connection with its
respective businesses as they are currently conducted, except where the
failure to own or have a valid right to use the IP Rights, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

  



    

 22

 



    



  

(b) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (i) the Company and
its Subsidiaries have good and valid title to all IP Rights owned by any of
them and valid and enforceable license rights to all IP Rights used under
license, free and clear, to the knowledge of the Company, of all material
liens, security interests and other encumbrances (other than Taxes not yet
due and payable), (ii) to the knowledge of the Company, all IP Rights are
in full force and effect and will remain in full force and effect immediately
following the Effective Time; and (iii) the Company does not believe that

such claim, that the IP Rights materially infringe any proprietary right of a
third party.

  



  

Section 4.16 _Takeover Statutes_. Assuming the accuracy of the
representations set forth in Section 5.8, the Company Board has taken all
action necessary to approve the acquisition of beneficial ownership of Shares
by Parent and Sub pursuant to the Tender Agreement and the Offer for purposes
of Section 203 of the DGCL so that the restrictions on "business combinations"
in Section 203 of the DGCL are not applicable to the Offer or the Tender
Agreement and, assuming Parent and Sub were not "interested persons" prior to

and good title to all its leasehold interests and other properties as
reflected in the most recent balance sheet included in the Company Financial
Statements, except for properties and assets that have been disposed of in the
ordinary course of business since the date of such balance sheet, free and
clear of all Liens (other than pursuant to the Credit Agreement) of any nature
whatsoever, except (a) Liens for current Taxes, payments of which are not yet
delinquent, and (b) such imperfections in title and easements and
encumbrances as are not substantial in character, amount or extent and do not
materially detract from the value, or interfere with the present use of the
property subject thereto or affected thereby, or otherwise materially impair
the Company's or such Subsidiary's business operations (in the manner
presently carried on by the Company or such Subsidiary), and except for such
matters which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. All leases under which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries leases any real or personal property are in
good standing, valid and effective in accordance with their respective terms,
and there is not, under any of such leases, any existing default or
event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default,
other than any such failure to be in good standing, valid and effective and
defaults thereunder which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 4.18 _Non-Competition_. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement which purports to restrict or
prohibit the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, directly or
indirectly, from engaging in any business, except as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

from a financial point of view.

  



  

Section 4.20 _Brokers and Finders_. The Company has not entered into
any contract, arrangement or understanding with any Person or firm which
may result in the obligation of the Company to pay any investment banking
fees, finder's fees, brokerage or agent commissions or other like payments in

Advisor.

Company nor any other Person on behalf of the Company makes any other express
or implied representation or warranty with respect to the Company with respect
to any other information provided to Parent or Sub. Each of Parent and Sub
agree that neither the Company nor any other Person will have or be subject to
any liability or indemnification obligation to Parent, Sub or any other
Person resulting from the distribution to Parent and Sub, or use by
Parent and Sub of, any such information, including any information,
documents, projections, forecasts or other material made available to Parent
and Sub in certain "data rooms" or "virtual data rooms", confidential
information memoranda or management presentations in expectation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each of Parent and Sub
expressly waives any right to rely upon any such information.

been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of each of Parent
and Sub other than the adoption and approval by Parent, in its capacity as the
sole stockholder of Sub, of this Agreement, which adoption and approval shall
occur immediately following execution of this Agreement. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Sub and (assuming the
valid authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company)
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and Sub
enforceable against Parent and Sub in accordance with its terms, except as
the enforceability thereof may be limited by creditors' rights generally or
by general principles of equity. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
does not, and the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions and compliance with the provisions hereof will not, conflict
with, or result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a material
benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (as hereinafter
defined) under, any provision of (i) the charter, by-laws or other
organizational documents of Parent and any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any
Contract to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which
any of their respective properties or assets are bound, or (iii) any judgment,
order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or
assets, other than, in the case of clause (ii) or (iii), any such conflicts,
violations, defaults, rights, or Liens that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to materially impair the ability
of Parent and Sub to perform their obligations hereunder or would not
reasonably be expected to prevent the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or
any of the other Transactions. No Consents of, or Registrations with, any
Governmental Entity, including those of Taiwan (ROC), is required by or with
respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement by Parent or Sub or is necessary for the
consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions, except for
(i) compliance with the provisions of Exchange Act, (ii) the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and
appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other states in which
the Company is qualified to do business, (iii) foreign and supranational laws
relating to antitrust and anticompetition clearances or notices (other than
those of Taiwan (ROC) or any authority within Taiwan), (iv) those matters,
including but not limited to, regulatory consents, approvals and waivers, set
forth in the Disclosure Schedule hereto, (v) as may be required in connection
with the Taxes described in Section 7.10, and (vi) such other Consents or
Registrations the failure of which to be obtained or made would not,
individually or in the aggregate, materially impair the ability of Parent and
Sub to perform their obligations hereunder or would not be reasonably expected
to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Offer and the Merger
or any of the other Transactions.

Section 5.4 _Offer Documents_. None of the information supplied or
to be supplied by Parent or Sub for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Offer Documents or the Schedule 14D-9, as applicable, at the
time such document is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or
supplemented or at the time it is first published sent or given to the holders
of Shares, will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading, except that no representation is made by Parent or
Sub with respect to information supplied by the Company for inclusion in any
of such documents.

  



  

Section 5.5 _Financing_. The obligations of Parent and Sub under
this Agreement are not subject to a condition regarding the obtaining of funds
by Parent or Sub to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions. Parent has, and will have, available sufficient funds to enable
it and Sub to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions,
including without limitation, to pay the aggregate Offer Price for Shares
accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer, the Merger Consideration to be
paid to the holders of shares of Common Stock and the aggregate consideration
to be paid to holders of Options a result of the Merger.

  



  

Section 5.6 _Litigation_. Except for matters which are not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to prevent or materially
delay, or materially impair the ability of Parent or Sub to consummate the
Transactions, there are no civil, criminal, administrative or
regulatory actions, suits, claims, hearings, investigations or proceedings
pending against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

Section 5.7 _Brokers_. No broker, investment banker or other
Person is entitled to any broker's, finder's or other similar fee or
commission in connection with the Merger and the other Transactions based
upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the Parent or Sub.

  



  

Section 5.8 _Ownership of Shares_. Parent and its Subsidiaries
beneficially own an aggregate of 413,047 shares of Common Stock as of the date
hereof (the " _Owned Shares_ "). Neither Parent nor Sub, alone or together
with any other Person, was at any time, or became, an "interested
stockholder" of the Company as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL, or has
taken any action that would cause the restrictions on business combinations
with interested stockholders set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL to be
applicable to this Agreement or the Transactions.

  



    

 26

 



    



  

Section 5.9 _Solvency_. Parent is not entering into this Agreement
with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either existing or future
creditors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately following the
Closing after giving effect to the Transactions. As of the Effective Time,
assuming satisfaction of the conditions to Parent's and Sub's obligations to
consummate the Merger, or waiver of such conditions, and after giving effect
to all of the Transactions, including without limitation the Financing, any
alternative financing and the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration,
payment of the aggregate consideration to be paid to holders of Options in
the Merger, any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by the Financing
Commitments, payment of all related fees and expenses, each of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will be Solvent. For purposes of this Section 5.9 the
term " _Solvent_ " when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of
any date of determination, (a) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the
assets of such Person will, as of such date, exceed (i) the value of all
"liabilities of such Person, including contingent and other liabilities" as
of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in
accordance with applicable federal laws governing determinations of the
insolvency of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the
probable liabilities of such Person on its existing debts (including
contingent liabilities) as such debts become absolute and matured, (b) such
Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital
for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be
engaged following such date, and (c) such Person will be able to pay
its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature.
For purposes of this definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount of
capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed
to be engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and
other liabilities, as they mature" means that such Person will be able
to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or refinancings,
or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due.

and maintain from and after the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary
thereof provisions in its Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws concerning
the indemnification and exoneration of the Company's former and current
officers, directors, employees, and agents that are no less favorable to
those persons than the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and By-
laws of the Company as in effect as of the date hereof.

  



  

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable law as modified by
the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws as in effect
as of the Effective Time, each present and former director and officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each present and former trustee of any

the Surviving Corporation's indemnification obligations pursuant to Section
7.2(a).

  



    

 31

 



    



  

(c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to be maintained in effect, without any lapse
in coverage, the current policies of directors' and officers' liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries ( _provided_ _that_ the Surviving Corporation may
substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to
the Indemnified Parties than the current policies) with respect to matters
arising on or before the Effective Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i)
in lieu of the purchase of such insurance by the Surviving Corporation, the
Company, with Parent's written consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld prior to the Effective Time), may purchase a six-year extended
reporting period endorsement under its existing directors' and officers'
liability insurance coverage, and (ii) during this period, the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to procure any coverage in excess of the
amount that can be obtained for the remainder of the period for an annual
premium of 300% of the current annual premium paid by the Company for its
existing coverage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may elect in
lieu of the foregoing insurance, prior to the Effective Time, to obtain and
fully pay for a policy (providing coverage for the Indemnified Parties and
such officers) with a claims period of at least six (6) years from the
Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating
as the Company's current insurance carrier with respect to directors' and
officers' liability insurance in an amount and scope no less favorable than
the Company's existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, provided that the cost thereof does not
exceed 300% of the aggregate amount per annum that the Company and its
Subsidiaries paid for such overage in the last full fiscal year, and
provided, further, that the Company shall consult with Parent regarding the
selection of such "tail" insurance policy. If such "tail" policy has been
obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain such policy in full force and effect for its full
term and shall continue to honor the Company's obligations thereunder.

  



  

(d) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay all
reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees that may be
incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided in this Section 7.2 as such fees are incurred upon the
written request of any Indemnified Party.

  



  

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in
addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such
Indemnified Party may have under the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws
of the Company, the DGCL or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 7.2
shall survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to
benefit each of the Indemnified Parties.

  



  

(f) This Section 7.2 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and
to grant third party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding
on all successors and assigns of the Company and the Surviving Corporation.
Each of the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to enforce the covenants
contained in this Section 7.2. If any Indemnified Party makes any claim for
indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Section 7.2 that is
denied by the Indemnitors, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines
that the indemnified Party is entitled to such indemnification, then the
Indemnitors shall pay such Indemnified Party's costs and expenses, including
reasonable legal fees and expenses, incurred in connection with pursuing such
claim against the Indemnitors.

  



  

(g) In the event that the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other person or entity and shall not be the
continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and assets to
any person or entity, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that such continuing or surviving entity or transferee, as the case
may be, assumes the obligations set forth in this Section 7.2.

  



    

 32

 



    



  

Section 7.3 _No Solicitation_. (a) After the date hereof and prior
to the Effective Time, the Company agrees that the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not, and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the affiliates, officers, directors, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys and other advisors or representatives of the Company or its
Subsidiaries (" _Representatives_ "), not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
knowingly solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate the making, submission of
any inquiry, indication of interest, proposal or offer which would reasonably
be expected to lead to a merger, acquisition, consolidation, tender offer,
exchange offer or similar transaction involving, or any proposal or offer to
purchase or acquire in any manner (A) assets representing 20% or more of the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) an equity
interest in 20% or more of the voting securities of the Company or of any of

of the assets referred to in clause (A) (any such proposal or offer being
hereinafter referred to as an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "), other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) enter into, participate,
continue or otherwise engage in discussions or negotiations with, or provide
any non-public information to any Person (other than Parent, Sub and
their Representatives and other than to state that the Company is not
permitted to have discussion except as permitted by this Agreement) with
respect to any inquiries, indication of interest, proposal or offer,
regarding, or that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to,
the making of, an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) except as permitted by this
Agreement, agree to, accept, endorse, recommend, approve (or publicly propose
or announce any intention or desire to agree to, accept, endorse, recommend
or approve) any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement or similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal (other
than a confidentiality agreement with a party to whom the Company is permitted
to provide information in accordance with Section 7.3(b)).

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) above or any
other provision of this Agreement, prior to the Acceptance Time, (i)
the Company may, in response to an unsolicited bona fide inquiry, offer or
proposal which could lead to an Acquisition Proposal from any Person (a "
_Potential Acquiror_ ") which the Company\'s Board of Directors determines, in
good faith and after consultation with its independent financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, could reasonably be expected to lead to a
transaction more favorable to the holders of Common Stock than the Offer and
the Merger (taking into account the likelihood of consummation, the person
making the inquiry or proposal, the form, and amount of consideration offered,
and any other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors of the
Company) (a " _Superior Proposal_ "), furnish confidential or nonpublic
information to, and engage in discussions and negotiate with, such Potential
Acquiror, its representatives, advisors, sources of debt or equity financing,
and persons expressing interest in purchasing any of the Company's assets or
businesses from such Potential Acquiror; provided, at least two business days
prior to furnishing any such confidential or nonpublic information to, or
engaging in discussions or negotiations with, such Person, the Company gives
Parent written notice of the identify of such Person and of the
Company's intention to furnish nonpublic information to, or enter into
discussions with, such Person.

(c) The Company shall reasonably promptly (and in no event later
than 48 hours after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal) notify Parent orally
and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal, unsolicited inquiry or request for
access to the properties, books or records of the Company or any Subsidiary

Subsidiary that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition
Proposal. The written notice shall include the identity of the Person making
or submitting such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request for access, the
material terms of the Acquisition Proposal or the request, and the Company
shall keep Parent reasonably informed of any material changes with respect to
such Acquisition Proposal or request. The Company shall reasonably promptly
(and in no event later than 48 hours) notify Parent upon determination by the
Board of Directors of the Company that an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior
Proposal (except as set forth below). The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status and material
details of, and any material amendments or modifications to, any such
inquiry, indication of interest, proposal, offer or request, and shall provide
Parent, as promptly as practicable, a true, correct and complete copy of any
written materials containing material non-public information provided by the
Company or, to the knowledge of the Company, any Company Representative on
behalf of the Company, in connection with any such inquiry, indication of
interest, proposal, offer or request to the extent that any such written
materials have not been previously provided to Parent, any of its Affiliates
or any of their respective representatives (including lenders). The Company
shall not exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
9.1(f) hereof until after the second business day following Parent\'s
receipt of written notice from the Company advising Parent that the Board of
Directors of the Company has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the
terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal and stating that the Board of
Directors of the Company intends to exercise its right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(f) (it being agreed and acknowledged that
the Company shall not be required to notify Parent of any changes with
respect to the terms of an Acquisition Proposal which the Company has advised
Parent constitutes a Superior Proposal (unless such changes cause the Board to
determine that such Acquisition Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior
Proposal) and any changes to the terms thereof shall not delay the Company's
right to terminate this Agreement and it being further agreed that such
action by the Board of Directors of the Company and any public
disclosure thereof shall not constitute a breach of Section 7.3(a)).

  



  

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 7.3 shall prohibit the Company
or its Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to the
Company's stockholders a position with respect to a tender offer by a third
party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act
or from making such disclosure to the Company's stockholders which, in the
judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company after receiving advice of
outside counsel, may be required under applicable law.

Section 7.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to
restrictions of applicable law (including antitrust laws), the Company shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent, and to
Parent's officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and
other representatives, upon reasonable notice, reasonable access during normal
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time to all their
respective properties, books, contracts, commitments and records and, during
such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
furnish reasonably promptly to Parent (a) a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of Federal or state securities laws and
(b) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as
Parent may reasonably request which are reasonably related to an orderly
transition of control of operations of the Company following the Closing,
including planning for the integration of computer systems; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (x) the Company may withhold the documents and information
to the extent required to comply with the terms of a confidentiality agreement
with a third party in effect on the date of this Agreement or to the extent
that such information is commercially sensitive as between Parent and Sub, on
the one hand, and the Company on the other and (y) in no event shall Parent,
Sub or any of their respective Representatives be permitted to conduct any
appraisals or audits of the Company's inventory or other assets without the
Company's prior written consent (which consent may be withheld in the
Company's sole and absolute discretion); and _provided_ _further_ that such
investigation or access shall not unreasonably disrupt the Company's
operations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, the
Company shall not be required to provide any information which it reasonably
believes it may not provide Parent or Sub by reason of applicable law, rules
or regulations, which constitutes information protected by attorney/client
privilege, which the Company or any Subsidiary is required to keep
confidential by reason of contract, agreement or understanding with third
parties, or which the Company reasonably believes is competitively sensitive.
All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 7.4 shall be subject to
the confidentiality agreement between the Company and Parent, dated January
18, 2017.

  



  

Section 7.5 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification_. (a) Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the
parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all reasonable actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the Merger, including (i) the identification and obtaining
of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from
Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary Registrations
(including filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of all
reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver form, or
to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) the
obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties,
(iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
the Merger, including, when reasonable, seeking to have any stay or temporary
restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or
reversed, and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the Merger and to fully carry out the purposes
of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligations set forth in
this sentence shall not be deemed to have been breached as a result of
actions by the Company expressly permitted under Section 6.1. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be obligated to
prepay or redeem debt, amend or waive the provisions of any Contract, or to
pay any consent or similar fees or payments, or divest any assets or enter
into commitments regarding the conduct of its business or licensing of
technology or know-how unless such action is conditioned upon the consummation
of the Merger. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and its Subsidiaries
shall not take or agree to take any action or make any commitment with respect
to any acquisition of businesses or assets which would reasonably be expected
to delay or prevent consummation of the Merger.

  



    

 35

 



    



  

(b) Without limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and the
Company undertakes and agrees to (i) respond as promptly as practicable to
any inquiries received from the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "
_FTC_ ") or the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice
(the " _Antitrust Division_ ") for information or documentation and to all
inquiries and requests received from any State Attorney General or other
Governmental Entity in connection with antitrust matters, and (ii) not enter
into any agreement with the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other
Governmental Entity not to consummate the Transactions, except with the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto. Parent shall offer to take (and
if such offer is accepted, commit to take) all steps which it is capable of
taking to avoid or eliminate impediments under any antitrust, competition, or
trade regulation law that may be asserted by the FTC, the Antitrust Division,
any State Attorney General or any other Governmental Entity with respect to
the Offer or the Merger so as to enable the consummation thereof as promptly
as reasonably practicable and shall defend through litigation on the merits
any claim asserted in any court by any party, including appeals. Without
limiting the foregoing, Parent shall propose, negotiate, offer to commit and
effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect), by consent
decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent or, effective as of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation, or their respective subsidiaries or
otherwise offer to take or offer to commit to take any action which it is
capable of taking and if the offer is accepted, take or commit to take such
action that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to
retain, any of the businesses, services or assets of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries, in order to avoid the entry of,
or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order
or other order in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the
effect of preventing or delaying the consummation of the Merger. At the
request of Parent, the Company shall agree to divest, hold separate or
otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action
with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses, services,
or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, _provided_ _that_ any
such action may be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and the
other Transactions. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no
event shall Parent or Sub be required, nor shall the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries be permitted, to sell, divest or dispose of any asset or
business, or otherwise commit to any action that limits its freedom of action
with respect to the business, services or assets of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 7.5 to
the extent such action would reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the Parent and Surviving Corporation on a consolidated basis
after giving effect to the Merger.

  



  

(c) Each party shall (i) promptly notify the other party of any
written communication to that party from the FTC, the Antitrust Division, any
State Attorney General or any other Governmental Entity and, subject to
applicable law, permit the other party to review in advance any proposed
written communication to any of the foregoing; (ii) not agree to participate
in any substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Entity in
respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement,
the Offer or the Merger unless it consults with the other party in advance
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat; and (iii) furnish the
other party with copies of all correspondence, filings, and communications
(and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between them and their
affiliates and their respective representatives on the one hand, and any
Governmental Entity or members or their respective staffs on the other hand,
with respect to this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger.

  



    

 36

 



    



  

(d) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to cause one of its Subsidiaries in the United
States (other than the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries) to enter
into definitive financing agreements to provide a credit facility to such
Subsidiary under which, following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation will
have access to borrowings in an aggregate amount that shall be sufficient to
allow the Company to operate substantially consistent with such operations in
the last 12 months, including similar funding of the Company's businesses in
Europe (the " _Financing Agreement_ "), so that the Financing Agreement is in
effect as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof and
consummate such financing at or prior to Closing. Parent shall keep the
Company informed of the status of the financing process relating to the
Financing Agreement and shall provide from time to time, such information as
the Company may reasonably request in respect thereof. The Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide such reasonable cooperation as may
be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Financing Agreement,
including (i) upon reasonable advance notice by Parent, participation in
meetings, drafting sessions, due diligence sessions, and management
presentation sessions, (ii) reasonably facilitating the pledging of
collateral following paydown of amounts under the Credit Agreement at or
after the Effective Time, (iii) the execution and delivery of loan agreements
and related documents, effective following paydown of amounts under the
Credit Agreement at or after the Effective Time, and (iv) allowing Parent and
its lender's representatives such access as may be reasonably necessary for
their due diligence; _provided_ that, the Company shall not be required to
provide any such assistance which would interfere unreasonably with the
business or operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries; and
_provided_ , _further_ , _that_ , without the Company's consent, which shall
not unreasonably be withheld, in no event shall any property level due
diligence involve environmental tests or assessments more intrusive to such
properties than those tests and assessments necessary to prepare Phase I
reports. Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket third party costs incurred by the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in connection with such
cooperation. In connection with any of the foregoing, none of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other
similar fee or reimburse the expenses of any party prior to the Effective
Time.

  



  

(e) If, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts by Parent
to satisfy its obligations under Section 7.5(d), the Financing Agreement is
terminated prior to the Closing, in whole or in part, for any reason, Parent
shall (i) promptly notify the Company of such expiration or termination and
the reasons therefore and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts promptly to
arrange for alternative financing (upon terms and conditions substantially
comparable to those contained in such expired or terminated commitments or
agreements) to replace the financing contemplated by such expired or
terminated commitments or agreements in an amount sufficient to assure the
continued operation of the Surviving Corporation in accordance with its
operations prior to Closing and for its solvency.

  



    

 37

 



    



  

Section 7.6 _Benefit Plans_. (a) Parent agrees to cause the
Surviving Corporation (i) to maintain for a period of one year after the
Acceptance Time for each individual employed by the Company and its
Subsidiaries without an employment agreement in effect on the date of this
Agreement, for so long as the Company Employee remains so employed by the
Surviving Corporation (it being agreed that for a period of one year,
employees shall only be terminated for cause or good reason; however, Nathan
Kahn and Sandra Kahn may be terminated for any reason), (x) the base salary
or base wages of the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (y)
the Employee Benefit Plans (other than equity-based plans) in effect on the
date of this Agreement or (ii) to provide compensation and employee benefits
(other than equity-based plans) to each current employee of the Company and
its Subsidiaries that are not materially less favorable in the aggregate to
such employees than those benefits in effect for such employees on the date of
this Agreement. In addition, Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation
to pay the bonuses for 2016, to the extent not yet paid, in the amount, to
the persons and at the times set forth in Section 7.6 of the Disclosure
Schedules and to continue to accrue and pay at times consistent with previous
years bonuses for 2017 (it being agreed that no bonuses shall be paid to
Nathan Kahn or Sandra Kahn).

  



  

(b) In addition to the agreement set forth in Section 7.6(a), from
and after the Acceptance Time, Parent shall cause the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to honor in accordance with their
respective terms (as in effect on the date of this Agreement), all the
Company's employment, severance, change in control, retention, transition and
termination agreements, plans and policies disclosed in the Disclosure
Schedule, including any change in control provisions contained therein.

  



  

(c) To the extent that employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
become eligible to participate in any employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including any
severance plan), then for all purposes, including determining eligibility to
participate, vesting and benefit accrual, service with the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as service with
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service
need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any
duplication of benefits. In addition, all such plans shall waive any pre-
existing conditions, actively-at-work exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation by and coverage of such employees and shall provide
that any expenses, co-payments, and deductibles paid or incurred on or
before the Acceptance Time and the Effective Time by or on behalf of any such
employees shall be taken into account under applicable Parent benefit plans
for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket provisions.

  



  

(d) No provision contained in this Section 7.6 shall (i) create any
right in any employee of the Company to continued employment by Parent, the
Company or the Surviving Corporation, or preclude the ability of Parent, the
Company or the Surviving Corporation to terminate the employment of any
employee for any reason other than as expressly provided for in Section
7.6(a); (ii) require Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation to
continue any Company Employee Plans or prevent the amendment, modification or
termination thereof after the Closing Date; or (iii) be treated as an
amendment to any particular employee benefit plan of Parent or the Company.

  



    

 38

 



    



  

Section 7.7 _Fees and Expenses_. (a) All fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the Merger and the other Transactions shall be
paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger
is consummated,

  



  

(b) Subject to Section 7.7(e), the Company agrees to pay Parent a
fee equal to $1,000,000 if:

  



  

(i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section
9.1(d)(iii) (in which case, the fee shall be payable within two business days
after such termination);

  



  

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
9.1(f) (in which case, the fee shall be payable at the time of
termination); or

  



  

(iii) this Agreement is terminated (X) by Parent pursuant to Section
9.1(d)(i) or (Y) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 9.1(b)(i) and all conditions to the purchase of Shares pursuant to
the Offer other than the Minimum Condition have been satisfied or waived,
and, in the case of both (X) and (Y), the event giving rise to the right to
terminate occurred at a time when an Acquisition Proposal (which, for
purposes of this Section 7.7(b)(iii), shall have the meaning set forth in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal contained in Section 7.3(a), except that
all references to 20% shall be deemed references to 51%) for the Company had
been made (other than by Parent or its affiliates) and not withdrawn and
within six months after such termination either the Company has entered into
a definitive agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal for the Company or
a transaction contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal for the Company has
been consummated (in which case, the fee shall be payable within two business
days after such event).

  



  

(c) The fee payable pursuant to Section 7.7(b) shall be made by wire
transfer of same day funds. The Company acknowledges that the
agreements contained in Section 7.7(b) are an integral part of the
Transactions, and that, without these agreements, Parent and Sub would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay
the amount due pursuant to Section 7.7(b), and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent or Sub commences a suit which results in a binding
nonappealable judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction against
the Company for the fee set forth in this paragraph (b) the Company shall pay
to Parent or Sub its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) in
connection with such suit.

  



  

(d) Parent agrees that the payment provided for in Section 7.7(b)
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent upon termination of
this Agreement under circumstances giving rise to an obligation (or potential
obligation) of the Company to pay the amounts set forth in Section 7.7(b) and
such remedy shall be limited to the aggregate of the sums stipulated in such
Section 7.7(b); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing herein shall relieve
any party from liability for the willful breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement. In no event shall the Company be required to pay to Parent
more than one termination fee pursuant to Section 7.7(b).

  



    

 39

 



    



  

(e) If this Agreement is terminated (x) by either Parent or the
Company pursuant to Section 9.1(b) and at such time (i) the Company is not
then in material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained
in this Agreement and (ii) there is a Prohibition (as defined in Section
8.1(a)) in effect (other than a Prohibition resulting from litigation brought
by or on behalf of stockholders of the Company alleging that the directors of
the Company have breached their fiduciary duties), Parent shall pay the
Company a termination fee of $4 million in cash payable by wire transfer of
same day funds, within two business days of such termination.  Each of Parent
and Sub acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.7(e) are
an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without these agreements, the
Company would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Parent fails to
promptly pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 7.7(e), and, in order to
obtain such payment, the Company commences a suit which results in a binding
nonappealable judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction against
Parent or Sub for the fee set forth in this paragraph (e) Parent shall pay to
the Company its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) in connection
with such suit.

  



  

(f) The Company agrees that the payment provided for in Section
7.7(e) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company upon
termination of this Agreement under circumstances giving rise to an
obligation (or potential obligation) of Parent to pay the amounts set
forth in Section 7.7(e) and such remedy shall be limited to the aggregate of
the sums stipulated in such Section 7.7(e); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for the willful breach
of any of its representations, warranties, covenants (including Section
7.5(b)) or agreements set forth in this Agreement. In no event shall Parent be
required to pay to the Company more than one termination fee pursuant to
Section 7.7(e).

  



  

Section 7.8 _Public Announcements_. Parent and Sub, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall use reasonable efforts to
consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other the reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public
statements with respect to the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions
and, unless it has made reasonable efforts to do the foregoing, shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by applicable law, court process or
by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange.

  



  

Section 7.9 _Sub_. Parent will take all action necessary (a) to
cause Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement, including to
consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement
and (b) to ensure that, prior to the Effective Time, Sub shall not conduct
any business or make any investments other than as specifically contemplated
by this Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.10 _Transfer Taxes_. The Company and Parent shall
cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all returns,
questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property
transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp
Taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar
Taxes which become payable by the Company, Parent or Sub in connection with
the Transactions (together with any related interest, penalties or additions
to Tax, " _Transfer Taxes_ "). All Transfer Taxes shall be paid by the
Company and expressly shall not be a liability of any holder of Common Stock.

  



    

 40

 



    



  

Section 7.11 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Expiration Date,
the board of directors of the Company, or an appropriate committee of non-
employee directors, shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive
guidance of the SEC so that the disposition of Company Common Stock
and Options pursuant to this Agreement by any officer or director of the
Company who is a covered person for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange
Act shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange
Act.

  



  

Section 7.12 _Transaction Litigation_. Subject to applicable law,
other than with respect to any litigation where Parent is adverse to the
Company, the Company will give Parent the reasonable opportunity, at Parent's
sole cost and expense, to participate, subject to a customary joint defense
agreement, in (but not control) the defense of any action, claim, suit or
proceeding against the Company or its directors or officers relating to the
Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions, and no such settlement will be
agreed to or offered without the prior written consent of Parent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ ,
that Parent shall not be obligated to consent to any settlement (i) which
does not include full release of Parent and its Affiliates or which imposes
an injunction or other equitable relief upon Parent or any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation), or (ii)
that would result in the payment by Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary
thereof of any amount in excess of the retention or deductible under any
applicable insurance policy of the Company. Subject to applicable law, other
than with respect to any litigation where the Company is adverse to Parent,
Parent will give the Company the reasonable opportunity, at the Company's
sole cost and expense, to participate, subject to a customary joint defense
agreement, in (but not control) the defense or settlement of any action,
claim, suit or proceeding against Parent or its directors or officers relating
to the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions. Prior to the consummation
of the Merger, without the prior written consent of the Company, Parent shall
not settle any action, claim, suit or proceeding related to the Offer, the
Merger or the other Transactions unless such settlement provides a full and
unconditional release for the Company and each officer and director of the
Company party to such litigation. The Company shall not settle or make an
offer to settle any litigation against the Company or any director by any
stockholder relating to this Agreement or the Merger, without the prior
written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , that Parent shall not be obligated to
consent to any settlement (i) which does not include full release of Parent
and its Affiliates or which imposes an injunction or other equitable
relief upon Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation), or (ii) that would result in the payment by
Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary thereof of any amount in excess of the
retention or deductible under any applicable insurance policy of the Company.
Each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, cooperate in the defense or settlement of any litigation
contemplated by this Section 7.12. The parties acknowledge that this Section
7.12 in no way limits the parties' obligations under Section 7.5(a).

  



    

 41

 



    



  

Section 7.13 _Escrow_. (a) Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Sub shall deposit fifteen million ($15,000,000) (the " _Escrow
Money_ ") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Escrow Agent. Failure to deposit the Escrow Money concurrently with the
execution of this Agreement shall constitute a material breach of this
Agreement by Parent and Sub, permitting the Company to terminate the Agreement
and seek damages against Parent and Sub. The Escrow Agent shall hold the
Escrow Money in escrow in a segregated account until the Acceptance Time, and
at the Acceptance Time the Escrow Agent shall transfer the Escrow Money to the
Paying Agent, if different than the Escrow Agent.  Parent and Sub agree and
acknowledge that the Escrow Money is for the payment of Shares pursuant to the
Offer and the Merger and, in the event that Parent or Sub has any liabilities
under this Agreement, including for breaches hereof, the Escrow Money
shall be available for payment of these liabilities or to meet its
obligations under an order of specific performance. Sub and the Company
agree to consent to the transfer of the Escrow Money by the Escrow Agent to
the Paying Agent (if different than the Escrow Agent) as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Acceptance Time. The Company and Sub shall
enter into an escrow agreement with the Escrow Agent in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit B (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ").

  



  

(b) Except as set forth in Section 7.13(a), the Escrow Agent shall
not be required to make any disposition of the Escrow Money unless (i)
the Escrow Agent is directed to do so in writing by the Company and Sub,
acting jointly, or (ii) the Escrow Agent is directed to do so in writing by
the party which claims to be entitled to receive the Escrow Money and the
other party does not object to such disposition within ten (10) days after
written notice of such direction is given by the Escrow Agent to the other
party or (iii) the Escrow Agent is directed to do so by a final order or
judgment of a court as hereinafter provided. The notice given by the Escrow
Agent pursuant to clause (ii) above shall state that failure of the addressee
to object to the disposition of the Escrow Money described in such notice
within ten (10) days after the giving thereof shall constitute a waiver of the
addressee's right to contest or object to such disposition. In the event that
any dispute shall arise with respect to the entitlement of either party to
the Escrow Money, the Escrow Agent shall continue to hold the Escrow Money
until otherwise directed by joint written instruction from the Company and
Sub or a final order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction entered
in an action or proceeding to which the Escrow Agent is a party. For the
purposes of this Section 7.13(b), no dispute shall be deemed to exist as to
entitlement of either party to the Escrow Money if the party receiving notice
from the Escrow Agent pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 7.13(b) objects
to the disposition of the Escrow Money provided for in such notice more than
ten (10) days after the giving of such notice by the Escrow Agent.

  



  

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge that the Escrow Agent is acting
solely as a stakeholder at their request and for their convenience, that with
respect to the Escrow Money, the Escrow Agent shall not be deemed to be the
agent of any of the parties hereto and that the Escrow Agent shall not be
liable to either of the parties hereto for any act or omission on its part
unless taken or suffered in bad faith, in willful disregard of this Agreement
or involving gross negligence on the part of the Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent
may act upon any instrument or other writing and upon signatures believed by
it to be genuine, without any duty of independent verification. The Escrow
Agent shall not be bound by any modification of this Agreement unless the same
is in writing and signed by the parties hereto and a counterpart thereof is
delivered to the Escrow Agent and, if the Escrow Agent's duties, rights or
liabilities hereunder are affected, unless the Escrow Agent shall have given
its prior consent thereto in writing. The Escrow Agent shall not be required
or obligated to determine any questions of law or fact. The parties hereto
shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless the Escrow Agent from
and against all costs, claims and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees and litigation costs, incurred by the Escrow Agent in
connection with the performance of its duties under this Section 7.13 and the
Escrow Agreement, except with respect to acts or omissions taken or suffered
by the Escrow Agent in bad faith, in willful disregard of the Escrow
Agreement or involving gross negligence on the part of the Escrow Agent.

Section 7.14 _No Transfer_. During the period from and including the
date of this Agreement through and including the earlier to occur of (i)
the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, Parent shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
not to, sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, or
cause or permit the sale, transfer or disposition of, any or all of the Owned
Shares.

CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

  



  

Section 8.1 _Conditions to Each Party\'s Obligation to Effect the
Merger_. The respective obligation of each party to effect the Merger is
subject to the satisfaction or waiver on or prior to the Closing Date of the
following conditions:

  



  

(a) _No Injunctions or Restraints_. No statute, rule, regulation,
temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other
order enacted, entered, promulgated, enforced or issued by any Governmental
Entity or other legal restraint or prohibition (any of the foregoing, a "
_Prohibition_ ") preventing the consummation of the Merger shall be in effect,
and then only if such Prohibition is (i) a Prohibition of a United States
federal or state statute, rule or regulation or United States federal or
state court order or injunction or (ii) any other statute, rule, regulation,
court order, or injunction the violation of which would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Parent and the Company (on a
consolidated basis after giving effect to the Merger) or would subject any
director or officer of the Parent or the Company to criminal liability (other
than a misdemeanor the only penalty for which is a monetary fine) in a
jurisdiction in which the director of officer resides (any Prohibition
described in clauses (i) or (ii) of this Section 8.1(a) is referred to herein
as a " _Blocking Prohibition_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to
asserting this condition each of the parties shall have used all reasonable
best efforts to prevent the entry of any such injunction or other order, to
have any such order or injunction lifted or withdrawn, and to appeal as
promptly as possible any such injunction or other order that may be.

  



  

(b) _Acceptance of Shares Pursuant to the Offer_. Sub shall have
accepted Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer; _provided_ , that
the obligation of Parent and Sub to effect the Merger shall not be

takes any other action permanently enjoining, restraining or
otherwise prohibiting the acceptance for payment of, or payment for, Shares
pursuant to the Offer or the Merger and such order, decree, ruling or other
action shall have become final and nonappealable and constitutes a Blocking
Prohibition, provided that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 9.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to any party which has not used
its best efforts to cause such order, decree, or ruling to be lifted or
otherwise taken action necessary to comply with Section 7.5;

  



  

(c) by Parent, (i) if the Company breaches or fails to perform in
any material respect any of its representations and warranties contained in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in _Exhibit A_, and (B) cannot be or has
not been cured within 10 business days after the giving of written notice to
the Company of such breach (provided that Parent is not then in material
breach of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement);

been breached, which breach would give rise to the failure of a condition set

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination
of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section

any liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Sub or the Company, other
than this Section, the last sentence of Section 7.4, Section 7.7, and Section
10.4, which provisions shall survive such termination, and except to the
extent that such termination results from fraud or a willful breach by a party

liabilities or damages (which the parties acknowledge and agree shall not be
limited to reimbursement of expenses or out of pocket costs).

any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this
Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to
assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of such rights.

  



  

Section 9.5 _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or
Waiver_. A termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1, an
amendment of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.3 or an extension or waiver

EXECUTION

  



  

EXHIBIT A

  



  

CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER

  



  

Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer, Sub shall not be required to and
Parent shall not be required to cause Sub to, accept for payment or pay for,
subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule
14e-1(c) of the Exchange Act, any Shares not theretofore accepted for
payment or paid for and, subject to the terms of the Agreement, may terminate
or amend the Offer unless (i) there shall have been validly tendered (and not
withdrawn) and "received" (as defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL) by the
depositary for the Offer prior to the expiration of the Offer at least that
number of Shares, when added to any Shares already owned by Sub, Parent,
or any direct or indirect, wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, equals a
majority of the then outstanding Shares (the " _Minimum Tender Condition_ ")
or (ii) at any time on or after the date of this Agreement and before the
acceptance of any Shares for payment or the payment therefor, any of the
following conditions exist or shall occur and remain in effect:

  



  

(a) any statute, rule, regulation, temporary restraining order,
preliminary or permanent injunction or other order enacted, entered,
promulgated, enforced or issued by any Governmental Entity or other legal
restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the Offer or the
Merger shall be in effect, and then only if such order, injunction or
restraint is (i) any United States federal or state statute, rule or
regulation or United States federal or state court order or injunction or (ii)
any other statute, rule, regulation, court order, or injunction the violation
of which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Parent and Company (on a consolidated basis after giving effect to the
Merger) or would subject any director or officer of the Parent or the Company
to criminal liability (other than a misdemeanor the only penalty for which is
a monetary fine) in a jurisdiction in which the director of officer resides;
provided, however, that prior to asserting this condition each of the parties
shall have used all reasonable best efforts to prevent the entry of any such
injunction or other order, to have any such order or injunction lifted or
withdrawn, and to appeal as promptly as possible any such injunction or other
order that may be entered; or

  



  

(b) (i) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth
in Section 3.2 relating to the capital stock of the Company shall not be true
and correct in all respects on the date of this Agreement and at the Closing
(except to the extent that such representation and warranty speaks as of a
particular date, in which case such representation and warranty shall be true
and correct in all respects as of that date), except for inaccuracies that
would not increase the aggregate consideration payable in the Offer and the
Merger by more than 2% and (ii) any of the other representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall not be true and
correct on and as of the date of this Agreement and at the Closing as though
such representations and warranties were made on and as of such date (without
giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or "Material
Adverse Effect" set forth therein) (except to the extent that such
representation and warranty speaks as of a particular date, in which case
such representation and warranty shall be true and correct as of that date),
except where the failure of the representations and warranties referred to in
this clause (ii) to so be true and correct would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

  



    



 



    



  

(c) the Company shall not have performed in all material respects
any material obligation, covenant and agreement required to be performed by
it under this Agreement;

  



  

(d) as of the Expiration Date, an authorized officer of the Company
shall not have executed and delivered to Parent a certificate to the effect
that, to the knowledge of such officer, the conditions set forth in clauses
(b) and (c) above shall not have occurred;

  



  

(e) the Company and Parent shall have reached a written agreement
that the Offer or this Agreement be terminated; or

  



  

(f) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its
terms.

  



  

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Sub and may
be asserted by Parent and Sub regardless of the circumstances giving rise to
any such condition, unless the failure of the satisfaction of any such
condition has been caused by or resulted from the failure by Parent and Sub to
fulfill any of its obligations under this Agreement, and any such condition
may be waived by Parent and Sub, in whole or in part, at any time and from
time to time, in the sole discretion of Parent and Sub. The failure by Parent
at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights will not be deemed a
waiver of any right, the waiver of such right with respect to any particular
facts or circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other
facts or circumstances, and each right will be deemed an ongoing right
which may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

  



  

The capitalized terms used in this Exhibit shall have the meanings set forth
in the Agreement to which it is attached.
