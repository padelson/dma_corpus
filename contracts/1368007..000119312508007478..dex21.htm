Buyer and the Company agree that upon such deduction, such note shall be
deemed to have been paid in full and terminated.

(c) _Vested Options_. At the Closing, each Vested Option shall be converted
into the right to receive for each share of Stock to which such Vested Option
pertains (i) the Closing Per Share Payment Amount  _minus_ the exercise price

_provided_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to any such payment
being made to a holder of Vested Options, such holder must first execute and
deliver a Cash Out and Termination of Stock Rights in substantially the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit B-2_ (a " _Stock Option Cash Out Agreement_ ")
and, if such holder does not or is unwilling to execute and deliver a Stock
Option Cash Out Agreement prior to such tenth (10th) Business Day after the
Closing, such holders Vested Options shall, upon the decision of Buyer, be
deemed terminated and such holder shall thereafter have no right to the
payments otherwise contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of doubt, the
parties hereto agree that in the event that the "end of the day rule" of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A) would otherwise apply to
any payments made pursuant to this Section 2.3(c), the Company and Buyer will
treat such payments as occurring at the beginning of the day following the
Closing for all U.S. federal income Tax purposes pursuant to the "next day
rule" of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B). Such treatment
shall also apply for all purposes of this Agreement, including Article IX.

to the Company and Buyer shall cause the Company to pay to each of the
holders of Vested SAR Units as listed on the Capitalization Table, the Net SAR
Unit Payment for each of their Vested SAR Units less any required withholding
of Taxes under applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto
agree that in the event that the "end of the day rule" of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A) would otherwise apply to any payments made
pursuant to this Section 2.3(d), the Company and Buyer will treat such
payments as occurring at the beginning of the day following the Closing for
all U.S. federal income Tax purposes pursuant to the "next day rule" of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B). Such treatment shall
also apply for all purposes of this Agreement, including Article IX.

SECTION 2.4 _U.K. Option Treatment_.

 

(a) Each UK Vested Option Holder shall, pursuant to the terms of a Stock
Option Cash Out Agreement delivered to each UK Vested Option Holder, be
given the option prior to the Closing to either (i) exercise his or her
Vested Options, effective immediately prior to the Closing, so as to be deemed
to have acquired that number of shares of Stock to which such Vested Option
pertains (on a cashless exercise basis to take into consideration the
applicable exercise price of such Vested Option), deemed to have transferred
such Stock if desired to a spouse or civil partner, and sell such Stock to
Buyer on the terms and conditions set forth in Section 2.3(b); _provided,
however_ , that it is understood and agreed, and the Stock Option Cash Out
Agreement executed by such UK Vested Option Holder shall provide, that,
following such exercise, the actual shares of Stock will be immediately
transferred to Buyer at Closing; and _provided, further_ that, in the event
such UK Vested Option Holder elects to transfer such Stock to a spouse or
civil partner, such spouse or civil party shall execute an agreement,
simultaneous with the UK Vested Option Holders execution of the Stock Option
Cash Out Agreement, to be bound by the terms of this Agreement as a "Seller"
and the terms and conditions of the Stock Option Cash Out Agreement; or (ii)
elect to have such holders Vested Options excluded from the provisions of
Section 2.3(c) and not cashed out at the Closing, and instead have such Vested
Options (" _UK Unexercised Vested Options_ ") be assumed by NYX pursuant
to Section 2.6(b).

(b) Neither Buyer, NYX nor any of their Affiliates shall have any liability
hereunder resulting from any failure by the UK Revenue authorities to accept
the Assumed UK EMI Options as qualifying Enterprise Management Incentives
under Section 5 Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003.



 

17 SECTION 2.5 _Escrows_. On the Closing Date, (a) Buyer and the Seller
Representative shall select a mutually satisfactory escrow agent (the "
_Escrow Agent_ "); (b) Buyer, the Escrow Agent and the Seller Representative
shall execute the escrow agreement substantially in the form attached hereto
as _Exhibit D_ , with such changes as may be proposed by the Escrow Agent and
are reasonably acceptable to the Company, Buyer and the Seller Representative
(the " _Escrow Agreement_ "); (c) notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this Article II, Buyer shall deposit with the Escrow Agent, an aggregate
amount in cash equal to $20,000,000 (the " _Indemnification Escrow Amount_ ")
to be held in escrow pending determination of the Adjustment Amount and
resolution of any claims for indemnification made by Buyer pursuant to
Article IX (such cash deposit being referred to herein as the "
_Indemnification Escrow Fund_ "); and (d) notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Article II, Buyer shall deposit with the Escrow Agent, in
a separate escrow account, an aggregate amount in cash equal to $200,000 (the
" _Reimbursement Escrow Amount_ ") to be held in escrow for use by the Seller
Representative to pay the costs and expenses that it incurs in its capacity
as the Seller Representative (the " _Reimbursement Escrow Fund_ "). With
respect to any amount released from the Indemnification Escrow Fund pursuant
to the Escrow Agreement (other than amounts released to pay Buyer Indemnified
Parties with respect to claims made pursuant to Article IX and amounts
released to Buyer as an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section
2.10(f)) and any amount released from the Reimbursement Escrow Fund,
the applicable Indemnification Escrow Distribution or Reimbursement Escrow
Distribution, respectively, relating to such release shall be paid to each
Combined Holder and the remaining portion of such amount shall be released to
Buyer.

SECTION 2.6 _Unvested Options; UK EMI Options_.

(a) Each of Buyer and NYX agrees that each Unvested Option shall be assumed by
NYX as set forth below. Without the need to further amend the Company Stock
Plan or to incorporate the Company Stock Plans terms into a plan of NYX, such
Unvested Options shall cease, as of the Closing, to represent a right to
acquire shares of Stock and shall be deemed assumed from and after the
Closing and deemed to constitute an option to purchase shares of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of NYX (such stock, " _NYX Stock_ ," and each such
option, an " _Assumed Option_ ") on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Unvested Option immediately prior to the Closing and
under the Company Stock Plan; _provided_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing,
prior to any such assumption of Unvested Options, the holder thereof must
first execute and deliver a Stock Option Cash Out Agreement and, if such
holder does not or is unwilling to execute and deliver a Stock Option Cash Out
Agreement prior to the tenth (10th) Business Day after the Closing, such
holders Unvested Options shall, upon the decision of NYX, be deemed
terminated and such holder shall thereafter have no rights with respect to
such Unvested Options. The number of shares of NYX Stock subject to each such
Assumed Option shall be equal to the number of shares of Stock subject to each
such Unvested Option immediately prior to conversion _multiplied by_ the
Conversion Ratio (as may be recalculated from time to time pursuant to the
definition thereof), rounded down to the nearest whole share of NYX Stock, and
such Assumed Option shall have an exercise price per share (rounded up to the
nearest penny) equal to the per share exercise price specified in such
Unvested Option immediately prior to conversion _divided by_ the Conversion
Ratio (as may be recalculated from time to time pursuant to the definition
thereof) (the " _Option Conversion Amounts_ "); _provided_ that, the number
of shares of NYX Stock subject to such Assumed Option  



 

18  and the terms and conditions of exercise of such Assumed Option shall be
determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code; _provided, further_ , that in the case of an
Assumed Option that vests and is exercised after the Closing but before any
Recalculation Date, NYX shall recalculate the Option Conversion Amounts
promptly after such Recalculation Date using the Conversion Ratio in effect
after the Recalculation Date, and if such recalculation would result in the
holder receiving a greater number of shares of NYX Stock than the sum of (i)
the shares such holder actually received upon exercise of the Assumed Option
and (ii) the shares such holder received as a result of any prior
recalculation on an Recalculation Date, NYX will transfer such additional
shares, rounded down to the nearest whole share of NYX stock, to such holder.
Following the Closing, the vesting of an unvested Assumed Option shall be
contingent on the holders continued service to the Company, NYX or an
Affiliate thereof, as applicable, in accordance with the vesting terms
of such option immediately prior to the Closing, which shall remain in effect
after Closing. All other restrictions on any Unvested Option immediately prior
to the Closing will continue in full force and effect and, except as described
above, the terms and conditions of each assumed Unvested Option will remain
unchanged; _provided,_ that the Board of Directors of NYX or a committee
thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Company Board
or Directors or any committee thereof under the Company Stock Plan.

(b) (i) Each of Buyer and NYX agrees that each UK EMI Option shall be assumed
by NYX as set forth below. Without the need to further amend the Company Stock
Plan or to incorporate the Company Stock Plans terms into a plan of NYX, such
UK EMI Options shall cease, as of the Closing, to represent a right to
acquire shares of Stock and shall be deemed assumed from and after the Closing
and deemed to constitute an option to purchase shares of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of NYX Stock (each such option, an " _Assumed UK EMI
Option_ ") on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such UK
EMI Option immediately prior to the Closing and under the Company Stock Plan;
_provided_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to any such assumption
of UK EMI Options, the holder thereof must first execute and deliver a Stock
Option Cash Out Agreement and, if such holder does not or is unwilling to
execute and deliver a Stock Option Cash Out Agreement prior to the
tenth (10th) Business Day after the Closing, such holders UK EMI Options
shall, upon the decision of NYX, be deemed terminated and such holder shall
thereafter have no rights with respect to such UK EMI Options. The number of
shares of NYX Stock subject to each such Assumed UK EMI Option shall be equal
to the number of shares of Stock subject to each such UK EMI Option
immediately prior to conversion _multiplied by_ the Conversion Ratio
calculated as of the Closing Date (and not, for the sake of clarity, as may
otherwise be recalculated pursuant to the definition thereof), rounded down to
the nearest whole share of NYX Stock, and such Assumed UK EMI Option shall
have an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest penny) equal to
the per share exercise price specified in such UK EMI Option immediately prior
to conversion _divided by_ the Conversion Ratio calculated as of the Closing
Date (and not, for the sake of clarity, as may otherwise be recalculated
pursuant to the definition thereof) (the " _UK Option Conversion Amounts_ ").
Following the Closing, the vesting of an unvested Assumed UK EMI Option shall
be contingent on the holders continued service to the Company, NYX or an
Affiliate thereof, as applicable, in accordance with the vesting terms of such
option immediately prior to the Closing, which shall remain in effect after
Closing. All other restrictions on any UK EMI Option immediately prior to the
Closing will continue in full force and effect and, except as described above,
the terms and conditions of each assumed UK EMI Option will remain  



 

19  unchanged; _provided,_ that the Board of Directors of NYX or a committee
thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Company
Board or Directors or any committee thereof under the Company Stock Plan. In
addition to the assumption of the UK EMI Option by NYX, and subject to the UK
EMI Option Holder executing a Stock Option Cash Out Agreement pursuant to the
above, the UK EMI Option Holder shall have the right to receive for each
share of Stock to which such UK EMI Option pertains (i) the Indemnification
Escrow Distributions, if any and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, (ii) the Reimbursement Escrow
Distributions, if any and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, (iii) the Terminated Option Amount
Distributions, if any and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, (iv) the Terminated SAR Unit Amount Distributions, if any and
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (v) Aged Receivables
Distributions, if any and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, and (vi) the Purchase Price Adjustment Payments, if any and
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to be paid by Buyer
in accordance with the payment instructions set forth on the Closing
Consideration Exhibit.

(ii) Neither Buyer, NYX nor any of their Affiliates shall have any liability
hereunder resulting from any failure by the UK Revenue authorities to accept
the Assumed UK EMI Options as qualifying Enterprise Management Incentives
under Section 5 Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003.

(c) At the Closing, by virtue of the Closing and without the need of any
further corporate action, NYX shall assume the Company Stock Plan, with the
result that all obligations of the Company under the Company Stock Plan,
including with respect to the Unvested Options and UK EMI Options outstanding
at the Closing, shall be obligations of NYX following the Closing. Prior to
the Closing, the Company shall take any action necessary to effect the
transactions contemplated by the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.6
under the terms of the Company Stock Plan, all Company Stock Option
agreements, and any other plan, agreement or arrangement of Company, including
the giving of any notice required under any plan or agreement relating to the
Stock Options. NYX shall take such actions as are reasonably necessary for the
assumption of the Unvested Options and UK EMI Options pursuant to this Section
2.6, including the reservation, issuance and listing of NYX Stock as is
necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.6. NYX
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file with the SEC
a registration statement on Form S-8 or other appropriate form with respect
to shares of NYX Stock subject to the Assumed Options and Assumed UK EMI
Options and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or
registrations statements covering such Assumed Options and Assumed UK EMI
Options (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses
contained therein) for so long as such Assumed Options and Assumed UK EMI
Options remain outstanding.

(d) In the event a Stock Option becomes a Terminated Option, then,

(i) as to any Assumed UK EMI Option or portion thereof that is a Terminated
Option, the difference between (A) the Closing Per Share Payment Amount
_times_ the number of shares of Stock subject to each UK EMI Option that is
attributable to such Terminated Option, and (B) the aggregate exercise price
of each such UK EMI Option, and



 

20 (ii) as to any other Terminated Option (that was never an Assumed UK EMI
Option), the difference between (A) the Option/SAR Per Share Payment Amount
as calculated at such time _times_ the number of shares of Stock subject to
each Unvested Option or Vested Option, that is attributable to such Terminated
Option, and (B) the aggregate exercise price of the Unvested Option or Vested
Option, as applicable, attributable to such Terminated Option

(in each case, such difference, as reduced by an amount retained by NYX as
consideration for recalculating the Option Conversion Amounts, but without
other deduction or offset, the " _Terminated Option Amount_ ") shall be held
by NYX for the account of the Equity Holders. Within fifty (50) days after
the Last Unvested Option/SAR Unit Date, NYX shall calculate the Terminated
Option Amount Distributions, if any, to be made to each Combined Holder, and
shall provide the Seller Representative with a summary of the Terminated
Option Amount Distributions and the names of the applicable Combined Holders.
The Seller Representative shall have ten (10) days to reasonably object to any
information or calculation set forth in the notice from NYX. Within sixty
(60) days after the Last Unvested Options/SAR Unit Date and subject to Section
2.11, NYX shall distribute to the Seller Representative an amount equal to the
sum of the Terminated Option Amount Distributions payable to the Combined
Holders. Following receipt by the Seller Representative of such amount, the
Seller Representative shall make Terminated Option Amount Distributions to the
applicable Combined Holders pursuant to the provisions of Section 10.15,
and neither NYX nor Buyer shall have any further liability with respect to
the Terminated Option Amount Distributions, including any liability in regard
to distributions of Terminated Option Amounts made by the Seller
Representative.

(e) As soon as practicable after the Closing, NYX shall deliver to the holders
of the Unvested Options appropriate notices setting forth such holders
rights pursuant to the Company Stock Plan and the agreements evidencing the
grants of such Unvested Options and that such Unvested Options and agreements
shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to
the adjustments required by this Section 2.6).

SECTION 2.7 _Unvested SAR Units_.

(a) Each of Buyer and NYX agrees that Unvested SAR Units shall be substituted
with unvested stock appreciation right units with respect to NYX Stock as set
forth below. Without the need to further amend the Company SARs Plan (except
to the extent the terms thereof are rendered inoperative by reason of the
corporate transaction contemplated hereby) or to incorporate the Company
SARs Plans terms into a plan of NYX, such Unvested SAR Units shall cease, as
of the Closing, to represent a right to receive any future appreciation with
respect to the value of Stock, and shall be substituted at the Closing for
rights to receive amounts with respect to the future appreciation with
respect to the value of NYX Stock (" _Substituted SAR Units_ "), on the same
terms and conditions as were applicable to such Unvested SAR Units immediately
prior to the Closing and under the Company SARs Plan. The number of
Substituted SAR Units received by a particular holder shall be equal to the
number of Unvested SAR Units held by such holder immediately prior to Closing
multiplied by the Conversion Ratio (as may be recalculated from time to time
pursuant to the definition thereof), rounded down to the nearest whole
Substituted SAR Unit, and such Substituted SAR Units shall have a Base Value
per Unit (rounded up to the nearest penny) equal to the Base Value per Unit
 



 

21  of the Unvested SAR Unit immediately prior to conversion divided by the
Conversion Ratio (as may be recalculated from time to time pursuant to the
definition thereof) (the " _SAR Unit Conversion Amounts_ "); _provided_ that,
the number of Substituted SAR Units, the Base Values of such Substituted SAR
Units, and the terms and conditions of exercise of such Substituted SAR Units
shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section
424(a) of the Internal Revenue Code as if such Substituted SAR Units were
incentive stock options as defined in Section 422(b) of the Internal Revenue
Code; _provided, further,_ that in the case of a Substituted SAR Unit that
vests and is exercised after the Closing but before any Assumed Recalculation
Date, NYX shall recalculate the SAR Unit Conversion Amounts promptly after
such Assumed Recalculation Date using the Conversion Ratio in effect after
the Assumed Recalculation Date, and if such recalculation would result in the
holder receiving a greater amount for such Substituted SAR Unit than the sum
of (i) the amount such holder actually received upon exercise of the
Substituted SAR Unit and (ii) the amount such holder received as a result of
any prior recalculation on an Assumed Recalculation Date, NYX will transfer
such additional amount to such holder. Following the Closing, the vesting of
an unvested Substituted SAR Unit shall be contingent on the holders continued
service to the Company, NYX or an Affiliate thereof, as applicable, in
accordance with the vesting terms of such unit immediately prior to
the Closing, which shall remain in effect after Closing. All other
restrictions on any Unvested SAR Units immediately prior to the Closing will
continue in full force and effect and, except as described in this Section
2.7, the terms and conditions of each substituted Unvested SAR Unit will
remain unchanged; _provided_ , that the Board of Directors of NYX or a
committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the
Company Board or Directors or any committee thereof under the Company SARs
Plan; _provided, further,_ that the fair market value of a Substituted SAR
Unit on the date such Substituted SAR Unit is settled shall be (i) the closing
sale price of NYX Stock as quoted on the New York Stock Exchange (or, if
there is no closing sale price for NYX Stock on such date, the closing sale
price for NYX Stock on the last preceding date for which such quotation
exists) _times_ 10.0, _minus_ (ii) the Base Value of such Substituted SAR
Unit.

(b) At the Closing, by virtue of the Closing and without the need of any
further corporate action, NYX shall assume the Company SARs Plan, with the
result that all obligations of the Company under the Company SARs Plan,
including with respect to the Unvested SAR Units outstanding at the Closing,
shall be obligations of NYX following the Closing. Prior to the Closing,
the Company shall take any action necessary to effect the transactions
contemplated by the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.7 under the terms
of the Company SARs Plan, all Company SAR Unit agreements, and any other plan,
agreement or arrangement of Company, including the giving of any notice
required under any plan or agreement relating to the SAR Units. NYX shall take
such actions as are reasonably necessary for the substitution of the Unvested
SAR Units pursuant to this Section 2.7, including, for example, amending such
terms of the Company SARs Plan that are rendered inoperative by reason of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as described above in Section
2.7(a).

(c) In the event a Substituted SAR Unit, or any portion thereof, that
conclusively expires, lapses, terminates, is cancelled or forfeited or is no
longer able to vest (for any reason) without having been exercised (such
Substituted SAR Units, or portion thereof, a " _Terminated SAR Unit_ "), then,
as to such Terminated SAR Unit, the difference between (A) 10.0 times the
Option/SAR Per Share Payment Amount as calculated at such time and (B) the  



 

22  aggregate Base Value of the Unvested SAR Units attributable to such
Terminated SAR Unit (such difference, as reduced by an amount retained by NYX
as consideration for recalculating the SAR Unit Conversion Amounts, but
without other deduction or offset, the " _Terminated SAR Unit Amount_ ") shall
be held by NYX for the account of the Equity Holders. Within fifty (50) days
after the Last Unvested Option/SAR Unit Date and subject to Section 2.11, NYX
shall calculate the Terminated SAR Unit Distributions, if any, to be made to
each Combined Holder, and shall provide the Seller Representative with a
summary of the Terminated SAR Unit Distributions and the names of the
applicable Combined Holders. The Seller Representative shall have ten (10)
days to reasonably object to any information or calculation set forth in the
notice from NYX. Within sixty (60) days after the Last Unvested Options/SAR
Unit Date, NYX shall distribute to the Seller Representative an amount equal
to the sum of the Terminated SAR Unit Distributions payable to the Combined
Holders. Following receipt by the Seller Representative of such amount, the
Seller Representative shall make Terminated SAR Unit Distributions to the
applicable Combined Holders pursuant to the provisions of Section 10.15, and
neither NYX nor Buyer shall have any further liability with respect to the
Terminated SAR Units, including any liability in regard to distributions of
Terminated SAR Units made by the Seller Representative.

(d) As soon as practicable after the Closing, NYX shall deliver to the holders
of the Unvested SAR Units appropriate notices setting forth such holders
rights pursuant to the Company SARs Plan and the agreements evidencing the
grants of such Unvested SAR Units and that such Unvested SAR Units and
agreements shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject
to the adjustments required by this Section 2.7).

SECTION 2.8 _ML Warrants; ML Convertible Note_.

(a) The Company shall comply with all provisions of the ML Warrants applicable
to the Closing and the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company shall provide any notices to the holders of such ML
Warrants as required therein. Each ML Warrant shall be deemed to be
automatically exercised immediately prior to the Closing on a cashless
exercise basis in accordance with Section 1.7 of each ML Warrant and, for
purposes of this Agreement, ML IBK will, as of the Closing, be treated as
holding the number of shares of Stock that would result from such cashless
exercise. However, it is understood and agreed that actual shares of Stock
will not actually be delivered to ML IBK in connection with such deemed
exercise and shall instead be held for delivery to Buyer at Closing. ML IBK
hereby agrees to the foregoing and to take all actions reasonably necessary to
effect the foregoing.

(b) The Company shall comply with all provisions of the ML Convertible Note
applicable to the Closing and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall provide any notices to the
holder of the ML Convertible Note as required therein. The ML Convertible Note
shall be deemed to be automatically converted into shares of Stock immediately
prior to the Closing and, for purposes of this Agreement, ML IBK will, as of
the Closing, be treated as holding the number of shares of Stock that would
result from such conversion. However, it is understood and agreed that actual
shares of Stock will not actually be delivered to ML IBK in connection with
such deemed conversion and shall instead be held for delivery to Buyer at
Closing. ML IBK hereby agrees to the foregoing and to take all actions
reasonably necessary to effect the foregoing.



 

23 (c) ML IBK, in its capacity as the holder of Stock, the ML Warrants and ML
Convertible Note, hereby expressly waives any rights it has as a result of
the transactions described in this Article II arising under that certain Right
of First Refusal Agreement dated as of November 14, 2005 among the Company, ML
IBK, Ronald B. Verstappen and Daniel Moore, which agreement provides ML IBK
with certain rights of first refusal and co-sale rights upon the proposed sale
of Stock by Ronald B. Verstappen, Daniel Moore and their transferees.

SECTION 2.9 _Conveyances at Closing_.

(a) _Company and Seller Deliveries_. At the Closing, the Company and the
Sellers shall, and to the extent applicable, the Company shall cause each of

SECTION 2.10 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

(a) _Net Tangible Assets_. " _Net Tangible Assets_ " shall mean the Companys
tangible assets  _less_ its tangible liabilities calculated on the basis of
the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet, with such adjustments thereto as set
forth on _Exhibit E,_ or the Closing Date Balance Sheet, with such adjustments
thereto as set forth on _Exhibit E_ , as the case may be, in accordance with
the applicable provisions of this Section 2.10.

(b) _Delivery of Preliminary Statement_. Not later than three (3) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Buyer a
certificate (the " _Preliminary Statement_ ") setting forth an Estimated
Closing Date Balance Sheet, adjustments thereto and statement of the
Estimated Net Tangible Assets. The Preliminary Statement shall be certified
and signed by the Company and shall be prepared in accordance with the
requirements of this Section 2.10.

(i) The " _Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet_ " means a balance sheet of
the Company that estimates the assets and liabilities of the Company as of
the expected Closing Date, which balance sheet shall be prepared by the
Company in accordance with GAAP and utilizing the same accounting policies,
principles, methodologies and practices as were used to prepare the Balance
Sheet (applied on a consistent basis).

(ii) " _Estimated Net Tangible Assets_ " means the Companys estimate of the
Net Tangible Assets as of the close of business on the Closing Date, which
shall be calculated based on the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet by
making the adjustments to such Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet as are
shown on _Exhibit E_ hereto such that the same accounting policies,
principles, methodologies and practices as were used to make the adjustments
shown in _Exhibit E_ shall be used in making adjustments to the Estimated
Closing Date Balance Sheet (applied on a consistent basis), including that
the line items and categories of assets and liabilities used to calculate
Estimated Net Tangible Assets shall be substantially similar to those line
items and categories included in the final column of _Exhibit E_ (entitled
Business Deal Adjustments); _provided, however,_ that (1) tangible liabilities
shall include Deferred Tax Liabilities that the Company expects will exist as
of the Closing Date, (2) tangible liabilities shall include the amount owed
to Kevin Fellow as set forth in _Exhibit E plus_ any out-of-pocket Taxes
payable by the Company with respect thereto, (3) tangible liabilities shall
not include any Reimbursable Company Expenses whether or not paid prior to
the Closing Date (because if such items have been paid prior to the Closing,
the Closing Payment will be increased by such amount, and if such items have
not been paid prior to the Closing, such items should not be a liability
which, if they were a liability, would reduce the Closing Payment), (4)
tangible liabilities shall not include Excess Company Expenses (because such
items will reduce the Closing Payment) and (5) tangible liabilities
shall include the amount owed to Jonathan Lambert as set forth in _Exhibit
E_. The parties acknowledge and agree that  



 

25   _Exhibit E_ contains a sample form of Preliminary Statement based on the
Balance Sheet; with (A) the first column containing the Balance Sheet, (B)
the second and third columns showing the adjustments made to remove line items
and/or categories from the Balance Sheet that are not tangible assets or
tangible liabilities, (C) the fourth column showing adjustments made to
estimate changes that are expected to occur by the end of the three month
period commencing on the Balance Sheet Date (which adjustments would not be
needed for purposes of the Preliminary Statement) and (D) the fifth column
containing the line items and categories of assets and liabilities used to
calculated Estimated Net Tangible Assets.

(c) _Initial Purchase Price Adjustment_. At the Closing, the Closing Payment
shall be (i) increased, dollar for dollar, by the amount by which the
Estimated Net Tangible Assets exceeds zero dollars ($0.00) (the " _Benchmark_
") and (ii) decreased, dollar for dollar, by the amount by which the
Estimated Net Tangible Assets is less than the Benchmark.

(d) _Post-Closing Statement_. Within sixty (60) calendar days after the
Closing Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver to Buyer and the Seller
Representative a statement (the " _Post-Closing Statement_ ") setting forth
the Closing Date Balance Sheet, adjustments thereto and statement of the
Final Net Tangible Assets, in each case prepared in accordance with this
Section 2.10.

(i) The " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ " means a balance sheet of the Company
as of the close of business on the Closing Date which balance sheet shall be
prepared by the Company in accordance with GAAP and utilizing the
same accounting policies, principles, methodologies and practices as were
used to prepare the Balance Sheet (applied on a consistent basis). Solely in
connection with the preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet, Buyer
agrees that it shall not, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries
not to, take any actions with respect to the accounting books and records of
the Company and its Subsidiaries on which the Post-Closing Statement is to be
based that are not consistent with Company and its Subsidiaries past
practices.

(ii) " _Final Net Tangible Assets_ " means the Net Tangible Assets as of the
close of business on the Closing Date, which shall be calculated based on the
Closing Date Balance Sheet by making the adjustments to such Closing Date
Balance Sheet as are shown on _Exhibit E_ hereto such that the same
accounting policies, principles, methodologies and practices as were used to
make the adjustments shown in _Exhibit E_ shall be used in making adjustments
to the Closing Date Balance Sheet (applied on a consistent basis), including
that the line items and categories of assets and liabilities used to
calculate Final Net Tangible Assets shall be substantially similar to those
line items and categories included in the final column of _Exhibit E_
(entitled _Business Deal Adjustments_ );  _provided, however,_ that (1)
tangible liabilities shall include Deferred Tax Liabilities as of the close of
business on the Closing Date, (2) tangible liabilities shall include the
amount owed to Kevin Fellow as set forth in  _Exhibit E plus_ any out-of-
pocket Taxes payable by the Company with respect thereto (unless such
liability shall not be outstanding as of the close of business on the Closing
Date), (3) tangible liabilities shall not include any Reimbursable Company
Expenses not paid prior to the Closing Date (because by not including such
items as liabilities, the Adjustment Amount will be increased), (4) tangible
liabilities shall include Excess Company Expenses that are outstanding as of
the close of  



 

26  business on the Closing Date and with respect to which the Closing Payment
was not reduced (because by including such items as liabilities, the
Adjustment Amount will be decreased) and (5) tangible liabilities shall
include the amount owed to Jonathan Lambert as set forth in _Exhibit E_ ; and
_provided, further_ that the fourth column of _Exhibit E_ (showing adjustments
made to estimate changes that are expected to occur by the end of the three
month period commencing on the Balance Sheet Date) shall not appear on the
Post-Closing Statement.

(e) _Disputes_. During the sixty (60) calendar day period following receipt of
the Post-Closing Statement, Seller Representative and its representatives
shall be permitted to review the books, records, working papers and all other
information and materials relating to the Post-Closing Statement, and the
Company shall cooperate with the Seller Representative to provide it and its
representatives with access to facilities and personnel and any other
information used in preparing the Post-Closing Statement reasonably requested
by them. The Post-Closing Statement shall become final and binding on the
sixtieth (60th) calendar day following receipt thereof, provided the Company
has reasonably cooperated as provided above, unless the Seller Representative
gives written notice of its disagreement with the Post-Closing Statement (a "
_Notice of Disagreement_ ") to the Company on or prior to such date. Any
Notice of Disagreement shall specify the nature of any disagreement so
asserted. If a Notice of Disagreement is received by the Company in a timely
manner, then the Post-Closing Statement (as revised in accordance with this
sentence) shall become final and binding on the earlier of (i) the date on
which the Company and the Seller Representative resolve in writing
any differences they have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice
of Disagreement or (ii) the date on which any disputed matters are finally
resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm. During the thirty (30) calendar
day period following the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, the Company
and the Seller Representative shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing
any differences that they may have with respect to the matters specified in
the Notice of Disagreement. If such dispute has not been resolved by the end
of such thirty (30) calendar day period, the Company and the Seller
Representative shall submit for resolution any and all matters that remain in
dispute and were properly included in the Notice of Disagreement to KPMG(or
such other nationally recognized independent accounting firm that is mutually
agreed upon by the Company and the Seller Representative) (the " _Accounting
Firm_ ") for resolution by a mutually acceptable partner of the Accounting
Firm ( _provided_ that if either party shall reasonably discover a conflict of
interest associated with KPMG, the parties shall retain Deloitte and Touche to
act as the Accounting Firm). The Company and the Seller Representative shall
retain the Accounting Firm no later than five (5) Business Days following the
expiration of such 30-day period. In the event of a failure to retain the
Accounting Firm during such time period, either the Company or the Seller
Representative, acting individually, shall have the right to retain the
Accounting Firm on behalf of both the Company and the Sellers. The Company and
the Seller Representative shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Accounting Firm to render a decision resolving any matters
submitted to the Accounting Firm within thirty (30) calendar days following
submission thereof. Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the
Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the party against which
such determination is to be enforced. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company, the Company and the Seller Representative shall each
promptly provide, or cause to be provided, to the Accounting Firm all
information, and to make available to the Accounting Firm all personnel, as
are reasonably necessary to permit the Accounting Firm to resolve any disputes
pursuant to this Section 2.10. The cost of any arbitration (including the
fees and expenses of the  



 

27  Accounting Firm and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses of the parties)
pursuant to this Section 2.10(e) shall be borne by the Company, on the one
hand, and the Seller Representative, on the other hand (from the Reimbursement
Escrow Amount) proportionately based on which partys position was closest to
the determination of the Accounting Firm. The scope of the disputes to be
resolved by the Accounting Firm, and the scope of the Accounting Firms
review, shall be limited to disputes concerning whether such calculation was
performed in accordance with the guidelines set forth in this Section 2.10,
whether there were errors in the Post-Closing Statement and the other matters
specifically set forth in this Section 2.10(e), and the Accounting Firm shall
not make any other determination. The date on which the Final Net Tangible
Assets is finally determined in accordance with this Section 2.10(e) is
hereinafter referred to as the " _Determination Date_."

(f) _Final Purchase Price Adjustment_. The " _Adjustment Amount_ ," which may
be positive or negative, shall equal the sum of (i) the Final Net Tangible
Assets _minus_ the Estimated Net Tangible Assets, which may be positive or
negative. If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number and the Adjustment
Amount exceeds $100,000, then the amount due by Buyer hereunder shall be
increased, in accordance with Section 2.10(f)(i), by the absolute value of the
Adjustment Amount, and if the Adjustment Amount is a negative number and the
absolute value of the Adjustment Amount exceeds $100,000, then the amount due
by Buyer hereunder shall be decreased, in accordance with Section 2.10(f)(ii),
by the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount.

(i) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number then, promptly following the
Determination Date, and in any event within five (5) Business Days
thereafter, if the Adjustment Amount exceeds $100,000, the Adjustment Amount,
as finally determined plus interest on the Adjustment Amount from the Closing
Date to the date of payment at the "Prime Rate" of interest published in the
"Money Rates" column of _The Wall Street Journal_ (or the average of such
rates if more than one rate is indicated) on the Closing Date shall be due by
Buyer, which such amount shall be deemed to have been paid in full by Buyer
upon the following: (i) Buyer shall pay to the Combined Holders the Purchase
Price Adjustment Payments pursuant to Section 2.3 and (ii) the Conversion
Ratio shall be adjusted pursuant to the definition thereof on the
Recalculation Date on which the Buyer makes such payments to the Combined
Holders.

(ii) If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number then, promptly following
the Determination Date, and in any event within five (5) Business Days
thereafter, if the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount exceeds $100,000,
the Escrow Agent shall pay to Buyer out of the Indemnification Escrow Fund an
amount equal to the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount, as finally
determined plus interest on the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount from
the Closing Date to the date of payment at the "Prime Rate" of interest
published in the "Money Rates" column of _The Wall Street Journal_ (or the
average of such rates if more than one rate is indicated) on the Closing Date.

(g) _Limitations on Adjustment_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 2.10, in no event shall (i) Buyer be entitled to payment
pursuant to this Section 2.10 of any amount in excess of the Indemnification
Escrow Fund or (ii) the Seller Representative or any Combined Holder have any
liability under this Section 2.10 or otherwise in excess of such Combined
Holders allocable share of the Indemnification Escrow Fund.



 

28 SECTION 2.11 _Withholding_. Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to an Equity Holder such amounts
as Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is required to deduct and
withhold or to pay with respect to such payment under the Internal Revenue
Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Equity Holder in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Buyer.

ARTICLE III.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, the Company shall deliver to Buyer a disclosure schedule with
numbered sections corresponding to the relevant sections in this Agreement
(the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ "). Any exception or qualification set
forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule with respect to a particular
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be an exception or qualification with respect to all other
applicable representations, warranties and covenants contained in this
Agreement only to the extent that such disclosure is sufficiently detailed to
allow a reasonable person to identify the other sections of this Agreement to
which such exceptions and qualifications are applicable. Nothing in the
Company Disclosure Schedule is intended to broaden the scope of any
representation, warranty or covenant of the Company contained in
this Agreement. Subject to the exceptions and qualifications set forth in the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company hereby represents and warrants to
Buyer as of the date hereof and as of the Closing as follows:

SECTION 3.1 _Authority_. The Company has all requisite corporate power and
authority to enter into this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder
and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance by
the Company of its obligations hereunder, and the consummation by the Company
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, have been duly authorized
by the Board of Directors of the Company, and no other corporate action on the
part of the Company is necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its
obligations hereunder or the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and, assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by the other parties to this Agreement, this Agreement constitutes a
legally valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by principles of public policy, and subject to (a) the effect of any
applicable Law of general application relating to bankruptcy, reorganization,
insolvency, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors rights and relief
of debtors generally and (b) the effect of rules of Law and general principles
of equity, including rules of Law and general principles of equity governing

corporation or other entity, as applicable, and is in good standing (to the
extent such concept is applicable), under the Laws of each jurisdiction in

nature of its activities, makes such qualification necessary, except in those
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing, when
taken together with all other failures by the Company to be so qualified or
in good standing, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect. Section 3.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule _ _ sets forth,
as of the date hereof, a true, correct and complete list of all foreign
jurisdictions in which the Company and the Subsidiaries are so qualified or
licensed and in good standing (to the extent such concept is applicable). True

accurately reflect, as of the Closing Date, all matters required to be set
forth in the Capitalization Table pursuant to Section 3.3(a) above.

been obtained or made, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder, and the

36 SECTION 3.9 _Tax Matters_.

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have prepared and timely filed
all Tax Returns required to be filed by or on behalf of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries with respect to Taxes concerning or attributable to the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries or their operations for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period, taking into account any extension of time to file that has been
granted to, or obtained by or on behalf of, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. All such Tax Returns are complete and accurate in all respects.
All Taxes due and payable (whether or not shown to be payable by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries on such Tax Returns) have been paid or will be
paid, and no deficiency for any amount of Taxes has been proposed, asserted or
assessed by a Taxing Authority against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
which deficiency remains unpaid. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries (i)
have complied in all respects with applicable Laws relating to the withholding
of Taxes (including withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442,
3121, and 3402 of the Internal Revenue Code or similar provisions under any
other Laws) and have, in all respects within the time and manner prescribed by
Law, paid to the proper Taxing Authority all amounts required to be withheld
and paid under all applicable Laws and (ii) are not liable for any Taxes or
any penalty for failure to comply with the foregoing. The unpaid Taxes of the
Company for Tax periods through the Closing do not exceed the accruals and
reserves for Taxes (excluding accruals and reserves for deferred Taxes
established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set
forth on the Balance Sheet. Since the Balance Sheet Date, the Company has
incurred no liabilities for Taxes except in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practices.

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, no waivers of statutes of limitations
have been given with respect to any Tax Returns of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, which waivers are currently in effect, and no request for
any such waiver is currently pending. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has requested an extension of time within which to file any Tax
Return in any taxable year which has not since been filed. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has agreed to an extension of time with
respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency, or have executed any powers of
attorney with respect to Tax matters which currently remain in effect. No
requests for ruling or determination letters or competent authority relief
with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is currently pending
with any Taxing Authority with respect to any Taxes. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any private letter ruling of the
Internal Revenue Service or any comparable ruling of any other Taxing
Authority. No U.S. federal, state, or local, or foreign audit, proceeding, or
other examination of any Tax Return of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is presently in progress, nor, to the knowledge of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, is any such audit, proceeding, or other examination threatened
or contemplated. No issue has been raised by any Taxing Authority in any
current or prior audit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which, by
application of the same principles, would reasonably be expected to result in
a material deficiency for any subsequent Tax period. No deficiencies for any
Taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed against the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries which have not been resolved and paid in full.

expense, a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement within ten (10) Business
Days of the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall request early termination of
the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and each of Buyer and the
Company shall supply promptly any additional information and documentary

in connection with any filing under applicable antitrust Laws and in
connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry concerning the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement commenced by any Governmental
Authority, including the United States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust
Division of the United States Department of Justice, or the office of any
state attorney general.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the terms of Section 6.5(a), as
promptly as practicable following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, Buyer shall take, or cause to be taken, all action necessary,
proper or advisable to obtain all financing necessary to make the payments

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to
satisfy any other payment obligations that Buyer may incur in connection with,
and that may be required in order to consummate, the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.



 

65 (d) Notwithstanding any other covenant contained in this Section 6.5 or
elsewhere in this Agreement, in connection with the receipt of any necessary
approvals or consents or the giving of any notices (including any of the
foregoing required under the HSR Act), neither Buyer, any of its Affiliates,
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to (i) divest or
hold separate any business, assets or operations or (ii) otherwise take or
commit to take any action to the extent that taking or committing to take such
action would (A) materially and adversely affect Buyer and its Subsidiaries,
or the business of Buyer and its Subsidiaries, in each case, taken as a whole,
or (B) materially and adversely affect the benefits expected to be derived by
Buyer from the transactions contemplated herein (any of the foregoing, an "
_Unacceptable Restraint_ ").

SECTION 6.6 _Further Action_. Subject to the terms and conditions provided in
this Agreement, each of the parties to this Agreement shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver, or cause to be delivered, such
further certificates, instruments and other documents, and to take, or cause

under applicable Law to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 6.7 _Tax Matters_.

(a) All Tax Returns of the Company required to be filed between the
date hereof and the Closing (i) will be filed by the Company when due (after
taking into account timely filed extensions) in accordance with all applicable
Laws and (ii) as of the time of filing, will be complete and accurate in all
respects. The Company will promptly deliver to Buyer true, correct and
complete copies of all Tax Returns of the Company that are prepared on or
after the date hereof and prior to the Closing. The Company shall pay all
Taxes with respect to such Tax Returns. 

(b) Buyer shall be responsible for filing or causing to be filed all Tax
Returns required to be filed by the Company other than Tax Returns described
in Section 6.7(a) above, and Buyer shall, subject to Section 6.7(c) below, pay
or cause to be paid the Taxes shown to be due on any such Tax Returns.

(c) Subject to the limitations of Article IX, Sellers will indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer for (i) any Taxes imposed on or payable with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and (ii) any
Taxes of any person (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) imposed on
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as of the Closing) as a transferee
or successor, by contract or pursuant to any law, rule, or regulation, which
Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring before the Closing, to the
extent such Taxes described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section are not
included as a liability on the Balance Sheet.

(d) In order to apportion appropriately any Taxes relating to a Straddle
Period to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, the parties hereto shall, to the extent
permitted under applicable Law, elect with the relevant Taxing Authority to
treat for all Tax purposes the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable
year or period of the Company. In any case where applicable Law does not
permit the Company to treat the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable
year or period, the portion of any Taxes that are allocable to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall be: (A) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic
basis (and not based on invoices, receipts, sales  



 

66  or payments), deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days
in the Straddle Period ending on (and including) the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire relevant
Straddle Period, and (B) in the case of Taxes not described in (A) (such as
taxes that are either (x) income taxes, or (y) imposed in connection with any
sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible
or intangible)), deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the
taxable year or period ended and the books closed at the close of the Closing
Date.

(e) After the Closing Date, Sellers shall (i) provide to Buyer
such assistance as may reasonably be requested by Buyer in connection with
the preparation, or audit or other controversy, of or with respect to any Tax
Return with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Straddle Periods and (ii)
retain, or cause to be retained, for so long as any such taxable years or
audits shall remain open for adjustments, any records or information which may
be relevant to any such Tax Returns or audits.

(f) At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Buyer a
certificate described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2(c) (a "
_FIRPTA Certificate_ ") in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer
establishing that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not
subject to withholding under Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code. 

(g) All transfer, documentary, sales and use, registration, value-added, stamp
or other similar Taxes, if any, arising out of or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_
") shall be paid by Buyer when due, and Buyer shall, at its own expense, file
all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
Transfer Taxes. Buyer and the Sellers shall cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other party, in the preparation, execution
and filing of all Tax Returns, applications or other documents regarding
any Transfer Taxes that become payable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 6.8 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

(a) Buyer agrees that, for a period beginning on the Closing Date and ending
on the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Benefits Continuation
Period_ "), Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to,
provide employee benefits to Company Employees that are substantially similar
in the aggregate to the benefits that are provided under the Company Benefit
Plans immediately prior to the Closing. Nothing in this Section 6.8 shall be
construed in any way to increase or extend the obligations of the Buyer, the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company under the terms of such Company
Benefit Plans or to restrict existing rights of the Company or any such
Subsidiary to terminate or modify such Company Benefit Plans. With respect to
any benefit plans of the Buyer in which Company Employees may be eligible to
participate after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall: (A) waive any
limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Company
Employees to the extent it would not have prevented coverage under the
Company Benefit Plans; (B) provide each Company Employee with credit for any
co-payments and deductibles paid on or prior to the Closing Date during the
year in which the Closing Date occurs in satisfying any applicable deductible
or out-of-pocket  



 

67  requirements to the extent it would be recognized under the Company Benefit
Plans and (C) recognize all service of the Company Employees with the Company
or any Affiliate or predecessor thereof for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting credit and entitlement for benefits (other than benefit
accruals), except to the extent such treatment would result in duplicative
benefits. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer any third-party
beneficiary rights or other rights or remedies upon any Company Employee.

(b) While it is Buyers present intention to provide, during the Benefits
Continuation Period, each Company Employee with a base salary that is no less
favorable than the base salary that was in effect for such Company Employee
immediately prior to the Closing, Buyer reserves the right to adjust the base
salaries of the Company Employees in its sole and absolute discretion
following the Closing Date.

(c) As of the Closing, NYX shall issue RSUs pursuant to Restricted Stock Unit
Agreements substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit F_ (an " _RSU
Agreement_ "), which such RSUs shall be subject to the NYX Stock Incentive
Plan and shall vest in accordance with the terms set forth in the RSU
Agreement, shall be issued in accordance with and subject to _Exhibit G_.

SECTION 6.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

(a) The Company shall give prompt written notice to Buyer of (i) any Actions
by any Governmental Authority commenced or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened, involving or affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their property or assets and (ii) any notice of, or other
communication relating to, a default or event which, with notice or lapse of
time or both, would become a default, received by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Closing, under any Listed Contract or any Contract entered into after the date
of this Agreement that if in effect on the date hereof would be a Listed
Contract, to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or is
subject.

(b) The Company, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall give
prompt written notice to the other party of (i) any notice or other
communication from any third party alleging that the consent of such third
party is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby or (ii) any Material Adverse Effect on the Company or a material
adverse effect on the ability of Buyer to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, as the case may be. The Company shall give prompt written
notice to Buyer, and Buyer shall give prompt written notice to the Company,
of the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event that would be reasonably
likely to result in a failure to satisfy the closing conditions set forth in
Section 7.2 as it relates to Company or any Seller, or Section 7.1 as it
relates to the Buyer.

(c) The Company shall give notice to Buyer, and Buyer shall give notice to the
Company, promptly upon becoming aware of any occurrence, or failure to occur,
of any event, which occurrence or failure to occur has caused or could
reasonably be expected to cause any representation or warranty in this
Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any
time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing.



 

68 (d) If the Company gives Buyer a notice pursuant to this Section 6.9 that
discloses an occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence
or failure to occur makes it impossible for the Company to satisfy the
condition set forth in Section 7.2(a)(i) or (ii) (any such notice, a "
_Company Notice_ "), then Buyer shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement by providing written notice of such termination to the Company
within ten (10) days of Buyers receipt of the Company Notice, with such
termination being Buyers sole and exclusive remedy relating to any matters
set forth in the Company Notice. If Buyer fails to provide written notice of
such termination to the Company within ten (10) days of Buyers receipt of the
Company Notice, then the Company Notice shall be deemed to have amended the
Company Disclosure Schedule, to have qualified the representations and
warranties in Article III, and to have cured any misrepresentation or breach
of representation or warranty that otherwise might have existed hereunder by
reason of the occurrence, or failure to occur, of the event or events set
forth in the Company Notice.

SECTION 6.10 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. From and
after the Closing until the sixth anniversary thereof, NYX shall, and shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless
each present and former director and officer of the Company and each present
and former director and officer of each of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the
" _Company Indemnitees_ "), against any Damages incurred or suffered by any of
the Company Indemnitees in connection with any liabilities or any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Closing, to the fullest extent that the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries would have been permitted under applicable Law and
under the Company Certificate of Incorporation and Company Bylaws, or
other organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company, in each case
as in effect on the date of this Agreement, to indemnify such Company
Indemnitees and (ii) advance expenses as incurred by any Company Indemnitee in
connection with any matters for which such Company Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification from NYX pursuant to this Section 6.10(a) to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law or, if greater and permitted under
applicable Law, under the Company Certificate of Incorporation and Company
Bylaws, or other organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company;
_provided, however_ , that the Company Indemnitee to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such Company Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification
under applicable Law, the Company Certificate of Incorporation and Company
Bylaws, or other organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company,
or pursuant to this Section 6.10.

SECTION 6.11 _Provision Regarding Legal Representation_. Each of the parties
to this Agreement hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
directors, members, partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, that DLA
Piper US LLP, DLA Piper Scotland LLP and DLA Piper UK LLP (collectively " _DLA
Piper_ ") may serve as counsel to each and any Seller and their respective
Affiliates (individually and collectively, the " _Seller Group_ "), on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, and that, following consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, DLA Piper (or any of its successors) may
serve as counsel to the Seller Group or any director, member, partner,
officer, employee or Affiliate of the Seller Group, in connection with  



 

69  any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding
such representation, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents thereto
and waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each of such
parties shall cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to waive any conflict of
interest arising from such representation; _provided, however_ , that DLA
Piper shall not represent any member of the Seller Group, or any director,
member, partner, officer, employee or Affiliate of the Seller Group, in any
litigation, adversarial proceeding or adversarial negotiation or position
against another member of the Seller Group.

SECTION 6.12 _Access to Records and Personnel_. 

(a) _Exchange of Information_. After the Closing, Buyer and the Company agree
to provide, or cause to be provided, as soon as reasonably practicable after
written request therefor and at the requesting Sellers sole expense,
reasonable access, during normal business hours, to Buyers and the Companys
employees and to any books, records, documents, files and correspondence in
the possession or under the control of Buyer and the Company that the
requesting Seller reasonably needs (i) to comply with reporting, disclosure,
filing or other requirements imposed on such Seller (including under
applicable securities Laws) by a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction
over such Seller; (ii) for use in any other judicial, regulatory,
administrative or other proceeding or in order to satisfy Tax, audit,
accounting, claims, regulatory, litigation or other similar requirements or
(iii) to comply with its obligation under this Agreement; _provided, however_
, that in the event that Buyer or the Company determines that any such
provision of information could be commercially detrimental, violate any Law
or agreement, or waive any attorney-client or other similar privilege, Buyer,
the Company and the requesting Seller shall take all reasonable measures to
permit the compliance with such obligations in a manner that avoids any such
harm or consequence, and Buyer and the Company will not be under any
obligation to provide such information to the extent it would result in such
consequence notwithstanding such measures.

(b) _Financial and Other Information_. After the Closing, Buyer and the
Company shall provide, or cause to be provided, to each requesting
Seller such financial and other data and information reasonably available and
in its possession (in such form as is reasonably available to it) as is
reasonably requested by such Seller and necessary in order for such other
party to prepare its financial statements and reports or filings, including
Tax Returns, with any Governmental Authority; _provided_ that the provisions
of this Section 6.12(b) shall in no way obligate Buyer or the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries to prepare any financial statements.

(c) _Ownership of Information_. Any information owned by Buyer or the Company
that is provided to a Seller pursuant to this Section 6.12 shall be deemed to
remain the property of Buyer or the Company, as the case may be, and shall be
subject to Section 6.4(c). Unless specifically set forth herein, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting or conferring
rights of license or otherwise in any such information.

(d) _Record Retention_. Except as otherwise provided herein, Buyer and the
Company agree to use their reasonable commercial efforts to retain the books,
records, documents, instruments, accounts, correspondence, writings, evidences
of title and other papers  



 

70  relating to the Company Business in their respective possession or control
for a commercially reasonable period of time, consistent with their
regular document retention policies, following the Closing Date or for such
longer period as may be required by Law or until the expiration of the
relevant representation or warranty under this Agreement and any related claim
of indemnification related thereto.

(e) _Limitation of Liability_. Buyer and the Company shall not have any
liability to any Seller in the event that any information exchanged or
provided pursuant to this Section 6.12 is found to be inaccurate.

(f) _Production of Witnesses; Records; Cooperation_. After the Closing, in
the case of a legal or other proceeding (including a claim for
indemnification) between two or more of the parties or between one or more of
the parties and a third party relating to the Company Business,
this Agreement (including any matters subject to indemnification hereunder)
or the transactions contemplated hereby, each party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to make available to the other party, upon written request,
itself (in the case of an individual) and the former (to the extent
practicable), current (to the extent practicable) and future officers,
employees, other personnel and agents of such party as witnesses and any
books, records or other documents within its control or which it otherwise
has the ability to make available (other than materials covered by the
attorney-client privilege), to the extent that any such Person (giving
consideration to business demands of such individual party, directors,
officers, employees, other personnel and agents) or books, records or other
documents may reasonably be required, relevant or helpful in connection with
any legal, administrative or other proceeding in which a party may from time
to time be involved, regardless of whether such legal, administrative or
other proceeding is a matter with respect to which indemnification may be
sought hereunder. The requesting party shall bear all out-of-pocket costs and
expenses in connection with the foregoing.

SECTION 6.13 _Company Expenses_. The Company, at least three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing, shall deliver to Buyer (a) a schedule setting forth a
good faith estimate of all Company Expenses incurred or to be incurred by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not paid or accrued at such
time, the payee thereof and payment instructions for such payee to the
extent such Company Expenses have not been paid, and, (b) with respect to any
Company Expenses paid prior to the Closing Date, a schedule setting forth such
Company Expenses, the amount of such Company Expenses and reasonable evidence
of such payment. 

SECTION 6.14 _No Solicitation; Alternate Transactions_.

(a) The Company and each Seller agrees that, following the execution of this
Agreement, it shall not, and shall ensure that its respective Representatives
do not, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, encourage, knowingly
facilitate or induce any inquiry with respect to, or the making, submission or
announcement of, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below); (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
Person any nonpublic information with respect to, or take any other action to
facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or
may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal; (iii) engage
in discussions with any Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal; (iv)
approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal; or (v) enter into
any letter of intent or similar document or any contract, agreement or

71  otherwise relating to any Acquisition Proposal or transaction contemplated

respective Representatives, immediately cease any and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

(b) As promptly as practicable, but in any event within 24 hours, after
receipt by the Company, a Seller or any of their respective Representatives
of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information or
inquiry that it reasonably believes would lead to an Acquisition Proposal, the
Company or applicable Seller, as the case may be, shall provide Buyer with
oral and written notice of the material terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity of the Person or
group making any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and a copy of
all written materials provided in connection with such Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry. The Company or applicable Seller, as the case may be,
shall provide Buyer as promptly as practicable with oral and written notice
setting forth all such information as is reasonably necessary to keep
Buyer informed in all material respects of the status and details (including
amendments or proposed amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request
or inquiry. The provisions of this Section 6.14(b) apply only to Acquisition

offer or proposal, relating to any transaction or series of related
transactions involving: (i) any purchase or acquisition (whether though a
sale, transfer or otherwise) from such party or acquisition by any person or
"group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder) of any equity
interests (including any capital stock) or Stock Rights in the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) any sale, lease, exchange, transfer, license, acquisition
or disposition of a material portion of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (other than non-exclusive licenses of the Company Products to
customers in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices),
(iii) any liquidation or dissolution of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (iv) any other transaction the consummation of which could
reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, prevent or materially delay
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement ( _provided, however,_ the
transactions contemplated hereby shall not be deemed an Acquisition Proposal
in any case).

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.14, the
covenant set forth in this Section 6.14 shall in no way apply to or otherwise
limit any brokerage or lending activity of ML IBK or any of its Affiliates,
with respect to any activity unrelated to the investment of ML IBK in the
Company and its ownership of the Stock, ML Convertible Note and ML Warrants.

SECTION 6.15 _Noncompetition; Nonsolicitation_.

(a) Ron Verstappen (the " _Restricted Equity Holder_ ") agrees, for a period
of three (3) years following the Closing Date (the " _Restricted Period_ "),
that the Restricted Equity Holder shall not, and shall not permit any Person
who at the time is its Affiliate to, engage (for its own account or for the
benefit of any other Person), directly or indirectly, as a principal,  



 

72  proprietor, partner, officer, employee, independent contractor, broker,
consultant, agent, investor, solely or jointly with others, or as a
stockholder, member or other owner in or of any Person, in any business or
activity that, in whole or in part, competes with, or is substantially similar
to, in whole or in part, the business of the delivery and management of
financial transactions, information related to financial transactions and
financial information, including the Company Business (the " _Restricted
Business_ "); _provided, however_ , that this Section 6.15(a) shall not
prohibit the Restricted Equity Holder or any Affiliate thereof from making
investments in any Person that competes, directly or through an Affiliate,
with the Restricted Business or any part thereof, such investments not to
exceed more than five percent (5%) of the total voting power of such Person,
subject to such investment being a passive investment where neither the
Restricted Equity Holder nor any Affiliate thereof (A) intends to or has the
right to influence (other than through the voting of shares) or direct
the operations or management of any such Person or (B) is a participant with
any other Person in any group with such intention or right.

(b) The Restricted Equity Holder agrees that during the Restricted Period,
neither such Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly,
solicit, divert, take away or attempt to solicit, divert or take away (i)
any Person that was a customer or significant supplier to (or, in each case,
Affiliates thereof) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries within the two (2)
year period immediately prior to the Closing or during the Restricted Period
or (ii) any Person that was a potential customer to whom the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries marketed any Company Products during the 6 month period
immediately prior to the Closing or during the Restricted Period, in each case
for any purpose with respect to any matter, activity or service within the
scope of the Restricted Business, or contact or communicate with any such
Person for any such purpose.

(c) The Restricted Equity Holder agrees that during the Restricted Period,
neither the Restricted Equity Holder nor any of its Affiliates shall, directly
or indirectly, solicit for employment, attempt to employ or employ any
Company Employee (or contact or communicate with any Company Employee for any
such purpose); _provided, however_ , that such restrictions shall not apply to
Company Employees who are terminated by Buyer or its Affiliates;
_provided, further_ , that the Restricted Equity Holder or any of its
Affiliates may employ a Company Employee who (i) initially contacts the
Restricted Equity Holder or its Affiliate without solicitation by the
Restricted Equity Holder or its Affiliate, or (ii) responds to any general
media solicitation of employment or engagement by the Restricted Equity Holder
or its Affiliate.

(d) The Restricted Equity Holder acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates, that (i) the Restricted Business is conducted throughout
the world and that the duration and scope of the covenants and
agreements contained in this Section 6.15 are fair, reasonable and necessary
to preserve the goodwill and proprietary rights of the Restricted Business and
Buyer and its Affiliates and (ii) that the Restricted Equity Holder is
entering into, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, the covenants and
agreements contained in this Section 6.15 in contemplation of, and
consideration for, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Restricted Equity Holder further acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates, that any breach of any of the obligations set forth in
this Section 6.15 would result in irreparable damage to the Restricted
Business and Buyer and its Affiliates, which could not be compensated by
monetary damages alone. Therefore, in addition to all other legal or equitable
 



 

73  remedies that may be available to Buyer or its Affiliates for any breach of
this Section 6.15, the Restricted Equity Holder agrees that Buyer and
its Affiliates shall be entitled to equitable relief, including an injunction
enjoining any breach or threatened breach and specific performance of this
Section 6.15, as a remedy for any such breach, and the Restricted Equity
Holder further waives any requirements for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with any such remedy.

(e) If any provision contained in this Section 6.15 shall for any reason be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this
Section 6.15, but this Section 6.15 shall be construed as if such invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. It is the
intention of the parties that if any of the restrictions or covenants
contained herein is held to cover a geographic area or to be for a length of
time which is not permitted by applicable Law, or in any way construed to be
too broad or to any extent invalid, such provision shall not be construed to
be null, void and of no effect, but to the extent such provision would be
valid or enforceable under applicable Law, a court of competent jurisdiction
shall construe and interpret or reform this Section 6.15 to provide for a
covenant having the maximum enforceable geographic area, time period and other
provisions (not greater than those contained herein) as shall be valid and
enforceable under such applicable Law.

SECTION 6.16 _Post-closing Collection of Aged Receivables_.

(a) One Business Day prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Buyer
a schedule (the " _Aged Receivables Schedule_ ") setting forth a true and
accurate list of all Accounts Receivable in excess of 120 days outstanding (
_i.e.,_ Accounts Receivable that have a date of invoice that is more than 120
days prior to the Closing Date) (such Accounts Receivable, the " _Aged
Receivables_ "). The Aged Receivables Schedule shall contain the invoice
number, the date of the invoice and the amount outstanding.

(b) Following the Closing, Jonathan Lambert (the " _Receivables
Representative_ "), at his own expense (subject to reimbursement as
provided in this Section 6.16), and not as an employee of the Company or
Buyer, shall be entitled, on behalf of the Company and Buyer, to (i) collect
and otherwise enforce all payments, late charges and other related amounts due
under the Aged Receivables; and (ii) exercise all rights and remedies under
any contracts or agreements governing the Aged Receivables. The Receivables
Representative shall have the exclusive right to waive, modify, extend, renew,
release, or discharge the terms of any Aged Receivable. The Company and Buyer
agree to fully cooperate, upon the Receivables Representatives reasonable
request and at the Receivables Representatives expense, with the collection
of the Aged Receivables and enforcement of all rights and remedies under any
contracts or agreements governing the Aged Receivables.

(c) All amounts collected from Aged Receivables, whether received by the
Receivables Representative or the Company, or any of their respective
Affiliates, shall be for the account of the Equity Holders, without deduction
or offset (except for costs and expenses incurred by the Receivables
Representative), and increased by the late fee, if any, the Company is
obligated to pay pursuant to Section 6.16(d) (such amounts, as reduced by such
costs and expenses, if any, and as increased by such fee, if any, "
_Aged Receivables Amounts_ "). In the  



 

74  event Aged Receivables are recovered by the Company, an Aged Receivable is
paid directly to the Company or an Aged Receivable is delivered to the Company
by the Receivables Representative, the Company shall segregate the same, and
not commingle such collections with the Companys own funds, and hold such
amounts for the account of the Equity Holders. Within thirty (30) days after
May 31 and December 31 of each year, the Company shall calculate the Aged
Receivables Distributions, if any, payable to the Combined Holders, and shall
provide the Seller Representative with a summary of the Aged Receivables
Distributions and the names of the applicable Combined Holders. The Seller
Representative shall have ten (10) days to reasonably object to any
information or calculation set forth in the notice from the Company. The day
after such ten (10) day period, if the Seller Representative has not
objected, and subject to Section 2.11, the Company shall distribute to the
Seller Representative an amount equal to the sum of the Aged Receivables
Distributions to be made to the Combined Holders. Following receipt by the
Seller Representative of such amount and information, the Seller
Representative shall make Aged Receivables Distributions to the applicable
Combined Holders pursuant to the provisions of Section 10.15, and neither NYX
nor Buyer shall have any further liability with respect to the Aged
Receivables Amounts, including any liability in regard to distributions of
Aged Receivables Amounts made by the Seller Representative.

(d) In the event the Company fails to distribute Aged Receivables Amounts
(other than the fee pursuant this Section 6.16(d)) payable to
Combined Holders to the Seller Representative within the time limits
established by Section 6.16(c) (such amounts that the Company fails to timely
deliver, " _Overdue Amounts_ "), the Company shall be obligated to pay a late
fee equal to two percent (2%) of such Overdue Amount for each month following
the applicable time limit, until such Overdue Amounts are distributed to the
Seller Representative as required by Section 6.16(c). Any late fee due under
this Section 6.16(d) shall also be distributed to the Seller Representatives
for distribution pursuant to the provisions of Section 10.15 as part of the
Aged Receivables Amounts.

(e) All costs or expenses incurred by the Receivables Representative in the
collection of the Aged Receivables shall be deducted from the
amounts collected from the Aged Receivables prior to distribution by the
Seller Representative.

(f) For so long as Aged Receivables remain outstanding, both the Company and
the Receivables Representative shall keep books and records of account, in
which full and correct entries shall be made on a timely basis of all amounts
collected or received from Aged Receivables. On a monthly basis, each of the
Receivables Representative and the Company shall provide the other with an
accounting of such collection activity and amounts collected or received from
Aged Receivables.

(g) The Company hereby grants to the Receivables Representative a limited
power-of-attorney to (i) collect and otherwise enforce all payments,
late charges and other related amounts due under the Aged Receivables; and
(ii) exercise all rights and remedies under any contracts or agreements
governing the Aged Receivables, all on behalf of the Company as contemplated
under this Section 6.16; _provided, however_ that nothing in this Section
6.16 shall be deemed to authorize the Receivables Representative to take any
illegal or unethical action, to take any action that is materially more
aggressive than the collection activities pursued by the Company in the
ordinary course of its business prior to the Closing, or to take any action
that  



 

75  would reasonably be expected to materially interfere with any relationship
between the Company and any of the Companys then-current customers; and 
_provided, further_ that in no event shall the Company be required to
cooperate in any activity described in the preceding proviso.

SECTION 6.17 _Pre-Closing Exercise of Vested Options_. In the event prior to
Closing a Combined Holder exercises a Vested Option, the Company and the
Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the exercising
Combined Holder to execute a counterpart to this Agreement and become a
"Seller" and therefore be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 10.16.

SECTION 6.18 _Invention Assignment Agreements_. The Company and the Sellers
shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause Virginia Faro Maza
to execute, at or prior to the Closing, an agreement regarding the protection
of proprietary information and the assignment to the Company of any
Intellectual Property arising from services performed for the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries by Virginia Faro Maza, which agreement shall be in a form
reasonably acceptable to the Buyer.

itself and the Sellers);

(ii) by either the Company (on behalf of itself and the Sellers), on the one
hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, by written notice to the other party if
any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such matters shall have
issued a Governmental Order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such
Governmental Order shall have become final and unappealable; _provided,
however_ , that the terms of this Section 8.1(a)(ii) shall not be available to
any party unless such party shall have used its commercially reasonable
efforts (with the understanding that in no event shall any party be required
to take or commit to take any action that would constitute an Unacceptable
Restraint) to oppose any such Governmental Order or to have such Governmental
Order vacated or made inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to which such Governmental Order relates;

(iii) by either (A) Buyer, if there has been a material misrepresentation or
material breach on the part of the Company or a Seller in the representations,
warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement that would result in a
failure to satisfy the closing conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or (B) the
Company (on behalf of itself and the Sellers), if there has been a material
misrepresentation or material breach on the part of Buyer in the  



 

79  representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement that

intent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(a)(iii); and 

(iv) by the Company (on behalf of itself and the Sellers), on the one hand, or
Buyer, on the other hand, by written notice to the other party if the Closing
shall not have occurred on or prior to April 15, 2008 (the " _Termination
Date_ "); _provided, however,_ that if a consent that is necessary and
material to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby has not been
obtained from a Governmental Authority, the Termination Date shall be extended
to June 15, 2008, unless the failure of the Closing to have occurred on or
prior to the Termination date (as extended if applicable) is the result of
any action or inaction under this Agreement by the party seeking to terminate
the Agreement pursuant to the terms of this Section 8.1(a)(iv).

SECTION 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement and abandonment of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
pursuant to and in accordance with Section 8.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and of no further force or effect whatsoever and there
shall be no liability on the part of any party to this Agreement; _provided,
however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in
this Agreement shall relieve any party to this Agreement from any Liability
resulting from or arising out of any intentional, material breach of any
agreement or covenant hereunder; _and provided further_ , that notwithstanding
the foregoing, the terms of Section 6.4, this Section 8.2 and Article X shall
survive any termination of this Agreement, whether in accordance with Section

ARTICLE IX.

INDEMNIFICATION

SECTION 9.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and
Indemnification Obligations_. The representations and warranties of the
Company, the Sellers, NYX and Buyer contained in this Agreement shall survive
the Closing Date for a period of 18 months following the Closing Date. The
covenants contained herein shall survive the Closing without limitation as to
time until the covenant has been fully performed in accordance with its
terms, in which case such covenant or agreement shall terminate at such time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if written notice of a claim meeting the
requirements of Section 9.3 has been given prior to the end of the applicable
survival period by a party in whose favor such representations, warranties and
covenants were made, then the relevant representations, warranties and
covenants shall survive as to such claim, until the claim has been finally
resolved. In accordance with the foregoing, the parties intend (x) if
applicable and consistent with the foregoing, to shorten the statute of
limitations and agree that no claims or causes of action may be brought
against the Company, the Sellers or Buyer, as the case may be, based upon,
directly or indirectly, any of the representations, warranties or covenants
contained in this Agreement after the applicable survival period specified
above and (y) as applicable and consistent with the foregoing, to permit
claims or causes of action based upon, directly or indirectly, any of the
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement so long
as the applicable survival period specified above has not terminated even if
longer than the statute of limitations applicable to general contract claims
otherwise applicable hereto.

(a) Subsequent to the Closing, and subject to the terms and conditions of this

as the case may be (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ "),
against, and hold each of the Buyer Indemnified Parties harmless from, any
Damages incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties arising out of or in
connection with:

(i) (A) any failure of any representation or warranty of the Company contained
in Article III of this Agreement to be true and correct both as of the date of
this Agreement and as of the Closing, or (B) without limiting the foregoing,
the failure of the certificate delivered by or on behalf of the Company
pursuant to Section 7.2(a) to be true and correct with respect to Sections
7.2(a)(i), (ii) or (iii);

(ii) any claim, regardless of the legal theory thereof, brought or alleged by
any Person claiming that prior to the Closing (1) the operation of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries and/or (2) the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives, has
infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated or is
infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating any Intellectual
Property, to the extent such claim relates to or arises out of the operation
of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as such business was
conducted as of or prior to the Closing; 

(iii) any claim, regardless of the legal theory thereof, brought or alleged by
Reuters Group plc or any Affiliates thereof claiming that (A) prior to or as
of the Closing, the employment by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of
any Company Employee, the provision of services by any such individual to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (B) the continuing employment after
the Closing of any such Company Employee employed at the Closing Date, has
breached or breaches or otherwise has violated or violates any Contract with,
or other duty or obligation to, Reuters Group plc or any of its Affiliates;

(iv) any breach or non-performance by the Company of any of its covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement that by their terms are to be
performed after the Closing;

(v) any Taxes attributable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, for which Sellers are
responsible pursuant to Section 6.7(c);

(vi) any Taxes required to be withheld pursuant to applicable Law, including
Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to any amounts payable

(vii) any failure of any representations or warranty of any such Seller
contained in Article IV of this Agreement to true and correct both of the
date of this Agreement and as of the Closing;



 

81 (viii) any breach or non-performance by such Seller of any of its covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement; or

(ix) Any Excess Company Expenses for which a corresponding reduction in the
Closing Payment was not made at Closing or for which a corresponding
reduction in the Net Tangible Assets of the Company was not made to the Final

the same Damages indemnified pursuant to this Section 9.2(a).

(i) Section 9.2(a)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) or (ix) shall be payable
solely from the Indemnification Escrow Fund.

(ii) Any claims for indemnification by a Buyer Indemnified Party hereunder
with respect to Damages resulting from fraud shall be made first by resort to
the Indemnification Escrow Fund, and second, if the balance of the
Indemnification Escrow Fund is insufficient to satisfy the entire amount of
payments to be made to a Buyer Indemnified Party (the amount of such
insufficiency, the " _Shortfall Amount_ "), by seeking recourse to each
Combined Holder, severally and not jointly, on a pro rata basis in accordance
with the Combined Holders Total Consideration Percentages.

(iii) Any Damages payable to the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to
Section 9.2(a)(vii) or (viii) shall be payable from the Indemnification Escrow
Fund to the extent of such Sellers allocable share of the Indemnification
Escrow Fund determined by multiplying the Indemnification Escrow Amount by

Seller.

Article IX, Buyer and the Company shall indemnify each of the Equity Holders,
their respective Affiliates (other than the Company), and each of their
respective officers, directors, employees, members, partners and agents, as
the case may be (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ "),
against, and hold each of the Seller Indemnified Parties harmless from, any
Damages incurred by the Seller Indemnified Parties arising out of or in
connection with:

(i) (A) any failure of any representation or warranty of Buyer contained in
Article V of this Agreement to be true and correct both as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Closing, or (B) without limiting the foregoing, the
failure of the certificate delivered by or on behalf of Buyer pursuant to
Section 7.1(a) to be true and correct with respect to Sections 7.1(a)(i) or

contained in this Agreement that by their terms are to be performed after the
Closing.



 

82 No Seller Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover more than once for
the same Damages indemnified pursuant to this Section 9.2(c).

(d) No Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to recover under this Agreement any Damages to the extent such Damages
consist of or are based upon punitive, consequential, or special or indirect
damages, including diminution in value or lost profits, other than
indemnification of amounts paid or payable to third parties in respect of any
third-party claim for which indemnification hereunder is required.

SECTION 9.3 _Notice of Claims_.

(a) Any Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party (any such party,
an " _Indemnified Party_ ") seeking indemnification hereunder shall, prior to
the expiration of the applicable survival period, give to the party or parties
obligated to provide indemnification under this Article IX (each such party,
the " _Indemnitor_ "), a notice (each such notice, a " _Claim Notice_ ")
describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any claims for
indemnification hereunder and shall include in such Claim Notice (if then
known) the amount or the method of computation of the amount of such claim,
and a reference to the provision of this Agreement or any agreement,
certificate or instrument executed pursuant hereto or in connection herewith
upon which such claim is based; _provided, however_ , that a Claim Notice in
respect of any action at Law or suit in equity by or against a third Person
as to which indemnification will be sought shall be given within ten (10) days
after the action or suit is commenced or in all other cases promptly after the
Indemnified Partys discovery of any matter that may give rise to an
indemnification claim hereunder; _and provided further_ , that failure to give
such notice shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder
except to the extent it shall have been prejudiced by such failure.

(b) The Indemnitor shall agree to the amount or method of determination set
forth in the Claim Notice and to pay such amount to such Indemnified Party in
immediately available funds or provide such Indemnified Party with notice that
it disagrees with the amount or method of determination set forth in the Claim
Notice (any such notice, a " _Dispute Notice_ "). A representative of
Indemnitor and such Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to negotiate in a bona fide attempt to resolve the matter.

(c) The Indemnified Party shall cooperate and assist the Indemnitor in
determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party
and in otherwise resolving such matters, including, (i) permitting the
Indemnitor to discuss the claim with such officers, employees, consultants and
representatives of the Indemnified Party as the Indemnitor reasonably
requests; (ii) permitting the Indemnitor to have reasonable access to the
personnel, properties, books, records, papers, documents, plans, drawings,
electronic mail, databases and computers of the Indemnified Party at
reasonable hours to review information and documentation relative to the
properties, books, records, papers, documents, plans, drawings, electronic
mail, databases and computers, contracts, commitments and other records of the
Indemnified Party; (iii) notifying the Indemnitor promptly of receipt by the
Indemnified Party of any subpoena or other third party request for documents
or interviews and testimony and providing to the Indemnitor copies of any
documents produced by the Indemnified Party in response to or compliance with
any subpoena or other third party request for documents; and  



 

83  (iv) permitting the Indemnitor to conduct such other reasonable
investigations and studies, and take such other actions, as are reasonably
necessary in connection with the Indemnitors defense or investigation of
such claim.

SECTION 9.4 _Third-Person Claims_. If a claim by a third Person is made
against an Indemnified Party, and if such Indemnified Party intends to seek
indemnity with respect thereto under this Article IX, such Indemnified Party
shall promptly notify the Indemnitor in writing of such claim, setting forth
such claim in reasonable detail, as specified in Section 9.3(a). The
Indemnitor shall have twenty (20) days after receipt of such notice to
undertake, conduct and control, through counsel of its own choosing and at its
own expense, the settlement or defense thereof, and the Indemnified Party
shall cooperate with it in connection therewith; _provided, however_ , that
the Indemnified Party may participate in such settlement or defense and in
doing so shall be entitled to retain one firm of separate counsel of its own
choosing (along with any reasonably required local counsel), the costs and
expenses of which shall be paid out of the Indemnification Escrow Fund, if (i)
the Indemnitor fails within a reasonable time to retain counsel; (ii) the
Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal
defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those
available to the Indemnitor and the Indemnified Party is prohibited or barred
from asserting such legal defenses; or (iii) the named parties in any such
proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnitor and
the Indemnified Party and representation of both sets of parties by the same
counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicts of
interest between them. If the Indemnitor does not notify the Indemnified Party
within twenty (20) days after receipt of the Indemnified Partys notice of a
claim of indemnity hereunder that it elects to undertake the defense thereof,
or fails to diligently pursue the defense thereof, the Indemnified Party,
without waiving any right to indemnity with respect to such claim pursuant to
this Agreement, shall have the right to undertake (upon delivering notice to
such effect to the Indemnitor), at Indemnitors cost, risk and expense, the
defense, compromise or settlement of the claim, and the Indemnitor shall be
liable for any resulting settlement of such claim and for any final judgment
with respect thereto; _provided, however_ , that the Indemnified Party shall
not pay or settle any such claim without the consent of the Indemnitor, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Indemnitor may not settle or
compromise any third Person claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. In the event the Indemnitor assumes the defense of the claim,
the Indemnitor shall keep the Indemnified Party reasonably informed of the
progress of any such defense, compromise or settlement, and in the event the
Indemnified Party assumes the defense of the claim, the Indemnified Party
shall keep the Indemnitor reasonably informed of the progress of any such
defense, compromise or settlement.

SECTION 9.5 _Limitation on Indemnity; Exclusive Remedy; Maximum Liability_.

(a) _Threshold Amount; De Minimis Amount_. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, an Indemnitor shall not be obligated to indemnify any
Indemnified Party under this Agreement (i) for any Damages suffered by such
Indemnified Party with respect to any individual breach or non-performance
unless such Damages exceed $100,000 and (ii) with respect to breaches under
Sections 9.2(a)(i), 9.2(a)(vii) or 9.2(c)(i), unless and until the aggregate
of all Damages suffered by such Indemnified Party thereunder exceeds
$2,000,000 (the " _Threshold Amount_ ") and then only to the extent of such
excess under this subclause (ii);  



 

84   _provided, however_ , that claims for indemnification by an Indemnified
Party hereunder with respect to Damages resulting from fraud shall not be
subject to the limitations contained in Section 9.5(a)(i) or Section
9.5(a)(ii).

(b) _Limitation on Damages_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary but subject to the last sentence of this Section 9.5(b), the
aggregate indemnification obligations of the Equity Holders and each Seller
(collectively) pursuant to Sections 9.2(a) shall be limited to the
Indemnification Escrow Amount. Claims for indemnification by an Indemnified
Party hereunder with respect to Damages resulting from fraud shall not be
subject to the foregoing limitations.

(c) _Amount of Damages_. The amount of any Damages payable hereunder shall be
reduced by (i) any insurance proceeds which the Indemnified Party actually
collects with respect to the event or occurrence giving rise to such Damages
and (ii) any amounts which the Indemnified Party actually collects from third
parties in connection with Damages for which indemnification is sought
under this Article IX. The Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnitor as
promptly as practicable of any insurance claims or third-party claims that
could reduce or eliminate Damages that are the subject of a Claim Notice;
_provided, however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall impose any
obligation on an Indemnified Party to pursue any such third-party claims. If
the Indemnified Party both collects proceeds from any insurance company or
third party and receives a payment from the Indemnitor hereunder, and the sum
of such proceeds, net of out-of-pocket collection costs and expenses, is in
excess of the Damages with respect to the matter that is the subject of the
indemnity, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly refund to the Indemnitor
the amount of such excess.

(d) _Mitigation_. Each Indemnified Party shall be required to use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate Damages and shall reasonably consult with the
Indemnitor with a view toward mitigating Damages in conjunction with all
claims for which a party seeks indemnification under this Article IX.

(e) _Final Net Tangible Assets_. In no event shall the Buyer Indemnified
Parties be entitled to recover any Damages with respect to any matter to the
extent it was included as a liability in the calculation of the Final Net
Tangible Assets, including the amount of any reserves or accruals reflected as
a current liability in such calculation

(f) _Tax Matters_. Any payment made pursuant to the indemnification
obligations arising under this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment
to the purchase price hereunder, unless the Indemnified Party provides an
opinion of nationally recognized tax counsel that any such amount will not
constitute an adjustment to the purchase price for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.

(g) _Exclusive Remedy_. The remedies provided in this Article IX shall be the
exclusive monetary remedies of the parties hereto after the Closing
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall
be in lieu of any other monetary remedies that may be available to the
Indemnified Parties under any other agreement or pursuant to any statutory or
common law (including Environmental Law) with respect to any Damages of any
kind or nature incurred directly or indirectly resulting from or arising out
of any of this  



 

85  Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or the Company Business.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this _Article IX_ shall
not restrict the right of any party to seek specific performance or other
equitable remedies pursuant to Section 10.11 below in connection with any
breach or threatened breach of any of the terms or provisions contained in
this Agreement. Each party hereby waives any provision of any applicable Law
to the extent that it would limit or restrict the agreement contained in this
Section 9.5(g).

SECTION 10.5 _Interpretation_. The Article and Section headings in this
Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed
to alter or affect the meaning or interpretation of any provision of this
Agreement. References to Articles or Sections in this Agreement, unless

The parties to this Agreement have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises with respect to any term or provision of this
Agreement, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the
parties to this Agreement, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party to this Agreement by virtue of the
authorship of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement. Any reference
to any federal, state, county, local or foreign statute or Law shall be deemed
also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the
context requires otherwise. For all purposes of and under this Agreement, (a)
the word "including" shall be deemed to be immediately followed by the words
"without limitation;" (b) words (including defined terms) in the singular
shall be deemed to include the plural and vice versa; (c) words of one gender
shall be deemed to include the other gender as the context requires and (d)
the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereto," "herewith" and any other words of

unless otherwise specified.

SECTION 10.6 _Severability_. In the event that any one or more of the terms or
provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other
certificate, instrument or other document referred to in this Agreement,
shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any
other term or provision of this Agreement or any other such certificate,
instrument or other document referred to in this Agreement, and the parties to
this Agreement shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to substitute
one or more valid, legal and enforceable terms or provisions into this
Agreement which, insofar as practicable, implement the purposes and intent of
this Agreement. Any term or provision of this Agreement held invalid or
unenforceable only in part, degree or within certain jurisdictions
shall remain in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or
unenforceable to the extent consistent with the intent of the parties as
reflected by this Agreement. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each
party waives any term or provision of Law which renders any term or provision
of this Agreement to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect.



 

89 SECTION 10.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Company
Disclosure Schedule and the Exhibits to this Agreement) and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties to
this Agreement with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, and
supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among
the parties to this Agreement with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement.

SECTION 10.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties to
this Agreement (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties to this Agreement, and any purported
assignment or other transfer without such consent shall be void and
unenforceable; _provided,_ that notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may
assign any of its rights and obligations hereunder to any Affiliate of Buyer
but no such assignment shall relieve Buyer of its obligations hereunder or
otherwise delay or impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or impair or adversely affect the rights of the other parties
hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties to this
Agreement and their respective estates, heirs, successors and assigns.

SECTION 10.9 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as specifically provided
in Section 6.10, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties to
this Agreement and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit
or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

SECTION 10.10 _Waivers and Amendments_.

(a) Prior to the Closing, this Agreement may be amended only by an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of the Company (on behalf of itself and
the Sellers) and Buyer; _provided_ that an amendment that alters or changes
any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, if such alteration or
change would adversely affect the Sellers, shall require the consent of (i)
Sellers holding a majority of the outstanding Stock at such time, and (ii) ML
IBK; _and provided, further,_ that if such alteration or change would
adversely and uniquely affect any Seller, the consent of such Seller shall
also be required. After the Closing, this Agreement may be amended only by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of Buyer, the Seller Representative and
ML IBK; _provided_ that an amendment that alters or changes any of the terms
and conditions of this Agreement if such alteration or change would adversely
affect the Sellers shall require the consent of holders of a majority of the
outstanding Stock (calculated for this purpose immediately prior to the
Closing); _and provided, further_ , that if such alteration or change would
adversely and uniquely affect any Seller, the consent of such Seller shall
also be required.

(b) Any failure of the parties to this Agreement to comply with any
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition in this Agreement may be waived
by the Waiving Party entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written
instrument signed by the Waiving Party granting such waiver. For purposes
hereof, " _Waiving Parties_ " shall mean (i) prior to the Closing, the Company
(on behalf of itself and the Sellers) and Buyer; _provided_ that a waiver that
would  



 

90  adversely affect the Sellers shall require the consent of Sellers holding a
majority of the outstanding Stock at such time; _and provided, further,_
 that if such waiver would adversely and uniquely affect any Seller, the
consent of such Seller shall also be required, and (ii) after the Closing,
Buyer and the Seller Representative; _provided_ that a waiver that would
adversely affect the Sellers shall require the consent of holders of a
majority of the outstanding Stock (calculated for this purpose immediately
prior to the Closing); _and provided, further_ , that if such waiver would
adversely and uniquely affect any Seller, the consent of such Seller shall
also be required.

(c) No delay on the part of any party to this Agreement in exercising any
right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor
shall any waiver on the part of any party to this Agreement of any right,
power or privilege hereunder operate as a waiver of any other right, power or
privilege hereunder, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right,
power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder. Unless
otherwise provided, the rights and remedies provided for in this Agreement
are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies which the
parties to this Agreement may otherwise have at law or in equity. Whenever
this Agreement requires or permits consent by or on behalf of a party, such
consent shall be given in writing in a manner consistent with the
requirements for a waiver of compliance as set forth in this Section 10.10.

SECTION 10.11 _Equitable Remedies_. Each of the parties to this Agreement
acknowledges and agrees that the other parties to this Agreement would be
irreparably damaged in the event that any of the terms or provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
otherwise are breached. Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties to this Agreement hereby
agrees that the other parties to this Agreement shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement, and to enforce specifically the performance by
such first party under this Agreement, and each party to this Agreement
hereby agrees to waive the defense in any such suit that the other parties to
this Agreement have an adequate remedy at law and to interpose no opposition,
legal or otherwise, as to the propriety of an injunction or specific
performance as a remedy, and hereby agrees to waive any requirement to post
any bond in connection with obtaining such relief. The equitable remedies
described in this Section 10.11 shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of,
any other remedies at law or in equity that the parties to this Agreement may
elect to pursue.

SECTION 10.12 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall
be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New
York applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed entirely within
such State. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally submits, for itself and its assets and properties, to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any New York state court, or federal court of the
United States of America, in either case sitting within the City and County of
New York, New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the agreements
delivered in connection with this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating
thereto, and each of the parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally (a) agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding
except in such courts; (b) agrees that any claim in respect of any such
action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New  



 

91  York state court or, to the extent permitted by law, in such federal court;
(c) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so,
any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any such action or proceeding in any such New York state or federal court and
(d) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any
such New York state or federal court. Each of the parties to this Agreement
hereby agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by law. Each of the parties to this Agreement
hereby irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for
notices in Section 10.3. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right of
any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by
applicable Law.

SECTION 10.13  _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE, IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS
DELIVERED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS; (B) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS; (C) IT MAKES
SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 10.13.

SECTION 10.14 _Exclusivity of Representations and Warranties_. It is the
explicit intent and understanding of each of the parties to this Agreement
that no party to this Agreement, nor any of their respective Affiliates,
representatives or agents, is making any representation or
warranty whatsoever, oral or written, express, implied or statutory, other
than those set forth in this Agreement.

SECTION 10.15 _Seller Representative_.

(a) Each Seller hereby appoints, authorizes and empowers Ronald B. Verstappen
as the Seller Representative for the benefit of the Equity Holders, as the
exclusive agent and attorney-in-fact to act on behalf of the Equity Holders,
in connection with and to facilitate the following:

(i) to execute and deliver the Escrow Agreement (with such immaterial
modifications or changes therein as to which the Seller Representative, in
its sole discretion, shall have consented) and to agree to such amendments or
modifications thereto as the Seller Representative, in its sole discretion,
determines to be desirable, provided that such amendments or
modifications are consistent with the terms of this Agreement, as amended;



 

92 (ii) to execute and deliver such waivers and consents in connection with this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby as the Seller Representative, in its sole
discretion, may deem necessary or desirable;

(iii) as Seller Representative, to enforce and protect the rights and
interests of the Equity Holders (including the Seller Representative, in its
capacity as a Seller) and to enforce and protect the rights and interests of
the Seller Representative arising out of or under or in any manner relating to
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement or the transactions provided for
herein or therein (including, without limitation, in connection with any and
all claims for indemnification brought under Article IX), and to take any and
all actions which the Seller Representative believes are necessary or
appropriate under the Escrow Agreement and/or this Agreement for and on
behalf of any Equity Holder, including asserting or pursuing any Action
against Buyer, defending any third party Actions or Actions by the Buyer
Indemnified Persons (other than, in each case, any Action seeking equitable
relief against any Seller or the payment of money by any Seller with funds
other than from the Indemnification Escrow Fund), consenting to, compromising
or settling any such Actions (other than, in each case, any Action seeking
equitable relief against any Seller or the payment of money by any Seller with
funds other than from the Indemnification Escrow Fund), conducting
negotiations with Buyer and its representatives regarding such Actions (other
than, in each case, any Action seeking equitable relief against any Seller or
the payment of money by any Seller with funds other than from the
Indemnification Escrow Fund), and, in connection therewith, to (A) assert any
claim or institute any action, proceeding or investigation; (B) investigate,
defend, contest or litigate any Action initiated by Buyer against the Seller
Representative and/or any of the Equity Holders, or by any Person against the
Seller Representative, the Indemnification Escrow Fund and/or the
Reimbursement Escrow Fund, and receive process on behalf of any or all of the
Equity Holders in any such Action and compromise or settle on such terms as
the Seller Representative shall determine to be appropriate, and
give receipts, releases and discharges with respect to, any such Action; (C)
file any proofs of debt, claims and petitions as the Seller Representative may
deem advisable or necessary; (D) settle or compromise any claims asserted
under the Escrow Agreement; and (E) file and prosecute appeals from any
decision, judgment or award rendered in any such Action, it being understood
that the Seller Representative shall not have any obligation to take any such
actions, and shall not have any liability for any failure to take any such
actions; _provided, however_ , that, in the event of an Action brought against
a Seller for a breach of a representation, warranty or covenant of such
Seller, the Seller Representative shall coordinate with, and keep apprised,
such Seller in defense of such Action; and

(iv) (A) to accept any portion of the consideration payable to the Equity
Holders (on behalf of the Equity Holders) and to deliver wire instructions to
Buyer in connection therewith; (B) to determine whether the conditions to
closing in Article VII have been satisfied and to supervise the Closing
(including waiving any such  



 

93  conditions if Seller Representative, in its sole discretion, determines that
such waiver is appropriate); (C) to take any and all actions that may
be necessary or desirable, as determined by Seller Representative in its sole
discretion, in connection with indemnification under Article IX and the Escrow
Agreement; (D) to make Terminated Option Amount Distributions, Terminated SAR
Unit Amount Distributions and Aged Receivables Distributions to Combined
Holders.

(b) The Seller Representative shall not be entitled to any fee, commission or
other compensation for the performance of its services hereunder, but shall be
entitled to the payment of all costs and expenses incurred as the Seller
Representative. In connection with the foregoing, the Seller
Representative shall be permitted, in accordance with the Escrow Agreement,
to use the Reimbursement Escrow Amount to pay the costs and expenses that it
incurs in its capacity as the Seller Representative. In addition, to the
extent that the Reimbursement Amount is at any time insufficient (as
determined by the Seller Representative in its reasonable discretion) to cover
all of the reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Seller Representative
in its capacity as the Seller Representative, then the Seller Representative
may, at its option, (y) retain such portion of the Indemnification Escrow
Amount (when, but not before, the Indemnification Escrow Amount is otherwise
released to the Seller Representative for distribution to the Equity Holders
in accordance with the Escrow Agreement) for purposes of reimbursement of such
costs and expenses; and (z) seek reimbursement of such costs and expenses from
the Equity Holders in the event the Indemnification Escrow Amount released
to the Seller Representative is insufficient to cover such costs and
expenses. Once the Seller Representative determines, in its reasonable
discretion, that it will not incur any additional expenses in its capacity as
Seller Representative, then the Seller Representative will direct the Escrow
Agent to release the remaining portion of the Reimbursement Escrow Fund in
accordance with Section 2.5. In connection with this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement and any instrument, agreement or document relating hereto or
thereto, and in exercising or failing to exercise all or any of the powers
conferred upon the Seller Representative hereunder (i) the Seller
Representative shall incur no responsibility whatsoever to any Equity Holder
by reason of any error in judgment or other act or omission performed or
omitted hereunder or in connection with the Escrow Agreement or any such other
agreement, instrument or document, excepting only responsibility for any act
or failure to act which represents bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct, and (ii) the Seller Representative shall be entitled to rely in
good faith on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other experts
experienced in the matter at issue, and any error in judgment or other act or
omission of the Seller Representative pursuant to such advice shall in no
event subject the Seller Representative to liability to any Equity Holder.
Each Equity Holder shall indemnify, from and to the extent of its share of
the Indemnification Escrow Fund, the Seller Representative against all
Damages, Liabilities, claims, costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys, accountants and other experts fees and the amount of
any judgment against them, of any nature whatsoever (including any and all
expense whatsoever incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against
any litigation, commenced or threatened or any claims whatsoever), arising out
of or in connection with any Action, or in connection with any appeal
thereof, relating to the acts or omissions of the Seller Representative
hereunder, or under the Escrow Agreement or otherwise; _provided, however,_
that the foregoing indemnification shall not apply in the event of any action
or proceeding which finally adjudicates the liability of the Seller
Representative hereunder for its bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct.



 

94 (c) All of the indemnities and immunities granted to the Seller Representative
under this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date and/or any termination of
this Agreement and/or the Escrow Agreement.

(d) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Seller Representative with
respect to the matters for which the Seller Representative is authorized
pursuant to this Section 10.15 shall constitute a decision of all of the
Equity Holders and shall be final, legally binding and conclusive. Buyer and
the Company shall have the right to rely upon any agreement entered into with
the Seller Representative and all actions taken or omitted to be taken by the
Seller Representative pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement (in
each case to the extent within the Seller Representatives authority pursuant
to this Section 10.15), all of which agreements, actions or omissions shall be
legally binding upon the Equity Holders. With respect to matters regarding
the Indemnification Escrow Amount, the Buyer Indemnified Parties may rely
upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Seller
Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each
Equity Holder. The Buyer Indemnified Parties are hereby relieved from any
liability to any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Seller Representative.

(e) The grant of authority provided for herein (i) is coupled with an interest
and shall be irrevocable and shall survive the death,
incompetency, bankruptcy or liquidation of any Equity Holder; and (ii) shall
survive the Closing. Any action taken by the Seller Representative pursuant to
the authority granted in this Agreement or under the Escrow Agreement shall be
effective and absolutely binding on each Equity Holder notwithstanding any
contrary action of or direction from such holder.

(f) The Seller Representative may at any time resign by giving written notice
of its resignation to Buyer and the Sellers specifying the date on which its
resignation shall become effective; _provided_ , that such date shall be at
least thirty (30) days after the receipt of such notice, unless Buyer and the
Sellers agree to accept shorter notice. Prior to resignation, Sellers who held
a majority of the outstanding Stock immediately prior to the Closing shall
appoint a replacement Seller Representative. Such appointment shall be
evidenced by a written instrument from such replacement Seller Representative
accepting such appointment, a copy of which shall be delivered to Buyer and
notice of which such appointment shall be given to the Equity Holders.
Notwithstanding the date of effectiveness specified in such written notice of
resignation, the resignation shall become effective only upon the acceptance
of appointment by the successor Seller Representative.

SECTION 10.16 _NYX Obligations_.

(a) NYX shall ensure the full and punctual performance and compliance by
Buyer with and of the terms of Section 2.9(b), Section 2.10(f), Section 6.2,
Section 6.5, Section 6.8(a), Section 6.11, Section 6.12 and this Article X.

(b) NYX hereby makes all of the representations and warranties set forth in
Article V, provided, that for this purpose the term "Buyer" is replaced with
"NYX."



 

95 (c) NYX does hereby unconditionally, absolutely and irrevocably guarantee to
the Sellers and other Equity Holders the full and punctual payment,
observance and performance of all of the Liabilities, agreements, promises and
covenants of Buyer contained in Article IX of this Agreement. The liability of
NYX hereunder shall be joint and several with the liability of Buyer and
shall be independent of the liability of Buyer. The liability of Buyer
hereunder shall be primary and not secondary, it being agreed that this makes
NYX the equivalent of a co-obligor with Buyer. NYX acknowledges and
agrees that this Section 10.16(c) may be enforced against NYX without first
resorting to or exhausting any such recourse or remedy against Buyer.

SECTION 10.17 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original,
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement. Additionally, any Combined Holder that exercises a Vested Option
and executes a counterpart to this Agreement shall be (i) included in the
definition of "Seller" in this Agreement, (ii) deemed a "Seller" hereunder;
and (iii) shall be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
