1.04 _Seller Representative Holdback Amount_. An amount equal to $4,000,000
(the " _Seller Representative Holdback Amount_ ") shall be delivered by the
Buyer to the Seller Representative at the Closing by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to a segregated account designated in writing by

Date (which account shall be used only to hold the Seller Representative
Holdback Amount and to pay any fees, costs, expenses, or any other amounts
payable out of the Seller Representative Holdback Amount pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement). The Seller Representative is entitled to pay on
behalf of the Sellers and the SAR Holders, and to the extent paid by the
Seller Representative from its own funds, obtain reimbursement from Sellers
and the SAR Holders for, any fees, costs, expenses reasonably incurred or
other disbursements made by the Seller Representative in the performance of
its roles hereunder from the Seller Representative Holdback Amount.

1.05 _Calculation of Final Purchase Price_.

 

(a) _Determination_. As promptly as possible, but in any event within sixty
(60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer will deliver to Seller Representative
(i) a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), which shall
be prepared in accordance with the Accounting Practices and Procedures, and
(ii) a reasonably detailed statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting
forth Buyers calculations of Cash on Hand, the Net Working Capital Amount,
Closing Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses, and the Transaction Tax Benefit.
Solely in connection with the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Statement, Buyer agrees that it shall not, and shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries not to, take any actions with respect to the accounting
books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries on which the Closing
Balance Sheet or Closing Statement are to be based that are not consistent
with the Accounting Practices

 



4  and Procedures. After delivery of the Closing Statement, Seller
Representative and its accountants shall be permitted reasonable access during
normal business hours to review the Company and its Subsidiaries books and
records and any work papers (including any work papers of their respective
accountants) related to the preparation of the Closing Statement. Seller
Representative and its accountants may make inquiries of Buyer, the Company
and its Subsidiaries and their respective accountants and employees regarding
questions concerning or disagreements with the Closing Statement arising in
the course of their review thereof, and Buyer shall use its, and shall cause
the Company and its Subsidiaries to use their, commercially reasonable
efforts to cause any such accountants and employees to cooperate with and
respond to such inquiries as promptly as practicable. If Seller Representative
has any objections to the Closing Statement, Seller Representative shall
deliver to Buyer a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the items in
dispute, the amount thereof in dispute and the basis for its objections
thereto (an " _Objections Statement_ "). If an Objections Statement is not
delivered to Buyer within forty-five (45) days after delivery of the Closing
Statement, the Closing Statement shall be final, binding, indisputable and
non-appealable by the parties hereto. Any matters not covered by the
Objection Statement shall be final, binding, indisputable and non-appealable
by the parties. Seller Representative and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith
to resolve any objections set forth in the Objections Statement (and all
such discussions related thereto shall, unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and
Seller Representative, be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of
Evidence (and any applicable similar state rule)), but if they do not reach a
final resolution within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Objections
Statement, Seller Representative and Buyer shall submit such dispute to
PricewaterhouseCoopers or, if not available, another independent nationally
recognized accounting firm of similar standing mutually acceptable to Buyer
and Seller Representative (the " _Accounting Referee_ "). Seller
Representative and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to promptly engage the
Accounting Referee pursuant to an engagement letter that requires the
Accounting Referee to make all determinations in accordance with the
Accounting Practices and Procedures; _provided_ , _however_ that if the
Accounting Referee determines that the Accounting Practices and Procedures
are not in compliance with GAAP, then "Accounting Practices and Procedures"
as used in this _Section 1.05(a)_ (and elsewhere in this Agreement for the
purposes of this _Section 1.05(a)_) shall mean GAAP applied in a manner most
consistent with the accounting methods, policies, practices and procedures,
including classification and estimation methodologies, used in the preparation
of the audited consolidated June 24, 2016 financial statements of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (it being acknowledged and agreed by Buyer that, as of
the date hereof, Buyer has no reason to believe that the Accounting Practices
and Procedures are not in compliance with GAAP, except as set forth on
_Schedule 1.05_ ). If any dispute is submitted to the Accounting Referee,
each party will promptly upon request, furnish to the Accounting Referee such
work papers and other documents and information relating to the disputed
issues as the Accounting Referee may request and are available to that party
or its accountants (including information of the Company and its Subsidiaries)
and otherwise cooperate fully with the Accounting Referees review of the
dispute, and each party shall be afforded the opportunity to present the
Accounting Referee (with a copy concurrently delivered to the other party)
material relating to the determination and to discuss the determination with
the Accounting Referee. The Accounting Referee shall resolve only those
matters set forth in such Objections Statement that remain in dispute after
the 30-day resolution period. With respect to any disputed item, the
Accounting Referees determination

 



5  shall be no greater than the higher amount calculated by Buyer or Seller
Representative, as the case may be, and no less than the lower amount
calculated by Buyer or Seller Representative as the case may be, and in all
events shall be calculated in accordance with the Accounting Practices and
Procedures. It is the intent of Buyer, Seller Representative and the Company
that the process set forth in this _Section 1.05_ and the activities of the
Accounting Referee in connection herewith are not intended to be and, in fact,
are not arbitration and that no formal arbitration rules shall be followed
(including rules with respect to procedures and discovery).
Seller Representative and Buyer shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Accounting Referee to resolve all such disagreements as
soon as practicable but in no event later than thirty (30) days after
submission of the disputed issues to the Accounting Referee. The resolution
of the dispute by the Accounting Referee shall be final, binding, indisputable
and non-appealable by the parties hereto. The Closing Statement shall be
modified if necessary to reflect such determination. The fees and expenses of
the Accounting Referee shall be allocated to be paid by Buyer, on the one
hand, and/or Seller Representative, on the other hand, based upon the
percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each
party bears to the amount actually contested by such party, as determined by
the Accounting Referee. For example, if Buyer claims that the Net Working
Capital Amount is $10,000 less than the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount
determined by the Company, and Seller Representative contests only $5,000 of
the amount claimed by Buyer, and if the Accounting Referee ultimately resolves
the dispute by awarding Buyer $3,000 of the $5,000 contested, then the cost of
such review and report will be allocated 60% (i.e., 3,000 ÷ 5,000) to Seller
Representative and 40% (i.e., 2,000 ÷ 5,000) to Buyer.

(b) Adjustments. 

(i) _Cash On Hand Adjustment_. If the Cash on Hand as finally determined
pursuant to _Section 1.05(a)_ above is greater than the Estimated Cash on
Hand, such excess shall result in an increase in the Estimated Purchase Price
in accordance with _Section 1.05(c)_. If the Cash on Hand as finally
determined pursuant to  _Section 1.05(a)_ above is less than the Estimated
Cash on Hand, such shortfall shall result in a decrease in the Estimated
Purchase Price in accordance with _Section 1.05(c)_.

 

(ii) _Net Working Capital Adjustment_. If the Net Working Capital Amount as
finally determined pursuant to  _Section 1.05(a)_ above is greater than the
Estimated Net Working Capital Amount, such excess shall result in an increase
in the Estimated Purchase Price in accordance with _Section 1.05(c)_. If the
Net Working Capital Amount as finally determined pursuant to _Section
1.05(a)_ above is less than the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount, such
shortfall shall result in a decrease in the Estimated Purchase Price in
accordance with _Section 1.05(c)._

 



6 (iii) _Closing Indebtedness Adjustment_. If the Closing Indebtedness
as finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.05(a)_ above is less than the
Estimated Closing Indebtedness, such shortfall shall result in an increase in
the Estimated Purchase Price in accordance with _Section 1.05(c)_. If
the Closing Indebtedness as finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.05(a)_
above is greater than the Estimated Closing Indebtedness, such excess shall
result in a decrease in the Estimated Purchase Price in accordance with 
_Section 1.05(c)_.

(iv) _Transaction Expenses Adjustment_. If the Transaction Expenses as
finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.05(a)_ above are less than the
Estimated Transaction Expenses, such shortfall shall result in an increase in
the Estimated Purchase Price in accordance with _Section 1.05(a)_. If the
Transaction Expenses as finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.05(a)
_above are greater than the Estimated Transaction Expenses, such excess shall
result in a decrease in the Estimated Purchase Price in accordance with
_Section 1.05(a)_. 

(v) _Transaction Tax Benefit Adjustment_. If the Transaction Tax Benefit as
finally determined pursuant to  _Section 1.05(a)_ above is less than the
Estimated Transaction Tax Benefit, such shortfall shall result in a decrease
in the Estimated Purchase Price in accordance with _Section 1.05(a)_. If the
Transaction Tax Benefit as finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.05(a)_
is greater than the Estimated Transaction Tax Benefit, such excess shall
result in an increase in the Estimated Purchase Price in accordance with
_Section 1.05(a)_.

 

(c) _Final Adjustment Amount_. Without duplication, all amounts calculated
pursuant to _Section 1.05(b)_ shall be aggregated, and the net amount (if
any) by which the Estimated Purchase Price is increased, on the one hand, or
decreased, on the other hand, is referred to as the " _Final Adjustment
Amount_." If the net effect pursuant to this  _Section 1.05(c)_ is an
increase in the Estimated Purchase Price, then Buyer shall make a cash payment
in an amount equal to the Final Adjustment Amount to the Paying Agent with
each Seller and SAR Holder being entitled to its Pro Rata Portion (it being
understood that Buyer bears no responsibility whatsoever for determining Pro
Rata Portion). If the net effect pursuant to this _Section 1.05(c)_ is a
decrease in the Estimated Purchase Price, then Seller Representative first,
but solely up to any then available amount of Seller Representative Holdback
Amount, and then, but solely for any residual amount, each Seller and SAR
Holder severally (and not jointly and severally) shall deliver to Buyer an
amount in cash equal its Pro Rata Portion of any residual Final Adjustment
Amount. The Final Adjustment Amount shall be calculated as an adjustment to
the Estimated Purchase Price and the Estimated Purchase Price, as so adjusted,
is referred to herein as the " _Final Purchase Price_." Payment of the Final
Adjustment Amount shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by the recipient party within five (5) Business
Days after the date of final determination pursuant to _Section 1.05(a)_.

7.01 _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, each Buyer Party
shall cause the Company to indemnify and hold harmless each present and
former director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _D andO
Indemnified Persons_") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or Liabilities of
any nature whatsoever (" _D andO Costs_"), incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to Closing, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under Legal
Requirements; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this  _Section
7.01(a)_ shall require the Company to indemnify any DandO Indemnified Person for
any DandO Costs that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries would not have been
obligated to indemnify such DandO Indemnified Person for prior to Closing.

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, each Buyer Party
shall cause to be maintained in effect with respect to the DandO Indemnified
Persons any provision in the Companys or its Subsidiaries articles or
certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or other organizational documents)
relating to the exculpation or indemnification of any officers and directors
in effect on the date of this Agreement (unless required by Legal
Requirements), it being the intent of the parties that the DandO Indemnified
Persons shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation and
indemnification. 

 



34 (c) If the Closing occurs, the Company shall purchase, and each of Buyer and
Sellers shall pay one-half of the cost of, a directors and officers
liability insurance "tail" or "runoff" insurance program (the " _Tail Policy_
") to be in effect until the end of the six-year period commencing as of
the Closing Date (and for so long as any indemnification claim is being
adjudicated) with respect to actions or omissions occurring prior to the
Closing Date (such coverage to be on terms and conditions and for an amount no
less favorable to the Companys and its Subsidiaries directors and officers
currently covered by such insurance than those of such policy in effect on the
date of this Agreement), and each Buyer Party and the Company agrees not to
terminate or modify in a manner adverse to the beneficiaries thereof the Tail
Policy prior to the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date.

(d) In the event that after the Closing Date, Buyer or the Company, or their
respective successors or assigns, (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer or the
Company, as the case may be, honor the indemnification and other obligations
of such Persons, including under this _Section 7.01_.

and (upon a Partys request) the provision of records and information that
are reasonably relevant to the preparation of any such Tax Return or to any
such audit, litigation or other proceeding.

 

(b) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Any and all existing Tax allocation and Tax
sharing agreements and Special Tax-Related Rights Arrangements (whether
written or not) binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or
benefitting any of their minority investors) shall be terminated as of the
Closing Date. After such date, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall have any further rights or Liabilities thereunder .

(c) _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes and related expenses shall be borne
50% by the Sellers and 50% by the Buyer when due, and the party required to
file the Transfer Tax Return under applicable Law will file all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes. The
parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other in connection with the
filing of any Tax Returns relating to Transfer Taxes, including joining in the
execution of any such Tax Return or other documentation where necessary to the
extent such Tax Return or other documentation is in form and substance
satisfactory to the cooperating party.

 



35 (d) _Pre-Closing Merger_. It is intended that the Pre-Closing Merger did not
(1) result in the recognition of any income or gain by the Company, Stone
Canyon, or SC Holdco for federal and state income Tax purposes or (2) cause
the affiliated group (as defined in Section 1504 of the Code) of corporations
of which Stone Canyon was the common parent to cease to remain in existence
within the meaning of Treas. Reg. § 1.1502-75(d), and the parties shall not
file any Tax Return or take any position in a proceeding before a Governmental
Authority inconsistent with the foregoing unless required by a closing
agreement entered into under section 7121 of the Code or any other settlement
agreement entered into in connection with an administrative or judicial
proceeding. Buyer shall submit a draft of any Income Tax Returns for the
taxable period that includes the Pre-Closing Merger or reflects the 2016
Refund Amount to the Seller Representative (together with schedules,
statements and, to the extent requested by the Seller Representative,
supporting documentation) at least forty (40) days prior to the due date
thereof (including extensions). If the Seller Representative objects to any
item on any such Income Tax Return, it shall, within ten (10) days after
delivery of such Income Tax Returns, notify Buyer in writing that it so
objects, specifying with particularity any such item and stating the specific
factual or legal basis for any such objection. If a notice of objection is
duly delivered, Buyer and Seller Representative shall negotiate in good faith
and use their reasonable best efforts to resolve such items. If Buyer and the
Seller Representative are unable to reach such agreement within ten (10) days
after receipt by Buyer of such notice, the disputed items shall be resolved
by the Independent Accountant and any determination by the Independent
Accountant shall be final. The Independent Accountant shall resolve any
disputed items within twenty (20) days of having the dispute referred to
it pursuant to such procedures as it may require. The Income Tax Return shall
be prepared in accordance with the Independent Accountants determination and
timely filed. The costs, fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall
be borne 50% by the Sellers, on the one hand, and 50% by the Buyer, on the
other.

(a) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to employees of the Company
or its Subsidiaries immediately before the Closing who continue employment
with Buyer and its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Company
and its Subsidiaries) following the Closing Date (the " _Continuing Employees_
"), Buyer shall cause the service of each such Continuing Employee to be
recognized for purposes of eligibility to participate, levels of benefits (but
not for benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan) and vesting
under each compensation, retirement, vacation, fringe or other welfare benefit
plan, program or arrangement of Buyer and its Affiliates, but not including
any equity compensation plans, programs, agreements or arrangements
(collectively, the " _Buyer Benefit Plans_ ") in which any Continuing Employee
is or becomes eligible to participate, but solely to the extent service was
credited to such employee for such purposes under a comparable Plan
immediately prior to the Closing Date and to the extent such credit would not
result in a duplication of benefits.

 

(b) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to each Buyer Benefit Plan
that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of
ERISA in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to participate,
Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to cause each such Buyer Benefit Plan to
(i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, waiting periods,
required physical examinations and exclusions with respect to participation
and coverage requirements applicable under such Buyer Benefit Plan for such
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents to the same extent that
such pre-existing conditions,

 



36  waiting periods, required physical examinations and exclusions would not
have applied or would have been waived under the corresponding Plan in which
such Continuing Employee was a participant immediately prior to his
commencement of participation in such Buyer Benefit Plan but, with respect to
long-term disability and life insurance benefits and coverage, solely to the
extent permitted under the terms and conditions of Buyers applicable
insurance contracts in effect as of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that for purposes of clarity, to the extent such benefit coverage includes
eligibility conditions based on periods of employment,  _Section 7.03(a)_
shall control; and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee and their eligible
dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid in the
calendar year that, and prior to the date that, such Continuing Employee
commences participation in such Buyer Benefit Plan in satisfying any
applicable co-payment or deductible requirements under such Buyer Benefit Plan
for the applicable calendar year, to the extent that such expenses were
recognized for such purposes under the comparable Plan.

(c) Buyer, the Company and the Sellers acknowledge and agree that all
provisions contained in this  _Section 7.03 _are included for the sole
benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and shall not create any
right in any other Person, including any employees, former employees, any
participant in any Plan or any beneficiary thereof or any right to continued
employment with Buyer or any of its Affiliates. Nothing in this _Section
7.03_ shall be deemed to amend any Buyer Benefit Plan or to require Buyer or
any of its Affiliates to continue or amend any particular benefit plan before
or after the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement,
and any such plan may be amended or terminated in accordance with its terms
and applicable Legal Requirements.

 

7.04 _WARN Act_. Buyer agrees that it shall not, nor shall it permit any of
its Affiliates (including, without limitation, the Company and its
Subsidiaries) to, at any time within ninety (90) days following the Closing
Date, effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as those terms are
defined in the WARN Act) without complying in all material respects with the
notice requirements and all other provisions of the WARN Act.

7.05 _Further Assurances_. Subject to the limitations set forth elsewhere in
this Agreement, from time to time, as and when requested by any party hereto
and at such partys expense, any other party shall execute and deliver, or
cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and
shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other actions as the
requesting party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to evidence and
effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

7.06 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_.

 

(a) For a period of three (3) years commencing on the Closing Date (the "
_Restricted Period_ "), SCIFSC shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, (i) engage in or assist others in
engaging in the Restricted Business in the Territory or

 



37  acquire or commit to acquire the entity listed on _Exhibit 7.06_ , whether
by merger, purchase of all or substantially all of the capital stock, equity
interests or assets, reorganization or otherwise; or (ii) intentionally
interfere in any material respect with the business relationships (formed as
of the date of this Agreement) between the Company and customers or suppliers
of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SCIFSC may (A) own, directly
or indirectly, solely as an investment, securities of any Person traded on any
national securities exchange if it is not a controlling Person of, or a member
of a group which controls, such Person and does not, directly or indirectly,
own five percent (5%) or more of any class of securities of such Person and
(B) acquire or hold passive investments in investment funds, partnership or
similar entities in which it does not have a controlling interest
or otherwise possess, directly or indirectly, control or influence over the
investment decisions or management of such entity or (C) commence employment
with a subsidiary, division or unit of any entity that engages in a business
that is competitive with the Restricted Business so long as SCIFSC and such
subsidiary, division or unit does not engage in the Restricted Business and
SCIFSC does not have any involvement in or exert any influence over any
business that engages in the Restricted Business. SCIFSC acknowledges that
the purchase price to be paid at Closing for the Shares as specified in
_Section 1.03(b)(i)_ includes, among other things, a value associated with
the goodwill of the Company, and that the restrictions contained in this
_Section 7.06_ are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate
interests of Buyer, including without limitation the protection of the
goodwill of the Company.

 

(b) During the Restricted Period, SCIFSC shall not, and shall not permit any
of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, hire or solicit any employee of
the Company (to the extent such employee was employed with the Company as of
the Closing Date), or encourage any such employee to leave such employment or
hire any such employee who has left such employment, except pursuant to a
general solicitation which is not directed specifically to any such
employees; _provided_ , _that_ nothing in this _Section 7.06_ shall prevent
SCIFSC or any of its Affiliates from hiring (i) any employee whose employment
has been terminated by the Company or Buyer or (ii) after one hundred and
eighty (180) days from the date of termination of employment, any employee
whose employment has been terminated by the employee.

 

(c) During the Restricted Period, SCIFSC shall not, and shall not permit any
of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, solicit or entice, or attempt
to solicit or entice, any clients or customers of the Company (to the extent
such client or customer was a client or customer of the Company as of the
Closing Date) for purposes of diverting their business or services from the
Company. 

(d) SCIFSC acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach of this _Section
7.06_ could give rise to irreparable harm to Buyer, for which monetary
damages may not be an adequate remedy, and hereby agrees that in the event of
a breach or a threatened breach by SCIFSC of any such obligations, Buyer may,
in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may be available to
it in respect of such breach, be entitled to equitable relief, including a
temporary restraining order, an injunction, specific performance and any other
relief that may be available from a court of competent jurisdiction.

 



38 (e) SCIFSC acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this _Section
7.06_ are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of

THIS AGREEMENT. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY (A) CERTIFIES THAT
NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT

INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR ECONOMIC LOSS ARISING OUT OF
ANY CLAIM, DEMAND OR ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT.

 

11.13 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the parties do not perform their obligations under the provisions of this
Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them
hereunder to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The
parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, without proof of damages, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, (ii) under the
circumstances when specific performance is permitted pursuant to this
_Section 11.13_ (A) are not intended to and do not adequately compensate for
the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement and (B) shall not
be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any partys right
to specific enforcement and (iii) the right of specific enforcement is an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without
that right, none of Sellers, the Company or Buyer would have entered into
this Agreement. Each party agrees that it will not

 



57  oppose the granting of specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy at law or that an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or equity. The parties acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an
injunction to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section
shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with
any such injunction.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary: (x) no Person
other than each Seller and the Company shall be entitled to seek specific
performance of this Agreement against Buyer, and (y) no party shall be
entitled to more than any one of (i) a monetary damages award, (ii) in the
case of Sellers and the Company, receipt of any amounts in connection with the
Confidentiality Agreement, or (iii) an order or similar equitable remedy
pursuant to this  _Section 11.13(b)_ requiring a party to effect the
Closing, plus any amounts payable in connection with the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 

11.14 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action based upon, arising out
of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Legal Requirements
of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to principles or rules of
conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require
or permit the application of the Legal Requirements of another jurisdiction.

(b) Any action, suit or proceeding based upon, arising out of or related to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may be brought in the
Delaware Court of Chancery (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be
unavailable, any other court of the State of Delaware or, in the case of
claims to which the federal courts have exclusive subject matter
jurisdiction, any federal court of the United States of America sitting in the
State of Delaware), and each of the parties irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in any such action, suit or
proceeding, waives any objection it may now or hereafter have to personal
jurisdiction, venue or to convenience of forum, agrees that all claims in
respect of the action, suit or proceeding shall be heard and determined
only in any such court, and agrees not to bring any action, suit or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby in any other court. Nothing herein contained shall be
deemed to affect the right of any party to serve process in any manner
permitted by Legal Requirement or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise
proceed against any other party in any other jurisdiction, in each case, to
enforce judgments obtained in any action, suit or proceeding brought pursuant
to this _Section 11.14(b)_.

11.15 _Legal Representation_.

 

(a) Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby agrees, on its own behalf and
on behalf of its directors, members, partners, officers, employees and
Affiliates, that Goodwin Procter LLP may serve as counsel to each and any
holder of the capital stock of the Company and its Affiliates (individually
and collectively, the " _Holder Group_ "), on the one hand, and the Company
and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, in connection with the negotiation,
preparation,

 



58  execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and that, following consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, Goodwin Procter LLP (or any successor) may
serve as counsel to the Holder Group or any director, member, partner,
officer, employee or Affiliate of the Holder Group, in connection with any
litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding
such representation and each of the parties hereto hereby consents thereto and
waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each of such parties
shall cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to waive any conflict of
interest arising from such representation.

(b) Each Buyer Party for itself and its Affiliates, including the Company and
its Subsidiaries, and for its and their respective successors and assigns,
irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all communications between Sellers or
their Affiliates, including the Company and its Subsidiaries, and its or
their counsel, including Goodwin Procter LLP, made in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and closing under, or any
dispute or proceeding arising under or in connection with, this
Agreement which, immediately prior to the Closing, would be deemed to be
privileged communications of Sellers or their Affiliates, including the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and their counsel and would not be subject to
disclosure to such Buyer Party or its Affiliates in connection with any
process relating to a dispute, litigation or proceeding arising under or in
connection with, this Agreement or otherwise, shall continue after the Closing
to be privileged communications between Sellers or their Affiliates,
including the Company and its Subsidiaries, and such counsel and none of such
Buyer Party, any Affiliate of such Buyer Party or any Person acting or
purporting to act on behalf of or through such Buyer Party or any Affiliate of
such Buyer Party shall seek to obtain the same by any process on the grounds
that the privilege attaching to such communications belongs to such Buyer
Party or any Affiliate of such Buyer Party, including the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and not Sellers or their Affiliates. For the avoidance of
doubt, the parties to this Agreement agree that all pre-Closing communications
between or among Goodwin Procter LLP, the Company, any Seller and/or the
Seller Representative that relate in any way to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, the attorney-client privilege and all other
rights to any evidentiary privilege belong to the Seller Representative and
may be controlled by the Seller Representative and shall not pass to or
be claimed by any Buyer Party or the Company. Prior to the Closing, the
Sellers and the Company may retain and remove all documents, emails and other
non-email electronic documents concerning any merger, acquisition or sale of
the Company or any of its assets. It is acknowledged and agreed to by the
parties that a failure by the Company and the Sellers to remove materials
identified in the foregoing sentence, to the extent that such materials are
otherwise protected by the attorney-client or work product privileges, is
inadvertent and that the Seller Representative shall, after receiving written
notice from any Buyer Party of said failure, to the extent discovered and
known by such Buyer Party to constitute materials identified in the foregoing
sentence, have ninety (90) days (the " _Recovery Period_ ") to request the
return of such documents from such Buyer Party and/or the Company and its
Subsidiaries. At all times prior to the lapse of the Recovery Period, each
Buyer Party agrees not to knowingly take any actions (and will cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries not to knowingly take any actions) with regard to
the documents that would be inconsistent with such claims of privilege.

 



59 (c) Each Buyer Party acknowledges that its consent and waiver under this 
_Section 11.15_ is voluntary and informed and that Buyer has obtained
independent legal advice with respect to this consent and waiver. Without
limiting anything set forth in this Agreement, each Buyer Party acknowledges
and agrees that each Seller is relying on the foregoing consent and waiver
set forth in this _Section 11.15_.

11.16 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give any Person,
other than the parties hereto, any rights or remedies under or by reason of
this Agreement except for (a) in the event the Closing occurs, the present
and former officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries (and
their personal successors, heirs and representatives) are intended third-party
beneficiaries of, and may enforce,  _Section 7.01_.

11.17 _Guarantee_. Parent irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to the
Sellers and SAR Holders the due and punctual performance of the obligations
of Buyer under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which Buyer is a
party (the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "), subject to the terms and conditions
set forth herein. If, for any reason whatsoever, Buyer shall fail to or be
unable to duly, punctually and fully pay or perform the Guaranteed
Obligations, Parent will forthwith pay and cause to be paid in lawful currency
of the United States, with respect to payment obligations, or perform or
cause to be performed, with respect to performance obligations, the Guaranteed
Obligations. It is acknowledged and agreed that the foregoing is a guarantee
of payment and of performance, as applicable, and not of collection.
