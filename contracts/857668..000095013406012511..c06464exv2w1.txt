part of the Company or any shareholder of the Company or Merger Sub:

     (a) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of Common Stock of Merger Sub
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and
become one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

     (b) Conversion of Common Shares. Each holder of Common Shares shall be
entitled to receive (i) a portion of the Initial Merger Consideration promptly
after the Effective Time in cash equal to (A) the Per Share Initial Merger
Consideration, multiplied by (B) the number of Common Shares held by such holder
immediately prior to the Effective Time (but not including any Common Shares
issuable upon the exercise of any Stock Options or Warrants held by such holder
immediately prior to the Effective Time); and (ii) from time to time after the
Effective Time, as and when such amounts, if any, become payable to holders of
Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement, such further amounts distributed out
of the Payment Fund by the Representative in respect of the Common Shares, which
shall be calculated pro rata based on the Percentage Interest represented by
such Common Shares (the aggregate amount thereof together with further amounts
so distributed in respect of the Stock Options and Warrants being the
"Subsequent Merger Consideration" and collectively with the Initial Merger
Consideration, the "Merger Consideration").

     3.2 Payment for Common Shares, Stock Options and Warrants.

     (a) Certain Calculations.

          (i) For the purpose of determining the amount required to be deposited
     pursuant to Section 3.2(b)(i) in the Payment Fund, the Representative shall
     calculate the Stock Option Consideration and the Warrant Consideration, if
     any, and the respective amounts payable to each holder of outstanding Stock
     Options or Warrants, as applicable, pursuant to Sections 3.3(a) and 3.3(b),
     respectively, and the Representative shall provide, no later than four (4)
     Business Days prior to the Closing Date and after providing Buyer with an
     opportunity for review and discussion, written notice to Buyer prior to the
     Closing of the Stock Option Consideration and the Warrant Consideration, if
     any, and the amount required to be deposited in the Payment Fund pursuant
     to Section 3.2(b)(i).

          (ii) No later than four (4) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
     and after providing Buyer with an opportunity for review and discussion,
     the Company shall deliver to Buyer and Merger Sub (1) a statement of
     estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital (the "Statement of Estimated
     Closing Date Net Working Capital") determined on a basis consistent with
     the methodology to be employed in the calculation of the Closing Date Net
     Working Capital pursuant to Section 3.5 below (such estimate, the
     "Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital"), (2) a statement (the
     "Statement of Estimated


                                       19

<PAGE>

     Closing Date Cash Amount") of a good faith estimate of the Closing Date
     Cash Amount (such estimate, the "Estimated Closing Date Cash Amount"), (3)
     a statement (the "Statement of Estimated Closing Date Other Indebtedness")
     of a good faith estimate of the Closing Date Other Indebtedness (such
     estimate, the "Estimated Closing Date Other Indebtedness"), and (4) a
     statement (the "Statement of Estimated Closing Date Capital Expenditure
     Amount") of a good faith estimate of the Closing Date Capital Expenditure
     Amount (such estimate, the "Estimated Closing Date Capital Expenditure
     Amount"). The amounts to be reflected on such statements shall be
     calculated as of the final Business Day of the month in which the Closing
     is to occur, unless the Closing is to occur during the first five (5)
     Business Days of a month, in which event such statements shall be as of the
     final Business Day of the preceding month.

     (b) Closing Payments. At the Closing, the following deposits and payments
shall be made:

          (i) Buyer or Merger Sub shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited
     in the Payment Fund, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an
     amount equal to the Closing Date Net Stockholder Payment.

          (ii) Buyer or Merger Sub shall pay, or cause to be paid, by wire
     transfer of immediately available funds, to each of the lenders of the
     Other Indebtedness the Payoff Amount.

     Intermediate LLC and TCI, as the case may be, to pay, by wire transfer of
     immediately available funds, to each Applicable Trustee such amount, as
     confirmed by such Applicable Trustee, necessary to satisfy and discharge
     the Indenture Indebtedness under such Indenture pursuant to the provisions
     of the relevant Indenture (collectively for all such Indentures, the
     "Indenture Satisfaction and Discharge Amount").

          (iv) Buyer or Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be deposited with
     the Escrow Agent, pursuant to an escrow agreement to be executed at the
     Closing, substantially in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit C (the "Escrow
     Agreement"), the following amounts: (A) ten million dollars ($10,000,000)
     (such amount, as it may be adjusted in accordance with this Agreement and
     the Escrow Agreement, the "Indemnity Escrow Amount"), which shall be
     deposited in a separate interest-bearing escrow account established under
     the Escrow Agreement for the purpose of making funds available to satisfy
     claims for Losses with respect to which either or both of Buyer and the
     Surviving Corporation is entitled to indemnification under Article XI (the
     "Indemnity Escrow Account"); and (B) five million dollars ($5,000,000) (the
     "Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount"), which shall be deposited in a
     separate interest-bearing escrow account established under the Escrow
     Agreement for the purpose of making funds available to satisfy any
     reduction in the Subsequent Merger Consideration as a result of any
     adjustment thereto pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.5(e) (the
     "Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account").


                                       20

          (v) Buyer or Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be deposited with
     the Escrow Agent, pursuant to an escrow agreement to be executed at the
     Closing, substantially in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit D (the
     "Environmental Escrow Agreement"), five million dollars ($5,000,000) (such
     amount, as it may be adjusted in accordance with this Agreement and the
     Environmental Escrow Agreement, the "Environmental Escrow Amount"), which
     shall be deposited in a separate interest-bearing escrow account
     established under the Escrow Agreement for the purpose of making funds
     available to satisfy the costs and expenses of the Environmental Work (the
     "Environmental Escrow Account").

          (vi) Buyer or Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, an
     amount equal to $500,000 as the Seller Expenses into a separate account to
     be designated by the Representative (the "Expense Account").

          (vii) Buyer or Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, an
     amount equal to the Stock Option Consideration into a separate account of
     the Company to be established by the Company for the benefit of the holders
     of all Stock Options (the "Stock Option Account") for the purpose of
     distributing such funds to the holders of all Stock Options pursuant to
     Section 3.3(a).

          (viii) Buyer or Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, an
     amount equal to the Warrant Consideration, if any, into a separate account
     of the Company to be established by the Company for the benefit of the
     holders of each unexpired Warrant reflected on Schedule 4.4(b) (the
     "Warrant Account") for the purpose of distributing such funds to the
     holders of Warrants pursuant to Section 3.3(b); provided, however, that no
     such deposit or distribution shall occur if prior to the Effective Time all
     such Warrants have been converted in their entirety into Common Shares.

          (ix) If the Representative so instructs Buyer in writing prior to the
     Closing, Buyer or Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, an
     amount equal to the Closing Transaction Expenses into an account of the
     Company, and the Company shall pay all Closing Transaction Expenses at the
     Closing to the recipients thereof as directed by the Representative.

     (c) Surrender of Certificates. The Representative shall pay an amount equal
to the Per Share Initial Merger Consideration out of the Payment Fund for each
Common Share that is surrendered in accordance with this Section 3.2(c).
Promptly after the Effective Time, subject to Section 3.6, upon surrender of a
Certificate or Certificates (or affidavit of lost Certificate in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representative and the Surviving
Corporation) representing Common Shares owned by such stockholder to the
Representative or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by the
Representative, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal in a form
reasonably acceptable to counsel for the Representative and Buyer, the holder of
such Certificate or Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor an amount in cash, without any interest thereon, equal to the product
of the Per Share Initial Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of Common
Shares represented by such Certificate or Certificates. From time to time after
the Effective Time, as and when any amount of Subsequent Merger Consideration is
distributed out of the Payment Fund by the Representative to the Equity


                                       21

<PAGE>

Holders pursuant to this Agreement, any holder of Common Shares that has
surrendered Certificates representing Common Shares to the Representative (or to
any agent appointed by the Representative) shall have the right to receive its
Percentage Interest of the Subsequent Merger Consideration that is distributed
out of the Payment Fund by the Representative to the Equity Holders in respect
of all Certificates representing Common Shares so surrendered by such holder
relative to the aggregate amount of the entire Subsequent Merger Consideration
so distributed. Such right to receive Subsequent Merger Consideration shall not
be transferable except by will or the laws of descent and distribution.

     (d) Unregistered Transfers of Capital Stock. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Common Shares which are not registered in the transfer records of
the Company as of the Effective Time, the appropriate portion of the Merger
Consideration, may be paid by the Representative to a transferee if the
Certificate or Certificates representing such Common Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the
Surviving Corporation, including, without limitation, (i) documents to evidence
and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer
taxes have been paid and (ii) representations or warranties by the transferee to
the Surviving Corporation with respect to the ownership of such capital stock,
in form reasonably acceptable to the Surviving Corporation.

     (e) No Further Ownership Rights in Company. At and after the Effective
Time, each holder of Common Shares of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as a stockholder of the Company,
except for the right to surrender such stockholder's Certificates in exchange
for its portion of the Initial Merger Consideration as set forth herein and the
right to receive its Percentage Interest of the Subsequent Merger Consideration
that is distributed out of the Payment Fund by the Representative to the Equity
Holders, and after the Effective Time no transfer of Common Shares of the
Company shall be made on the stock transfer books of the Company. Any
Certificates presented after the Effective Time for transfer shall be cancelled
and exchanged for the holder's portion of the Merger Consideration in accordance
with Section 3.2(c) above.

     (f) Tax Withholding. Each of the Surviving Corporation and the Company
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from all amounts payable into the
Payment Fund pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of payment of such amounts
under the Code, or any other provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or the
Company, it shall so advise the Representative in writing indicating the Person
in respect of which such deduction is being made and the amount withheld, and
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid into the Payment Fund. The Representative shall have the right
to deduct such withheld amounts from any payment contemplated to be made under
Section 3.2(c) to such Person in respect of which such amount was deducted and
withheld by the Company or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this Section
3.2(f).

     3.3 Company Stock Options; Company Warrants.

     (a) At the Effective Time, each then outstanding Stock Option that is not
exercised prior to the Closing shall terminate and the holder thereof will have
the right to receive in


                                       22

<PAGE>

exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the difference between (x) the Per
Share Initial Merger Consideration, multiplied by the aggregate number of Common
Shares issuable upon exercise in full of all Stock Options (whether or not then
vested) held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time, minus (y)
the aggregate cash exercise price payable upon exercise of all such Stock
Options, net of applicable withholding Taxes. The aggregate amount payable to
the holders of all outstanding Stock Options pursuant to this Section 3.3(a),
before giving effect to any applicable deductions or withholdings for Taxes, is
referred to herein as the "Stock Option Consideration." Promptly after the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid to the holders
of all Stock Options all amounts due under this Section 3.3(a) without interest
thereon out of the funds deposited by Buyer or Merger Sub into the Stock Option
Account pursuant to Section 3.2(b)(vii). Additionally, from time to time after
the Effective Time, as and when any amounts of Subsequent Merger Consideration
shall become payable pursuant to this Agreement, holders of Stock Options
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be entitled to receive
a pro rata portion of such Subsequent Merger Consideration based on the
Percentage Interest represented by such Stock Options.

     (b) At the Effective Time, each unexpired Warrant that is not exercised
prior to the Closing shall terminate and the holder thereof will have the right
to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the difference
between (x) the Per Share Initial Merger Consideration, multiplied by the
aggregate number of Common Shares issuable upon exercise in full of all Warrants
held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time, minus (y) the
aggregate cash exercise price payable upon exercise of all such Warrants, net of
applicable withholding Taxes. The aggregate amount payable to the holders of all
outstanding Warrants pursuant to this Section 3.3(b), before giving effect to
any applicable deductions or withholdings for Taxes, is referred to herein as
the "Warrant Consideration." Promptly after the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid to the holders of all Warrants all
amounts due under this Section 3.3(b) without interest thereon out of the funds
deposited by Buyer or Merger Sub into the Warrant Account pursuant to Section
3.2(b)(viii). Additionally, from time to time after the Effective Time, as and
when any amounts of Subsequent Merger Consideration shall become payable
pursuant to this Agreement, holders of Warrants outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be entitled to receive a pro rata portion of such
Subsequent Merger Consideration based on the Percentage Interest represented by
such Warrants.

     (c) To the extent there are any changes to Schedule 4.4(b) in order to
reflect the exercise of Stock Options or Warrants prior to the Closing, the
Company shall provide an updated Schedule 4.4(b) to Buyer, Merger Sub and the
Representative at the Closing, and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to rely on such schedule in making payments under Sections 3.3(a) and 3.3(b)
above.

     (d) The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
all amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Stock Options or
Warrants such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect
to the making of payment of such amounts under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Stock Option
or Warrants, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by the Surviving Corporation.


                                       23

<PAGE>

     (e) Effective as of the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate all
stock option plans granting rights in the Company's capital stock.

     3.4 Indemnity Escrow Amount.

     (a) The Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be held by the Escrow Agent in order
to provide funds for the payment of claims with respect to which any Buyer
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to Article XI. Buyer
will have a right to make claims against the Indemnity Escrow Account in
accordance with Article XI on behalf of any Buyer Indemnified Party for any and
all amounts of Losses with respect to which such Buyer Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification under Article XI. Any interest earned on the
Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be deposited by the Escrow Agent into the
Indemnity Escrow Account, but shall not constitute part of the Indemnity Escrow
Amount. The amount of interest, reduced by any Taxes (as referred to in the next
sentence), brokerage fees and other expenses or losses incurred in connection
with the investment of the Indemnity Escrow Amount, shall be paid to the Buyer
and the Representative in proportion to the respective payments to them of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount. The parties acknowledge that Buyer shall be treated as
the owner of the Indemnity Escrow Account and shall be responsible for any Taxes
attributable to income earned in respect of the Indemnity Escrow Amount until
such Indemnity Escrow Amount is disbursed in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement (with the Buyer being entitled to reimbursement out of such
interest for any such Taxes paid).

     (b) The Escrow Agreement shall provide for releases from the Indemnity
Escrow Account as follows: (i) $2,000,000 on the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, and (ii) $2,000,000 on the second anniversary of the Closing Date,
in each case to the extent that unresolved claims do not exceed the Indemnity
Escrow Amount.

     (c) Subject to the provisions of the Escrow Agreement, on the next Business
Day after the Indemnity Cut-Off Date, Buyer and the Representative shall
instruct the Escrow Agent to release from the Indemnity Escrow Account and
deposit into the Payment Fund the remaining balance of funds in the Indemnity
Escrow Account; provided, however, that if, at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on
the Business Day immediately preceding the Indemnity Cut-Off Date, any portion
of the Indemnity Escrow Account is subject to one or more pending
indemnification claims that have been timely asserted in accordance with Article
XI and have not been paid in full or otherwise finally settled or adjudicated,
or are subject to appeal or further proceedings, then an amount equal to such
portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount attributable to such claims (including
accrued interest earned on each such amount in the Indemnity Escrow Account from
the date on which each such claim was made to the Indemnity Cut-Off Date) shall
be retained in the Indemnity Escrow Account until such claims are paid in full
or otherwise finally settled or adjudicated and no longer subject to appeal or
further proceedings. Subject to the right of the Representative to retain funds
to cover the Seller Expenses, the Representative shall distribute to the Equity
Holders all funds released from the Indemnity Escrow Account pursuant to this
Section 3.4 in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests; provided,
however, that the Representative shall pay to the Surviving Corporation all
amounts required pursuant to this Section 3.4 to be distributed from the Payment
Fund to the holders of Stock Options and Warrants, and the Surviving Corporation
shall distribute such amounts, net of applicable


                                       24

<PAGE>

withholding Taxes, to such holders in accordance with their respective
Percentage Interests therein in accordance with the Representative's
instructions.

     3.5 Adjustment to the Merger Consideration.

     (a) The Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be held by the Escrow
Agent until the final determination of the Closing Date Net Working Capital,
Closing Date Cash Amount, Closing Date Other Indebtedness and Closing Date
Capital Expenditure Amount in accordance with this Section 3.5 in order to
provide funds for the payment of all amounts (if any) required to be paid to
Buyer pursuant to this Section 3.5 as a result of a difference between the
Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Cash Amount, Closing Date Other
Indebtedness and Closing Date Capital Expenditure Amount, each as finally
determined pursuant to this Section 3.5, and the respective corresponding
amounts estimated pursuant to Section 3.2(a)(ii). Any interest earned on the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be deposited by the Escrow Agent
into the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account, but shall not constitute part
of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount. The amount of interest, reduced
by any Taxes (as referred to in the next sentence), brokerage fees and other
expenses or losses incurred in connection with the investment of the Purchase
Price Adjustment, shall be paid to the Buyer and the Representative in
proportion to the respective payments to them of the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Amount. The parties acknowledge that Buyer shall be treated as the owner
of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account and shall be responsible for any
Taxes attributable to income earned in respect of the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Amount until such Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount is disbursed in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement (with the Buyer being entitled
to reimbursement out of such interest for any such Taxes paid). Upon final
determination of each of the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Closing Date
Cash Amount, the Closing Date Other Indebtedness and the Closing Date Capital
Expenditure Amount, and the payment of all amounts (if any) required to be paid
to Buyer pursuant to this Section 3.5, Buyer and the Representative shall
instruct the Escrow Agent to release from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Account and deposit into the Payment Fund the balance of funds remaining in the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account, if any, and (subject to the right of
the Representative to retain funds to cover Seller Expenses) the Representative
shall distribute such funds to the Equity Holders in accordance with their
respective Percentage Interests.

     (b) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to the Representative (i) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and the Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the Closing Date
(but without giving effect to the Closing) (the "Closing Balance Sheet"), (ii)
an unaudited statement of the Closing Date Net Working Capital (the "Statement
of Closing Date Net Working Capital"), (iii) an unaudited statement of the
Closing Date Cash Amount (the "Statement of Closing Date Cash Amount"), (iv) an
unaudited statement of the Closing Date Other Indebtedness (the "Statement of
Closing Date Other Indebtedness") and (v) an unaudited statement of the Closing
Date Capital Expenditure Amount (the "Statement of Closing Date Capital
Expenditures") (altogether, the "Closing Statements"). The Closing Statements
shall be prepared based upon the books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. The Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statements shall be
prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied on a basis consistent with that of the
Audited Financial Statements (except to the extent that the definitions of
Closing Date Net


                                       25

<PAGE>

Working Capital, Closing Date Cash Amount, Closing Date Other Indebtedness and
Closing Date Capital Expenditure Amount specifically provide otherwise); without
limitation of the foregoing, the Closing Statements shall be prepared using the
same accounting methods, policies, practices and procedures, with consistent
classifications, judgments and estimation methodologies as were used in the
preparation of the Audited Financial Statements, to the extent they are, in each
case, consistent with GAAP.

     (c) Following the delivery to the Representative of the Closing Statements,
Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide the Representative and
its representatives with reasonable access during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice to books and records and relevant personnel to verify the
accuracy of the Closing Statements referred to in paragraph (b) above and
attempt to resolve any disputes that may arise under this Section 3.5.

     (d) The Closing Statements shall be final and binding on the parties unless
the Representative shall, within forty-five (45) days following the delivery of
the Closing Statements deliver to Buyer written notice of disagreement, which
notice shall describe the nature of any such disagreement in reasonable detail,
identify the specific items involved and the dollar amount of each such
disagreement. After the end of the forty-five (45) day period following the
delivery of the Closing Statements, neither Buyer nor the Representative may
introduce additional disagreements with respect to any item in the Closing
Statements, except to the extent they arise out of or are related to then
pending disagreements. If the Representative shall raise any objections within
the aforesaid forty-five (45) day period, then the disputed matters shall be
resolved by the Representative, on behalf of the Equity Holders, and Buyer. If
the Representative and Buyer are unable to resolve all disagreements within
thirty (30) days, or such longer period as may be agreed by Buyer and the
Representative, then, within thirty (30) days thereafter, the Representative and
Buyer jointly shall select an arbiter from KPMG or such other accounting firm of
national standing as may be agreed by the parties. If Buyer and the
Representative are unable to select an arbiter within such time period, the
American Arbitration Association shall make such selection (the person so

Accounting Arbitrator so selected will consider only those items and amounts set
forth in the Closing Statements as to which Buyer and the Representative have
disagreed within the time periods and on the terms specified above (except as
provided above) and must resolve the matter in accordance with the terms and
provisions of this Agreement. The Accounting Arbitrator shall issue a report
that sets forth the resolution of all items in dispute and that contains a final
Closing Balance Sheet and/or a final Statement of Closing Date Net Working
Capital and/or final Statement of Closing Date Cash Amount and/or a final
Statement of Closing Date Other Indebtedness and/or a final Statement of Closing
Date Capital Expenditures, as applicable. Such report shall be final and binding
upon Buyer and the Representative. The fees and expenses hereunder of the
Accounting Arbitrator shall be paid one-half by Buyer and, as Seller Expenses,
one-half by the Representative, on behalf of the Equity Holders. Buyer and the
Representative shall, and Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
cooperate fully with the Accounting Arbitrator and respond on a timely basis to
all requests for information or access to documents or personnel made by the
Accounting Arbitrator or by other parties hereto, all with the intent to fairly

of Closing Date Net Working Capital and/or Statement of Closing Date Cash Amount
and/or Statement of the Closing Date Other Indebtedness and/or

as reasonably practicable.

     (e) (i) If the Closing Date Net Working Capital as reflected in the
Statement of Closing Date Net Working Capital as finally determined in
accordance with this Section 3.5 is less than the Estimated Closing Date Net
Working Capital, the payments of Subsequent Merger Consideration shall be
decreased by an amount equal to the amount of such shortfall, and if the Closing
Date Net Working Capital as reflected in the Statement of Closing Date Net
Working Capital is greater than the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital,
the payments of Subsequent Merger Consideration shall be increased by an amount
equal to the amount of such excess.

          (ii) If the Closing Date Cash Amount as reflected in the Statement of
Closing Date Cash Amount as finally determined in accordance with this Section
3.5 is less than the Estimated Closing Date Cash Amount, the payments of
Subsequent Merger Consideration shall be decreased by an amount equal to the
amount of such shortfall, and if the Closing Date Cash Amount as reflected in
the Statement of Closing Date Cash Amount as finally determined in accordance
with this Section 3.5 is greater than the Estimated Closing Date Cash Amount,
the payments of Subsequent Merger Consideration shall be increased by an amount
equal to the amount of such excess.

          (iii) If the Closing Date Other Indebtedness as reflected in the
Statement of Closing Date Other Indebtedness as finally determined in accordance
with this Section 3.5 is less than the Estimated Closing Date Other
Indebtedness, the payments of Subsequent Merger Consideration shall be increased
by an amount equal to the amount of such difference, and if the Closing Date
Other Indebtedness as reflected in the Statement of Closing Date Other
Indebtedness as finally determined in accordance with this Section 3.5 is
greater than the Estimated Closing Date Other Indebtedness, the payments of
Subsequent Merger Consideration shall be decreased by an amount equal to the
amount of such excess.

          (iv) If the Closing Date Capital Expenditure Amount as reflected in
the Statement of the Closing Date Capital Expenditures as finally determined in
accordance with this Section 3.5 is less than the Estimated Closing Date Capital
Expenditure Amount, the payments of Subsequent Merger Consideration shall be
decreased by an amount equal to the amount of such shortfall, and if the Closing
Date Capital Expenditure Amount as reflected in the Statement of the Closing
Date Capital Expenditures as finally determined in accordance with this Section
3.5 is greater than the Estimated Closing Date Capital Expenditure Amount, the
payments of Subsequent Merger Consideration shall be increased by an amount
equal to the amount of such excess.

     (f) If the aggregate adjustments under paragraph (e) of this Section 3.5
result in a reduction in the payments of Subsequent Merger Consideration, the
Representative and Buyer shall instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer (by
wire transfer to an account designated in writing by Buyer) from the funds held

plus accrued interest earned on such amount in the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Account from the Closing Date to the payment date within five (5)

Closing Date Cash Amount, Closing Date Other Indebtedness and Closing Date
Capital Expenditure Amount, Buyer shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited
into the Payment Fund the amount of such increase plus accrued interest that
would have been earned on such amount had such amount been deposited in the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account from the Closing Date to the payment
date.

     (g) To the extent that any funds remain in the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Account after all payments, if any, required to be made to Buyer pursuant
to Section 3.5(f) above are made, the parties shall instruct the Escrow Agent to
pay into the Payment Fund the balance of funds remaining in the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Account. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, in the event that the net aggregate amount of the adjustments
in Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Cash Amount, Closing Date
Other Indebtedness and Closing Date Capital Expenditure Amount exceeds the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount, the remaining balance of such net
aggregate amount (plus accrued interest that would have been earned on such
amount had such amount been deposited in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Account from the Closing Date to the payment date) shall be paid to Buyer out of
the Indemnity Escrow Account.

     (h) Judgment upon the award rendered by the accounting firm may be entered
in any court of competent jurisdiction.

Representative shall pay to the Surviving Corporation all amounts required
pursuant to this Section 3.5 to be distributed from the Payment Fund to the
holders of Stock Options and the holders of Warrants, and the Surviving
Corporation shall distribute such amounts, net of applicable withholding Taxes,
to such holders in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests in
accordance with the Representative's instructions.

     3.6 Dissenting Shares.

appraisal of such Common Shares in the manner provided in Section 262 of the
DGCL and who, as of the Closing Date, will not have effectively withdrawn or
lost such right to dissenters' rights ("Dissenting Shares") will not be
converted into or represent a right to receive any portion of the Merger
Consideration. The holders thereof will be entitled only to such rights as are
granted by Section 262 of the DGCL. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes
entitled to payment for such shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be
entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Common Shares held by
them in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262 of the DGCL;
provided, however, that if any such holder of Dissenting Shares will have
effectively withdrawn such holder's demand for appraisal of such shares or lost
such holder's right to appraisal and payment of such shares under Section 262 of


                                       28

<PAGE>

the DGCL, such holder will forfeit the right to appraisal of such shares and
each such Common Share will thereupon be deemed to have been canceled,
extinguished and converted, as of the Effective Time, into and represent the
right to receive the portion of the Merger Consideration to which such holder
shall be entitled, without any interest thereon, in accordance with this Article
III, upon surrender in the manner provided in Section 3.2(c), of the Certificate
or Certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, evidenced the
number of shares of Common Shares owned by such stockholder.

     (b) The Company will give Buyer (i) prompt notice of any written demand for
appraisal, any withdrawal of a demand for appraisal and any other instrument
served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL received by the Company and (ii) the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands
for appraisal under such Section 262 of the DGCL.

     (c) In the event that any stockholder properly demands relief in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL and the rights to obtain such relief are not
withdrawn or otherwise lost prior to the Effective Time, the Representative
shall withhold payment out of the Payment Fund of, and pay over to Buyer, such
amounts that would otherwise be paid pursuant to Section 3.2(c) to holders of
Common Shares. The Buyer and the Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent
to pay over to Buyer the amounts allocable to the Common Shares referred to in
clause (i) of this paragraph and held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and the
Environmental Escrow Agreement, based on the Percentage Interests attributable
to such Dissenting Shares.

Transactions shall have been abandoned pursuant to Section 10.1, the closing of

     Except as disclosed in the SEC Reports and except as disclosed in the

organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization, and has all necessary power and authority
necessary to own, lease and operate its assets and to carry on its business as
conducted. Each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified to
do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of
its business or its ownership of property requires it to be so qualified, except
where the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would not, when taken
together with all other such failures, have a Material Adverse Effect. Schedule
4.1.1 lists, for the Company and each of its active Subsidiaries, the
jurisdiction of its organization, its form as a legal entity and each
jurisdiction in which it is so qualified. Schedule 4.1.2 lists each dormant
Subsidiary of the Company. Each such dormant Subsidiary has no material assets
and the aggregate Liabilities of all such dormant Subsidiaries do not exceed

action. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and
constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Remedies Exception. Each Ancillary
Agreement to which the Company will become a party, when executed and delivered
by the Company, will constitute the valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Remedies Exception. The board of directors of the Company, at a meeting duly
called and held at which a quorum was present throughout, by the requisite vote
of the directors, has determined this Agreement and the Transactions to be
advisable and fair to and in the best interest of the Company and its
stockholders, has approved this Agreement and the Transactions and has resolved
to recommend the approval by the Company's stockholders of this Agreement and
the Transactions, and no such declaration, approval, adoption or recommendation
has been changed, withdrawn or revoked.

     4.3 No Breach; Consents.

     (a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements to which the Company will become a party will not (i)
contravene any provision of the Organizational Documents of the Company or any
Subsidiary; (ii) violate any Law, Governmental Order or Governmental
Authorization; (iii) result in any breach of any of the

acceleration of payment (or any right to terminate) or require a Consent, under
any Contract that is either binding upon or enforceable against the Company or
any Subsidiary (other than the Contracts governing the Other Indebtedness and
the Indenture Indebtedness to be cancelled at the Closing) or any Governmental
Authorization that is held by the Company or any Subsidiary; (iv) result in the
creation of any Encumbrance upon the Company or any Subsidiary or any of the
assets of the Company or any Subsidiary; (v) require any Governmental
Authorization (subject to the making of the filings and the expiration of
waiting periods required under the HSR Act and the EU antitrust Laws and
regulations (the "Antitrust Clearance")); (vi) give any Governmental Entity or
other Person the right to challenge any of the Transactions or to exercise any
remedy or obtain any relief under any Law, Governmental Order or Governmental
Authorization (subject to the Antitrust Clearance); or (vii) cause Buyer to
become subject to, or to become liable for the payment of, any Tax, (x) except
for, in the case of clauses (ii) to (vii) above, any such items, individually or
in the aggregate, which would not have a Material Adverse Effect, and (y)
subject to, in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (vi), required Consents, as

Representative to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
discussions with any Person that relate to any Acquisition Proposal subject to
Section 6.10(a).

     (d) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary will release or permit the
release of any Person from, or waive or permit the waiver of any provision of,
any confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement to which the Company is a
party, and will enforce or cause to be enforced each such agreement at the
request of Buyer.

     6.11 Checks. The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all checks received by the
Company or any Subsidiary prior to the Closing Date to be deposited into the
Company's or the Subsidiaries' bank accounts prior to the close of business on
the Closing Date.

                                VII. TAX MATTERS

     7.1 Tax Matters.

     (a) If the Company or any Tax Affiliate is permitted but not required,
under applicable Tax laws, to treat the Closing Date as the last day of any Tax
Period, the parties shall treat the Tax Period as ending, as the case may be, at
the close of business on the Closing Date.

     (b) Tax Returns.

          (i) The Company (use of the defined term "Company" in this Section 7.1
     shall also include each Tax Affiliate) shall, at the Company's expense,
     prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Returns
     for the Company which are due on or before the Closing Date, and the
     Company shall pay all Taxes with respect to such Returns. All such Returns
     shall be accurate and complete in accordance with applicable Laws and shall
     be prepared on a basis consistent with the Returns filed by or on behalf of
     the Company for the preceding Tax Period. The Company shall submit copies
     of all income Tax Returns to Buyer at least 30 days prior to their extended
     due date for Buyer's review and approval.

          (ii) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to
     be filed all Returns of the Company which are due after the Closing Date,
     and Buyer shall cause the Company, at the Surviving Corporation's expense,
     to pay all Taxes with respect to such Returns. The Company shall reserve on
     the Closing Balance Sheet in a manner that is consistent with past practice
     and is in accordance with GAAP an appropriate amount to reflect the
     obligation to pay any such Taxes. Buyer shall permit the Representative to
     review and comment, prior to filing, on each Return for Tax Periods which
     begin before the Closing Date ("Straddle Tax Returns"). Any portion of any
     Tax which must be paid in connection with the filing of a Straddle Tax
     Return, to the extent attributable to any period or portion of a period
     ending on or before the Closing Date (the "Interim Period"), shall be
     referred to herein as "Pre-Closing Taxes." The Escrow Agent shall remit to
     Buyer, in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, an amount from the Escrow
     Amount equal to the Pre-Closing Taxes due with any Straddle Tax Returns (to
     the extent such


                                       63

<PAGE>

     Taxes are not reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet) at least ten (10)
     Business Days before Buyer is required to cause to be paid the related Tax
     liability; it being understood that the Company will accrue on the Closing
     Balance Sheet all Pre-Closing Taxes. Where the Pre-Closing Taxes involve a
     period which begins before and ends after the Closing Date, such
     Pre-Closing Taxes shall be calculated as though the taxable year of the
     Company terminated as of the close of business on the Closing Date;
     provided, however, that in the case of a Tax not based on income, receipts,
     proceeds, profits or similar items, Pre-Closing Taxes shall be equal to the
     amount of Tax for the Tax Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
     which shall be the number of days from the beginning of the Tax Period
     through the Closing Date and the denominator of which shall be the number
     of days in the Tax Period. All Straddle Tax Returns shall be prepared, and
     all determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations
     shall be made, in a manner consistent with prior practice of the Company.

     (c) Audits. Each party shall promptly notify the other in writing upon
receipt by such party (or any of its Tax Affiliates) of any pending or
threatened Tax proceeding with respect to the Company for any (i) Tax Period
ending on or before the Closing Date or (ii) Tax Period which begins before the
Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date. The Representative shall have the
sole right to represent the interests of the Company in any Tax proceedings
relating to Tax Periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date and to employ
counsel of its choice at its expense. Buyer shall have the right to participate
at its expense in any such Tax proceeding which may have the effect of
increasing Buyer's or the Company's Tax Liability for any Tax Period ending
after the Closing Date, and the Representative and the Company shall not settle
or compromise any such proceeding without Buyer's prior written consent, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided,
however, that Buyer shall consent to any settlement or compromise if the Equity
Holders fully indemnify Buyer for any increase in Buyer's or the Company's Tax
Liability. Buyer shall have the sole right to represent the interest of the
Surviving Corporation in any Tax proceedings relating to Tax Periods which end
after the Closing Date and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense. The
Representative shall have the right to participate at the Equity Holders'
expense in any such Tax proceedings which may have the effect of increasing the
Company's Tax Liability for any Tax period ending before the Closing Date, and
Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall not settle or compromise any such
proceeding without prior written consent of the Representative, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding any
other provision to the contrary, Buyer in its sole and absolute discretion may
notify the Representative at any time that any defense and settlement of any Tax
proceeding relating to Taxes for which the Equity Holders are required to
indemnify Buyer pursuant to this Agreement must be immediately terminated in
which case any obligation with respect to the Equity Holders to make
indemnification payments to Buyer with respect to such Tax proceeding shall
thereupon terminate.

     (d) Cooperation. The Representative and Buyer shall cooperate fully, as and
to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the
preparation and filing of Returns pursuant to Section 7.1 and any audit,
Litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall
include signing any Returns, amended Returns, claims or other documents
necessary to settle any Tax controversy, the retention and (upon the other
party's request) the provision of records and information (including any prior
years' Returns, workpapers or memoranda, whether prepared internally or by a
third-party) which are reasonably


                                       64

<PAGE>

relevant to any such audit, Litigation or other proceeding and making employees
(and, to the extent relevant, outside advisors) available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereby. In addition, each party agrees to (i) furnish to the
other, on a timely basis, copies of all correspondence received from any Tax
authority and (ii) promptly inform the other party of any other communication
from a Tax authority, in connection with any Tax audit, information request, or
other proceeding with respect to any Tax Period which may result in the payment
of, or affect the amount payable of, any Tax by such other party.
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, each party will bear its own
expenses in complying with the foregoing provisions.

     (e) Tax Refunds. Any refund of Taxes (which for purposes of this provision
shall include any entitlement to a credit against Tax) relating to the Company
with respect to Tax Periods (or portions thereof) ending on or before the
Closing Date and received by the Surviving Corporation within three (3) years
following the Closing shall be for the account of the Equity Holders after
payment of any and all applicable Taxes. Buyer shall pay over to the
Representative (after payment of any and all applicable Taxes) for the account
of the Equity Holders any such refunds that Buyer may receive within five (5)
days of such receipt; provided, however, that Buyer shall be entitled to (i) any
refunds and interest arising from the carryback of a Tax item from a Tax Period
that ends after the Closing Date to a Tax Period that begins before the Closing
Date and (ii) any refund of a Tax, regardless of the Tax Period to which it
relates, if Buyer is responsible for and has paid such Tax and has not otherwise
been indemnified for the payments of such Tax.

     (f) Pre-Closing Actions. Prior to the Closing, the Company will not (i)
make or rescind any express or deemed election or take any other discretionary
position relating to Taxes, (ii) amend any Return, (iii) settle or compromise
any Litigation relating to Taxes, (iv) make any change in the composition of any
affiliated group of which the Company is a member, or (v) change any of its
methods of reporting income or deductions for federal or state income Tax
purposes from those employed in the preparation of the last filed federal or
state income Tax Returns, which may have the effect of increasing Buyer's or the
Company's Tax Liability for any Tax Period ending after the Closing Date.

     (g) Post-Closing Actions. The Surviving Corporation will not amend (i) any
Return attributable to a Tax Period ending on or before the Closing Date or (ii)
any Straddle Tax Return that includes a Tax Period that begins before and ends
after the Closing date if such amendment may have the effect of increasing the
Company's Tax Liability for any Tax Period (or portion thereof) that ends on or
before the Closing Date.

     (h) Transfer Taxes. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.1(h),
all transfer (including real estate transfer), documentary, sales, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement (and the transactions
contemplated hereby) shall be paid by Buyer when due, and Buyer shall, at its
own expense, file all necessary Returns and other documentation with respect to
all such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other Taxes
and fees, and, if required by applicable Law, the Representative shall, and
shall on behalf of the Equity Holders, join in the execution of any such Returns
and documentation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any German real property
transfer Taxes incurred in connection with this Agreement (and the transactions


                                       65

<PAGE>

contemplated hereby) shall be borne one-half by Buyer and one-half by the Equity
Holders by (i) including fifty percent (50%) of the estimated German real
property transfer Taxes in the Closing Transaction Expenses and (ii) if the
amount of German real property transfer Taxes actually paid is more than or less
than the amount estimated, by either (A) permitting Buyer to collect fifty
percent (50%) of the excess from the Indemnity Escrow Amount or (B) requiring
Buyer to remit fifty percent (50%) of the shortfall to the Equity Holders by
depositing such amount into the Payment Fund, in either case, promptly following
the actual payment of such Taxes. The parties agree that the total amount of
estimated German real property transfer Taxes to be incurred in connection with
this Agreement (and the transactions contemplated hereby) is Euro 150,000.

     (i) Tax Sharing Agreements. All tax sharing agreements, other than the
Company Tax Sharing Agreement, to which the Company is a party shall be
terminated effective as of the Closing Date.

                           VIII. AGREEMENTS OF BUYER

     8.1 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

     (a) All rights to indemnification, whether pursuant to the Organizational
Documents of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company, by Contract, by Law or
otherwise, existing in favor of those Persons who are, or were, directors,
officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries at or prior to the
date of this Agreement (the "Indemnified Persons") will survive the Merger and
will be observed by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, including the DGCL, for a period of six years
from the Closing Date (the "Indemnification Period").

     (b) During the Indemnification Period, the Surviving Corporation will
maintain in effect, for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons with respect to
acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing Date, the existing policy of
directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company as of the
date of this Agreement in the form disclosed by the Company to Buyer prior to
the date of this Agreement (the "Existing Policy"); provided, however, that (i)
the Surviving Corporation may substitute for the Existing Policy a policy or
policies of comparable coverage, (ii) the Surviving Corporation will not be
required to pay annual premiums for the Existing Policy (or for any substitute
policies for which premiums are payable on an annual basis) in excess of 125% of
the per annum rate of premium paid as of the date hereof for the Existing
Policy, and (iii) in the case of any substitute policy such as a "runoff policy"
for which the applicable premium is payable on a one time basis to obtain
coverage for the entire Indemnification Period, the Surviving Corporation will
not be required to pay an aggregate amount in respect of such premium in excess
of 750% of the per annum rate of premium paid as of the date hereof for the
Existing Policy. In the event the future premiums for the Existing Policy (or
any substitute policies) exceed the threshold amounts set forth in clauses (ii)
and (iii) of the preceding sentence, the Surviving Corporation will be entitled
to reduce the amount of coverage of the Existing Policy (or any substitute
policies) to the amount of coverage that can be obtained for premium amounts
that are within threshold amounts set forth in clauses (ii) or (iii), as the
case may be.

     8.2 Employment; Employee Benefits.


                                       66
<PAGE>

     (a) Nothing in this Agreement will be construed to create a right in any
employee of the Company or any Subsidiary to employment with Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Buyer (including the Company),
and, subject to any agreement between an employee and Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Buyer (including the Company), the
employment of each employee of the Company or any Subsidiary who continues
employment with Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the
Surviving Corporation (including the Company) after the Closing Date (a
"Continuing Employee") will be "at will" employment, except as otherwise
provided under applicable Law.

     (b) The Parties agree that the Company shall be responsible for any
required notices and other obligations under the WARN Act or any comparable Law
for any terminations by it up to and including the date and time of Closing, and
the Buyer shall be responsible for any required notices and any other
obligations under the WARN Act or any comparable Law for any terminations by it
after the date and time of Closing.

     8.3 Replacement of Letters of Credit. Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall (i)
make arrangements to obtain as of the Closing Date one or more letters of credit
to replace each of the existing letters of credit set forth on Schedule 8.3 (and
any replacements thereof obtained by the Company prior to the Closing), such
replacement letters of credit to be in a form and substance acceptable to the
intended beneficiaries thereof and (ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain the release of the letters of credit set forth on Schedule 8.3 (or any
replacements thereof obtained by the Company prior to the Closing) from the
beneficiaries thereof, such release to take effect as of the Closing Date or
cash collateralize such letters of credit until such letters of credit shall be
so released by the beneficiaries thereof.

     8.4 Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Subject to the terms and conditions
herein provided, Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective the Transactions. Without limiting the foregoing, no later than the
tenth business day after the date of this Agreement, Buyer and Merger Sub will
make all filings and submissions required by them under any Law applicable to
Buyer or Merger Sub required for the consummation of the Merger and the
Transactions, if any. Buyer and Merger Sub will use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain an early termination of any applicable waiting
period under, and will make any additional filings required pursuant to, any
applicable Laws.

     8.5 Access to Information. In connection with Buyer's and its authorized
representatives' obtaining access, pursuant to Section 6.6 hereunder, to the
facilities, offices, properties, technology, processes, books, business and
financial records, officers, business plans, budgets and projections,
information in the possession of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect
to their customers and other information of each of the Company and the
Subsidiaries, and the workpapers of Ernst & Young LLP, the Company's independent
accountants, Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to attempt to
minimize the disruption of the ongoing business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries caused by any such access.

     (a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Buyer;

     (b) at the election of the Company or Buyer on or after December 28, 2006,
if the Closing shall not have occurred by the close of business on such date,
provided that the terminating party is not in default of any of its obligations
hereunder such that there would be a failure of condition under Section 9.2(a)
or (b) or Section 9.3(a) or (b), as the case may be, if the Closing were to

     (e) by the Company, if (A) the Company will have delivered to Buyer a
written notice of the Company's intent to enter into a merger, acquisition or
other agreement (including an agreement in principle) to effect a Superior
Proposal based on an Acquisition Proposal received by it, (B) five business days
have elapsed following delivery to Buyer of such written notice by the Company,
(C) during such five business-day period the Company has fully cooperated with
Buyer, including, without limitation, informing Buyer of the terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal, with the intent of enabling Buyer to agree to a
modification of the terms and conditions


                                       70

<PAGE>

of this Agreement so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be effected,
(D) at the end of such five business-day period the Board of Directors of the
Company will have reasonably concluded that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, (E) the Company pays to Buyer an amount equal
to the aggregate of all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Buyer in connection
with the Transactions (including, without limitation, travel expenses of Buyer
personnel and fees and disbursements of external advisors to Buyer), and (F) the
Company will have entered into a merger, acquisition or other agreement
(including an agreement in principle) to effect a Superior Proposal or the Board
of Directors of the Company will have resolved to do so; or

     (f) if the party seeking to terminate is not then in material breach of

notice of such breach by Buyer to the Company, (ii) by the Company, if there has
been a material breach by Buyer or Merger Sub of any of their respective

such breach by the Company to Buyer, or (iii) by any party if any of the
conditions to its obligations to consummate the Merger and the Transactions set
forth in Article IX shall have become impossible to satisfy and such
impossibility is not due to its own action or omission.

     10.2 Procedure Upon Termination. In the event of termination by Buyer or
the Company, or both, pursuant to Section 10.1, written notice thereof shall
forthwith be given to the other party or parties, and this Agreement shall
terminate, and the Merger and the Transactions shall be abandoned, without
further action by Buyer or the Company. If this Agreement is terminated as
provided herein each party shall return all documents, work papers and other
material of any other party relating to the Merger and the Transactions, whether
obtained before or after the execution hereof, to the party furnishing the same.

     10.3 Effect of Termination. In the event that this Agreement is validly
terminated as provided herein, then each of the parties shall be relieved of
their duties and obligations arising under this Agreement after the date of such
termination and such termination shall be without Liability to Buyer, Merger Sub
or the Company; provided, however, that all obligations of the parties under
this Agreement will terminate except that the provisions of (i) Section 6.6
(pre-closing access to information); (ii) Article XIII; (iii) Sections 10.2
(procedure upon termination); and this Section 10.3 (effect of termination) will
survive indefinitely unless sooner terminated or modified by the parties in
writing; provided, further, however, that, to the extent this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 10.1(f)(i) or (ii), nothing in this Section 10.3
shall relieve any party hereto from any Liability for a material breach of this
Agreement which resulted in such termination.

                              XI. INDEMNIFICATION

     11.1 Survival of Representation and Warranties. Notwithstanding any
investigation made by or on behalf of any of the parties hereto or the results
of any such investigation and notwithstanding the participation of such party in
the Closing, the representations and warranties of each of Buyer, Merger Sub and
the Company contained in this Agreement shall survive the


                                       71

<PAGE>

Closing and the Effective Time and such representations and warranties shall
terminate at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the second anniversary of the
Closing Date; provided, however, (i) the representations and warranties set
forth in Sections 4.12 and 4.21 shall survive the Closing until, and shall
terminate at, 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the third anniversary of the
Closing Date (each, an "Indemnity Cut-Off Date"). Any claim for indemnification
made under Section 11.2 which is not asserted by notice in writing given as
herein provided relating thereto within the above-specified period of survival
may not be pursued and is hereby irrevocably waived after the applicable

and acknowledging that Buyer and Merger Sub are relying on the indemnification
provided in this Section 11.2 in executing and performing this Agreement, the

against:

          (i) subject to Section 11.1, any and all Losses resulting from,
     arising from, relating to or constituting the failure of any representation

     (d) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary:

          (i) the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be indemnified under
     Section 11.2(c) with respect to any Losses or Taxes for any Taxable Period
     that begins after the Closing Date, including without limitation, the
     portion of any Straddle Period that begins after the Closing Date; and

          (ii) the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be indemnified under
     Section 11.2(c) with respect to any Losses or Taxes that would not have
     been generated but for any election made by the Buyer under Section 338(g)
     of the Code with respect to the Company and one or more Tax Affiliates.

     (e) Subject to Sections 11.3 and 11.4 below, Buyer and the Surviving
Corporation hereby, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold the
Equity Holders and the Representative and their respective officers, directors,
employees and successors and assigns (collectively, the "Equity Holders
Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against:

          (i) subject to Section 11.1, any and all Losses resulting from,
     arising from, relating to or constituting the failure of any representation
     or warranty of Buyer or Merger Sub set forth in Article V to be true and
     correct as of the date made; and

          (ii) any and all Losses resulting from, arising from, relating to or
     constituting the breach of any covenant or other agreement on the part of
     Buyer or Merger Sub under this Agreement.

     (f) Notice of all claims made by any Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to
this Article XI shall be given exclusively to the Representative, not in its
personal capacity, but solely in its capacity as the representative of the
Equity Holders, and the Representative shall have full and exclusive power and
authority to represent the interests of the Equity Holders in respect of such
claims. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no Buyer
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to make any claim for indemnification under
this Article XI against the Representative or any Equity Holder.

     (g) To the extent that Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary
suffers any Losses for which it is entitled to be indemnified under Section
11.2(a), then (without limiting any of the rights of the Surviving Corporation
or such Subsidiary as a Buyer Indemnified Party, but in any event without
duplication) Buyer shall be entitled to make an indemnification claim for such
Losses on behalf of the Surviving Corporation or such Subsidiary.

     11.3 Limits on Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary:

     (a) no indemnified party shall be entitled to indemnification under
Sections 11.2(b)(i), 11.2(c) or 11.2(e)(i) unless the aggregate amount of all
Losses to the Equity Holders Indemnified Parties or the Buyer Indemnified
Parties, as applicable, finally determined to arise thereunder exceeds
$2,500,000 (the "Basket Amount"), and then only to the extent of the aggregate
Losses which exceed that amount; provided that (i) for the purpose of
calculating the Losses to the Buyer Indemnified Parties herein any materiality
or Material Adverse Effect qualifications in the representations and warranties
set forth in Article IV shall be disregarded,


                                       73

<PAGE>

and (ii) any obligation to pay the Initial Merger Consideration or any
Subsequent Merger Consideration, and indemnification for any breach of the
representations set forth in Sections 4.29 and 5.4 shall not be entitled to the
benefit of the Basket Amount;

     (b) no Party shall be indemnified for any Losses under Sections 11.2(b),
11.2(c) or 11.2(e) to the extent (i) that such Party receives or is entitled to
receive any insurance proceeds or other amounts from third parties in respect of
such Losses or (ii) of the Tax Benefits allowable with respect to such Losses;

     (c) to avoid double-counting as to any matter, the term "Losses" shall not
include any Loss suffered with respect to any Liability or obligation of the
Company or any Subsidiary, to the extent that such Liability or obligation (or a
reserve therefor (to the extent of such reserve)) is reflected in any of the
Closing Statements, or, in the event of any dispute with respect thereto, in
accordance with the final determination of such dispute, even if the events,
facts or circumstances giving rise to such Loss would also constitute a breach
of any of the Company's representations or warranties hereunder;

     (d) claims by Buyer Indemnified Parties against the Indemnity Escrow
Account for indemnification for any Losses shall be made on or prior to the
applicable Indemnity Cut-Off Date. Any claim made for indemnification for Losses
which is not asserted by notice in writing given as herein provided relating
thereto within such time period may not be pursued and is hereby irrevocably
waived after such time;

     (e) no Party shall be entitled to indemnification under any Section of this
Agreement in respect of any Loss unless the amount of such Loss exceeds $30,000;
provided that any and all Losses for which indemnification is excluded under
this Section 11.3(e) shall be counted in determining whether the Basket Amount
has been reached.

     11.4 Exclusive Remedy.

     (a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties
acknowledge and agree that the sole recourse of the Buyer Indemnified Parties
for any claim under this Article XI that is validly established shall be to make
claims against and to collect amounts solely from the Indemnity Escrow Account
(all as more particularly set forth in the Escrow Agreement and this Article
XI), to the extent of the amounts remaining therein, and the Buyer Indemnified
Parties shall have no other recourse against the Representative or the Equity
Holders or any of their respective assets and properties for any such claim. No
claim against any of the Equity Holders or the Representative in respect of the
Transactions shall be available or be asserted, and none of such Persons shall
have any Liability of any nature whatsoever to any of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties, other than for their respective interests in the Indemnity Escrow
Account.

     (b) Prior to or in connection with the Closing, the parties will have
available to them all remedies available under Law, including specific
performance or other equitable remedies. The parties agree that, after the
Closing, their respective remedies under this Article XI are their exclusive
remedies under this Agreement, including without limitation with respect to any
matter based on the inaccuracy, untruth, incompleteness or breach of any
representation or warranty of any party hereto contained herein or based upon
the failure to perform any covenant, agreement


                                       74

<PAGE>

or undertaking herein. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing
in this Agreement will prevent any party from bringing an action, other than
under this Article XI, based upon allegations of fraud by any other party in
connection with this Agreement.

     11.5 General Indemnification Procedures.

     (a) Subject to Section 11.5(e), in the event that any Legal Proceedings
shall be instituted or that any claim or demand shall be asserted by any Third
Party (a "Third Party Claim") in respect of which indemnification may be sought
under Section 11.2, any indemnified party shall reasonably and promptly cause
written notice of the assertion of any Third Party Claim of which it has or
obtains knowledge which is covered by this indemnity to be forwarded to the
indemnifying party. Such notice shall identify specifically the basis under
which indemnification is sought pursuant to Section 11.2 and enclose true and
correct copies of any written document furnished to the indemnified party by the
Person that instituted the Third Party Claim. The indemnifying party shall have
the right to defend against, negotiate or otherwise deal with such Third Party
Claim. The indemnified party may, at its own cost, participate in the
investigation, trial and defense of such claim, any lawsuit or action arising
therefrom and any appeal thereof; provided, however, if the named parties to the
action or proceeding include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified
party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be
inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct, the expense of
separate counsel for the indemnified party shall be paid by the indemnifying
party, but the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the reasonable fees
and expenses of more than one separate counsel (and one local counsel in each
applicable jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction in which the primary claim,
lawsuit or action is being conducted). If the indemnifying party fails to assume
the defense of such claim within thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice of
a Third Party Claim (or such earlier date, if the failure to assume the defense
on such earlier date would materially impair the ability of such indemnified
party to defend such claim), or if the indemnifying party fails to diligently
conduct the defense of such claims, the indemnified party against which such
claim has been asserted will (upon delivering notice to such effect to the
indemnifying party) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or
settlement of such claim (all at the cost and expense of the indemnifying party)
and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate therein at its
own cost. If the indemnifying party is the Representative, acting on behalf of
the Equity Holders hereunder, and has assumed the obligation to defend,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim, all expenses
incurred by the Representative in defending against, negotiating, settling or
otherwise dealing with such Third Party Claim shall be paid out of the Indemnity
Escrow Account established therefor under the Escrow Agreement and, to the
extent that there are sufficient funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account, the
Representative and Buyer shall instruct the Escrow Agent to make the required
payment to the indemnifying party out of the Indemnity Escrow Account and, to
the extent that there are insufficient funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account,
such expenses shall be paid by Buyer. The parties hereto agree to cooperate
fully with each other in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement
of any such Third Party Claim; provided, that such cooperation will not unduly
disrupt the operations of the business of the Buyer Indemnified Party (other
than the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) or cause the Buyer
Indemnified Party (other than the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to
breach any confidentiality obligations owed to third parties. The party
defending such Third Party Claim shall promptly supply to the other party copies
of all correspondence and documents relating to or in connection


                                       75

<PAGE>

with such Third Party Claim and keep the other party fully informed of all
developments relating to or in connection with such Third Party Claim
(including, without limitation, providing to the other party on request updates
and summaries as to the status thereof).

     (b) Neither the indemnified party nor the indemnifying party may concede,
settle or compromise any Third Party Claim without the consent of the other
party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
unless (A) such concession, settlement or compromise shall constitute a complete
or unconditional discharge and release of all parties indemnified hereunder, (B)
such judgment, discharge, settlement or compromise shall provide for no relief
other than the payment of monetary damages and the Indemnity Escrow Amount shall
be sufficient pay such monetary damages in full, and (C) no indemnified party
shall be required to admit criminal liability. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(i) if a Third Party Claim seeks the issuance of an injunction, the specific
election of an obligation or similar remedy against a Buyer Indemnified Party or
(ii) if the subject matter of a Third Party Claim relates to the ongoing
business of any Buyer Indemnified Party, which Third Party Claim, if decided
against any Buyer Indemnified Party, would materially adversely affect the
ongoing business or reputation of any Buyer Indemnified Party, the Buyer
Indemnified Party alone will be entitled to settle such Third Party Claim
(provided that no such settlement shall be evidence of Losses incurred by such
party) in the first instance and, if the Buyer Indemnified Party does not settle
such Third Party Claim, the Representative will then have the right to contest
and defend (but not settle) such Claim; provided that if Representative presents
a settlement of such claim to the Buyer Indemnified Party and the Buyer
Indemnified Party refuses to consent to such settlement, subsequent expenses in
respect of such claim and amounts payable with respect thereto in excess of the
amount of such settlement shall not be Losses.

     (c) With respect to claims for indemnification pursuant to this Article XI
other than Third Party Claims, the indemnified party shall promptly notify in
writing the indemnifying party of such claims of which it has or obtains
knowledge.

     (d) Subject to Section 11.5(e), no later than ten (10) Business Days after
any final judgment or award shall have been rendered by a court, arbitration
board or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of
the time in which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall have been
consummated, or the indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall have
arrived at a mutually binding agreement with respect to a claim hereunder, the
indemnifying party shall pay the amounts, if any, due and owing by the
indemnifying party to the indemnified party by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by the indemnified party.

     (e) All indemnity payments required under this Section 11.5 to be made by
the Representative, acting on behalf of the Equity Holders as indemnifying party
hereunder, to the indemnified party in respect of such claim (including without
limitation any reimbursement of expenses) shall be paid exclusively out of, and
with recourse limited to, the Indemnity Escrow Account, and to the extent that
there are sufficient funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account the Representative
and Buyer shall instruct the Escrow Agent to make such payments to the
indemnified party out of the Indemnity Escrow Account. All cost and expenses
required under this Section 11.5 to be borne by the Representative, acting on
behalf of the Equity Holders as indemnifying party hereunder (including all
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of counsel


                                       76

<PAGE>

to the Representative), which are incurred with respect to any Third Party Claim
which is being defended, negotiated or settled, or otherwise dealt with, by the
Representative at the request of the indemnified party, shall be paid out of the
Indemnity Escrow Account, and (i) to the extent that there are sufficient funds
in the Indemnity Escrow Account, the Representative and Buyer shall instruct the
Escrow Agent to advance all funds required to cover all such costs and expenses
out of the Indemnity Escrow Account to the Representative and (ii) to the extent
that there are insufficient funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account, Buyer shall
advance all funds required to cover the balance of such costs and expenses to
the Representative. The Representative, acting on behalf of the Equity Holders
as indemnifying party hereunder, shall be entitled (i) to decline any request of
any Buyer Indemnified Party to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise
deal with any Third Party Claim unless and until all cost and expenses referred
to in the immediately preceding sentence are advanced to the Representative and
(ii) at any time cease to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal
with any such Third Party Claim if all such cost and expenses are not advanced
by the Escrow Agent or Buyer to the Representative after a request therefor is
made in writing by the Representative.

     11.6 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. The parties hereto agree to treat
any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Article XI as an adjustment to the
Merger Consideration for federal, state, local and foreign income Tax purposes
to the extent permitted by Law.

     12.2 Payments of Expenses; Holdbacks.

     (a) The Representative shall withhold and retain from the Payment Fund, and
shall have the right to withhold and retain from the funds distributed by the
Escrow Agent to the Representative from the Indemnity Escrow Account, the

the Representative shall be authorized to withdraw funds from the Expense
Account (including such costs and expenses which are required to be paid or
borne by the Equity Holders pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and
the Environmental Escrow Agreement), which Expense Account shall be maintained

investments of funds in the Expense Account shall be deposited in the Expense
Account. In the sole and absolute discretion of the Representative, any amounts
on deposit in the Expense Account, including, without limitation, any income
earned from investments of funds in the Expense Account, may be distributed from
time-to-time by the Representative to the Equity Holders in accordance with
their respective Percentage Interests. Upon the final distribution of any
remaining amounts in the Indemnity Escrow Account and the Environmental Escrow
Account to the Equity Holders and the termination of each of the Escrow

incurred by the Representative, shall be distributed to the Equity Holders in
accordance with their respective Percentage Interests.

     12.3 Percentage Interests, Disbursements.

     (a) All payments to Equity Holders out of the Payment Fund by the
Representative hereunder, and all sums, proceeds and other property held by the
Representative, on behalf of the Equity Holders, and all deductions or other
setoffs from such payments or other proceeds, shall be allocated among them in
accordance with their respective Percentage Interests.

     (b) All monies or other proceeds deposited into the Payment Fund or
received by the Representative for distribution to Equity Holders shall be
distributed by the Representative as promptly as practicable to each Equity
Holder in accordance with its Percentage Interest, subject,

contemplated by the provisions of this Article XII and to withhold amounts under
Section 3.6.

     12.4 Bank Accounts; Investments.

     (a) The Representative shall have the right to open such account or
accounts in its own name as the Representative in any bank or trust company as
it may select in order to deposit all sums that it may receive and hold
hereunder and to issue checks or draw money upon the signature of any
then-acting Representative (or the signature of one or more persons the
Representative may designate) on each such account.

     (b) The Representative shall have the right to invest and reinvest any of
the proceeds held by it under the terms of this Agreement (including sums held
in the Expense Account) in investments only of a type which the Escrow Agent is
permitted to make pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. Any securities or other
property at any time held by the Representative may be held by it in bearer or
registered form or in the name of any other person or persons it may designate,
and the Representative may deal with such securities or other property to the
same extent and with the same powers as an individual owner thereof might do.
Except to the extent provided in Section 12.5(b)(i), the Representative shall
have no responsibility or obligation whatsoever to any Equity Holder or to any
other party for the performance of any investments made in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement or for any losses realized by any thereof.

     12.5 Compensation; Exculpation; Indemnity; Security.

     (a) The Representative shall not be entitled to any fee, commission or
other compensation for the performance of its services hereunder, but shall be
entitled to the payment of all its expenses incurred as the Representative
(including, without limitation, a reasonable allocation of the amount of salary
and other employment expenses paid to employees of the Representative actually
engaged in the exercise of any of the powers conferred upon the Representative
hereunder), and in furtherance of the foregoing, may pay or cause to be paid or
reimburse itself for the payment of any and all such expenses, or may draw
advances in respect of anticipated expenses, from the Expense Account. The
Representative shall provide to the Equity Holders a breakdown of expenses
deducted from the Expense Account.

     (b) In dealing with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Environmental
Escrow Agreement and any instruments, agreements or documents relating thereto,
and in exercising or failing to exercise all or any of the powers conferred upon
the Representative hereunder, (i) the Representative assumes and shall incur no
responsibility whatsoever by reason of any error in judgment or other act or
omission performed or omitted hereunder or in connection with the Escrow
Agreement, the Environmental Escrow Agreement or any such other agreement,
instrument or document, excepting only responsibility for any act or failure to
act which constitutes willful misconduct, and (ii) the Representative shall be
entitled to rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other
independent experts experienced in the matter at issue, and any error in
judgment or other act or omission of the Representative pursuant to such advice
shall in no event subject the Representative to liability to any Equity Holder,
the Company, Buyer, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or any other Person.


                                       81

     (c) Each Equity Holder, severally, shall indemnify the Representative
against all damages, liabilities, claims, obligations, costs and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys', accountants' and other experts' fees and the
amount of any judgment against the Representative, of any nature whatsoever,
arising out of or in connection with any claim, investigation, challenge, action
or proceeding or in connection with any appeal thereof, relating to the acts or
omissions of the Representative hereunder, or under the Escrow Agreement or the
Environmental Escrow Agreement or otherwise; provided, however, that the
aggregate amount which any Equity Holder may be liable to indemnify the
Representative under this Section 12.5(c) shall not exceed the aggregate Merger
Consideration paid or payable to such Equity Holder hereunder, and the
Representative shall be entitled to withhold and retain from amounts otherwise
payable to such Equity Holder hereunder any amount required to satisfy such
Equity Holder's indemnification obligations hereunder. The foregoing
indemnification shall not be deemed exclusive of any other right to which the
Representative may be entitled apart from the provisions hereof. The foregoing
indemnification shall not apply in the event of any action or proceeding which
finally adjudicates the liability of the Representative hereunder for its
willful misconduct. In the event of any indemnification under this Section
12.5(c), the Representative shall first proceed against any amounts then on
deposit in the Expense Account. Thereafter, upon written notice from the
Representative to the Equity Holders as to the existence of a deficiency toward
the payment of any such indemnification amount, each Equity Holder shall
promptly deliver to the Representative full payment of his or her ratable share
of the amount of such deficiency, in accordance with such Equity Holder's
Percentage Interest.

     (d) Subject to Section 12.5(c) above, to the extent that the
Representative, in its sole and absolute discretion, shall deem the amount then
on deposit in the Expense Account to be inadequate, the Representative may
require security and indemnity satisfactory to it to be provided by the Equity
Holders against costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in connection
with any action or actions proposed to be taken by the Representative, and the
Representative shall be entitled to withhold and retain from amounts otherwise
payable to any Equity Holder hereunder any amount required to satisfy such
Equity Holder's indemnification obligation hereunder. The Representative shall
be under no obligation to proceed with any such proposed action (and shall incur
no liability whatsoever for its failure to so proceed) in the absence of such
security.

     (e) All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the
Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Closing and/or any
termination of this Agreement and/or the Escrow Agreement and/or the
Environmental Escrow Agreement.

     (f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither Buyer, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Corporation nor the Company shall have any responsibility or
obligation whatsoever to any Equity Holder or to any other party with respect to
or arising out of any actions taken or any inaction by the Representative. Each
of Buyer and the Surviving Corporation may rely entirely on its dealings with,
and notices to and from, the Representative to satisfy any obligations it might
have under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Environmental Escrow
Agreement or any other agreement referred to in this Agreement or otherwise to
the Equity Holders.

     12.6 Successor Representative; Termination of Representative.

     (a) In the event the original Representative shall be unable or unavailable
to perform its duties hereunder, the Representative shall name a successor
Representative that shall have all of the authority and responsibilities
conferred upon or delegated to the Representative pursuant to this Article XII.
In the event the Representative becomes unwilling to continue in its capacity
hereunder, the Representative may resign at any time and be discharged from its
duties or obligations hereunder by giving a written resignation to Buyer and the
Equity Holders, specifying the date when such resignation shall take effect;
provided, however, that Representative will give not less than thirty (30) days
prior written notice of such resignation and that no such resignation shall
become effective until the Representative appoints its successor Representative
and such successor Representative accepts such appointment.

     (b) Upon the later of: (i) the date on which all of the funds in the
Indemnity Escrow Account, the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account and the
Environmental Escrow Account are distributed to the Equity Holders or Buyer, as
applicable, in accordance with the terms hereof and of the Escrow Agreement and
the Environmental Escrow Agreement; and (ii) the date on which all of the Equity
Holders' indemnification obligations under Section 11.1 shall have expired in
accordance with such Section, the Representative shall be entitled to resign at
any time upon giving written notice to Buyer and the Equity Holders not less
than ten (10) Business Days prior to such resignation, and upon the
effectiveness of such resignation, the provisions of this Article XII, and the
corresponding rights and obligations of the Representative under this Agreement,
shall expire automatically; provided, however, that such resignation shall not
have the effect of releasing the Representative from (x) any obligation under
this Agreement existing as of the date of such resignation or (y) any liability
to which the Representative would otherwise be subject for any act or omission
prior to such resignation which constitutes willful misconduct.

     12.7 No Third Party Rights. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement or elsewhere to the contrary, no Person or Persons other than the
Representative (and its successors) shall (i) be entitled to exercise any of the
rights or powers of the Representative hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement
or the Environmental Escrow Agreement, (ii) have any access whatsoever to the
Expense Account, (iii) have any right to make a call or demand upon any of the
Equity Holders (including the Representative) to contribute any amounts to cover
expenses or otherwise, or (iv) as a result of the provisions of this Article XII
have any claims or rights against any of the Equity Holders (including the
Representative) other than any claims or rights that would exist in any event
absent the provisions of this Article XII.

                                 XIII. GENERAL

     13.1 Public Statements. The Company and its Subsidiaries, agree that, from
the date hereof through the Closing Date, no public release or announcement
concerning the Merger and the Transactions shall be issued or made by any party
without the prior consent of the other party or parties (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except (a) as such release or
announcement may be required by Law, in which case the party required to make
the release or announcement shall allow, to the extent reasonably practicable,
the other party or parties reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such


                                       83

<PAGE>

issuance, and (b) that each of the Company and its Subsidiaries may make such an
announcement to their respective employees after consultation with the other
parties.

     13.2 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided for in this
Agreement, the Company, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, will each
pay all expenses incurred by each of them in connection with the Transactions,
including legal, accounting, investment banking and consulting fees and expenses
incurred in negotiating, executing and delivering this Agreement and the other
agreements, exhibits, documents and instruments contemplated by this Agreement
(whether the Transactions are consummated or not). Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has borne or will bear any of the expenses of its shareholders in
connection with the Transactions. The Company will pay all amounts payable to
the title insurer in respect of the title commitments, copies of exceptions and
title policies, including premiums (including premiums for endorsements), search
fees and closing fees, and amounts payable to surveyors. Buyer will pay one-half
and the Company will pay one-half of (a) the HSR Act filing fee and other filing
fees relating to the Antitrust Clearance and (b) the fees and expenses of the
Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement and the Environmental Escrow Agreement.

     13.3 Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement may not be amended, a provision
of this Agreement or any default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or
agreement under this Agreement be waived, and a consent may not be rendered,
except in a writing executed by the party against which such action is sought to
be enforced. Neither the failure nor any delay by any Person in exercising any
right, power or privilege under this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such
right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right,
power or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right,
power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. In
addition, no course of dealing between or among any Persons having any interest
in this Agreement will be deemed effective to modify or amend any part of this
Agreement or any rights or obligations of any Person under or by reason of this
Agreement. The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are
cumulative and not alternative.

     13.4 Notices. All notices, demands and other communications to be given or
delivered under or by reason of the provisions of this Agreement will be in
writing and will be deemed to have been given (i) when delivered if personally
delivered by hand (with written confirmation of receipt), (ii) when received if
sent by a nationally recognized overnight courier service (receipt requested),
(iii) five (5) business days after being mailed, if sent by first class mail,
return receipt requested, or (iv) when receipt is acknowledged by an affirmative
act of the party receiving notice, if sent by facsimile, telecopy or other
electronic transmission device (provided that such an acknowledgement does not
include an acknowledgment generated automatically by a facsimile or telecopy
machine or other electronic transmission device). Notices, demands and

     13.5 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned by any party to this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other parties to this Agreement;
provided, that in the case of any proposed assignment by Buyer of its rights
under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates, the Company shall not
unreasonably withhold its written consent to such assignment; and provided,
further, that Buyer may assign any of its rights under this Agreement to either
Robert Bosch GmbH or Robert Bosch Corporation without the prior consent of the
Company. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement and all of the provisions of
this Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties to
this Agreement and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

     13.6 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing expressed or referred to in this
Agreement confers any rights or remedies upon any Person that is not a party or
permitted assign of a party to this Agreement.

     13.7 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law,
but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid
under applicable Law, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent of
such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such
provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

     13.8 Complete Agreement. This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and,
when executed and delivered, the Ancillary Agreements, contain the complete
agreement between the parties and supersede any prior understandings, agreements
or representations by or between the parties, written or oral. The Company
acknowledges that Buyer has made no representations, warranties, agreements,
undertakings or promises except for those expressly set forth in this Agreement
or in agreements referred to herein that survive the execution and delivery of
this Agreement. Buyer acknowledges that the Company has made no representations,
warranties, agreements, undertakings or promises except for those expressly set
forth in this Agreement or in agreements referred to herein that survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement.

     13.9 Disclosure Schedules. The Disclosure Schedule contains a series of
schedules corresponding to the Sections contained in Article IV. Reference in
Article IV to "Schedule [ ]" shall mean the portion of the Disclosure Schedule
corresponding to a Section of this Agreement. Information disclosed in a Section
of the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to apply to each other Section of
this Agreement to which its relevance is reasonably apparent on its face. The
fact that any item of information is disclosed in any Disclosure Schedule shall
not be construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by
this Agreement. Such information and the dollar thresholds set forth herein
shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the terms "material" or "Material
Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in this Agreement, and will not be


                                       86

<PAGE>

deemed an admission by any party that such listed matter is material or that
such listed matter has or would have a Material Adverse Effect.

     13.10 Signatures; Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signatures of more than
one party, but all such counterparts taken together will constitute one and the
same instrument. A facsimile signature will be considered an original signature.

     13.11 Governing Law. THE DOMESTIC LAW, WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS
PRINCIPLES, OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WILL GOVERN ALL QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE
CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY AND INTERPRETATION OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE PERFORMANCE
OF THE OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

     13.12 Specific Performance. Each of the Company and the Representative
acknowledges and agrees that the subject matter of this Agreement, including the
business, assets and properties of the Company and the Subsidiaries, is unique,
that Buyer would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the provisions of
this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
otherwise are breached, and that the remedies at law would not be adequate to
compensate Buyer not in default or in breach. Accordingly, each of the Company
and the Representative agrees that Buyer will be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in addition to any other remedy to which Buyer may be entitled, at law
or in equity (without any requirement that Buyer provides any bond or other
security). The Company and the Representative waive any defense that a remedy at
law is adequate and any requirement to post bond or provide similar security in
connection with actions instituted for injunctive relief or specific performance
of this Agreement.

     13.13 Jurisdiction. Subject to the procedures specified in Article III,
each of the parties submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or
federal court sitting in The Borough of Manhattan of The City of New York, New
York, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement
and agrees that all claims in respect of the action or proceeding may be heard
and determined in any such court. Each party also agrees not to bring any action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other court.
Each of the parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance
of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other
security that might be required of any other party with respect to any such
action or proceeding. Any party may make service on any other party by sending
or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at the address set
forth in Section 13.4. The parties agree that either or both of them may file a
copy of this paragraph with any court as written evidence of the knowing,
voluntary and bargained agreement between the parties irrevocably to waive any
objections to venue or to convenience of forum. Nothing in this Section 13.13
will affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by law or in equity.

     13.14 Construction. The parties and their respective counsel have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In
addition, each of the parties acknowledges that it is sophisticated and has been
advised by experienced counsel and, to the extent it deemed


                                       87

<PAGE>

necessary, other advisors in connection with the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed as if drafted jointly by
the parties and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement. The parties intend that each representation, warranty and
agreement contained in this Agreement will have independent significance. If any
party has breached any representation, warranty or agreement in any respect, the
fact that there exists another representation, warranty or agreement relating to
the same subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) that
the party has not breached will not detract from or mitigate the fact that the
party is in breach of the first representation, warranty or agreement. Any
reference to any Law will be deemed to refer to all rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. The headings
preceding the text of Articles and Sections included in this Agreement and the
headings to the schedules and exhibits are for convenience only and are not be
deemed part of this Agreement or given effect in interpreting this Agreement.
References to Sections, articles, schedules or exhibits are to the sections,
articles, schedules and exhibits contained in, referred to or attached to this
Agreement, unless otherwise specified. The word "including" means "including
without limitation." A statement that an action has not occurred in the past
means that it is also not presently occurring. When any party may take any
permissive action, including the granting of a consent, the waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or otherwise, whether to take such action is in its
sole and absolute discretion. The use of the masculine, feminine or neuter
gender or the singular or plural form of words will not limit any provisions of
this Agreement. A statement that an item is listed, set forth disclosed or
described means that it is correctly listed, set forth disclosed or described,
and a statement that a copy of an item has been delivered means a true and
correct copy of the item has been delivered.

     13.15 Time of Essence. With regard to all dates and time periods set forth
or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

                            [Signature pages follow.]

Capital Expenditure Amount in accordance with Section 3.5 of the Merger
Agreement, Buyer and the Representative shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a

                                   ARTICLE III

                     DISTRIBUTION OF INDEMNITY ESCROW FUNDS

     3.1 Indemnity Claims. Subject to Article XI of the Merger Agreement, at any
time prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the applicable Indemnity Cut-Off
Date, Buyer may give the Escrow Agent and the Representative written notice in
substantially the form of Exhibit C (an "Indemnity Claim Notice") of a claim for
which a Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to
Article XI of the Merger Agreement. If the Representative does not give the
Escrow Agent and Buyer a written notice of disagreement (an "Indemnity Claim
Dispute Notice") with any matter or amount set forth in an Indemnity Claim
Notice within thirty (30) Business Days of the date of such Indemnity Claim
Notice, then the Escrow Agent shall, within ten (10) Business Days following the
thirtieth (30th) Business Day after the date of the Indemnity Claim Notice,
release the amount of the Indemnity Escrow Amount set forth in the Indemnity
Claim Notice (together with accrued interest and other income earned thereon
from the Closing Date to the applicable payment date), and pay such amount in
the manner directed by Buyer. In the event that the Representative shall give to
the Escrow Agent an Indemnity Claim Dispute Notice at any time during such
thirty (30) Business Day period, then the provisions of Section 4.4 shall apply
with respect to the amount set forth therein. An indemnification claim as to
which an Indemnity Claim Dispute Notice has been given and which has not been
resolved pursuant to Section 4.4 of this Agreement is referred to hereinafter as
an "Unresolved Indemnity Claim".

     3.2 Partial Release of Indemnity Escrow Funds.

          (a) Buyer and the Representative shall deliver a joint written notice
instructing the Escrow Agent to immediately release from the Indemnity Escrow
Account and deposit into the Payment Fund: (i) on the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, the lesser of (A) $2,000,000 or (B) the Indemnity Escrow Amount as
of such date minus the aggregate dollar amount of all Unresolved Indemnity
Claims; and (ii) on the second anniversary of the Closing Date, the lesser of
(A) $2,000,000 or (B) the Indemnity Escrow Amount as of such date minus the
aggregate dollar amount of all Unresolved Indemnity Claims, in each case,
together with accrued interest and other income earned thereon.

          (b) On the last applicable Indemnity Cut-Off Date, Buyer and the
Representative shall deliver a joint written notice instructing the Escrow Agent
to release from the Indemnity Escrow Account and deposit into the Payment Fund
the remaining balance of funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account; provided,
however, that if, at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day
immediately preceding the last applicable Indemnity Cut-Off Date, any portion of
the Indemnity Escrow Amount is subject to one or more pending indemnification
claims that have been timely asserted in accordance with Article XI of the
Merger Agreement and have not been paid in full or otherwise finally settled or
adjudicated, or are subject to appeal or further proceedings, then an amount
equal to such portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount attributable to such claims
(including accrued interest and other income earned on each such amount in the
Indemnity Escrow Account from the Closing Date to the last applicable Indemnity
Cut-Off Date) shall be retained in the Indemnity Escrow Account until Buyer and
the Representative deliver a joint written notice notifying the Escrow Agent
that such claims are paid


                                       4

<PAGE>

in full or otherwise finally settled or adjudicated and no longer subject to
appeal or further proceedings.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                                  ESCROW AGENT

     4.1 Duties. The duties and obligations of the Escrow Agent shall be
determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement and shall be
limited to the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically
set forth in this Agreement, as it may be amended from time to time with the
Escrow Agent's written consent as provided in Section 5.8 hereof. The Escrow
Agent shall not have any liability under, nor duty to inquire into the terms and
provisions of any agreement or instruction, other than those set forth in, or
given pursuant to, this Agreement.

     4.2 Reliance. In the performance of its duties hereunder, the Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to rely, and shall be protected in acting or refraining from
acting, upon any document or instrument reasonably believed by it to be genuine
and signed by Buyer and/or the Representative, as applicable, and the Escrow
Agent shall be under no duty to inquire into or investigate the validity or
accuracy of any such document. The Escrow Agent may assume that any person
purporting to give any notice in accordance with the provisions hereof has been
duly authorized to do so.

     4.3 Liability. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any error of
judgment, or any action taken or omitted to be taken hereunder in good faith,
except in the case of its bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct. In
the administration of the Escrow Funds, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
consult with counsel of its choosing (including internal counsel). The Escrow
Agent shall not be liable for any act suffered or omitted by it in good faith in
accordance with the advice or opinion of such counsel.

     4.4 Disputes. In the event that the Escrow Agent shall receive an Indemnity
Claim Dispute Notice, the Escrow Agent shall not release any Escrow Funds with
respect to any matter covered by such notice until there shall have been a final
determination of the rights of the parties with respect to such matter, and then
only in accordance with the terms of such final determination. In the event that
the Escrow Agent shall otherwise be uncertain as to its duties or rights
hereunder, it shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action until such
time as there has been a final determination of the rights of the parties with
respect to the Escrow Funds (or relevant portion thereof). For purposes of this
Section 4.4, there shall be deemed to have been a final determination of the
rights of the parties at such time as (i) any final judgment or award shall have
been rendered by a court, arbitration board or administrative agency of
competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the time in which to appeal
therefrom, or (ii) a settlement shall have been consummated, or Buyer and the
Representative shall have arrived at a mutually binding agreement with respect
to a claim thereunder, and the Escrow Agent shall have been notified thereof in
a joint written direction from each of Buyer and the Representative.

     4.5 Resignation. The Escrow Agent may resign at any time and be discharged
of the duties imposed hereunder (but without prejudice for any liability in the
case of its bad faith,


                                       5

<PAGE>

gross negligence or willful misconduct hereunder) by giving notice to the
Representative and Buyer at least thirty (30) Business Days prior to the date
specified for such resignation to take effect, in which case, upon the effective
date of such resignation:

          (a)  all funds then held by the Escrow Agent hereunder shall be
               delivered by it to such Person as may be designated in writing
               jointly by Buyer and the Representative, whereupon the Escrow
               Agent's obligations hereunder shall cease and terminate;

          (b)  if no such person has been designated by such date, all
               obligations of the Escrow Agent hereunder shall, nevertheless,
               cease and terminate, subject to clause (c) below; and

          (c)  the Escrow Agent's sole responsibility thereafter shall be to
               keep all funds then held by it (and to make the investments as
               hereinbefore provided) and to deliver the same to the successor
               escrow agent designated jointly by Buyer and the Representative
               in writing or, if no such successor escrow agent shall have been
               so designated, in accordance with the directions of a final order
               or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction and the
               provisions of Section 4.7 and Section 4.8 shall remain in effect.

     Upon their receipt of notice of resignation from the Escrow Agent, Buyer
and the Representative shall use their reasonable best efforts jointly to
designate a successor escrow agent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the foregoing, the Escrow Agent or any successor escrow agent shall continue to
act as Escrow Agent until a successor is appointed and qualified to act as
escrow agent.

     4.6 Removal of Escrow Agent. Buyer and the Representative may, upon at
least thirty (30) Business Day's prior written notice to the Escrow Agent,
dismiss the Escrow Agent hereunder and appoint a successor. In such event, the
Escrow Agent shall promptly account for and deliver to the successor escrow
agent named in such notice the balance of the Escrow Funds. Upon acceptance
thereof and of such accounting by such successor escrow agent, and upon
reimbursement to the Escrow Agent of all expenses due to it hereunder through
the date of such accounting and delivery, the Escrow Agent shall be released and
discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder, but without
prejudice to any liability of the Escrow Agent for its bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct hereunder.

     4.7 Compensation. On the Closing Date and annually thereafter, Buyer and
the Representative shall each pay one-half of the Escrow Agent's $___________
annual fee (the "Annual Fee") in full satisfaction of its engagement fee and
compensation, without pro-ration for partial years. All amounts payable by the
Representative pursuant to this Section 4.7 shall be paid out of the Expense
Account to be maintained by the Representative under the Merger Agreement.

     4.8 Indemnification. The Escrow Agent and its directors, officers, agents
and employees (the "Indemnified Parties") shall be indemnified and held harmless
by each of the Representative and Buyer, severally and not jointly (with each
such indemnifying party liable up


                                       6

<PAGE>

to a maximum of 50%), against any loss, liability, claim, damage, injury, demand
or expense, including reasonable legal fees and expenses of in-house or outside
counsel arising out of or in connection with the performance of the Escrow
Agent's obligations hereunder or pursuant to any written instructions of Buyer
or the Representative given to the Escrow Agent pursuant to this Agreement,
including the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the collection of
its fees and including the costs and expenses of defending itself against any
claim or liability arising out of or in connection with the performance of its
duties hereunder, except for any loss, liability, claim, damage, injury, demand
or expense resulting from any of the Indemnified Parties' bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct; provided, however, that promptly after the
receipt by any of the Indemnified Parties of notice of any claim or the
commencement of any suit, action or proceeding, such Indemnified Party shall, if
a claim of indemnification in respect thereof is to be made against any of the
other parties hereto, notify such other parties thereof in writing; and
provided, further, however, that the indemnifying party or parties shall be
entitled, at their own expense, to participate in or assume the defense of any
such action, suit or proceeding. If the indemnifying party assumes control of
such defense and the indemnifying party and any of the Indemnified Parties have
a conflict of interest with respect to such suit, action or proceeding, such
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have separate legal representation in
respect thereof and the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Escrow
Agent shall be considered "damages" for the purposes of this Section 4.8. The
failure of any of the Indemnified Parties to provide written notification to an
indemnifying party shall not affect the rights of any of the Indemnified Parties
under this Section 4.8 except (and only to the extent that) the indemnifying
party incurs additional expenses or the indemnifying party is actually
prejudiced by reason of such failure to give timely notice. The right of any of
the Indemnified Parties (or any successor escrow agent appointed hereunder) to
indemnification under this Section 4.8 shall survive the termination of this
Agreement or the earlier removal or resignation of the Escrow Agent or the
termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall any of the Indemnified Parties be liable for
special, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever
(including but not limited to lost profits), even if such Indemnified Party has
been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form
of action. All amounts payable by the Representative pursuant to this Section
4.8 shall be paid out of the Indemnity Escrow Fund pursuant to a joint
instruction signed by the Representative and Buyer. The parties hereby grant the
Escrow Agent a lien on, right of set-off against and security interest in the
Escrow Fund for the payment of any claim for indemnification, compensation,
expenses and amounts due hereunder and payable by the Representative.

     4.9 Merger. Any corporation into which the Escrow Agent in its individual
capacity may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any
corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the
Escrow Agent in its individual capacity shall be a party, or any corporation to
which substantially all the corporate trust business of the Escrow Agent in its
individual capacity may be transferred, shall be the successor escrow agent
under this Agreement without further action, and the provisions of this
Agreement shall continue to apply to such successor escrow agent as if such
successor escrow agent was an original party hereto.

                                      TAXES

     5.1 The Escrow Agent shall timely report to the Buyer and the
Representative the aggregate amount of income earned, interest received and
gains recognized (collectively, the "Escrow Interest") from the investment of
the Escrow Funds on which taxes imposed on any such income, interest or gains
(such taxes, the "Escrow Taxes") are then due and payable and the Buyer shall
report the amount of such Escrow Interest to the appropriate taxing authorities
and shall pay the Escrow Taxes, in which event it may direct the Escrow Agent,
by a reasonably detailed written notice to it with a copy to the Representative,
to reimburse the Buyer in the amount of the Escrow Taxes out of the Escrow
Interest. In the event any portion of an Escrow Fund is to be paid to the Buyer
or deposited into the Payment Fund pursuant to Section 2.1, Section 3.1 or
Section 3.2, such amount shall be reduced (and the amount of such reduction
shall be paid over to the Buyer, but only to the extent not reimbursed to it
pursuant to the preceding sentence) by an amount equal to the product of (i) the
Escrow Taxes that are then due and payable and that the Buyer estimates (in a
reasonably detailed written notice to the Escrow Agent with a copy to the
Representative) will be due and payable with respect to the taxable period in
which such payment or deposit is made multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the amount otherwise to be paid to the Buyer or deposited
into the Payment Fund under this sentence, as the case may be, and the
denominator of which is the applicable Escrow Fund. The amount determined
pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be adjusted to the extent reasonably
practical to account for any duplication in payment and any timing differences
in payments into and disbursements from the Escrow Account. The provisions of
this Section 5.1 shall be interpreted and applied in a manner that is consistent
with the provisions of Section 3.4(a) of the Merger Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

     6.1 Term. This Agreement shall continue in force until the final
distribution of all amounts held by the Escrow Agent in escrow in accordance
with this Agreement.

     6.2 Notices. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be given
in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally, by registered or
certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested), by overnight courier
(providing proof of delivery), by facsimile (which is confirmed), to the party
to receive such notices or communications at the address set forth below (or
such other address as shall from time to time be designated by such party to the

damages resulting from such failure to perform or otherwise from such causes.
Performance under this Agreement shall resume when the Escrow Agent is able to
perform substantially its duties.

shall be attached, garnished or levied upon by any court order, or the delivery
thereof shall be stayed or enjoined by an order of a court, or any order,
judgment or decree shall be made or entered by any court order affecting the
property deposited under this Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent is hereby
expressly authorized, in its sole discretion, to obey and comply with all writs,
orders or decrees so entered or issued, which it is advised by legal counsel of
its own choosing is binding upon it, whether with or without jurisdiction, and

                                        Sincerely,


                                        By:

</TABLE>

Telephone call backs shall be made to both the Buyer and Representative if joint
instructions are required pursuant to the agreement. All funds transfer
instructions must include the signature of the person(s) authorizing said funds
transfer.

Periodically, the parties may issue payment orders to the Escrow Agent to
transfer funds by federal funds wire. The Escrow Agent will review the orders to
determine compliance with the governing documentation and to confirm signature
by the appropriate party, in accordance with the incumbency list previously
supplied to the Escrow Agent. Bank policy requires that, where practicable, the
Escrow Agent undertake callbacks to a party other than the individual who signed
the payment order to verify the authenticity of the payment order.

Inasmuch as the Person(s) designated on this schedule are the only employees in
such Person's office who can confirm wire transfers, the Escrow Agent will call
such Person to confirm any federal funds wire transfer payment order purportedly
issued by such Person. A party's continued issuance of payment orders to the
Escrow Agent and confirmation in accordance with this procedure will constitute
such party's agreement (1) to the callback security procedure outlined in the
Agreement and (2) that the security procedure outlined therein constitutes a
commercially reasonable method of verifying the authenticity of payment orders.
Moreover, each party agrees to accept any risk associated with a deviation from
this bank policy.

accordance with the first sentence in this Section 1.7.

     1.8 Accounting. The Escrow Agent shall provide a written account to Buyer
and the Representative at the end of each month of the relevant calendar year
listing all transactions with respect to the Environmental Escrow Account during
the immediately preceding month.

                                   ARTICLE II

                  DISPOSITION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL ESCROW FUNDS

     2.1 Claims for Environmental Escrow Funds.

          (a) At any time during the term of this Agreement, Buyer and the
Representative may deliver a joint written notice substantially in the form of
Exhibit A to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release from the
Environmental Escrow Account the payments with respect to any Environmental Work
completed in accordance with Section 6.2 of the Merger Agreement ("Joint
Notice"). Except as may otherwise be provided in this Agreement or in the Merger
Agreement, within three (3) Business Days after the delivery by Buyer and the
Representative to the Escrow Agent of a Joint Notice, the Escrow Agent shall
release to Buyer the amount of Environmental Escrow Amount set forth in such
notice to (together with accrued interest and other income earned thereon from
the Closing Date to the applicable payment date).

          (b) At any time prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the third
anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer may give the Escrow Agent and the
Representative written notice in substantially the form of Exhibit ___ (a "Funds
Disbursement Notice") requesting the Escrow Agent to disburse funds for the
performance of Environmental Work (including Environmental Work which is
required under Schedule 6.2 but which will occur and/or be completed after the
third anniversary of the Closing Date; provided, however, that no funds will be
disbursed for matters which Mark IV has, as of the date of disbursement of the
funds, continued to honor and perform the indemnity obligations set forth in
Schedule 6.2) pursuant to the Merger Agreement. If the Representative does not
give the Escrow Agent and Buyer a written notice of disagreement (a
"Disbursement Dispute Notice") with any matter or amount set forth in the Funds
Disbursement Notice within thirty (30) Business Days of the date of the Funds
Disbursement Notice, then the Escrow Agent shall, within ten (10) Business Days
following the thirtieth (30th) Business Day after the date of the Funds
Disbursement Notice, release to Buyer the amount of the Environmental Escrow
Amount set forth in the Funds Disbursement Notice. If the Representative shall
give a Disbursement Dispute Notice to the Escrow Agent and Buyer within such
thirty (30) Business Day period, the provisions of Section 3.4 shall apply with
respect to the amount set forth therein. A funds disbursement request as to
which a Disbursement Dispute Notice has been given and which has not been


                                        3

<PAGE>

resolved pursuant to Section 3.4 of this Agreement is referred to hereinafter as
an "Unresolved Disbursement Claim".

          (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the amount of any
disbursement hereunder (i) shall be net of Tax Benefits (as defined in the
Merger Agreement) and (ii) to the extent that it relates to remediation costs to
be incurred over a period in excess of one year, shall be discounted to present
value using customary financial practices and a discount rate equal to 8.5%.

     2.2 Partial Release of Environmental Escrow Funds. Buyer and the
Representative shall deliver a joint written notice instructing the Escrow Agent
to immediately release from the Environmental Escrow Account and deposit into
the Payment Fund on the second anniversary of the Closing Date the lesser of:
(i) $2,000,000 or (ii) $5,000,000 minus the aggregate dollar amount of all
Unresolved Disbursement Claims. Within three (3) Business Days after the third
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent shall release such portion of
the Environmental Escrow Amount as may be remaining in the Environmental Escrow
Account as of such date (other than an amount equal to the aggregate dollar
amount of all Unresolved Disbursement Claims), and shall pay such amount to the
Representative in the manner directed by the Representative, together with
accrued interest and other income earned thereon from the Closing Date to the
applicable payment date. In the event that there are Unresolved Disbursement
Claims remaining at the third anniversary of the Closing Date, the parties shall
proceed to resolve such claims pursuant to the dispute resolution mechanism in
Section 3.4 hereof within 30 days of the third anniversary date and payment or
retention of funds related to such resolved claims shall be made in accordance
with this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE III

                                  ESCROW AGENT

     3.1 Duties. The duties and obligations of the Escrow Agent shall be
determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement and shall be
limited to the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically
set forth in this Agreement, as it may be amended from time to time with the
Escrow Agent's written consent as provided in Section 4.8 hereof. The Escrow
Agent shall not have any liability under, nor duty to inquire into the terms and
provisions of any agreement (including the Merger Agreement) or instruction,
other than those set forth in, or given pursuant to, this Agreement.

     3.2 Reliance. In the performance of its duties hereunder, the Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to rely, and shall be protected in acting or refraining from
acting, upon any document or instrument reasonably believed by it to be genuine
and signed by Buyer and/or the Representative, as applicable, and the Escrow
Agent shall be under no duty to inquire into or investigate the validity or
accuracy of any such document. The Escrow Agent may assume that any person
purporting to give any notice in accordance with the provisions hereof has been
duly authorized to do so.

     3.3 Liability. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any error of
judgment, or any action taken or omitted to be taken hereunder in good faith,
except in the case of its bad faith,


                                        4

<PAGE>

gross negligence or willful misconduct. In the administration of the
Environmental Escrow Funds, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to consult with
counsel of its choosing (including internal counsel). The Escrow Agent shall not
be liable for any act suffered or omitted by it in good faith in accordance with
the advice or opinion of such counsel.

     3.4 Disputes. In the event that the Escrow Agent shall receive a
Disbursement Dispute Notice, the Escrow Agent shall not release any
Environmental Escrow Funds with respect to any matter covered by such notice
until there shall have been a final determination of the rights of the parties
with respect to such matter, and then only in accordance with the terms of such
final determination. In the event that the Escrow Agent shall be otherwise
uncertain as to its duties or rights hereunder, it shall be entitled to refrain
from taking any action until such time as there has been a final determination
of the rights of the parties with respect to the Escrow Funds (or relevant
portion thereof). For purposes of this Section 3.4, there shall be deemed to
have been a final determination of the rights of the parties at such time as (i)
an agreement shall have been reached between the Buyer and the Representative
regarding the amount to be disbursed pursuant to that particular Funds
Disbursement Notice; or (ii) in the event that the Buyer and the Representative
are not able to reach an agreement, then the respective parties' environmental
consultants shall meet to attempt to reach agreement, or (iii) failing that, the
environmental consultants shall jointly select a third environmental consultant
who shall review the available information and make a final determination as to
the reasonable costs which shall be reflected as the disbursement and the Escrow
Agent shall have been notified thereof in a joint written direction from each of
Buyer and the Representative. Buyer and Representative agree to proceed
diligently upon notice by one party to the other that the dispute resolution
mechanism in this Section 3.4 are to be implemented.

     3.5 Resignation. The Escrow Agent may resign at any time and be discharged
of the duties imposed hereunder (but without prejudice for any liability in the
case of its bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct hereunder) by
giving notice to Buyer and the Representative at least thirty (30) Business Days
prior to the date specified for such resignation to take effect, in which case,
upon the effective date of such resignation:

          (a)  all funds then held by the Escrow Agent hereunder shall be
               delivered by it to such Person as may be designated in writing by
               Buyer and the Representative, whereupon the Escrow Agent's
               obligations hereunder shall cease and terminate;

          (b)  if no such person has been designated by such date, all
               obligations of the Escrow Agent hereunder shall, nevertheless,
               cease and terminate, subject to clause (c) below; and

          (c)  the Escrow Agent's sole responsibility thereafter shall be to
               keep all funds then held by it (and to make the investments as
               hereinbefore provided) and to deliver the same to the successor
               escrow agent designated jointly by Buyer and the Representative
               in writing or, if no such successor escrow agent shall have been
               so designated, in accordance with the directions of a final order
               or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction and the
               provisions of Section 3.7 and Section 3.8 shall remain in effect.


                                        5

<PAGE>

     Upon their receipt of notice of resignation from the Escrow Agent, Buyer
and the Representative shall use their reasonable best efforts jointly to
designate a successor escrow agent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the foregoing, the Escrow Agent or any successor escrow agent shall continue to
act as Escrow Agent until a successor is appointed and qualified to act as
escrow agent.

     3.6 Removal of Escrow Agent. Buyer and the Representative may, upon at
least thirty (30) Business Day's prior written notice to the Escrow Agent,
jointly dismiss the Escrow Agent hereunder and appoint a successor. In such
event, the Escrow Agent shall promptly account for and deliver to the successor
escrow agent named in such notice the balance of the Environmental Escrow Funds.
Upon acceptance thereof and of such accounting by such successor escrow agent,
and upon reimbursement to the Escrow Agent of all expenses due to it hereunder
through the date of such accounting and delivery, the Escrow Agent shall be
released and discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder, but
without prejudice to any liability of the Escrow Agent for its bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct hereunder.

     3.7 Compensation. On the Closing Date and annually thereafter, Buyer and
the Representative shall each pay one-half of the Escrow Agent's $_______ annual
fee (the "Annual Fee") in full satisfaction of its engagement fee and
compensation, without pro-ration for partial years. All amounts payable by the
Representative pursuant to this Section 3.7 shall be paid out of the Expense
Account to be maintained by the Representative under the Merger Agreement.

     3.8 Indemnification. The Escrow Agent and its directors, officers, agents
and employees (the "Indemnified Parties") shall be indemnified and held harmless
by each of Buyer and the Representative, severally and not jointly (with each
such indemnifying party liable up to a maximum of 50%), against any loss,
liability, claim, damage, injury, demand or expense, including reasonable legal
fees and expenses of in-house or outside counsel arising out of or in connection
with the performance of the Escrow Agent's obligations hereunder or pursuant to
any written instructions of Buyer or the Representative given to the Escrow
Agent pursuant to this Agreement, including the costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the collection of its fees and including the costs and expenses
of defending itself against any claim or liability arising out of or in
connection with the performance of its duties hereunder, except for any loss,
liability, claim, damage, injury, demand or expense resulting from any of the
Indemnified Parties' bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct;
provided, however, that promptly after the receipt by any of the Indemnified
Parties of notice of any claim or the commencement of any suit, action or
proceeding, such Indemnified Party shall, if a claim of indemnification in
respect thereof is to be made against any of the other parties hereto, notify
such other parties thereof in writing; and provided, further, however, that the
indemnifying party or parties shall be entitled, at their own expense, to
participate in or assume the defense of any such action, suit or proceeding. If
the indemnifying party assumes control of such defense and the indemnifying
party and any of the Indemnified Parties have a conflict of interest with
respect to such suit, action or proceeding, such Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to have separate legal representation in respect thereof and the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Escrow Agent shall be considered
"damages" for the purposes of this Section 3.8. The failure of any of the
Indemnified Parties to provide written notification to an indemnifying party
shall not affect the rights of any of the Indemnified Parties under this Section
3.8 except (and only to the extent that) the indemnifying


                                        6

<PAGE>

party incurs additional expenses or the indemnifying party is actually
prejudiced by reason of such failure to give timely notice. The right of any of
the Indemnified Parties (or any successor escrow agent appointed hereunder) to
indemnification under this Section 3.8 shall survive the termination of this
Agreement or the earlier removal or resignation of the Escrow Agent or the
termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall any of the Indemnified Parties be liable for
special, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever
(including but not limited to lost profits), even if such Indemnified Party has
been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form
of action. All amounts payable by the Representative pursuant to this Section
3.8 shall be paid out of the Environmental Escrow Fund pursuant to a joint
instruction signed by the Representative and the Buyer. The parties hereby grant
the Escrow Agent a lien on, right of set-off against and security interest in
the Environmental Escrow Fund for the payment of any claim of indemnification,
compensation, expenses and amounts due hereunder and payable by the
Representative.

     3.9 Merger. Any corporation into which the Escrow Agent in its individual
capacity may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any
corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the
Escrow Agent in its individual capacity shall be a party, or any corporation to
which substantially all the corporate trust business of the Escrow Agent in its
individual capacity may be transferred, shall be the successor escrow agent
under this Agreement without further action, and the provisions of this
Agreement shall continue to apply to such successor escrow agent as if such
successor escrow agent was an original party hereto.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                                      TAXES

     4.1 The Escrow Agent shall timely report to the Buyer and the
Representative the aggregate amount of income earned, interest received and
gains recognized (collectively, the "Escrow Interest") from the investment of
the Escrow Funds on which taxes imposed on any such income, interest or gains
(such taxes, the "Escrow Taxes") are then due and payable and the Buyer shall
report the amount of such Escrow Interest to the appropriate taxing authorities
and shall pay the Escrow Taxes, in which event it may direct the Escrow Agent,
by a reasonably detailed written notice to it with a copy to the Representative,
to reimburse the Buyer in the amount of the Escrow Taxes out of the Escrow
Interest. In the event any portion of the Environmental Escrow Fund is to be
paid to Buyer or deposited into the Payment Fund pursuant to Section 2.2, such
amount shall be reduced (and the amount of such reduction shall be paid over to
the Buyer, but only to the extent not reimbursed to it pursuant to the preceding
sentence) by an amount equal to the product of (i) the Escrow Taxes that are
then due and payable and that the Buyer estimates (in a reasonably detailed
written notice to the Escrow Agent with a copy to the Representative) will be
due and payable with respect to the taxable period in which such payment or
deposit is made multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
amount otherwise to be paid to the Buyer or deposited into the Payment Fund
under this sentence, as the case may be, and the denominator of which is the
Environmental Escrow Fund. The amount determined pursuant to the preceding
sentence shall be adjusted to the extent reasonably practical to account for any
duplication in payment and any timing differences in payments into and


                                        7

<PAGE>

disbursements from the Environmental Escrow Account. The provisions of this
Section 4.1 shall be interpreted and applied in a manner that is consistent with
the provisions of Section 3.4(a) of the Merger Agreement.

                                    ARTICLE V

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

     5.1 Term. This Agreement shall continue in force until the final
distribution of all amounts held by the Escrow Agent in the Environmental Escrow
Account in accordance with this Agreement.

Agreement and all of the provisions of this Agreement will be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

     5.4 GOVERNING LAW. THE PARTIES HERETO AGREE THAT THIS AGREEMENT, AND THE
RESPECTIVE RIGHTS, DUTIES AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER, SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS TO BE PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN SUCH STATE.

     5.5 Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

          (a) Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that all actions and
proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be heard and determined in the Supreme
Court of the State of New York, New York County, or the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York, and the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in any such
action or proceeding and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum
to the maintenance of any such action or proceeding. The parties hereto agree
that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by applicable law.

          (b) EACH PARTY IS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF AGREEMENTS
DELIVERED IN


                                        9

<PAGE>

CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT
OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT
SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER
OF SUCH WAIVERS, (ii) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH
WAIVERS, (iii) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 5.5(b).

     5.6 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original.

     5.7 Headings. The Section headings in this Agreement are for convenience
only and do not constitute part of this Agreement.

     5.8 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended only by a writing signed by
each of the parties hereto. The Escrow Agent shall not be required to enter into
any amendment to this Agreement which affects its rights, duties or liabilities
hereunder.

     5.9 Facsimile Signatures. All signatures of the parties to this Agreement
may be transmitted by facsimile, and such facsimile will, for all purposes, be
deemed to be the original signature of such party whose signature it reproduces
and will be binding upon such party.

     5.10 Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as expressly contemplated by Section
3.8 hereof, this Agreement is not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon
any person other than the parties hereto or thereto.

     5.11 Confirmation of Instructions. In the event funds transfer instructions
are given (other than in writing at the time of execution of the Agreement),
whether in writing, by telecopier or otherwise, the Escrow Agent is authorized
to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to the person
or persons designated on Schedule 1 hereto, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon
the confirmations of anyone purporting to be the person or persons so
designated. The persons and telephone numbers for individuals authorized to give
or confirm funds transfer instructions may be changed only in a writing executed
by the relevant party and actually received and acknowledged by the Escrow
Agent. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that such security procedure is
commercially reasonable. The Escrow Agent and the beneficiary's bank in any
funds transfer may rely solely upon any account numbers or similar identifying
numbers provided by Buyer or the Representative, as applicable, to identify (i)
the beneficiary, (ii) the beneficiary's bank, or (iii) an intermediary bank. The
Escrow Agent may apply any of the escrowed funds for any payment order it
executes using any such identifying number, even when its use may result in a
person other than the beneficiary being paid, or the transfer of funds to a bank
other than the beneficiary's bank or an intermediary bank designated. The
parties to this Escrow Agreement acknowledge that these security procedures are
commercially reasonable. All funds transfer instructions must include the
signature of the person(s) authorizing said funds transfer.

its obligations under the terms of this Agreement because of acts of God,
terrorism, strikes, equipment or transmission failure or damage reasonably
beyond its control, or other cause reasonably beyond its control, the Escrow
Agent shall not be liable for damages to the other parties for any unforeseeable
damages resulting from such failure to perform or otherwise from such causes.
Performance under this Agreement shall resume when the Escrow Agent is able to
perform substantially its duties.

     5.14 Compliance with Court Orders. In the event that any escrow property
shall be attached, garnished or levied upon by any court order, or the delivery
thereof shall be stayed or enjoined by an order of a court, or any order,
judgment or decree shall be made or entered by any court order affecting the
property deposited under this Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent is hereby
expressly authorized, in its sole discretion, to obey and comply with all writs,
orders or decrees so entered or issued, which it is advised by legal counsel of
its own choosing is binding upon it, whether with or without jurisdiction, and

or decree it shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other
person, firm or corporation, by reason of such compliance notwithstanding such
writ, order or decree be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or
vacated.

Sub and the Representative, the Merger Agreement, embody the entire agreement

                     Telephone Number(s) for Call-Backs and
       Person(s) Designated to Give or Confirm Funds Transfer Instructions

If to Buyer and/or Merger Sub, to:

Name                             Telephone Number Signature Specimen

If to Representative to:

Name                             Telephone Number Signature Specimen

                                 Telephone call backs shall be made to both the
                                 Buyer and the Representative if joint
                                 instructions are required pursuant to the
                                 agreement. All funds transfer instructions must
                                 include the signature of the person(s)
                                 authorizing said funds transfer.

                                 Periodically, the parties may issue payment
                                 orders to the Escrow Agent to transfer funds by
                                 federal funds wire. The Escrow Agent will
                                 review the orders to determine compliance with
                                 the governing documentation and to confirm
                                 signature by the appropriate party, in
                                 accordance with the incumbency list previously
                                 supplied to the Escrow Agent. Bank policy
                                 requires that, where practicable, the Escrow
                                 Agent undertake callbacks to a party other than
                                 the individual who signed the payment order to
                                 verify the authenticity of the payment order.

                                 Inasmuch as the Person(s) designated on this
                                 schedule are the only employee in such Person's
                                 office who can confirm wire transfers, the
                                 Escrow Agent will call such Person to confirm
                                 any federal funds wire transfer payment order
                                 purportedly issued by such Person. A party's
                                 continued

                                 procedure will constitute such party's
                                 agreement (1) to the callback security
                                 procedure outlined in the Agreement and (2)
