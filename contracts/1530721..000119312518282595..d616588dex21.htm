_Final Determination of the Price Adjustment_. The Green Parties and Buyer
agree that the calculation of the Green Liability Position as of the Closing
Date and Price Adjustment: (i) as stated in the Buyers Accounts Statement
delivered in accordance with Paragraph 4.2 ( _Buyer_ __ _s
Accounts Statement_ ) above in respect of which the Violet Parties do not

Buyers rights under Article 15 (subject to the applicable limitations in such
Article).  

---|--- 



   4.8 |

_Price Adjustment_. Within and no later than ten (10) Business Days following
the determination of the Green Liability Position in accordance with the
provisions of Paragraph 4.7 ( _Final Determination of the_ _Price Adjustment_
) above, the Green Purchase Price shall be adjusted as follows (the
"Price Adjustment"): 

---|--- 



     | (i) |

if the absolute value of the amount of the Green Liability Position as finally
determined is less than the absolute value of the amount of the Estimated
Green Liability Position, then Buyer shall pay to the Green Parties (each pro
rata to the equity interest held in Green by each of them) in the aggregate an
amount equal to the absolute amount of the difference between the absolute
value of the amount of the Green Liability Position and the absolute value of
the amount of the Estimated Green Liability Position; 

---|---|--- 
 



27

         | (ii) |

if the amount of the absolute value of the Green Liability Position as finally
determined is greater than the absolute value of the amount of the Estimated
Green Liability Position, then the Violet Parties collectively shall pay to
Buyer an amount equal to the absolute amount of the difference between the
absolute value of the amount of the Green Liability Position and the absolute
value of the amount of the Estimated Green Liability Position (such amount
may, at Buyers option in its sole discretion, be recovered from the Escrow
Amount); and 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) |

if the amount of the Green Liability Position is equal to the amount of the
Estimated Green Liability Position, there shall be no adjustment to the Green
Purchase Price. 

---|---|--- 

For the avoidance of doubt, none of the exclusions and limitations set forth
in Article 15 ( _Indemnification_ ) (other than those set forth in Paragraphs
15.2(ii)(b), 15.2(iii) and 15.2(iv)) below shall apply to any amount to be
paid to Buyer pursuant to this Paragraph 4.8 ( _Price Adjustment_ ). 



   4.9 |

_Misallocated Assets_. If, following the Closing, any asset is found to have
been retained by Green as of the Closing (after giving effect to the Green
Carve Out) that, according to the Green Step Plan and the Green De-Merger
Deed, should have been transferred to New Green in the Green Carve Out, Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to transfer, or to cause its
applicable Subsidiaries to transfer, such asset as soon as reasonably
practicable to the Violet Parties or any Affiliate of the Violet Parties
designated by the Violet Parties;  _provided_ , that as a condition to any
such transfer, the Violet Parties shall promptly reimburse Buyer or its
designee for any costs, fees and expenses (including Taxes) incurred by Buyer
or any of its Affiliates in connection therewith. If, following the Closing,
any asset is found to have been transferred to New Green as of the Closing
(after giving effect to the Green Carve Out) that, according to the Green Step
Plan and the Green De-Merger Deed, should have been retained by Green in the
Green Carve Out, the Violet Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to transfer, or to cause New Green to transfer (at the Violet Parties sole
expense), such asset as soon as reasonably practicable to Green or any
Affiliate of Green designated by Buyer.

_provided_ , _however_ , that any event, action or transaction that is (a)
expressly consented to in writing by Buyer or (b) listed in Section 5.1 of the
Sellers Disclosure Letter (clauses (a) and (b) collectively, a "Permitted
Leakage") are not and will not be deemed to be in breach of the provisions of
this Article 5 ( _Locked Box_ ).



   5.2 |

_Indemnification for Leakage_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any exclusions or
limitations set forth in Article 15 ( _Indemnification_ ), but subject to
Paragraphs 15.2(ii)(b), 15.2(iii) and 15.2(iv) and Paragraphs 16.1(i) and
16.1(ii), to the extent any Leakage is not deducted from the Purchase Price
at Closing as a portion of the Estimated Leakage Amount, from and after the
Closing Date, each Major Seller shall indemnify and pay to Buyer, on a Euro
per Euro basis, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, an amount in cash
equal to the amount of any Leakage received by or made for the benefit of,
such Major Seller or his/her/its Affiliates (the "Leakage Concerned Seller"),
as will be finally determined, following the delivery of a Post-Closing
Leakage Notice in accordance with Paragraph 5.4 ( _Post-Closing_ _Leakage
Notice_ ) below, in accordance with Paragraph 5.5 ( _Objection to Post-Closing
Leakage Notice_ ) below. For the sake of clarity, with respect to
any particular Leakage, the Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that,
subject to Paragraphs 16.1(i) and 16.1(ii), the portion of the Purchase Price
paid by Buyer at the Closing to any Major Sellers other than the applicable
Leakage Concerned Seller shall not be subject to any deduction in respect of
such Leakage. 

---|--- 



   5.3 |

_Pre-Closing Leakage Notice_. 

---|--- 
 



     | (i) |

The Major Sellers acknowledge and agree that any Leakage received by or made
for the benefit of any Leakage Concerned Seller during the period beginning
on the Locked Box Date and ending at the Closing shall be deducted from the
Major Sellers Purchase Price respectively paid to such Leakage Concerned
Seller at Closing to the extent specified in the Pre-Closing Leakage
Statement, and, to the extent any such Leakage is not so specified, Buyer
shall be indemnified by such Leakage Concerned Seller for any such Leakage in
accordance with Paragraph 5.2 ( _Indemnification for Leakage_ ). 

---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

No earlier than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date and no later
than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, each of the Major
Sellers shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) to Buyer a reasonably
detailed statement of the aggregate estimated Leakage received by or made (or
to be received by or made) for the benefit of such Major Seller or
his/her/its Affiliates (if any) between the period beginning on the Locked Box
Date and ending on the Closing Date, which statement shall be duly executed by
each such Major Seller (the "Pre-Closing Leakage Statement"). For any Major
Seller whose Pre-Closing Leakage Statement as per the foregoing would not
include any estimated Leakage, such Sellers Pre-Closing Leakage Statement
shall so state and shall be duly executed by each such Major Seller. 

---|---|--- 



      | (iii) |

Following delivery of the Sellers Pre-Closing Leakage Statements, Buyer may
submit comments and observations thereto and the applicable Leakage Concerned
Seller shall in good faith take into account such comments and observations
(including by discussing such comments and observations with Buyer in good
faith) to determine whether any changes should be made to such Leakage
Concerned Sellers Pre-Closing Leakage Statement, it being understood,
however, that in no event shall the Closing be delayed or the Closing Date be
postponed if such Leakage Concerned Seller and Buyer are unable to reach an
agreement with respect to any such comments or observations, in which case the
Closing actions and transactions will occur on the basis of such Leakage
Concerned Sellers Pre-Closing Leakage Statement as delivered in accordance
with this Paragraph 5.3. To the 

---|---|--- 
 



30

         |  extent Buyer does not agree with any Sellers Pre-Closing
Leakage Statement or there is any additional Leakage from the date of such
statement to the Closing (any such amounts so not agreed or incurred during
such period, the "Unresolved Leakage Items"), the Leakage Concerned Sellers
and Buyer shall as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date
and in any event within twenty (20) Business Days thereof seek in good faith
to resolve such Unresolved Leakage Items. If the applicable Leakage Concerned
Seller(s) and Buyer are unable to so resolve all Unresolved Leakage Items
within such time period, then the provisions set forth in Paragraphs 4.5 (
_Independent Auditor_ ), and 4.6 ( _Engagement of the Independent Auditor_ )
above shall apply to the resolution of such Unresolved Leakage Items, _mutatis
mutandis_. 
---|--- 
 



   5.4 |

_Post-Closing Leakage Notice_. On or prior to the later of (a) June 10, 2019
or (b) 120 Business Days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall give written
notice to the applicable Leakage Concerned Sellers of any additional Leakage
of which it becomes aware (to the extent such Leakage was not reflected
pursuant to Paragraph 5.3 ( _Pre-Closing Leakage Notice_)), and shall provide
reasonable particulars thereof, including (i) the nature of the Leakage, and
(ii) the amount of such Leakage (the "Post-Closing Leakage Notice"). 

---|--- 



   5.5 |

_Objection to Post-Closing Leakage Notice_. The applicable Leakage Concerned
Sellers shall have the right to challenge in writing the Post-Closing Leakage
Notice within thirty (30) Business Days from receipt thereof, specifying the
subject matter of such Leakage Concerned Sellers disagreement and the reasons
for such disagreement together with reasonable particulars thereof. In such
case, the provisions of Paragraphs 4.4 ( _Attempted Agreement on the Disputed
Items_ ), 4.5 ( _Independent Auditor_ ) and 4.6 ( _Engagement of the
Independent Auditor_ ) above shall apply, _mutatis mutandis_. Failure by the
applicable Leakage Concerned Sellers to challenge the Post-Closing Leakage
Notice in accordance with this Paragraph 5.5 shall constitute an acceptance of
the Post-Closing Leakage Notice by the Sellers. For the avoidance of any
doubt, none of the exclusions and limitations set forth in Article 15 (
_Indemnification_ ) below (other than Paragraphs 15.2(ii)(b), 15.2(iii) and
15.2(iv)) shall apply to any amount to be paid to Buyer pursuant to
this Article 5 ( _Locked Box_ ). 

---|--- 



   5.6 |

_Remedy_. The rights and remedies provided in this Article 5 ( _Locked Box_ )
shall be in addition to any other right of indemnification of Buyer pursuant
to Article 15 ( _Indemnification_ ), however arising in connection with, or by
virtue of, any Leakage; provided, that no Leakage shall give rise to any right
on the part of Buyer to rescind or terminate this Agreement or to refuse to
perform its obligations hereunder.

Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, acquire or agree to
acquire, including through mergers, consolidations, acquisitions or other
similar transactions, any equity interests, assets, businesses or lines of
business, if such acquisition would reasonably be expected to: (a) impose any
material delay in the obtaining of, or increase in any material respect the
risk of not obtaining, the Antitrust Clearance, (b) increase in any material
respect the risk of any Governmental Authority seeking or entering an order
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (c)

33

         |  auditors or officers of Green or any Group Company in their
capacity as such (the "Individual Indemnitees"), as provided in the respective

prior to the Closing Date that is at least as favorable to the Individual
Indemnitees as the existing coverage provided to the Individual Indemnitees by
Green and/or the Group Company; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Buyer and
Green and/or the Group Companies shall not be required to pay an aggregate
amount for such "tail" policy in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the

insurance; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the cost of such "tail" policy
exceeds such amount, Buyer shall be obligated to obtain a "tail" policy with
the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to

statutory auditors of Green and the Company based on any act or omission

auditors) made by any of them in his or her capacity as such at or prior to
the Closing (including any of the matters referred to in _Exhibit_
_9.2(iv)-bis_ ), and (b) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless each of such
directors and statutory auditors from any Losses he or she may incur as a
result of any breach of Buyers obligations set forth in clause (a), in each

or any other Group Company may have waived, or may in the future waive, the
exercise of liability actions vis-a -vis its current or former directors or
statutory auditors with respect to such specific fact, act or circumstance,
shall not limit the responsibility of the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement
(including pursuant to Article 15 ( _Indemnification_ )) with respect to any
such fact, act or circumstance if such fact, act or circumstance gives rise
(or has given rise) to any Loss that is otherwise indemnifiable pursuant to

_One Transaction_. Any and all actions and transactions constituting the

foregoing agreements occurs substantially concurrently, and (ii) the delivery
of any cash payments made pursuant to this Agreement and the Subscription
Agreements, respectively, will be subject to netting. In addition, the Parties
acknowledge that the Violet Parties may wish to assign and transfer (
_intestare fiduciariemente_ ) the Violet Green Shares, on a fiduciary basis,

if the Violet Parties so elect, the Parties agree to implement such fiduciary
construct in a customary manner, including by making any relevant changes to
the Closing mechanics otherwise contemplated herein.

failure). The Notice of 

---|---|--- 
 



82

    

Claim shall also specify whether it arises as a result of a claim, action,
suit or proceeding by a Person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
notice by any Governmental Authority of any violation of any Law) against
Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (a "Third Party Claim") or
whether the Notice of Claim is asserted directly by Buyer (a "Direct Claim");

the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to challenge in writing the Notice
of Claim within thirty (30) Business Days from receipt thereof, under penalty
of forfeiture, specifying the subject matter of the Indemnifying Partys

and Buyer shall attempt to resolve amicably and in good faith any differences,
which they may have with respect to any matters constituting the subject
matter of such notice, with a view to reaching an amicable agreement in
respect of such matters. If, at the end of such period (or any mutually agreed
upon extension thereof), the Indemnifying Party and Buyer fail to reach
agreement in writing with respect to all such matters, then all matters as to
which agreement is not so reached may, thereafter, be submitted to arbitration
in accordance with Paragraph 23.2 ( _Arbitration_ ) below.

and/or any of its Subsidiaries to defend, any such claim, in each case, at

_Indemnification Obligation of the Sellers_ ) in accordance with the terms
hereof; 

---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate, and, to the

action, suit or proceeding asserted or initiated against the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or Buyer constituting the subject matter of the Notice of
Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with Buyer in the preparation
for and the prosecution of the defense of such Third Party Claim, including by
making available evidence within the control of the Indemnifying Party;

---|---|--- 



     | (v) |

obligation, to have such payment obligation or liability first satisfied by
means of payments from the Escrow Account. 

---|--- 
 



84

       15.7 |

_Escrow Agreement_. Prior to the Closing, the Violet Parties and Buyer shall
negotiate in good faith a customary escrow agreement with the Escrow Agent
that reflects and is wholly consistent with the relevant terms set forth in
this Agreement (the "Escrow Agreement"). The Escrow Agreement shall specify
that, upon the joint instruction of Buyer and the Violet Parties, or receipt
of an applicable arbitration award, the Escrow Agent shall release to Buyer or
the Violet Parties (as may be applicable) such amount as is set forth in such
joint instruction or arbitration award, up to the amount then remaining in
the Escrow Account. The Escrow Agreement shall specify that on the date that

Parties, or receipt of an applicable arbitration award, release to the Violet
Parties an amount equal to (A) the total amount of funds remaining in the

Account _minus_ (x) the aggregate amount of funds remaining in the Escrow
Account agreed to be disbursed (but not yet disbursed) to Buyer in respect of
Claims made prior to the Final Escrow Release Date _plus_ (y) the aggregate
amount of any Pending Claims as of the Final Escrow Release Date;  _provided_
, that any funds that remain in the Escrow Account following the Final Escrow
Release Date in respect of any such Pending Claims shall be released to the
Violet Parties promptly upon resolution or (if applicable) satisfaction
of such Pending Claim (after taking into account the amount to be paid to the
Buyer as a result of such resolution). The funds held in the Escrow Account
shall be invested as set forth in _Exhibit 15.7_ hereto unless otherwise
agreed by the Violet Parties and Buyer.

   15.8 |

_Autonomous guarantee obligations_. In no case shall the Sellers
representations and warranties under this Agreement be intended as warranties
on the "qualities" of the Shares or warranties to "lack of defects," and
therefore subject to Articles 1495 and 1497 of the Italian Civil Code. The
Sellers representations and warranties under this Agreement are to be
treated as autonomous guarantee obligations ( _impegni autonomi di garanzia_ )
by which each relevant Seller guarantees the assumptions of facts described in

   15.9 |

_Nature of the Representations and Warranties_. The representations and
warranties of the Sellers contained herein are _in lieu_ of all other

in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. No Person has been
authorized by the Sellers to make any representation or warranty relating to
Green, the Company, its Subsidiaries or their business or operations, or
otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and, if made, such representation or warranty must not be relied upon as
having been authorized or given by the Sellers. 

---|--- 



   15.10 |

_Mitigation; Other Provisions_. In the case of any indemnification claim
pursuant to this Article 15 ( _Indemnification_ ) in respect of a breach,
non-compliance or non-performance of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement, each Buyer Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate any Losses for which it is so entitled to indemnification.
For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of Article 15, Losses shall include
any Tax of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including Green and the Group
Companies) resulting from the receipt, or right to receive, any
indemnification payment hereunder (reduced, but not below zero, by the amount
of any reduction in the cash Tax 

---|---

liability of, or any increase in any cash Tax refund received by, the Buyer or
any of its Affiliates (including Green and the Group Companies) for which
such party would otherwise have been liable, or which increased amount such
party would otherwise not have received, which reduction in cash Tax liability
or increase in cash Tax refund results from, and would not have resulted but
for, the payment or accrual of the relevant indemnifiable Loss giving rise to
such indemnification payment to the extent such reduction in cash Tax
Liability, or increase in cash Tax refund, is actually realized in cash
within the third taxable year following the one in which such indemnifiable
Loss is paid or accrued).



   15.11 |

_Indemnification obligation of Buyer_. Buyer shall indemnify, pay and hold
each Major Seller harmless in respect of the full amount of any and all
Losses incurred or suffered by such Major Seller (i) that would not have been
so incurred and/or suffered had the representations and warranties of Buyer
contained in Article 14 ( _Representations and Warranties of Buyer_ ) been
true, correct and accurate and (ii) arising out of or relating to any breach,
non-compliance or non-performance by Buyer of any covenant or agreement,
which is to be performed prior to or at the Closing, contained in this
Agreement; _provided_ , that the provisions set forth in Paragraphs
15.1(ix), 15.2 ( _Exclusions and Limitations_ ) (as they apply to the
representations and warranties contained in Articles 11 ( _Representations and
Warranties as to the Company and its Subsidiaries_ )), 15.3 ( _Request for
Indemnification_ ), 15.4 ( _Handling of the Third Party Claims_ ), 15.5 (
_Payments_ ), 15.8 ( _Autonomous guarantee obligations_ ), and 15.9 (
_Mitigation; Other Provisions_ ) shall apply to Buyers indemnification
obligations under this Paragraph 15.10,  _mutatis mutandis_.

     | (i) |

Subject to Paragraph 20.2 ( _Public Announcement_ ), all information provided
to Buyer pursuant to Articles 5 and 8 above prior to the Closing shall be

Agreement, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference and which

reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Buyer Confidentiality Agreement
will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. 

---|---|--- 
 



88

         | (ii) |

Subject to Paragraph 20.2 ( _Public Announcement_ ), from and after the
Closing: the Major Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand,
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates and representatives to,
maintain in confidence any details of the negotiation of this Agreement,
_provided_ , that a Party may disclose such information to the extent
required (based on the advice of legal counsel) to be disclosed by judicial or
administrative process or Law. 

---|---|--- 



     | (iii) |

Each Major Seller acknowledges that the trade secrets and other confidential
or proprietary information and data of Green and the Group Companies
(collectively, "Group Confidential Information") are the property of Green and
the Group Companies, respectively, and agrees that Green and the Group
Companies have a protectable interest in such Group Confidential Information.
Therefore, each Major Seller agrees that, for a period of five years following

whatsoever any such Group Confidential Information without the prior written

source not known by such Major Seller to be bound by an obligation or duty of
confidentiality or (c) is independently developed by the applicable Major
Seller or its representatives after the Closing without use of or reference to
any of the Group Confidential Information. A Major Seller may disclose Group
Confidential Information to the extent required (based on the advice of legal
counsel) to be disclosed by judicial or administrative process or Law;
_provided_ , that to the extent legally permissible and reasonably
practicable in the circumstances, such Major Seller notifies Buyer of its
intention to make such disclosure and, to the extent reasonably practicable,
provides a list of the Group Confidential Information that such Seller intends
to disclose prior to making such disclosure. Each Major Seller agrees to use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer (at Buyers
expense) so that Buyer may seek, at its expense, an appropriate protective
order or other remedy. In the event that such a protective order or other
remedy is not obtained, the applicable Seller (I) will furnish only that
portion of the Group Confidential Information that, after consultation with
its legal counsel, it reasonably determines, in good faith, is required by
judicial or administrative process or Law to be disclosed and (II) will use
its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an order or other reasonable
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such information at
Buyers expense.

any public disclosure it believes in good faith is required by applicable Law
or the regulations of any stock exchange on which any of the Parties (or any
Partys Affiliates) shares are listed, in which case the Party required to
issue such public announcement shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
inform the other Party of any such requirement and shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to consult, in good faith, as practicable, with the other
Party before issuing any such public announcement and (b) the Parties will
have the right to issue press releases or make any other public announcements
or disclosures consistent with the contents of previously 

---|---
