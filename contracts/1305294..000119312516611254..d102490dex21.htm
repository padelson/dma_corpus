WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger;

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a
condition and an inducement to the willingness of the Company to enter into
this Agreement, Thoma Bravo Fund XII, L.P. (the " _Guarantor_ ") has entered
into that certain guaranty, dated as of the date hereof (the " _Guaranty_ "),
in favor of the Company with respect to certain obligations and liabilities of
Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
certain of the Companys shareholders have entered into voting agreements
(the " _Voting Agreements_ "), dated as of the date hereof, with Parent,

Proposal; and

WHEREAS, certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in
_Section 9.04_.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein and intending to
be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as follows: ARTICLE I

 

 _The Merger_

 

Section 1.01 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), on the Closing Date, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "). At the Effective Time,
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company
shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ").

 

Section 1.02 _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger shall
take place at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, Four
Times Square, New York, New York 10036 at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, as
soon as possible but in no event later than the second Business Day following
the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver by the party or
parties entitled to the benefits thereof of the conditions set forth in
_Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the
extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions at the Closing), or at
such other place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing between the
Company and Parent; _provided_ that, notwithstanding the satisfaction or (to
the extent permitted by Law) waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article
VII_ , if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction
or waiver of such conditions (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing), the Closing shall occur instead on the
date that is the earlier to occur of (a) any Business Day during the Marketing
Period specified by Parent to the Company on no less than two (2) Business
Days notice to the Company and (b) the second Business Day after the final
day of the Marketing Period, but subject, in each case under clause (a) or
(b), to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver by the
party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof of the conditions set forth
in _Article VII_ at the Closing (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
(to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions at the Closing);
_provided_ , _further_ , that if any of the conditions set forth in _Article
VII_ are not satisfied or (to the extent permitted by Law) waived on any such
second Business Day, then the Closing shall take place on the first Business
Day on which all such conditions shall have been satisfied or (to the extent
permitted by Law) waived. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to
in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."

 

Section 1.03 _Effective Time_. Concurrently with the Closing, the parties
shall file with the Delaware Secretary the certificate of merger relating to
the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), in customary form and substance
and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The
Merger shall become effective at the time that the Certificate of Merger have
been duly filed with the Delaware Secretary, or at such later time as the
Company and Parent shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the
time the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



2 Section 1.04 _Effects_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

Section 1.05 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The certificate
of incorporation of the Company shall, at the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any further action, be amended and restated to read in
its entirety as set forth on _Exhibit A_ and, as so amended and restated,
shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law,
subject to _Section 6.04(a)_. The bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law, subject to _Section 6.04(a)_, except that references to the
name of Merger Sub shall be replaced by references to the name of the
Surviving Corporation.

Section 1.06 _Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation_. The directors
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors
of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their death, resignation or
removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified,
as the case may be. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until the
earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

ARTICLE II

 

 _Effect on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Entities; Exchange of
Certificates_

 

Section 2.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or any holder of shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of
the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") or shares of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ "):

(a) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of Merger Sub Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights,
powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the
only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From
and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of Merger
Sub Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were
converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

 



3 (b) _Cancellation of Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
that is owned directly by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to _Sections 2.02_ and
_2.03_ , each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in
accordance with _Section 2.01(b)_) shall be converted at the Effective Time
into the right to receive $30.50 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted,
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (or evidence of shares in
book-entry form) that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. Without limiting the restrictions set forth in _Section 5.01_,
if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then any
number or amount contained herein which is based upon the number of shares of
Company Common Stock will be appropriately adjusted to provide to Parent and
the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Agreement prior to such event.

 

Section 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates; Payment Fund_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, at its sole
cost and expense, appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to
the Company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment
and delivery of the Merger Consideration. Substantially concurrent with the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent, for the benefit
of the holders of Company Common Stock, for payment in accordance with this
_Article II_ through the Paying Agent, cash constituting an amount equal to
the aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section
2.01(c)_ (but not including any Merger Consideration in respect of any
Dissenting Shares). All such cash deposited with the Paying Agent is
hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_."

 

(b) _Letter of Transmittal_. As reasonably promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time (and in any event within three (3) Business Days after the
Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of Company Common Stock (other than the Company, its Subsidiaries,
Parent and Merger Sub) a form of letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent, shall be in such form and have such other
provisions (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an
"agents message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form) as Parent
may specify subject to the Companys reasonable approval, and shall be
prepared prior to the Closing), together with instructions thereto.

 



4 (c) _Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange_. Upon (i) in
the case of shares of Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate, the
surrender of such Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together
with the Letter of Transmittal, duly, completely and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, or (ii) in the case of shares of
Company Common Stock held in book-entry form, the receipt of an "agents
message" by the Paying Agent, in each case together with such other documents
as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such shares
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration
into which such shares of Company Common Stock have been converted pursuant to
_Section 2.01(c)_. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common
Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the
Merger Consideration may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate
representing such Company Common Stock (or, if such Company Common Stock
is held in book-entry form, proper evidence of such transfer) is presented to
the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have
been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.02(c)_, each
share of Company Common Stock, and any Certificate with respect thereto, shall
be deemed at any time from and after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration, without
interest thereon, that the holders of shares of Company Common Stock are
entitled to receive in respect of such shares pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_.
No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender
of any Certificate (or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry
form).

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ upon
conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been
issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock (or shares
of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form) are presented to Parent or
the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article II_.

(e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including
any interest received with respect thereto) that remains undistributed to the
holders of Company Common Stock for one (1) year after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has
not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration without any interest
thereon.

 



5 (f) _No Liability_. None of the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of
the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates or shares in
book-entry form shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the date
on which any cash in respect of such shares would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such cash in respect of
such shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

(g)  _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash in
the Payment Fund if and as directed by Parent; _provided_ , that such
investment shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations of issuers organized under the Law
of a state of the United States of America, rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Ratings Service,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion,
or in mutual funds investing in such assets. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to, and be the property of,
Parent. No investment losses resulting from investment of the Payment Fund
shall diminish the rights of any of the Companys shareholders to receive the
Merger Consideration or any other payment as provided herein. To the extent
there are losses with respect to such investments or the Payment Fund
diminishes for any other reason below the level required to make prompt cash
payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to  _Section
2.01(c)_, Parent shall reasonably promptly replace or restore the cash in the
Payment Fund so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is at all times maintained
at a level sufficient to make such cash payments.

 

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation (including
through its payroll system) and the Paying Agent (without duplication) shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment
under applicable Tax Law. Amounts so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of which such
deduction or withholding was made.

 

(i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by Parent, the posting of such
Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct,
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, pay the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

(j) _No Further Dividends or Distributions_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with
a record date on or after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of
any un-surrendered Certificates or shares in book-entry form.

 



6 Section 2.03 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, to
the extent that holders thereof are entitled to appraisal rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly
exercised and perfected his or her demand for appraisal rights under Section
262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, the
Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, but the holders of such
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive such consideration as shall be
determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost his or her right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL
(whether occurring before, at or after the Effective Time), such holders
shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, and such shares shall not be
deemed to be Dissenting Shares. From and after the Effective Time, a holder of
Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled to exercise any of the voting rights
or other rights of an equity owner of the Surviving Corporation or of
a stockholder of Parent.

(b) The Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent of any demands for
appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments, notices or demands served pursuant to the DGCL
received by the Company relating to appraisal demands, and Parent shall have
the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands occurring prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing.

Section 2.04 _Company Stock Awards_.

 

(a) _Company Stock Options_. As of the Effective Time, each then outstanding
Company Stock Option (whether or not vested or exercisable) shall be canceled
and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash payable
as soon as practicable following the Effective Time equal to the product of
(i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the per
share exercise price of such Company Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
(subject to any required withholding under applicable Tax Law);  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the per share exercise price of any such Company Stock
Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company
Stock Option shall be cancelled and terminated as of the Effective Time
without any cash payment being made in respect thereof.

 



7 (b) _Stock Appreciation Rights_. As of the Effective Time, each then
outstanding Stock Appreciation Right (whether or not vested or exercisable)
shall be canceled and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an
amount in cash payable as soon as practicable following the Effective Time
equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger
Consideration over (B) the per share base or strike price of such Stock
Appreciation Right multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Stock Appreciation Right (subject to any required
withholding under applicable Tax Law); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
per share base or strike price of any such Stock Appreciation Right is equal
to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Stock Appreciation Right
shall be cancelled and terminated as of the Effective Time without any cash
payment being made in respect thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
case of a Stock Appreciation Right that is a Company MVSSAR, the
amount payable with respect to such Company MVSSAR shall be reduced to the
extent necessary such that the amount payable with respect to such Company
MVSSAR equals the maximum amount payable with respect to such award under its
terms.

 

(c) _Company RSUs_

 

(i) _Vested Company RSUs_. Effective as of the Effective Time, each then
outstanding Vested Company RSU that has not otherwise previously been settled
shall be canceled and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive a cash
payment payable as soon as practicable following the Effective Time equal to
the product of (A) the Merger Consideration and (B) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to the Company RSU (subject to any required
withholding under applicable Tax Law); _provided_ that any payment in respect
of any Vested Company RSU which, immediately prior to such cancellation was
treated as "nonqualified deferred compensation" for purposes of Section 409A
of the Code, shall be made on the applicable settlement date of such Vested
Company RSU if required in order to comply with Section 409A of the Code (or
such earlier date following the Effective Time as may be permissible while
still complying with Section 409A of the Code).

 

(ii) _Unvested Company RSUs_.

 

(1) One-third of each Unvested Company RSU outstanding as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall become a Vested Company RSU and settled in
accordance with _Section 2.04(c)(i)_.

(2) One-third of each Unvested Company RSU shall not become a Vested Company
RSU and shall instead be cancelled and converted into the contingent right to
receive a cash payment equal to the product of (A) the Merger Consideration
and (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Unvested
Company RSU (subject to any required withholding under applicable Tax Law);
_provided_ that such cash payment shall not be paid at the Effective Time but
shall instead be subject to the holder of such Unvested Company RSU being
continuously employed with the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of (x)
date of the satisfaction of the original vesting conditions applicable to the
underlying Unvested Company RSU or (y) the first anniversary of the Effective
Date.

 



8 (3) The remaining one-third of each Unvested Company RSU shall not become
a Vested Company RSU and shall instead be cancelled and converted into the
contingent right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (A) the
Merger Consideration and (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to the Unvested Company RSU (subject to any required withholding
under applicable Tax Law); _provided_ that such cash payment shall not be paid
at the Effective Time but shall instead be subject to the holder of such
Unvested Company RSU being continuously employed with the Surviving
Corporation until the earlier of (x) date of the satisfaction of the original
vesting conditions applicable to the underlying Unvested Company RSU or (y)
the eighteen (18)-month anniversary of the Effective Date.

(4) Notwithstanding the foregoing in this _Section 2.04(c)(ii)_, in the event
that the holders employment with the Surviving Corporation is terminated by
the Surviving Corporation other than for Cause, the vesting conditions with
respect to any unpaid Unvested Company RSU consideration shall be deemed
satisfied as of the holders last day of employment with the Surviving
Corporation.

(5) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the Merger
Consideration applicable to such Unvested Company RSUs, without interest
thereon, upon the satisfaction of the underlying vesting conditions applicable
thereto (including after taking into account any accelerated vesting provided
in this _Section 2.04(c)(ii)_ (whether as a result of the first anniversary
of the Effective Date, the eighteen (18)-anniversary of the Effective Date, or
termination other than for Cause, as applicable as provided in this  _Section
2.04(c)_)) or as soon as practicable thereafter, but in no event later than
the date which is the later of (A) ten (10) Business Days after the date the
vesting conditions are satisfied and (B) the date of the Companys first
regularly scheduled payroll after such times; _provided_ that any payment in
respect of any Unvested Company RSU which, immediately prior to such
cancellation was treated as "nonqualified deferred compensation" for purposes
of Section 409A of the Code, shall be made on the applicable settlement date
of such Unvested Company RSU if required in order to comply with Section 409A
of the Code. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the
original vesting conditions are not satisfied or deemed satisfied pursuant to
_Section 2.04(c)(ii)(4)_ as of the holders termination of employment or
other service relationship with the Company, the holder shall cease to be
entitled to any further payments on account of the Unvested Company RSUs.

 



9 (6) For purposes of this _Section 2.04(c)_ the portion of any
Unvested Company RSU with respect to which the vesting provisions are
accelerated shall be determined by first accelerating the portion of each
Unvested Company RSU which was otherwise scheduled to vest soonest following
the Effective Time and thereafter in order from soonest to vest to latest to
vest.

(7) No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Parent
and the Company shall mutually prepare and agree to an allocation schedule
which shall set forth the following information with respect to the Unvested
Company RSUs: (a) the name of each holder thereof, (b) the total number
of Unvested Company RSUs issued or granted to such holder that remain
outstanding as of the Effective Time, (c) the vesting schedule for each
Unvested Company RSU, and (d) the applicable settlement or payment date for
each Unvested Company RSU that is treated as "nonqualified deferred
compensation" for purposes of Section 409A of the Code (or such earlier date
following the Effective Time as may be permissible while still complying with
Section 409A of the Code). 

(d) _Restricted Stock_. Each award of restricted Company Common Stock shall
become fully vested immediately prior to the Effective Time and the holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration (subject to any
required withholding under applicable Tax Law).

 

(e) _Performance-Vesting Awards_. For Company Stock Awards the vesting of
which is conditioned upon the attainment of performance goals, for purposes
of this _Section 2.04_, the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to the award shall be determined at the "target" level of performance for such
award (or, if no target is specified, at the maximum number of shares subject
to the award).

(f) _Termination of Company Stock Plans_. The Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Company Stock Plans)
shall take such actions as are necessary to approve and effectuate the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 2.04_, including making any
determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof
or any administrator of a Company Stock Plan as may be necessary. The Company
(including the Company Board and each relevant committee thereof) will ensure

other similar incentive equity or stock plan will have any right thereunder to
acquire any equity securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Subsidiaries.

Section 3.01 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has all requisite power and
authority to conduct its businesses as presently conducted, except where the

is duly qualified or licensed to do business in each jurisdiction where the
nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties make
such qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed, individually or in the aggregate,

Section 3.02 _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite limited liability company or

no other corporate proceedings or approvals (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any shareholder approval) on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are

Agreement and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the
Company, this Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation,
enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms
except, in each case, as enforcement may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar Laws affecting creditors
rights generally and by general principles of equity.

(a) The execution and delivery by each of Parent and Merger Sub of this
Agreement does not, and the performance by each of Parent and Merger Sub of
its obligations hereunder and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, conflict with, or result
in any violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any obligation, any obligation to make an offer to purchase or
redeem any Indebtedness or capital stock or any loss of a material benefit
under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or
assets of Parent or Merger Sub under, any provision of (i) the governing

 



11  or organizational documents of Parent or Merger Sub; (ii) any written and
legally binding contract, lease, license, indenture, note, bond, agreement,
undertaking or other instrument (a " _Contract_ ") to which either Parent or
Merger Sub is a party or by which any of their respective properties or assets
is bound; or (iii) subject to the filings and other matters referred to in
_Section 3.03(b)_, any judgment, order, decree, decision, injunction,
ruling, writ or other similar requirement (" _Order_ ") or statute, law,
ordinance, rule, regulation, code, constitution, treaty or other binding legal
requirement or rule of law (" _Law_ ") enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced
or entered by any Governmental Entity, in each case, applicable to Parent or
Merger Sub or their respective properties or assets, other than, in the case
of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, any matters that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(b) No consent, approval, clearance, waiver or order (each a " _Consent_ ")
of or from, or registration, declaration, notice or filing made to or with any
government, court of competent jurisdiction, administrative agency or
commission or other governmental authority or instrumentality, whether
federal, national, state, provincial or local and whether domestic, foreign or
supranational (a " _Governmental Entity_ "), is required to be obtained or
made by or with respect to Parent or its Affiliates in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or its performance of its obligations
hereunder or the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions

Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.04 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company true and
complete copies of the fully executed (a) debt commitment letter from Ares
Capital Corporation, Ares Capital Management LLC, Golub Capital LLC, TPG
Specialty Lending, Inc., Varagon Capital Partners, L.P., and American
International Group, Inc. (collectively, the " _Lenders_ "), dated as of the
date hereof (including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments thereto
(and together with any Fee Letter) as of the date of this Agreement,
collectively, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which, and
subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Lenders have committed to
lend the amounts set forth therein to Project Alpha Intermediate Holding,
Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Intermediate Sub_ "; references
to Parent in this Agreement shall, to the extent appropriate in the context,
be deemed to refer to Intermediate Sub and any other Subsidiary of Parent that
may hold equity in Intermediate Sub) and Merger Sub, for the purpose of
funding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Debt
Financing_ "), and (b) equity commitment letters from each of the Guarantor,
Thoma Bravo Fund XI, L.P., and Thoma Bravo Special Opportunities Fund II,
L.P. (collectively, the " _Sponsors_ "), each dated as of the date hereof
(including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments thereto as of the
date of this Agreement, the 

 



12  " _Equity Commitment Letters_ " and, together with the Debt Commitment
Letter, the " _Financing Commitments_ ") pursuant to which, and subject to the
terms and conditions thereof, the Sponsors have committed to invest the
amounts set forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ " and, together with the
Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that solely in
the case of the Fee Letter, true and complete copies have been delivered to
the Company with only the fee amounts and market flex terms redacted in a
customary matter (so long as the redaction does not cover terms that would
adversely affect the conditionality, availability or termination of the Debt
Financing). The Equity Commitment Letters provide, and will continue to
provide, that the Company is a third party beneficiary thereof as set forth
therein. As of the date hereof, all of the Financing Commitments are in full
force and effect and are legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent,
Merger Sub and, in the case of the Debt Commitment Letter to the Knowledge of
Parent, the other parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with their
respective terms except, in each case, as enforcement may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar Laws affecting creditors
rights generally and by general principles of equity. As of the date of
this Agreement, no Financing Commitment has been withdrawn, terminated,
repudiated, rescinded, amended, supplemented or modified, in any respect, and
no such withdrawal, termination, repudiation, rescission, amendment,
supplement or modification is contemplated. Assuming the accuracy of the
Companys representations and warranties set forth in _Article IV_ , as of the
date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, any
other counterparty thereto has committed any breach of any of its covenants
or other obligations set forth in, or is in default under, any of the
Financing Commitments, and to the Knowledge of Parent no event has occurred or
circumstance exists that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would or would reasonably be expected to (i) constitute or result in a breach
or default on the part of any Person under any of the Financing Commitments,
(ii) constitute or result in a failure to satisfy any of the terms
or conditions set forth in any of the Financing Commitments, (iii) make any
of the assumptions or any of the statements set forth in the Financing
Commitments inaccurate in any material respect or (iv) otherwise result in any
portion of the Financing not being available. Assuming the accuracy of the
Companys representations and warranties set forth in _Article IV_ , as of the
date of this Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe (both before and after
giving effect to any "flex" provisions contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter) that it will be unable to satisfy, on a timely basis, any term or
condition to be satisfied by it contained in the Financing Commitments or that
the full amounts committed pursuant to the Financing Commitments will not be
available as of the Closing if the terms or conditions to be satisfied by it
contained in the Financing Commitments are satisfied. There are no conditions
precedent or, as of the date of this Agreement, other conditions related to
the Financing, or any contracts, agreements, arrangements or understandings
related to the Financing, other than the terms thereof set forth in the
Financing Commitments. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has fully
paid any and all commitment fees or other fees or deposits required by the
Financing Commitments to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement. The
aggregate proceeds from the Financing constitute all of the financing required
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and,
assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_ and
_Section 7.03_, are sufficient in amount to provide 

 



13  Parent with the funds necessary for it to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby at the Closing and to satisfy its obligations under this
Agreement at the Closing, including for Parent to pay the aggregate amounts
payable pursuant to _Article II_ at the Closing, for the Surviving Corporation
to pay the aggregate amounts payable as soon as possible following the Closing
pursuant to _Section 2.04_ (other than  _Section 2.04(c)(ii)_) and for the
payment of all fees, costs and expenses to be paid by Parent related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including such fees, costs and
expenses relating to the Financing. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is aware of
any direct or indirect limitation or other restriction on the ability of the
lender parties in the Debt Financing to provide financing for other potential
purchasers of the Company.

 

Section 3.05 _Guaranty_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Parent has delivered to the Company the Guaranty of the Guarantor, dated as
of the date hereof, in favor of the Company. The Guaranty is in full force and
effect and is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor,
enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms except
as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or
similar Laws affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles
of equity. No event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, could constitute a default on the part of the Guarantor under the
Guaranty. The Guarantor has the financial capacity to pay and perform its
obligations under the Guaranty, and all funds necessary for the Guarantor to
fulfill its obligation under the Guaranty will be available to the Guarantor
for so long as the Guaranty remains in effect.

Section 3.06 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing will, at
the date it is first mailed to the Companys shareholders or at the time of
the Company Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. No
representation is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to statements made
or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by the
Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement or
any Other Required Company Filing.

Section 3.07 _Litigation_. There is no suit, action or other proceeding
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or Merger
Sub that, individually or in the aggregate, would have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect, nor is there any Order outstanding against or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or Merger Sub that,
individually or in the aggregate, would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 3.08 _Absence of Certain Agreements_. Except the Voting Agreements,
neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates has entered into any contract,
agreement, arrangement or understanding, or authorized, committed or agreed to
enter into any contract, agreement, arrangement or understanding, pursuant to
which any shareholder of the Company would be entitled to
receive consideration of a different amount or nature than the Merger
Consideration or pursuant to which any shareholder of the Company (a) agrees
to vote to adopt this Agreement or the Merger (b) agrees to vote against any
Superior Proposal or (c) as of the date hereof, has agreed to provide equity
capital, directly or indirectly, to Parent or Merger Sub to finance in whole
or in part the Merger.

 



14 Section 3.09 _Brokers  Fees and Expenses_. No broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other Person, other than Goldman, Sachs and Co., the fees
and expenses of which will be paid by Parent, is entitled to any brokers,
finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in connection
with the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or its
affiliates.

 

Section 3.10 _Capitalization of Merger Sub_. As of the date hereof, the
authorized share capital of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares, $0.01 par
value per share, 1,000 of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the

of Parent. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated hereby, and it has not conducted any business prior

transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, liabilities related to the Debt Financing). All of the issued and
outstanding share capital of Intermediate Sub is, and at the Effective Time
will be, owned by Parent or a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of

assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident to
its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger and other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of

Section 3.11 _Ownership of Company Common Stock_. Neither Parent nor Merger
Sub, any controlled Affiliates of either of the foregoing, or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, any Person to which Parent or Merger Sub may assign any
of its rights and obligations under this Agreement is, nor at any time during
the last three (3) years has been, an "interested stockholder" of the
Company, in each case as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL. None of Parent,
Merger Sub or Thoma Bravo, LLC or any of its affiliated investment funds
beneficially owns (as such term is used in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the

other rights to acquire Company Common Stock or other securities of, or any
other economic interest (through derivative securities or otherwise) in, the

Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries has all requisite power and authority to conduct its businesses
as presently conducted. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is

Business Days after the commencement of such Alternative Proposal, (E) fail to
include the recommendation of the Company Board in favor of approval and
adoption of this Agreement and the Merger in the Proxy Statement (any of the
foregoing clauses (A) through (E) being an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_
") or (F) enter into any letter of intent or agreement in principle or
any agreement providing for any Alternative Proposal or that would reasonably
be expected to lead to an Alternative Proposal or that contradicts this
Agreement or requires the Company to abandon this Agreement (except for
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 5.03(a)_, if the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective Representatives
receives prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval a written
Alternative Proposal by any Person that was not solicited in material breach
of _Section 5.03(a)_, the Company and its Representatives may, prior to (but
not after) obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, take the actions set
forth in subsections (i) and (ii) of this _Section 5.03(b)_ if the Company
Board (or any committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors), that such
Alternative Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary duties under
applicable Law: (i) furnish non-public information to and afford access to the
business, employees, officers, contracts, properties, assets, books and
records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the Person who made
such Alternative Proposal and such Persons Representatives pursuant to (but
only pursuant to) one or more Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements (provided
that the Company has previously furnished, made available or provided access
to Parent to any such non-public information or substantially concurrently
(and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours thereafter) does so); and (ii)
enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any Person regarding such Alternative Proposal.

 



39 (c) Reasonably promptly (but in no event more than twenty-four (24) hours)
following the Companys receipt of any Alternative Proposal from and after
the date of this Agreement, the Company shall advise Parent in writing of the
receipt of such Alternative Proposal, and the terms and conditions of such
Alternative Proposal (including, in each case, the identity of the Person
making any such Alternative Proposal), and the Company shall as reasonably
promptly as practicable provide to Parent: (i) a copy of such Alternative
Proposal, if in writing; or (ii) a written summary of the material terms of
such Alternative Proposal, if oral. In addition, the Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed in all material respects on a reasonably current basis, or
upon Parents reasonable request, of the status and material terms of
(including material amendments or revisions or proposed material amendments or
revisions to) such Alternative Proposal.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any time prior to (but
not after) obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board may,
if the Company has received an Alternative Proposal from any Person that is
not withdrawn and the Company concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior
Proposal, (i) make an Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii) terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_ to enter into a definitive written
agreement providing for such Superior Proposal simultaneously with the
termination of this Agreement, in each case only if (A) if the Company Board
(or any committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation
with its financial and outside legal advisors), that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the directors exercise of their
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (B) the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation with its
financial and outside legal advisors) that such Alternative Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and (C) the Company has complied in all
material respects with this _Section 5.03_ with respect to such Alternative
Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) no Adverse Recommendation Change
may be made and (2) no termination of this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 5.03(d)_ and _Section 8.01(d)_ may be effected, in each case until
after the fourth (4th) Business Day (the " _Notice Period_ ") following
Parents receipt of a written notice from the Company advising Parent that the
Company has received an Alternative Proposal that is not withdrawn and that
the Company Board (or any committee thereof) has concluded in good faith
constitutes a Superior Proposal and, absent any revision to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board (or any committee thereof)
intends to make an Adverse Recommendation Change on account of
such Alternative Proposal or terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 5.03(d)_ and _Section 8.01(d)_ (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_
") and specifying the reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of
any such Superior Proposal (including copies of all relevant documents in the
Companys possession relating to such Superior Proposal) and the identity of
the party making the Superior Proposal (in each case to the extent not
previously provided by the Company to Parent). During the Notice Period, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to (1) negotiate with
Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that the Alternative Proposal would cease to constitute a
Superior Proposal and (2) permit Parent and its Representatives to make a
presentation to the Company Board (or a committee thereof) regarding this
Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent Parent
desires to make such presentation). Any material amendment to the financial
terms or any other material amendment of such Superior Proposal shall require
a new Notice of Superior Proposal and the Company shall be required to

 



40  comply again with the requirements of this _Section 5.03(d)_, including the
Notice Period (it being understood that the "Notice Period" in respect of such
new Notice of Superior Proposal will be two (2) Business Days). In
determining whether an Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal,
the Company Board (or committee thereof) shall take into account any changes
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement timely proposed by Parent in
response to a Notice of Superior Proposal.

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any time prior to
(but not after) obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board
may make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an event, occurrence,
change, effect, condition, development or state of facts or
circumstances (other than related to an Alternative Proposal) arising after
the date of this Agreement that was neither known to, nor reasonably
foreseeable by, the Company Board prior to the date of this Agreement (an "
_Intervening Event_ "), only if the Company Board (or any committee thereof)
has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial and
outside legal advisors) that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Adverse Recommendation Change
may be made until the conclusion of the Notice Period following Parents
receipt of a written notice from the Company advising Parent that absent any
revision to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board (or
any committee thereof) intends to make an Adverse Recommendation Change due to
an Intervening Event and specifying in reasonable detail the reasons for such
Adverse Recommendation Change. During the Notice Period, the Company shall,
and shall cause its Representatives to (1) negotiate with Parent and its
Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to
make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that
the Company Board (or committee thereof) no longer determines that the failure
to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event
would be inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law and (2) permit Parent and its Representatives to make a
presentation to the Company Board (or committee thereof) regarding this
Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent Parent
desires to make such presentation). In determining whether to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event, the Company Board
(or a committee thereof) shall take into account any changes to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement timely proposed by Parent in response to such
Intervening Event.

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board (or any committee thereof) from issuing a "stop, look and
listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or
complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect
to an Alternative Proposal or from making any disclosure to the Companys
shareholders required (after consultation with outside legal advisors) under
applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, a factually accurate public
statement that describes the Companys receipt of an Alternative Proposal and
the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed an
Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

(g) The Company agrees that any breach of this _Section 5.03_ by any of the
Company Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives (other than any
inadvertent breaches thereof not intended to result in an Alternative
Proposal) shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company.

 



41 (h) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Alternative Proposal_ " means any bona fide proposal or offer (whether
or not in writing), with respect to any (A) merger, consolidation, share
exchange, equity investment, recapitalization (including a leveraged
recapitalization or extraordinary dividend), reorganization, other business
combination or similar transaction involving the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries, pursuant to which Persons other than the shareholders of the
Company immediately prior to such transaction own securities representing more
than 20% of the voting power of the Company or any surviving or resulting
entity immediately following such transaction; (B) sale, contribution or
other disposition, directly or indirectly of any business or assets of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the
consolidated revenues, net income or assets of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (C) issuance, sale or other disposition,
directly or indirectly, to any Person (or the shareholders of any Person) or
"group" of Persons (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) of
securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) representing 20% or
more of the voting power of the Company; (D) transaction in which any Person
(or the shareholders of any Person) shall acquire, directly or indirectly,
beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire beneficial ownership, or
formation of any "group" which beneficially owns or has the right to acquire
beneficial ownership of, securities (or options, rights or warrants to
purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities)
representing 20% or more of the voting power of the Company; or (E) any
combination of the foregoing (in each case, other than the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written proposal or offer
with respect to an Alternative Proposal (with all percentages in the
definition of Alternative Proposal increased to 51%) made by a third party or
"group" on terms which the Company Board (or any committee thereof) determines
in its good faith judgment (after consultation with its financial and outside
legal advisors) to be likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms
and more favorable to the holders of Company Common Stock than the Merger
(including any changes to the terms of this Agreement committed to by Parent
to the Company in writing in response to such Alternative Proposal under the
provisions of _Section 5.03(d)_), taking into account all the terms and
conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including, among other things,
if appropriate, financing contingencies, regulatory approvals, shareholder
litigation, identity of the Person making the Alternative Proposal (including
whether shareholder approval of such Person is required), breakup fee and
expense reimbursement provisions and other events or circumstances beyond the
control of the Company).

 



42 (iii) " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means a confidentiality
agreement containing terms not materially less favorable in the aggregate to
the Company than the terms set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement (it
being understood and hereby agreed that such confidentiality agreement need
not contain a "standstill" or similar provision that prohibits the
counterparty thereto or any of its Affiliates or Representatives from making
any Alternative Proposal, acquiring the Company or taking any other similar
action);  _provided_ , _however_ , that such confidentiality agreement shall
not prohibit compliance by the Company with any of the provisions of this
_Section 5.03_.

 

ARTICLE VI

_Additional Agreements_

Section 6.01 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Other Required Company
Filing; Company Shareholders Meeting_. 

(a) As reasonably promptly as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC a
proxy statement to be sent to the Companys shareholders relating to the
Company Shareholders Meeting (together with any amendments or supplements
thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). If the Company determines that it
is required to file any document other than the Proxy Statement with the SEC
in connection with the Merger pursuant to applicable Law (such document, as
amended or supplemented, an " _Other Required Company Filing_ "), then the
Company shall as reasonably promptly as practicable prepare and file such
Other Required Company Filing with the SEC. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement and any Other Required
Company Filing to comply as to form and substance in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC
and NASDAQ. Parent shall furnish all information concerning Parent and its
Affiliates to the Company, and provide such other assistance, as may be
reasonably requested in connection with the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Proxy Statement and any Other Required Company Filing. The
Company shall reasonably promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing and
shall provide Parent with copies of all non-routine correspondence between the
Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other
hand, related to the Proxy Statement and any Other Required Company Filing.
The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as reasonably
promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the
Proxy Statement and any Other

 



43  Required Company Filing, and Parent will cooperate in connection therewith.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement
(including any amendment or supplement thereto) or any Other Required Company
Filing or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the
Company (i) shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Proxy Statement or Other Required Company Filing or response
(including the proposed final version of the Proxy Statement or Other Required
Company Filing or response) and (ii) shall consider in good faith all comments
reasonably proposed by Parent.

 

(b) If prior to the Effective Time any change occurs with respect to
information supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Proxy Statement or Other
Required Company Filing which is required to be described in an amendment of,
or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement or Other Required Company Filing,
Parent shall reasonably promptly notify the Company of such event, and Parent
and the Company shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any
necessary amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or Other Required
Company Filing, and as required by Law, in disseminating the information
contained in such amendment or supplement to the Companys shareholders.
Nothing in this _Section 6.01(b)_ shall limit the obligations of any party
under _Section 6.01(a)_.

 

(c) If prior to the Effective Time any event occurs with respect to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any change occurs with respect to other
information supplied by the Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement or
Other Required Company Filing, which is required to be described in an
amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement or Other Required
Company Filing, the Company shall reasonably promptly notify Parent of such
event, and the Company shall as reasonably promptly as practicable file any
necessary amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or Other Required
Company Filing with the SEC and, as required by Law, disseminate the
information contained in such amendment or supplement to the Companys
shareholders. Nothing in this _Section 6.01(c)_ shall limit the obligations
of any party under _Section 6.01(a)_.

 

(d) The Company shall, as reasonably promptly as practicable after the SEC
Clearance Date, duly call, establish a record date for, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of (i)
seeking the Company Shareholder Approval; and (ii) in accordance with Section
14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder,
seeking advisory approval of a proposal to the Companys shareholders for a
non-binding, advisory vote to approve certain compensation that may become
payable to the Companys named executive officers in connection with the
completion of the Merger. Without the prior written consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the
foregoing shall be the only matters (other than procedure matters) which the
Company shall propose to be acted on by the holders of Company Common Stock
at the Company Shareholders Meeting. In connection with the foregoing, the
Company shall (i) file the definitive Proxy Statement with the SEC and cause
the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys shareholders as
of the record date established for the Company Shareholders Meeting as
promptly as practicable (and in any event within seven (7) Business Days)
after the date on which the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on
the Proxy Statement (the " _SEC Clearance Date_ "; _provided_ that if the SEC
has failed to affirmatively notify the Company within ten (10) calendar days
after the initial filing of the Proxy Statement with the SEC that it will or
will not be reviewing the Proxy Statement, then such date shall be the " _SEC_

 



44   __ _Clearance Date_ "); and (ii) subject to Section 5.03(d), use reasonable
best efforts to solicit the Company Shareholder Approval. The Company shall,
through the Company Board, recommend to its shareholders that they give the
Company Shareholder Approval (the " _Company Recommendation_ ") and shall
include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement, in each case, except to
the extent that the Company Board shall have made an Adverse Recommendation
Change as permitted by Section 5.03(d). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Company may postpone or adjourn the Company
Shareholders Meeting only (i) with the consent of Parent and Merger Sub, (ii)
for the absence of a quorum, (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for any
supplemental or amended disclosure which the Company has determined in good
faith is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended
disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Companys shareholders prior
to the Company Shareholders Meeting or following an order or request from the
SEC or (iv) to allow additional solicitation of votes in order to obtain the
Company Shareholder Approval. Once the Company has established the record date
for the Company Shareholders Meeting, the Company shall not change such record
date or establish a different record date without the prior written consent
of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), unless required to do so by applicable Law. In the event that the
date of the Company Shareholders Meeting as originally called is for any
reason adjourned or postponed or otherwise delayed, the Company agrees that
unless Parent shall have otherwise approved in writing, it shall use
reasonable best efforts to implement such adjournment or postponement or other
delay in such a way that the Company does not establish a new record date for
the Company Shareholders Meeting, as so adjourned, postponed or delayed,
except as required by applicable Law. Unless this Agreement is validly
terminated in accordance with _Section 8.01_, the Company shall submit this
Agreement and the Merger to its shareholders at the Company Shareholder
Meeting, even if the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has effected an
Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

Section 6.02 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable
Law, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to, afford to
Parent and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours,
upon reasonable advance notice, during the period prior to the Effective Time,
to all their respective properties, Contracts, books and records (including
Tax Returns) and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each
Company Subsidiary to, furnish reasonably promptly to Parent and its
Representatives (A) all other information concerning its business, properties
and personnel as Parent may reasonably request for any reasonable business
purposes related to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (in each case, in a manner so as to not interfere in any material
respect with the normal business operations of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary) and (B) to the extent available for the period beginning after the
date of this Agreement and ending at the Effective Time, as soon as
practicable after the end of each month, and in any event within thirty (30)
days thereafter, a copy of the monthly consolidated financial statements of
the Company, including statements of financial condition, results of
operations and statements of cash flow in the form created by the Company in
the ordinary course of business; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall not be required to permit such access or make such disclosure, to the
extent it determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that
such disclosure or access would (a) violate the terms of any confidentiality

 



45  agreement or other Contract with a third party ( _provided_ that the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the required consent
of such third party to such access or disclosure and implement appropriate
procedures to enable the disclosure of such information); (b) result in the
loss of any attorney-client privilege ( _provided_ that the Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in
a manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-client privilege); or (c)
violate any Law ( _provided_ that the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide such access or make such disclosure in a manner
that does not violate Law). Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to provide any
access or make any disclosure to Parent pursuant to this  _Section 6.02_ to
the extent such access or information is reasonably pertinent to a litigation
where the Company or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent or any
of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties. All information
exchanged pursuant to this _Section 6.02_ shall be subject to the
confidentiality agreement, dated as of April 4, 2016, between Thoma Bravo, LLC
and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 

Section 6.03 _Efforts to Consummate_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of Parent and
the Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to reasonably
promptly take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and
applicable Laws to consummate and make effective as reasonably promptly as
practicable after the date hereof and in any event no later than the End Date
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) preparing as
reasonably promptly as practicable all necessary applications, notices,
petitions, filings, ruling requests and other documents and to obtain as
reasonably promptly as practicable all Consents necessary or advisable to be
obtained from any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the " _Governmental Approvals_
") and (ii) as reasonably promptly as practicable taking all steps as may be
necessary to obtain all such Governmental Approvals. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to (A) make an
appropriate and complete filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to
the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby within ten
(10) Business Days following the date of this Agreement, (B) make all other
required filings pursuant to other Regulatory Laws with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as reasonably promptly as practicable, and
(C) not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into
any agreement with the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") or the United
States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other Governmental Entity
not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except
with the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. Each of Parent and
the Company shall supply as reasonably promptly as practicable any additional
information or documentation that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or
any other Regulatory Law and use its reasonable best efforts to take all
other actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any other
Regulatory Law as soon as possible and in any event no later than the End
Date.

 



46 (b) Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with the actions
referenced in  _Section 6.03(a)_ to obtain all Governmental Approvals under
the HSR Act or any other Regulatory Laws, (i) cooperate in all respects with
each other in connection with any communication, filing or submission and in
connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding
initiated by a private party; (ii) keep the other party and/or its counsel
informed of any communication received by such party from, or given by such
party to, the FTC, the DOJ or any other U.S. or other Governmental Entity and
of any communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated
hereby; (iii) consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference
with the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity or, in connection with
any proceeding by a private party, with any other person, and to the extent
permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other Governmental Entity or other
person, give the other party and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and conferences; and (iv) permit the other party
and/or its counsel to review in advance any submission, filing
or communication (and documents submitted therewith) intended to be given by
it to the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity; _provided_ that
materials may be redacted to remove references concerning the valuation of the
businesses of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. Parent and the
Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material to be provided to the other under this
_Section 6.03(b)_ as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and
the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust
counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission
is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the
Company, as the case may be) or its legal counsel.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, (i)
in no event will the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries, Parent or
Merger Sub be required to take or commit to take any actions that would be
reasonably likely to materially adversely impact or impose limitations on the
ownership by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of all or a material portion
of the Companys business or assets and (ii) in no event will Parent or Merger
Sub be obligated pursuant to this Agreement to (or to cause or direct their
Affiliates to), and the Company and the Company Subsidiaries will
not, without the written consent of Parent, sell, divest, license or hold
separate any capital stock or other equity or voting interests, assets
(whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or businesses.

 

Section 6.04 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent agrees that
all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time) now
existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as provided in their respective
governing or organizational documents and any indemnification or other similar
agreements of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, in each case as
in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms (it being agreed that after the Closing
such rights shall be mandatory rather than permissive, if applicable), and

 



47  Parent shall cause each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to
perform its obligations thereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, during the
period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary
of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and
the Surviving Corporation agrees that it will, indemnify and hold harmless
each individual who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior
to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who
thereafter commences prior to the Effective Time, serving at the request of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a director or officer of
another Person (the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ "), against all claims,
losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees,
costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements (" _Losses_
"), incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (including with respect to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including
this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated hereby), arising
out of or pertaining to the fact that the Company Indemnified Party is or was
a director or officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or is or was
serving at the request of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a director
or officer of another Person, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law. In the event of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding, (x) each
Company Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred
in the defense of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding from the
Surviving Corporation in accordance with the organizational documents and any
indemnification or other similar agreements of the Surviving Corporation as in
effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that any person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent
required by the DGCL or the Surviving Corporations certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) or any such
indemnification or other similar agreements, to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined by final adjudication that such person is not entitled
to indemnification and (y) the Surviving Corporation shall reasonably
cooperate in the defense of any such matter.

(b) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall either cause to be maintained in effect
the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries or provide substitute policies for the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and their current and former directors and officers who are
currently covered by the directors and officers and fiduciary liability
insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries, in either case, of not less than the existing coverage and
having other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
coverage currently maintained by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the
Effective Time (with insurance carriers having at least an "A" rating by A.M.
Best with respect to directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance), except that in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect to such insurance
policies, in the aggregate for all six (6) years, more than 300% of the
aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the Company prior to

 



48  the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ "), and if the Surviving
Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance required by this _Section
6.04(b)_ it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the
years within such six (6)-year period for a premium equal to the Maximum
Amount. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the Closing Date the Company may,
at its option, purchase a "tail" directors and officers liability insurance
policy and fiduciary liability insurance policy for the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and their current and former directors and officers who
are currently covered by the directors and officers and fiduciary liability
insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries, such tail to provide coverage in an amount not less than the
existing coverage and to have other terms not less favorable to the insured
persons than the directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ that in no event shall
the cost of any such tail policy exceed the Maximum Amount. Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain such policies in full force and effect,
and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

prior to such disclosure). The Company and Parent agree that the initial
press release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties.

Section 6.08 _Employment and Company Benefits_.

 

(a) During the one (1)-year period immediately following the Closing Date,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide to each
Company Employee, for so long as the Company Employee remains so employed by

similar base salary and substantially similar target annual bonus opportunity
provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date and
(ii) other compensation and employee benefits (excluding cash and equity-based
long-term incentive opportunities) that, with respect to each employee,
are substantially similar in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits
provided to such employee immediately prior to the Closing Date. Without
limiting the foregoing, as of the Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, comply with the terms of all employment agreements
covering Company Employees. " _Company Employee_ " means any employee of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing.

 

(b) Parent shall provide each Company Employee who incurs a termination of
employment during the one (1)-year period immediately following the Closing
Date with severance benefits that are no less favorable than the severance
benefits to which such employee would have been entitled with respect to such
termination under the severance policies of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and employment agreements covering Company Employees as in
effect immediately prior to the Closing Date or, if greater, the severance
benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Parent.

 



50 (c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, give Company
Employees credit for such Company Employees service with the Company for
purposes of eligibility, vesting, and determination of the level of vacation
and severance benefits ( but not for purposes of benefit accruals under
defined benefit pension plans) under any benefit plans maintained by Parent
or the Surviving Corporation in which a Company Employee participates to the
same extent and for the same purpose as recognized by the Company and the
analogous Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such service shall not be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits with
respect to the same period of service.

 

(d) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to take
commercially reasonable efforts to, (i) waive any preexisting
condition limitations otherwise applicable to Company Employees and their
eligible dependents under any plan of Parent or any of its Affiliates that

employees as of the Closing Date under the analogous Company Benefit Plan;
(ii) honor any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by
the Company Employees and their eligible dependents under the health plans in
which they participated immediately prior to the Closing Date during the
portion of the calendar year prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any
deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums under health plans of
Parent or any of its Affiliates in which they are eligible to participate
after the Closing Date in the same plan year in which such deductibles, co-
payments or out-of-pocket maximums were incurred; and (iii) waive any
waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement that would
otherwise be applicable to a Company Employee and his or her eligible
dependents on or after the Closing Date, in each case to the extent such
Company Employee or eligible dependent had satisfied any similar limitation
or requirement under an analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Closing
Date.

(e) No provision of this Agreement shall (i) create any right in any employee
of the Company to continued employment by Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, or preclude the ability of Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation to terminate the employment of any employee for any reason; (ii)
require Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation to continue any
Company Benefit Plans or prevent the amendment, modification or termination
thereof after the Closing Date; (iii) confer upon any Company Employee any
rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement; or (iv) be treated as
an amendment to any particular employee benefit plan of Parent or the Company.

 

Section 6.09 _Merger Sub; Parent Subsidiaries_. Parent shall cause each of
Merger Sub, Intermediate Sub and any other applicable Subsidiary of Parent to
comply with and perform all of Parents and Merger Subs obligations under or
relating to this Agreement and refrain from taking any action or inaction as
to which Parent is prohibited or restricted under this Agreement,

 



51  including in the case of Merger Sub to consummate the Merger on the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the case of Intermediate
Sub, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent that is or becomes a party
to the Debt Commitment Letter or any Financing Agreement (including in
connection with any Alternative Financing) to comply with and perform all of
Parents obligations under this Agreement in respect thereof. 

Section 6.10 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent acknowledges and agrees that the Company, the Company Subsidiaries,
and their respective Representatives shall not have any responsibility for,
or incur any liability to any Person under, any financing that Parent may
raise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any cooperation provided pursuant to _Section 6.11(a)_ and that Parent shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, and their
respective Representatives from and against any and all Losses suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with the Financing and any
information utilized in connection therewith (other than with respect to any
material misstatement or omission in information provided by the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries).

 

(b) Parent shall use, and shall cause its Affiliates to use, their respective
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and
obtain the proceeds of the Financing on the terms and conditions, taken as a
whole (including any "flex" provisions), described in the Financing
Commitments, including executing and delivering all such documents and
instruments as may be reasonably required thereunder and using (and causing
its Affiliates to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to:

 

(i) comply with and maintain in effect the Debt Financing and the Debt
Commitment Letter, negotiate and enter into definitive financing agreements
with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions contained in
the Debt Commitment Letter (the " _Financing Agreements_ ") (and comply with
and maintain in effect the Financing Agreements) so that the Financing
Agreements are in effect as promptly as practicable but in any event no later
than the Closing;

(ii) satisfy, or cause their respective Representatives to satisfy, as
promptly as practicable and on a timely basis all conditions to the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and Financing Agreements
(including by consummating the financing pursuant to the terms of the Equity
Commitment Letters and by paying any commitment fees or other fees or deposits
required by the Financing Commitments or the Financing Agreements);

 



52 (iii) accept (and comply with) to the fullest extent all "flex" provisions
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and the Financing Agreements to the
extent such "flex" provisions are exercised in accordance with the terms
thereof;

 

(iv) in the event that all conditions to the Financing have been satisfied or
waived, enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter and Financing
Agreements in the event of a breach by the Financing Sources under the Debt
Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements (provided that, Parent and its
Affiliates shall not be required to pursue litigation against the Financing
Sources); and

(v) cause the Financing Sources, the Sponsors and any other Persons providing
Financing to fund the Financing no later than the Closing.

(c) Parent shall not agree to or permit any amendment, supplement,
modification or replacement of, or grant any waiver of, any condition, remedy
or other provision under any Financing Commitment or any Financing Agreement
without the prior written consent of the Company if such amendment,
supplement, modification, replacement or waiver would or would reasonably be
expected to (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing from that
contemplated by the Financing Commitments delivered as of the date hereof
(provided that Parent may decrease the amount of the Debt Financing so long
as the Equity Financing under the Equity Commitment Letters is increased in a
corresponding amount to the extent permitted pursuant to the Financing
Commitments), (ii) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise
expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing
in a manner materially adverse to the Company, (iii) make it less likely that
the Financing would be funded (including by making the conditions to obtaining
the Financing less likely to occur) or otherwise prevent or delay or impair
the ability or likelihood of Parent to timely consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or (iv) adversely impact the ability of Parent
to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Financing Commitments
or the Financing Agreements. Parent shall not agree to the withdrawal,
termination, repudiation or rescission of any Financing Commitment or
Financing Agreement without the prior written consent of the Company, and
shall not release or consent to the termination of the obligations of the
Lenders under the Debt Commitment Letter. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent
and Merger Sub may modify, supplement or amend the Debt Commitment Letter to
add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents, documentation
agents or entities in similar roles. Upon any amendment, supplement,
modification or replacement of, or waiver of, any Financing Commitment or
Financing Agreement in accordance with this _Section 6.10(c)_, Parent shall
deliver a copy thereof to the Company and references herein to "Financing
Commitments", "Debt Commitment Letter", "Equity Commitment Letters" and
"Financing Agreements" shall include and mean such documents as amended,
supplemented, modified, replaced or waived in compliance with this _Section
6.10(c)_, and references to "Financing", "Debt Financing" and
"Equity Financing" shall include and mean the financing contemplated by the
Financing Commitments or Financing Agreements as amended, supplemented,
modified, replaced or waived in compliance with this _Section 6.10(c)_, as
applicable. Parent acknowledges and agrees that the certificate to be
delivered by an authorized officer of the Company under paragraph (g)(ii) of
Exhibit A of the Debt Commitment Letter with respect to minimum cash on the
balance sheet of the Company, calculated on a pro forma basis after giving
effect to the transactions described in the Debt Commitment Letter, shall be
delivered by an individual who is an authorized officer of the Company as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



53 (d) In the event that all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes or
could become unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any "flex"
provisions) or from the sources contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter or
the Financing Agreements for any reason or any of the Debt Commitment Letter
or the Financing Agreements shall be withdrawn, terminated, repudiated or
rescinded for any reason (but without limiting the obligations of Parent in
the penultimate sentence of _Section 6.10(c)_ and in _Section 6.10(b)(iv)_
and  _Section 6.10(b)(v)_), (i) Parent shall promptly so notify the Company
and (ii) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain,
as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event (and in
any event no later than the Closing), and to negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to, alternative debt financing from the
same or alternative debt financing sources (the " _Alternative Financing_ ")
in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (or replace any unavailable portion of the Debt Financing), and to
obtain a new financing commitment letter (including any associated engagement
letter and related Fee Letter) with respect to such Alternative Financing
(collectively, the " _New Debt Commitment Letter_ "), copies of which shall be
promptly provided to the Company (with only the fee amounts and market flex
terms redacted from the Fee Letter in a customary manner (so long as the
redaction does not cover terms that would adversely affect the conditionality,
availability or termination of the Debt Financing)); _provided_ , that Parent
shall not be required to obtain Alternative Financing on terms and conditions
that are materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent than those in
the Debt Commitment Letter that such Alternative Financing and New Debt
Commitment Letter would replace. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no Alternative Financing or New Debt Commitment Letter may expand upon the
conditions precedent or contingencies to the funding of the Debt Financing on
the Closing Date as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter in effect on the
date hereof or otherwise include terms (including any "flex" provisions) that
would reasonably be expected to make the likelihood that the Alternative
Financing would be funded less likely. In the event any Alternative Financing
is obtained and a New Debt Commitment Letter is entered into in accordance
with this _Section 6.10(d)_, Parent shall deliver a copy thereof to the
Company (with only the fee amounts and market flex terms redacted from the Fee
Letter in a customary manner (so long as the redaction does not cover terms
that would adversely affect the conditionality, availability or termination of
the Debt Financing)) and references herein to (A) "Financing Commitments" and
"Debt Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include and mean the Debt
Commitment Letter to the extent not superseded by a New Debt Commitment
Letter, as the case may be, at the time in question and any New Debt
Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect, and (B) "Financing" or "Debt
Financing" shall include and mean the debt financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter as modified pursuant to the preceding clause (A). Without
the Companys prior written consent, Parent shall not directly or indirectly
take any action that would or would be reasonably expected to result in the
Financing not being available.

 



54 (e) Parent shall (i) furnish the Company drafts (when available) and
thereafter true and complete and executed copies of the Financing Agreements
promptly upon their execution, (ii) give the Company prompt written notice of
any default, breach or threatened default or breach (or any event or
circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any default or breach) by any party to
any of the Financing Commitments or the Financing Agreements of which Parent
or any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives becomes aware or
any withdrawal, termination, repudiation or rescission or threatened
withdrawal, termination, repudiation or rescission thereof, and (iii)
otherwise keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of its efforts
to arrange the Financing (or any Alternative Financing). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent shall give the Company prompt notice (A)
of the receipt or delivery of any notice or other communication, in each
case from any Person with respect to (x) any actual or potential default
under or breach of any provisions of the Financing Commitments or Financing
Agreements by Parent, or any withdrawal, termination, repudiation or
rescission or threatened withdrawal, termination, repudiation or rescission
thereof by any party to any of the Financing Commitments or Financing
Agreements or (y) any dispute or disagreement between or among parties to any
of the Financing Commitments or Financing Agreements with respect to the
obligation to fund the Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded
at the Closing, and (B) if at any time for any reason Parent believes that it
will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms
and conditions, in the manner or from the sources, contemplated by any of the
Financing Commitments or Financing Agreements or will be unable to obtain
Alternative Financing. Parent shall promptly provide any
information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance
referred to in clause (A) or (B) of the immediately preceding sentence.

 

(f) Parent acknowledges and agrees that it shall be fully responsible for
obtaining the Equity Financing and shall take (or cause to be taken) all
actions, and do (or cause to be done) all things, necessary, proper or
advisable to obtain the Equity Financing pursuant to and in accordance with
and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment
Letters, including taking all actions necessary to (i) comply with the terms
of and maintain in effect the Equity Commitment Letters, (ii) satisfy on a
timely basis all conditions in such Equity Commitment Letters to be satisfied
by Parent, (iii) consummate the Equity Financing at or prior to the Closing
subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity Commitment Letters and (iv)
enforce its rights under the Equity Commitment Letters to the extent the
Sponsors are required to fund under their respective Equity Commitment Letter
pursuant to the terms thereof and this Agreement.

(g) Parent acknowledges and agrees that neither the obtaining of the
Financing or any alternative financing, nor the completion of any issuance of
securities contemplated by the Financing or any alternative financing, is a
condition to the Closing.

Company Subsidiaries to, at Parents sole expense, reasonably cooperate in

Company Subsidiaries. Such cooperation by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries shall include, at the reasonable request of Parent, (i) subject

financial information and data derived from the Companys historical books
and records), (6) reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral in

reasonable efforts to supplement the information covered by this _Section
6.11(a)_ on a current basis if such supplement is reasonably necessary to

fact necessary to make such information not materially misleading.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (1) neither the

Company or any Company Subsidiary shall not be required to approve any
Financing (or any alternative financing) or agreements related thereto prior
to the Closing, (4) neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be

for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by
the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives in connection with their respective obligations pursuant to

may be, and such failure is not capable of being cured, or is not cured by
Parent or Merger Sub on or before the earlier of (i) the End Date and (ii)
thirty (30) days after delivery of written notice thereof by the Company;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may not terminate this Agreement

enter into such definitive written agreement simultaneously with such

6.10(a)_, _Section 6.11(b)_, this  _Section 8.02_, _Section 8.03_ and
_Article IX_ , which provisions shall survive such termination; _provided_ ,
_however_ , such termination shall not relieve any party of liability and each
party shall remain liable for Losses resulting from fraud.

 



62 Section 8.03 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as specifically provided for herein,
all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not such transactions are
consummated.

 

(a) The Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee if:

 

(i) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_ or
Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(f)_ or _Section
8.01(h)_; or

(ii) (A) an Alternative Proposal shall have been made to the Company or to
the Companys shareholders generally after the date of this Agreement and
become publicly known or announced (and not publicly withdrawn at least five
(5) Business Days prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting); (B) thereafter
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ (other than if
the failure of the Merger to be consummated on or before the End Date is due
solely to the failure of the Debt Financing to be funded on the date the
Closing should have occurred pursuant to _Section 1.02_), _Section
8.01(b)(iii)_ or _Section 8.01(e)_; and (C) within twelve (12) months of such
termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to
such Alternative Proposal and such Alternative Proposal is subsequently
consummated; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this _Section
8.03(a)(ii)_, the references to 20% in the definition of "Alternative
Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to 50.1%.

Any Termination Fee due under this _Section 8.03(a)_ shall be paid (less the
amount of any Parent Expenses previously paid to Parent pursuant to _Section
8.03(c)_, if any) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Parent (x) in the case of clause (i) above, on the
Business Day immediately following the date of termination of this Agreement
(or simultaneously with such termination, in the case of termination pursuant
to _Section 8.01(d)_) and (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, on the date
of consummation of an Alternative Proposal as referred to in clause (ii)(C)
above. In no event shall the Company be obligated to pay the Termination Fee
or Parent Expenses on more than one occasion.

 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent or the
Company pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(i)_, in circumstances in which the
Company would have been entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.01(c)_ (but only if the failure to satisfy the condition specified
therein results from an intentional act or omission in breach by Parent or
Merger Sub of any of their respective representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements contained therein) or _Section 8.01(g)_ but for such
termination pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(i)_, or (ii) by the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.01(c)_ (but only if the failure to satisfy the
condition specified therein results from an intentional act or omission in
breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any of their respective representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained therein) or _Section 8.01(g)_,
then Parent shall promptly, but in no event later than two

 



63  (2) Business Days following the date of such termination, pay or cause to be
paid to the Company an amount equal to the Reverse Termination Fee, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Company. In no event shall the Reverse Termination Fee be payable on more than
one occasion, whether by Parent or the Guarantor under the Guaranty, and in
the circumstances in which the Reverse Termination Fee is payable, the
Reverse Termination Fee constitutes liquidated damages and not a penalty, and
the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee in such circumstances is supported
by due and sufficient consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
other than in the case of fraud or as otherwise permitted by _Section 8.02_,
the Companys right to receive the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to this
_Section 8.03(b)_ shall be of no further force or effect if the Company
or any Company Related Party under its control makes any demand or claim for
monetary damages suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be
consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or under the
Guaranty or otherwise in any suit, action or other proceeding against Parent
or any other Parent Related Party for monetary damages other than for the
payment of the Reverse Termination Fee.

 

(c) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to (i) _Section
8.01(b)(iii)_ or (ii) _Section 8.01(e)_, in each case, under circumstances
in which the Termination Fee is not then payable (but could become payable in
the future where an Alternative Proposal shall have been made to the Company
or to the Companys shareholders generally after the date of this Agreement
and shall have become publicly known or announced (and not publicly withdrawn
at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting))
pursuant to _Section 8.03(a)(ii)_, and prior to the time of such
termination, Parent and Merger Sub were not in material breach of their
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement,
then the Company shall, following receipt of an invoice therefor, no later
than two (2) Business Days after the date of such termination, pay, or cause
to be paid, at the direction of Parent, up to $5,000,000 of Parents
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including legal
fees and expenses) incurred by Parent and its Affiliates on or prior to the
termination of this Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including the Financing) (the " _Parent Expenses_ ");
_provided_ , that the existence of circumstances which could require the
Termination Fee to become subsequently payable by the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.03(a)(ii)_ shall not relieve the Company of its obligations to pay
the Parent Expenses pursuant to this  _Section 8.03(c)_; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the payment by the Company of Parent Expenses pursuant to
this _Section 8.03(c)_ shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent
obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.03(a)_ except
to the extent indicated in _Section 8.03(a)_.

(d) The parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in
_Section 8.03(a)_, _Section 8.03(b)_ and _Section 8.03(c)_ are an integral
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without
these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to reasonably promptly pay the amount due
pursuant to _Section 8.03(a)_ or _Section 8.03(c)_ or Parent fails to
reasonably promptly pay the amount due pursuant to _Section 8.03(b)_, and,
in order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit, action or
other proceeding that results in an Order in its favor for such payment, the
party responsible for such payment shall pay to the other party its
reasonable and

 



64  documented costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit, action or other proceeding, together with interest
on the amount of such payment from the date such payment was required to be
made until the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the prime interest
rate published in The Wall Street Journal on the date such interest begins
accruing.

 

Section 8.04 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any
time before or after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval; _provided_
, _however_ , that (a) after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval,
there shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further approval by the
Companys shareholders without the further approval of such shareholders, and
(b) except as provided above, no amendment of this Agreement shall be
submitted to be approved by the Companys shareholders unless required by Law.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of each of the parties.

Section 8.05 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties; (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in
any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement; (c) waive compliance with
any covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement; or (d) waive the
satisfaction of any of the conditions contained in this Agreement as provided
herein. No extension or waiver, or termination of this Agreement, by the
Company shall require the approval of the Companys shareholders unless such
approval is required by Law. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of the party to be bound thereby. The failure of any
party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, no modification, waiver or
termination of _Section 8.02_, _Section 9.08_, _Section 9.09(c)_, _Section
9.10_, the last sentence of  _Section 9.11(b)(ii)_, _Section 9.11(b)(v)_,
_Section 9.11(d)_, _Section 9.13_, and this sentence of _Section 8.05_ (and
any provision of this Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver
or termination of such provision would modify the substance of any of the
foregoing provisions) that is adverse to the interests of any Lender or
Financing Source will be effective against a Lender or a Financing Source
without the prior written consent of such Lender or Financing Source.

transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its specified
terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Solely to the extent that the

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without such rights, none of
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub would have entered into this Agreement. Each
party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties
hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity to the extent

terms of this Section 9.11. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any
party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this

waiver by the Company) or the Company Related Parties (in the case of such
waiver by Parent and Merger Sub), arising under or based upon any Law
(including any securities law, common law or otherwise) for any breach of the
representations and warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement;
_provided_ , that following the Effective Time, nothing in this _Section
9.11_ shall relieve any party from any liability for fraud or limit the rights
or remedies of any third party beneficiary under clause (b) of _Section
