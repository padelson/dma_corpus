The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with the accounting principles used by the Company in the preparation of the Financial Statements and the determination of the Net Debt Target and the Signing Debt Amount (the " _Accounting Principles_ ") and in all cases in accordance with GAAP. The Closing Balance Sheet shall be accompanied by a report (the " _Preliminary Adjustment Report_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail the Net Debt Amount as of immediately prior to the Closing (as finally determined in accordance with Section 1.9(c), the " _Closing Debt Amount_ "). The Seller Representative and its representatives shall have the right to review and copy the computations and work papers (including accountants work papers, subject to such confidentiality restrictions, as the Seller Representatives accountants shall reasonably request) and underlying books and  ##### 

 

 

8   

records used in connection with the Buyer Representatives determination of
the Closing Debt Amount, and to have access to the employees and accountants
of IPO Corp. and its predecessors, and its respective books and records, in
connection therewith. Unless the Seller Representative provides
specific written notice to the Buyer Representative of an objection to any
aspect of the Preliminary Adjustment Report before the close of business on
the 30th day after the Seller Representatives receipt thereof, the
Preliminary Adjustment Report shall then become binding upon the
Buyer Representative, the Sellers and the Seller Representative, and shall be
the " _Final Adjustment Report_ ", and such day shall be the " _Final
Adjustment Report Date_ ". If the Seller Representative, by written notice to
the Buyer Representative before the close of business on such 30th day,
objects to any aspect of the Preliminary Adjustment Report, then those aspects
as to which the objection was made (the " _Seller Objection_ ") shall not
become binding. The Buyer Representative and the Seller Representative shall
discuss such objection in good faith and, if they reach written agreement
amending the Preliminary Adjustment Report within thirty (30) days after
delivery of the Preliminary Adjustment Report by the Buyer Representative, the
Preliminary Adjustment Report, as amended by such written agreement, shall
become binding upon the Buyer Representative, the Sellers and the Seller
Representative, and shall be the Final Adjustment Report, and the date of
such written agreement shall be the Final Adjustment Report Date. If
the Buyer Representative and the Seller Representative do not reach such
written agreement within thirty (30) days after the Seller Representative
gives such notice of objection, those aspects as to which such objection was
made shall be submitted for arbitration to a big four accounting
firm acceptable to the Seller Representative and the Buyer Representative
(the " _Accounting Firm_ ") (whose fees shall be borne by IPO Corp.), which
shall arbitrate the dispute and submit a written statement of its
adjudication, which statement, when delivered to the Buyer Representative and
to the Seller Representative, shall become final and binding upon the
Buyer Representative, the Sellers and the Seller Representative, and shall,
together with those aspects of the Preliminary Adjustment Report as to which
no objection was made, be the Final Adjustment Report. In such case, the date
on which such statement is delivered to the Buyer Representative and to the
Seller Representative shall be the Final Adjustment Report Date. The scope of
the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm is limited to whether the
amounts set forth in the Seller Objection or on the line items on the Closing
Balance Sheet used to calculate the Closing Debt Amount were obtained from
and in accordance with the books and records of the Company and are in
accordance with the Accounting Principles and, to the extent not inconsistent
with the Accounting Principles, GAAP applied on a basis consistent with prior
periods, and whether there were errors of fact or mathematical errors in the
Final Adjustment Report (which errors shall be resolved by the Accounting
Firm), and the Accounting Firm is not to make any other determination. The
determination of the Accounting Firm, including the resolution of any disputes
as described above, shall constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding
and unappealable and upon which a judgment may be entered by any court having
jurisdiction thereof. In acting hereunder, the Accounting Firm shall be
entitled to the privileges and immunities of arbitrators. 

  

 (d) On the Final Adjustment Report Date, to the extent that the Incremental Retained Shares as calculated pursuant to Section 1.9(a) is a positive number, IPO Corp, shall issue all Incremental Retained Shares to the Sellers. Each Seller shall be entitled to such Sellers Seller Pro Rata Share Amount of the Incremental Retained Shares with no further consideration due therefor.  #####

Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of Partnership Units subject to such Options by the Exchange Ratio (defined below), rounded down, if necessary, to a whole share of IPO Corp. Common Stock, at a price per share (rounded up, if necessary, to a penny) equal to the per share exercise price specified in such Option divided by the Exchange Ratio. Such Options shall hereinafter be referred to as " _IPO Corp. Options_." IPO Corp. and the Company will cooperate to structure the arrangements contemplated by this Section 1.10 in a manner consistent with Sections 409A and, if applicable, 422 of the Code. For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Exchange Ratio_ " shall mean a fraction, the numerator of which shall be equal to the value in dollars per Partnership Unit implied by the transactions described in Sections 1.5 and 1.6 (as calculated by the Compensation Committee of the Company immediately prior to the Closing, and such calculation to be reasonably satisfactory to Buyer) and the denominator of which shall be equal to the value in dollars of IPO Corp. Common Stock immediately after the Closing.

"special voting shares" (described on _Annex A)_ shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion, and no consideration shall be delivered in respect thereof.

 1.13 _Board of Directors_. On or prior to the Closing, the Board of Directors of IPO Corp. shall cause the number of directors that will comprise the full Board of Directors of IPO Corp. at the Closing to be 11.

 1.14 _Additional Sellers_. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause each holder of Partnership Units acquired upon exercise of Options or otherwise subsequent to the date hereof, to execute and deliver a joinder agreement (the " _Joinder_    ##### 

 

 

10 

 _Agreement_ "), in a form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, the Company and
the Seller Representative, pursuant to which such holder shall become a party
to this Agreement and for all purposes hereunder be treated as a Seller. To
the extent any holder of Partnership Units acquired subsequent to the date
hereof does not execute and deliver a Joinder Agreement prior to Closing, at
Closing each Seller will permit Buyer to purchase its pro rata share of
shares of IPO Corp. Common Stock received in respect of Partnership Units
and notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
Seller not executing this Agreement will not receive its Seller Pro Rata
Share of the Aggregate Cash Consideration. In the event that any Seller
becomes a party to this Agreement following the date hereof in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, such Seller may deliver
to the Company and Buyer prior to such execution a Disclosure Schedule
listing the exceptions of such Seller to the representations and warranties
to be made by the same pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof. 

   

 1.15 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_.

 1.16 _Alternative Structure_ . The parties agree to reasonably cooperate in the consideration of alternative structures to implement the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that are mutually agreeable to Buyer, the Company and the Sellers, as long as such alternative structure does not impose any material delay on, or condition to, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Article I, or adversely affect any of the parties hereto or either IPO Corp.s or Buyers stockholders, result in additional liability to directors or officers of any of the parties hereto, or breach or result in a default under the Credit Agreement or the Indentures.

 _ANNEX A_  

   

 _Step One: IPO Reorganization (all of these steps will happen at the closing,
in the order indicated)_  

   

        |   |   | IPO Corp. files an amended and restated
certificate of incorporation designed to reflect its imminent public company
status, including a certificate of designations authorizing a new class of
"special voting shares" having no economic value but with, in the aggregate,
greater than 75% of the total voting power of IPO Corp.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    |   |   | IPO Corp., the Blackstone Funds, the Graham Family and
Founder enter into an Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement that
amends and restates the Registration Rights Agreement executed in 1998 in
connection with the Recapitalization Agreement dated as of December 18, 1997
to provide for certain registration rights of the Blackstone Funds, Graham
Family and Founder (and/or an affiliate of Founder) upon becoming
shareholders of IPO Corp.  
      
    |   |   | The Company contributes its assets and liabilities to IPO
Corp. such that the 99% limited partnership stake in Graham Packaging Company
and all of the interests in GPC Opco GP LLC (which owns a 1% general partner
stake in Graham Packaging Company) will become directly held by IPO Corp.
(i.e., Graham Packaging Company becomes a 99%-directly/1%-indirectly owned
subsidiary of IPO Corp.).  
      
    |   |   | IPO Corp. substitutes managements options in the Company
with options in IPO Corp. with an equivalent value; if any member of
Management exercises options in the Company prior to the transaction, such
person will not receive substitute options and, instead, will, in accordance
with the Management Stockholders Agreement, be required to exchange
interests in the Company for shares of IPO Corp. common stock.  
      
    |   |   | The Company liquidates and BCP LLC, BMP/GHC, GPC and the
other Sellers (including the Graham Family and Management (to the extent they
have exercised options)) receive newly-issued shares of IPO Corp. Common
Stock pro rata in respect of all of the general and limited partnership
interests of the Company held by them in accordance with the Partnership
Agreement.  
      
    |   |   | IPO Corp. becomes the successor guarantor under the
Graham Credit Agreement and the Graham Note Indentures.  
      
    |   |   | GPC and BMP/GHC contribute their shares of IPO Corp.
common stock to IPO Corp. IPO Corp. issues new shares of IPO Corp. Common
Stock to GPC and BMP/GHC on a one for one basis and issues warrants to GPC
and BMP/GHC in an amount equal to their pro rata amount of the 2,760,000 new
warrants to be issued (part of consideration).  ##### 

 

 

   

     

  

       |   |   | IPO Corp. issues warrants to Sellers other than GPC
and BMP/GHC in an amount equal to such Sellers pro rata amount of the
2,760,000 new warrants to be issued.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    |   |   | Simultaneously with the prior step, IPO Corp. issues 4
special voting shares to BCP LLC and 0.7 special voting share to GPC (i.e.,
pro rata in respect of Holdings general partner interests). Each special
voting share will be non-transferable by its holders (except to
affiliates).  
      
    |   |   | GPC Opco GP LLC distributes its 1% general partnership
interest in the Operating Company to IPO Corp., and IPO Corp. contributes a
1% limited partnership interest in the Operating Company to GPC Opco GP
LLC.  
      
    |   |   | BCP LLC distributes its assets and liabilities (i.e., IPO
Corp. common stock and special voting shares) to BMP/GHC and liquidates.  
      
    |   |   | GPC distributes IPO Corp. common stock to the Graham
Family Holders.  
      
    |   |   | BMP/GHC converts to a Delaware limited liability company
(" _BMP/GHC LLC_ ") treated as a flow through entity for U.S. federal income
tax purposes.  
      
    |   |   | As a result of these transactions, all Sellers will
directly hold shares of IPO Corp. Common Stock pro rata with their earlier
ownership rights in the Company.  
   

  

 _Step Two: Purchase of IPO Corp. Common Stock and Issuance_  

   

       |   |   | 2,760,000 shares of Buyer Common Stock held by
Founder become restricted earnout shares that satisfy the earnout upon
closing stock price reaching $13.75 over a defined trading period (more
specifically set forth in the Agreement) and 2,760,000 warrants held by
Founder are amended to become exercisable upon the closing stock price
reaching $15 over a defined trading period (more specifically set forth in
the Agreement) and with an exercise price of $10 per share.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    |   |   | Buyer purchases an aggregate of 54,440,001 shares of IPO
Corp. Common Stock held by the Sellers (and any member of Management who
exercises options prior to the transaction) in exchange for an aggregate of
$350 million; Sellers retain 35 million shares (subject to adjustment). The
Sellers retain their special voting shares, none of which are acquired by the
Buyer.  
      
    |   |   | Buyer contributes newly-purchased shares of IPO Corp.
common stock to IPO Corp.  
      
    |   |   | A newly formed wholly owned limited liability company
subsidiary of Graham Packaging Company merges with Buyer. In connection with
the merger, holders of Buyer Common Stock receive new shares of IPO Corp.
Common Stock equal to the number of shares acquired by Buyer as well as an
additional number of shares of IPO Corp. Common Stock (such number of shares
shall equal the difference between the maximum number of shares that Buyer
shareholders can convert to cash, or 16,559,999, and the actual number shares
converted). The issuance from IPO Corp.   ##### 

 

 

  

      |   |   | to Buyer shareholders will be pursuant to an
effective registration statement in an "initial public offering" of IPO Corp.
shares.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       |   |   | IPO Corp. cancels all of the special voting
shares.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    |   |   | IPO Corp. to apply at least 50% of the cash proceeds from
issuance of any additional shares of IPO Corp. common stock by IPO Corp, to
pay down term loans under the Graham Credit Agreement.  
      
    |   |   | BMP/GHC LLC distributes IPO Corp. common stock, cash
proceeds and new warrants from the sale of IPO Corp. common stock to its
members and liquidates.
