ISTA Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the
Company being the survivor of such merger in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the
"DGCL"), as a result of which the Company will become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Parent;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (together with any duly
constituted and authorized committee thereof, the "Company Board") has
unanimously (i) determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and
its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement,
(ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger (as defined below) and (iii) resolved to recommend
adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company;

WHEREAS, prior to the date hereof, the Company has entered into letter
agreements (collectively, the "Warrant Letters") in the form attached as
_Exhibit A_ hereto with all of the holders of warrants to purchase Company
Common Stock (as defined below) (collectively, the "Company Warrants"); and

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of each of the Parent and Merger Sub have
unanimously approved this Agreement and declared it advisable that the Parent
and Merger Sub, respectively, enter into this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below, and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree as
follows:

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

 

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, Merger Sub shall merge with
and into the Company (the "Merger") at the Effective Time.

1.2 _Effective Time of the Merger_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, prior to the Closing, the Parent and the Company shall jointly
prepare, and immediately following the Closing the Company shall cause to be
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a certificate of
merger (the "Certificate of Merger"), in such form as is required by, and
executed  in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and shall make all
other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as is agreed to by the
Parent and the Company and set forth in the Certificate of Merger (the
"Effective Time").

 

1.3 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at
10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on a date to be specified by the Parent and the
Company (the "Closing Date"), which shall be no later than the third Business
Day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII
(other than delivery of items to be delivered at the Closing and other than
satisfaction of those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, it being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall
remain subject to the delivery of such items and the satisfaction or waiver
of such conditions at the Closing), at the offices of Cleary Gottlieb Steen and
Hamilton LLP, One Liberty Plaza, New York, New York, unless another date,
place or time is agreed to in writing by the Parent and the Company. For
purposes of this Agreement, a "Business Day" shall be any day on which the
principal offices of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC") in Washington, DC are open to accept filings other than a day on
which banking institutions located in Los Angeles, California or New York,
New York are permitted or required by Law to remain closed.

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time (a) the separate existence
of Merger Sub shall cease and Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company, with the Company, following the Effective Time, continuing as the
surviving corporation of the Merger (the Company, as the surviving corporation
in the Merger, is sometimes referred to herein as the "Surviving Corporation")
and (b) the certificate of incorporation of the Company as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended and restated in its
entirety as of the Effective Time to be in the form of the certificate of
incorporation attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ , and, as so amended and
restated, such certificate of incorporation shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until further amended in
accordance with the DGCL. In addition, subject to Section 6.8(b), the Parent
shall cause the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation to be amended and
restated in their entirety so that, immediately following the Effective Time,
they are identical to the by-laws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, except that all references to the name of Merger Sub
therein shall be changed to refer to the name of the Company, and, as so
amended and restated, such by-laws shall be the by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation, until further amended in accordance with the DGCL. The Merger
shall have the effects set forth herein and in the applicable provisions of
the DGCL, including Section 259 thereof.

1.5 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

(a) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation. 

(b) The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



\- 2 -  ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK AND OTHER SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY

 

2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any further action on the part of the Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or the holder of any shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per
share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") or capital stock of Merger
Sub:

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of the common stock of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock or by any
wholly- owned Subsidiary of the Company and any shares of Company Common
Stock owned by the Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of
the Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
shall cease to exist and no stock of the Parent or other consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) _Merger Consideration for Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.2,
each share of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into
the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $9.10, without interest
thereon (the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such
shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of (i) a
certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such
shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") and (ii) uncertificated
shares which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such
shares of Company Common Stock (the "Uncertificated Shares") shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) upon the surrender of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares in accordance with Section 2.2, without
interest.

(d) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split,
reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock
occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date hereof
and prior to the Effective Time.

2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the
Merger are as follows:

 



\- 3 -  (a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall
deposit with a bank or trust company designated by the Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, for payment through the Exchange Agent in accordance with
this Section 2.2, cash in an amount sufficient to make payment of the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c) in exchange for all of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Exchange Fund") (for the
avoidance of doubt, such amounts shall only include amounts sufficient to make
payment for shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding at the
Effective Time and not any securities of the Company exchangeable or
exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock). The Exchange Fund shall not
be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the
Exchange Agent as directed by the Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available);
_provided_ , _however_ , that no gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable hereunder and the Parent shall take all actions necessary to ensure
that the Exchange Fund includes at all times cash sufficient to satisfy the
Parents obligation to pay the Merger Consideration under this Agreement. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments (net of any losses)
shall be paid to the Parent pursuant to Section 2.2(d). In the event of
any losses to the Exchange Fund from any investment such that the Exchange
Fund is diminished below the level required for the Exchange Agent to make
prompt cash payments as required under Section 2.2(b), the Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly deposit additional cash
into the Exchange Fund to the extent necessary to reimburse the Exchange Agent
for any such investment losses.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly (and in any event within three Business
Days) after the Effective Time, the Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail to each holder of record of a Certificate and each holder of record of
Uncertificated Shares (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and (ii)
in the case of a holder of Certificates, instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration
payable with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation
to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions (and such
other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange
Agent), the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled.
Upon receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other
evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request)
in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holder of
such Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and the
transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall immediately be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the
surrender of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to an 

 



\- 4 -   individual, corporation, limited liability company, partnership,
association, trust or other entity, including a Governmental Entity ("Person")
other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated Shares
are registered, if, in the case of shares represented by a Certificate, such
Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent, and in each case the
transferor provides to the Exchange Agent (i) all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and (ii) evidence reasonably satisfactory to
the Surviving Corporation that any applicable stock transfer or other Taxes
have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each
Certificate and all Uncertificated Shares (other than Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares representing Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.2.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates and cancellation of
Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to
have been paid in satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares
of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Subject to the last sentence of
Section 2.2(d) below, if, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for six months
after the Effective Time (including all interest and other income received by
the Exchange Agent in respect of all funds made available to it) shall be
delivered to the Parent, upon demand, and any holder of Company Common Stock
who has not previously complied with this Section 2.2 shall be entitled to
look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat
or other similar Laws) as a general creditor thereof with respect to the
payment of any Merger Consideration, without interest. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed at such time as it would otherwise escheat
to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Parent or its designee, free
and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

(e) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, none of the
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any
amount required to be delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, including
to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options or
Company Warrants, such amounts as it reasonably determines are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any other 

 



\- 5 -   applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so deducted and withheld, such amounts (i) shall be remitted by the Parent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may
be, to the applicable Governmental Entity and (ii) shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made. 

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an effective affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, which shall
include an agreement to indemnify and defend and hold harmless the Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent from and against any and all
costs, claims, losses, judgments, damages, counsel fees, expenses and
liabilities whatsoever which each may suffer, sustain or incur in connection
with the failure of any statement, representation or warranty set forth in
such affidavit, any payment for or transfer, exchange or delivery of such
Certificate and such Persons inability to locate such Certificate, and, if
required by the Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary
amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay, in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 

2.3 _Company Stock Plans_.

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of Company Common
Stock granted subject to time-based, performance or other vesting or lapse
restrictions pursuant to any Company Stock Plan (as defined in Section 2.3(b)
below) (each, a "Restricted Share"), that is outstanding and subject to such
restrictions immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically vest,
and the Companys reacquisition right with respect to each Restricted Share
shall lapse, and the holder thereof shall, subject to this Article II
(including Section 2.2(f)), be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
with respect to each such Restricted Share.

 

(b) The Company shall take such action as shall be required:

(i) to cause the vesting of any unvested options to purchase Company Common
Stock ("Company Stock Options") or any stock appreciation right granted under
any stock option plans or other equity-related plans of the Company (the
"Company Stock Plans") to be accelerated in full effective immediately prior
to the Effective Time; and

(ii) to cause, pursuant to the Company Stock Plans, each outstanding Company
Stock Option with a per share exercise price less than the Merger
Consideration per share of Company Common Stock (an "In-the-Money Company
Stock Option") and each stock appreciation right to represent as of the
Effective Time solely the right to receive, in accordance with this Section
2.3 (and subject to Section 2.2(f)), a lump sum cash payment in the amount of
the Option Consideration, if any, with respect to such In-the-Money Company
Stock Option or stock appreciation right and to be cancelled and to no longer
represent the right to purchase Company Common Stock or any other equity
security of the Company, the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other
Person or any other consideration, as applicable. Each Company Stock Option
outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time that
is not an In-the-Money Company Stock Option will automatically and without
any required action on the

 



\- 6 -   part of the holder thereof, be cancelled as of the Effective Time without
any consideration payable in respect thereof, and will have no further force
or effect.

 

(c) Each holder of an In-the-Money Company Stock Option or stock appreciation
right so cancelled shall receive from the Surviving Corporation, in respect
and in consideration of each such In-the-Money-Company Stock Option or stock
appreciation right, as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but
in any event not later than the next regularly scheduled payroll cycle), an
amount (net of applicable taxes) equal to the product of (i) the excess, if
any, of (A) the Merger Consideration per share of Company Common Stock over
(B) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such In-
the-Money Company Stock Option or stock appreciation right, as applicable,
multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such In-the-Money Company Stock Option (whether or not then vested
or exercisable) or stock appreciation right, as applicable, without any
interest thereon (the "Option Consideration").

 

(d) Following the execution of this Agreement, if and as required by the
Company Stock Plans, the Company shall mail to each person who is a holder of
Company Stock Options a letter describing the treatment of and payment for
such Company Stock Options pursuant to this Section 2.3 and providing
instructions for use in obtaining payment for such Company Stock Options.
The Surviving Corporation shall at all times from and after the Effective
Time maintain sufficient liquid funds to satisfy its obligations to holders of
Company Stock Options pursuant to this Section 2.3.

 

(e) If the Effective Time occurs on or before the "Purchase Date" relating to
the applicable "Offering Period" (as such terms are defined in the Company
ESPP) in effect as of the date of this Agreement and there are rights to
purchase Company Common Stock ("Company ESPP Rights") then outstanding with
respect to such Offering Period, the Company Board shall, prior to the
Effective Time, take such actions as are necessary to provide that all
outstanding Company ESPP Rights shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time,
provided that notice of such cancellation shall be given to each holder of
a Company ESPP Right, and each holder of a Company ESPP Right shall have the
right to exercise such Company ESPP Right in full on the Closing Date (or, if
not practicable, on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date)
based on payroll deductions then credited to his or her account as of a date
determined by the Company Board, which date shall not be less than ten (10)
days preceding the Closing Date. If the Effective Time occurs after the
"Purchase Date" relating to the applicable "Plan Period" in effect as of the
date of this Agreement (e.g., a new Offering Period has commenced), the
Company Board shall terminate the Company ESPP as of a date prior to the
Closing Date and, as promptly as reasonably practicable following such
termination, all payroll deductions pursuant to the Company ESPP shall be paid
out to the participating employees under the Company ESPP. In any event, the
Company Board shall terminate the Company ESPP prior to the Effective Time.
As used in this Agreement, "Company ESPP" means the Companys 2009 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan.

 



\- 7 -  2.4 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time that are held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the
Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has made a proper demand for
appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the DGCL
(any such shares being referred to as "Dissenting Shares" until such time as
such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses such holders
appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall,
subject to Section 2.4(b), not be converted into or represent the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1, but shall be
entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of
Dissenting Shares. 

(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect appraisal rights under the DGCL, a withdrawal of demand for
appraisal rights or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or
the date of loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be treated as
if they had been, as of the Effective Time, converted into, and shall
represent only the right to receive, the Merger Consideration in accordance
with Section 2.1, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate
or Uncertificated Shares formerly representing such shares.

 

(c) The Company shall give the Parent: (i) prompt notice of any written demand
for appraisal pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company prior to the
Effective Time, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice
or instrument delivered to the Company pursuant to the DGCL prior to the
Effective Time that relates to such demand; and (ii) notice of, and
the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall not make any payment or settle, or make any settlement offer
or approve any withdrawal with respect to any such demand, notice or
instrument (or agree or commit to do any of the foregoing) unless the Parent
shall have given its prior written consent to such payment, settlement,
settlement offer or withdrawal.

 

2.5 _Warrants_. The Company shall give notice of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement to the holders of Company Warrants as required pursuant to
the terms of the Company Warrants. At the Effective Time, (a) any holder of a
Company Warrant having properly elected to require an "Early Termination Upon
Major Transaction" shall be entitled to receive the "Major Transaction
Warrant Early Termination Price" (each term as defined under the Company
Warrants) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Company Warrants
and (b) any Company Warrant in respect of which a holder has not properly
elected to require an "Early Termination Upon Major Transaction" (or has
revoked or attempted to revoke such election) shall no longer be exercisable
for Company Common Stock but shall thereafter be exercisable solely for
an amount of cash equal to the Merger Consideration that would have been
payable in respect of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that the
holder of such Company Warrant would have received had such holder exercised
such Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time.

interests representing (i) more than 50% of the voting power of all
outstanding stock or ownership interests of such entity or (ii) the right to
receive more than 50% of the net assets of such entity available

its business as now being conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and
is in good standing as a foreign company (to the extent such concepts are

operated or leased or the nature of its activities makes such qualification

be reasonably likely to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect. All of the
outstanding shares of capital stock and other equity securities or interests

fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights and all such shares
(other than directors qualifying shares in the case of non-U.S. Subsidiaries,

Company. There are no voting trusts, proxies or other agreements with respect

or indirectly, any capital stock of any Person that is not a Subsidiary of
the Company.

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has agreed or
is obligated to make, or is bound by any Contract under which it may become
obligated to make, any future equity investment in or capital contribution to
any other Person.

3.4 _Authority; No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and perform its obligations hereunder and, subject, in the case
of the Merger, to obtaining the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of

at the Company Meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, in favor
of the adoption of this Agreement (the "Company Voting Proposal" and such
approval and adoption having been made in accordance with the DGCL, the
"Company Stockholder Approval") to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company
Board, at a meeting duly called and held, unanimously (i) determined that the
Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, is fair
to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii)
approved and declared advisable this Agreement, the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the provisions
of the DGCL, (iii) directed that this Agreement be submitted to the

Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement not to be subject to any state takeover law or
similar law that might otherwise apply to such execution, delivery,

herein, together with all exhibits and schedules thereto and documents
incorporated by reference therein, as the "Company SEC Reports." The Company
SEC Reports (i) were or will be filed on a timely basis, (ii) at the time
filed, complied, or will comply when filed as to form in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Reports, and (iii) did not or will
not at the time they were or are filed or furnished (or with respect to
Company SEC Reports first filed or furnished on or prior to the date of this
Agreement, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, the date of the
filing of such amendment, with respect to the disclosures that are amended)
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated in such Company SEC Reports or necessary in order
to make the statements in such Company SEC Reports, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No Subsidiary of the
Company is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or Section
15(d) of the Exchange Act.

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any related notes and schedules) contained or to be contained in the Company

normal and recurring year-end adjustments as permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q
under the Exchange Act that will not be material in amount or effect. The
Companys auditors have not withdrawn any audit opinion with respect to any
financial statements contained in the Company SEC Reports, and the Company has
not determined to or announced any intention to restate any financial
statements contained in the Company SEC Reports. The consolidated,

 



\- 16 -  audited balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2011 is referred to

requirements of Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act and has
established and maintains disclosure controls over financial reporting that
satisfy the requirements of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that all material
information concerning the Company is made known on a timely basis to the
individuals responsible for the preparation of the Companys filings with the
SEC and other public disclosure documents and are designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with

maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company and
its Subsidiaries; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries that could have a material effect
on the Companys financial statements. The Companys management has completed
an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys system of internal
controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, and, except as set forth in the Filed
Company SEC Reports, such assessment concluded that such controls
were effective and the Companys independent registered accountant has issued
(and not subsequently withdrawn or qualified) an attestation report concluding
that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2011. Since January 1, 2010, to the Companys
Knowledge, the Companys independent registered accountant has not identified
or been made aware of: (A) any significant deficiency or material weakness in
the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting utilized
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (B) any illegal act or fraud,
whether or not material, that involves the Companys management or other
employees; or (C) any claim or allegation regarding any of the foregoing.
Since January 1, 2010, the Company and each of its officers and directors have
been and are in compliance in all material respects with (1) the applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (2) the applicable listing and other
rules and regulations of The Nasdaq Stock Market.

(d) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved
comments in comment letters received from the SEC with respect to the Company
SEC Reports. To the Companys Knowledge, none of the Company SEC Reports is
the subject of ongoing SEC review and there are no inquiries or
investigations by the SEC or any internal investigations pending or
threatened, in each case regarding any accounting practices of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

misleading with respect to any material fact, and shall not omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not false or
misleading or necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication
with respect to the solicitation of proxies for the Company Meeting which has
become false or misleading. The Proxy Statement will, at the time it is
first filed with the SEC and first mailed to stockholders of the Company,
comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act.

with respect to statements made therein with respect to the Parent or Merger

in Section 6.1(a), subject to compliance with Section 6.1(e), following the
date of this Agreement and prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval
is obtained, in response to an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that
did not result from a breach of this Section 6.1, if the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its
financial advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal is bona fide and either
constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to lead to
a Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable
Law, the Company may (subject to its delivering to the Parent, at least
thirty-six hours in advance, the notice as required under Section 6.1(e),
together with a statement to the effect that the Company Board has made the
determination required by this Section 6.1(b) in respect of such Acquisition
Proposal and the Company intends to furnish non-public information to, or
enter into discussions or negotiations with, such Person making such
Acquisition Proposal), (i) furnish information with respect to the Company to
the Person (and the Representatives of such Person) making such Acquisition

\- 39 -  (iii) adopt, approve or recommend, or propose publicly to adopt, approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal;

Company that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal is commenced, fail to
recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the
Companys stockholders (including, for these purposes, by taking no position
with respect to the acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by its
stockholders, which shall constitute a failure to recommend against acceptance
of such tender offer or exchange offer) within ten (10) Business Days after
commencement thereof; or

 

(v) resolve to do any of the foregoing.

(d) _Permitted Change in Recommendation_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to the time the
Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board (or applicable
committee thereof) may (i) in the absence of an Acquisition Proposal, make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change if a material event or change in
circumstances has occurred with respect to the Company after the date hereof
and the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside counsel) that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under
applicable Law, or (ii) if the Company Board has received an Acquisition
Proposal (that has not been withdrawn), effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal if the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal was an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal received by the Company in
compliance with Section 6.1(a) and constitutes a Superior Proposal and that
the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations
under applicable Law; provided, that prior to the Company Board taking any
action contemplated by clause (i) or (ii):

 

(A) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall have complied in all material
respects with this Section 6.1 and the Company shall have provided to the
Parent prior written notice, at least four (4) Business Days in advance of
taking such action, advising the Parent of the decision of the Company Board
to propose to take such action and the reasons therefor (which notice
shall not, in and of itself, constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change), including, in the case of an Acquisition Proposal, the identity of
the party making such Acquisition Proposal, an unredacted copy of the
Acquisition Proposal, the relevant proposed transaction agreements and a copy
of any financing commitments (including redacted fee letters) relating
thereto;

 

(B) the Company shall have given the Parent four (4) Business Days after
delivery of such notice to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement
(or make another proposal) and if the Parent proposes to revise the terms of
this Agreement or make another proposal, the Company shall discuss (and shall
have caused its Representatives to discuss), during such period, in
good faith with the Parent such proposed revisions or other proposal (it
being agreed that, in the case

 



\- 40 -   of an Acquisition Proposal, any material changes or modifications to an
Acquisition Proposal shall require a new notice except the notice and
discussion period shall be a two (2) Business Day period); and

(C) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after considering
the results of such discussions and giving effect to the proposed revisions
made in writing by the Parent, if any, that (1) in the case of an Acquisition
Proposal, such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and that
the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the Company Board under applicable Law and (2) in the absence of an
Acquisition Proposal, failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable Law.

(e) _Notices to the Parent_. The Company shall promptly (and in any event
within twenty four (24) hours of receipt) advise the Parent orally, with
written confirmation to follow, of the Companys receipt of any (i)
Acquisition Proposal, which written notice shall contain the identity of the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal, a copy of the Acquisition Proposal
if it is in writing or otherwise a description of the material terms and
conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal (a "Notice of Acquisition
Proposal"), (ii) any inquiries specifically relating to an Acquisition
Proposal or (iii) any request for information from, or any negotiations sought
to be initiated or continued with, either the Company or its Representatives
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall keep the Parent
reasonably informed on a current basis (and in any event within twenty four
(24) hours thereafter) of any material modification or amendment to any such
Acquisition Proposal. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall enter into any agreement after the date hereof that would prohibit them
from providing such information to the Parent.

(f)  _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Section 6.1 or
in Section 6.7 (or elsewhere in this Agreement) shall be deemed to prohibit
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Company Board from (i) taking
and disclosing to its stockholders a position with respect to a tender offer
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act,
or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its
position thereunder, or (ii) if, in the good faith judgment of the Company
Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure to so disclose could
be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law, from making any
disclosure to the Companys stockholders; provided that any disclosure other
than a "stop, look and listen" communication to the stockholders of the
Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any
similar communications to the stockholders of the Company) shall be deemed a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless accompanied or promptly followed
by an express rejection of any applicable Acquisition Proposal or an express
affirmation of the Company Board Recommendation.

(g) _Cessation of Ongoing Discussions_. Except as otherwise expressly
permitted by this Section 6.1, the Company shall, and shall direct and cause
its Representatives to, cease immediately all discussions and negotiations
that commenced prior to the date of this Agreement regarding any proposal that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal. With respect to any Person with whom such discussions or
negotiations

 



\- 41 -   shall be terminated, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
promptly require such Person to promptly return or destroy in accordance with
the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement any information
furnished by or on behalf of the Company.

\- 43 -  6.5 _Stockholders Meeting_. As promptly as practicable after the SEC confirms
that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement, the Company, acting
through the Company Board, shall take all actions in accordance with
applicable Law, including the rules and regulations under the Exchange Act,
its certificate of incorporation and by-laws and the rules of The Nasdaq
Stock Market to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold, the Company
Meeting, for the purpose of considering and voting upon the Company Voting
Proposal. Subject to Section 6.1, (i) the Company Board shall recommend
adoption of the Company Voting Proposal by the stockholders of the Company and
include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (ii) the Company Board

reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting to the extent necessary to
ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is

in advance of the Company Meeting or if as of the time for which the Company
Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there
are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person
or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Company Meeting. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless
this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to Article VIII, the Company shall
submit the Merger and this Agreement for the approval of its stockholders at
the Company Meeting, whether or not a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
shall have occurred or an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly
announced or otherwise made known to the Company or the Company Board.

6.6 _Legal Conditions to the Merger_.

(a) Subject to the terms hereof, including Section 6.1, Section 6.6(b) and
Section 6.6(c), the Company, the Parent and Merger Sub shall each use its
reasonable best efforts (unless, with respect to any action, another standard
of performance is expressly provided for herein) to:

(i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable;

(ii) as promptly as practicable, obtain from any Governmental Entity any
consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations, or orders
required to be obtained or made by the Company or the Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in connection with the authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby;

 

(iii) as promptly as practicable, make all necessary filings, and thereafter
make any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the
Merger required under (A) the Exchange Act, and any other applicable federal
or state securities laws,

 



\- 44 -   (B) the HSR Act, any other applicable Antitrust Law and any related
governmental request thereunder and (C) any other applicable Law;

 

(iv) oppose any Law or Order that has the effect of making the Merger illegal
or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or have any such Law or Order vacated or made
inapplicable to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and

 

(v) execute or deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement.

The Company, the Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with each other in
connection with the making of all such filings, including providing copies of
all such documents to each non-filing party and its advisors prior to filing
and, if requested, accepting reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested in connection therewith. Each of the Company, the Parent and Merger
Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to each other all
information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant
to any applicable law (including all information required to be included in
any Proxy Statement) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that nothing in this
Section 6.6(a) shall limit their obligations under the other provisions of
this Section 6.6.

(b) Subject to the terms hereof, and without limiting the Parents obligations
under Section 6.6(c), the Parent and the Company agree, and shall cause each
of their respective Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use their respective
reasonable best efforts to obtain any government clearances (including by
expiration of the relevant waiting period) or approvals required for the
Closing under the HSR Act, the Clayton Act, as amended, and any other
applicable federal, state or foreign law, regulation or decree designed to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively "Antitrust Laws"), to
respond to any government requests for information under any Antitrust Law,
and to contest and resist any action, including any
legislative, administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) (an "Antitrust Order") that
restricts, prevents or prohibits the consummation of the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law. The
parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in
good faith the views of one another, in connection with, and provide to the
other parties in advance, any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of
any party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to any
Antitrust Law.

(c) The Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to propose,
negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit
to and effect), by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses of the Parent or,
effective as of the Closing Date, the Company, or their respective
Subsidiaries, or otherwise offer to take or offer to commit to take any action
which it is capable of taking and if the offer is accepted, take or commit to
take such action that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its
ability to retain, any of the businesses, services or assets

 



\- 45 -   of the Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries, in order to
avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any Antitrust Order,
which would have the effect of preventing or delaying the Effective Time
beyond the Outside Date (a "Divestiture Action"); provided however,
notwithstanding the foregoing or anything herein to the contrary, the Parent
shall not have any obligation to propose, negotiate, commit to or effect any
Divestiture Action that could reasonably be expected to have (i) a Company
Material Adverse Effect or (ii) a material adverse effect on the assets and
liabilities (taken as a whole), business, financial condition or results
of operations of (A) the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or
(B) the Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (a "MAE Burdensome
Condition"); provided, further, that no party shall be required pursuant to
this Section 6.6(c) to propose, commit to or effect any action that is not
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Parent shall have the right to determine
and direct the strategy and process (including all timing, substantive
matters and decisions to propose, negotiate, commit to or effect any
Divestiture Action) by which the parties will seek required consents,
approvals, clearances, waivers, waiting period expirations and terminations
and removal of all impediments (including all elements of any suit, action or
other Legal Proceeding and communications with Governmental Entities), in each
case under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, including the right to
enter into reasonable timing agreements with Governmental Entities as is
customary in reviews under the HSR Act and other Antitrust Laws; provided,
further, however that Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
regularly consult with the Company and keep the Company reasonably informed
of such strategy and process and the results thereof.

(d) Each of the Company and the Parent shall give (or shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties other than
Governmental Entities, and use, and cause their respective Subsidiaries to
use, their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents from
third parties other than Governmental Entities required in connection with the
Merger that are (i) necessary in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby or (ii) disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent
Disclosure Letter, as the case may be, it being understood that neither the
Company nor the Parent shall be required to make any payments in connection
with the fulfillment of its obligations under this Section 6.6(d).

(e) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall reasonably cooperate with the
Parent in connection with the preparation of post-effective amendments to the
Companys registration statements under the Securities Act on Forms S-3 and
S-8 or on any other applicable form for the purpose of terminating such
registration statements on or promptly following the Closing.

(f) Subject to the matter described in Section 6.6(f) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts
(based on its good faith business judgment) to submit for filing with the FDA
a New Drug Application for PROLENSA substantially in the manner and on the
timetable set forth on Section 6.6(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(g) The Company shall give the Parent the opportunity to participate in (but
not control) the defense and settlement of any stockholder litigation against
the Company and/or any of its directors relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

provide each other the reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon any
press release or other public statement or comment prior to the issuance of
such press release or other public statement or comment relating to this
Agreement or the Merger and shall not issue any such press release or other
public statement or comment prior to such consultation except as may be
required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement
with any national securities exchange, in which case the disclosing party
will use its reasonable best efforts to allow the other party an opportunity
to review and comment prior to making any such disclosure. The Parent and the
Company agree that the press release announcing the execution of
this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be reasonably agreed upon by
the Parent and the Company. The restrictions set forth in this Section 6.7
shall not apply to any communication made by the Company in accordance with
Section 6.1. 

6.8 _Indemnification_.

(a) From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on which
the Effective Time occurs, the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
indemnify and hold harmless each Person who is now, or has been at any time
prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(the "Indemnified Parties"), against all claims, losses, liabilities,
damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including
attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to
the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director, employee
or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time, or, while a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee or agent of another Person prior
to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, in each case to the same extent that such Persons are entitled
to indemnification pursuant to the Companys current certificate of
incorporation and bylaws or any agreement currently in effect.
Each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses (including
attorneys fees) incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation from the Surviving Corporation to the same extent
that such Persons are entitled to payment of expenses pursuant to the
Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws as currently in effect or
any agreement currently in effect; provided that the individual to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it
shall be determined that such Person is not entitled to be indemnified
pursuant to such certificate of incorporation and bylaws or agreement.

 

(b) From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on which
the Effective Time occurs, the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of
the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and the Parent shall cause the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation to so
contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and
former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are
presently set forth in the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the
Company.

 



\- 47 -  (c) Subject to the next sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain,
and the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, at no
expense to the beneficiaries, in effect from the Effective Time through the
sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs directors
and officers liability insurance with respect to matters existing or
occurring prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement), with respect to those individuals who are currently (and
any additional individuals who prior to the Effective Time become) covered by
the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy, issued by
reputable insurers, of coverage no less favorable to such covered individuals
than the coverage in the Companys current policies with respect to matters
existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time, including a "tail" policy)
so long as the annual premium therefor would not be in excess of 200% of the
last annual premium paid prior to the Effective Time (such 200%, the "Maximum
Premium"). If such insurance coverage expires, is terminated or canceled
during such period or exceeds the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation
shall obtain, and the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain,
as much directors and officers liability insurance as can be obtained for
the remainder of such period for an annualized premium not in excess of the
Maximum Premium, on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the
Indemnified Parties than the Companys existing directors and officers
liability insurance. Subject to the foregoing limitation on expense, at the
Companys option, the Company may purchase prior to the Effective Time, a
six-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions providing substantially
equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time, covering
without limitation the transactions contemplated hereby. If such prepaid "tail
policy" has been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, the
Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for
its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the
Surviving Corporation, and such "tail policy" shall be deemed to satisfy
all obligations of the Parent pursuant to this Section 6.8(c).

(d) The Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, now existing in favor of the current or
former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of
incorporation or by-laws or other organization documents or in any agreement
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect and the
Surviving Corporation shall, and the Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, perform as and when due all obligations of the Surviving
Corporation thereunder. The provisions of this Section 6.8 are intended to be
in addition to the rights otherwise available to the current officers and
directors of the Company by law, charter, statute, by-law or agreement, and
shall operate for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their representatives. The obligations
set forth in this Section 6.8 shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise
modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Party, or
any Person who is a beneficiary under the policies referred to in this
Section 6.8 and their heirs and representatives, without the prior written
consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other Person, unless such
termination, amendment or modification is required by applicable Law.

 



\- 48 -  (e) If the Surviving Corporation or the Parent or any of their successors or
assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation or the
Parent, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations of the
Surviving Corporation and the Parent, as the case may be, set forth in this
Section 6.8.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or
shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective
directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.8 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 

6.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the
Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give
prompt notice to the Parent, of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of
any event, which occurrence or failure to occur is reasonably likely to cause
any condition to Closing set forth in Article VII not to be satisfied, (b)
any failure of such party (or, in the case of the Parent, Merger Sub) to
perform in all material respects any obligation to be performed by it under
this Agreement, (c) any notice or other communication received by such party
(or, in the case of the Parent, Merger Sub) from any Governmental Entity in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or from
any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection therewith, (d) any Legal Proceeding commenced or, to the Companys
Knowledge on the one hand and Parents knowledge, on the other hand,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party
or any of its Subsidiaries, which relate to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, (e) any notice or other communication
(whether oral or written) received by the Company or otherwise between the
Company and the holders of any Company Warrants with respect to the Company
Warrants, including any such notice or communication requesting or attempting
to effect the transfer, assignment, exercise or termination of any Company
Warrants or otherwise relating to the terms and conditions of the
Company Warrants, and (f) any written notice or other written communication
received by the Company with respect to the Companys Credit Facility or the
Companys Revolving Credit Agreement, including the exercise by any lender
under the Credit Facility of any put notice to require the Company to repay
loans outstanding under the Credit Facility. The Company will advise the
Parent in writing no later than four (4) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date of the amount required to be paid by the Company to the holders of the
Company Warrants who have exercised their right to terminate Company Warrants
in connection with consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section 6.9 will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the conditions to such partys
obligation to consummate the Merger.

 

6.10 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including
derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions

 



\- 49 -   contemplated hereby by each individual who is a director or officer of the
Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to
the extent permitted by applicable Law. 

6.11 _Service Credit_. Following the Effective Time, the Parent will give each
employee of the Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their respective
Subsidiaries who shall have been an employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees")
full credit for prior service with the Company or its Subsidiaries for
purposes of (a) eligibility and vesting under any Parent Employee Plans (as
defined below), (b) determination of benefit levels under any Parent Employee
Plan or policy relating to vacation or severance and (c) determination of
"retiree" status under any Parent Employee Plan, in each case for which the
Continuing Employee is otherwise eligible and in which the Continuing Employee
is offered participation, but except where such credit would result in a
duplication of benefits. In addition, the Parent shall waive, or cause to be
waived, any limitations on benefits relating to pre-existing conditions to the
same extent such limitations are waived under any comparable plan of
the Parent and recognize for purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket
limits under its medical and dental plans, deductible and out-of-pocket
expenses paid by Continuing Employees in the calendar year in which the
Effective Time occurs. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Parent
Employee Plan" means any "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(2) of ERISA), any "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA), and any other written or oral plan, agreement or
arrangement, including insurance coverage, severance benefits, disability
benefits, deferred compensation, bonuses, stock options, stock purchase,
restricted stock unit, stock appreciation or other forms of incentive
compensation or post-retirement compensation and all unexpired severance
agreements, for the benefit of, or relating to, any current or former employee
of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any entity that is a member of
(i) a controlled group of corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the
Code), (ii) a group of trades or businesses under common control (as defined
in Section 414(c) of the Code) or (iii) an affiliated service group (as
defined in Section 414(m) of the Code or the regulations under Section 414(o)
of the Code), any of which includes or included the Parent or a Subsidiary of
the Parent. The Company Employee Plans of the type described in the
definition of Parent Employee Plan (excluding any equity awards or other
equity features contained therein) will be continued on terms generally no
less favorable to Continuing Employees than those in effect at the date of
this Agreement until Parent determines in its sole discretion that the
Continuing Employees may participate in the Parent Employee Plans. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this Section
6.11 are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties hereto and
shall not create any right (A) in any other person, including without
limitation, any employees, former employees, any participant or any
beneficiary thereof in any Company Employee Plan or any benefits
plan, agreement or arrangement of Parent, (B) to continued employment with
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or the Parent or (C) to participate in
any Parent Employee Plans unless and until the Parent so determines in its
sole discretion. Nothing contained in this Section 6.11 or elsewhere in this
Agreement is intended to be or shall be considered to be an amendment of any
plan, program, agreement, arrangement or policy of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or the Parent nor shall it interfere with the Parents or the
Companys right to amend, modify or terminate any Company Employee Plan or to
terminate the employment of any employee of the Company or of any of its
Subsidiaries for any reason. Without limiting the generality of Section 9.4,
no current or former employee or any other individual associated therewith
shall be regarded

 



\- 50 -   for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of the provisions of this
Section 6.11 or have the right to enforce such provisions.

 

6.12 _Company Director and Employee Arrangements_. Prior to the Company
Stockholder Approval, if the Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates enters into any contract or agreement, or makes or enters into any
arrangements or other understandings with any director, officer or employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that relates to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Parent or Merger Sub shall
promptly thereafter notify the Company thereof.

 

6.13 _Company Indebtedness_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
arrange for customary payoff and release letters, lien terminations
(including UCC-3 financing statements) and instruments of discharge (including
mortgage releases, if applicable) to be delivered at the Closing providing for
the payoff, discharge and termination on the Closing Date of all
Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries and any Liens related
thereto, including the Indebtedness specified on Section 6.13 of the Company
Disclosure Letter and any Liens related thereto.

 

6.14 _Takeover Statutes_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Company and the Parent shall each (a) take all action
necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar Law is or
becomes applicable to any of the transactions contemplated hereby and (b) if
the restrictions of any state takeover statute or similar Law become
applicable to any of the transactions contemplated hereby, take all action
necessary to ensure that the transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise lawfully minimize the effect of such Law on the
transactions contemplated hereby.

6.15 _Director Resignations_. Prior to the Closing, other than with respect
to any directors identified by the Parent in writing to the Company two (2)
days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to the Parent
resignations executed by each director of the Company and its Subsidiaries
in office immediately prior to the Effective Time, which resignations shall
be effective at the Effective Time.

with respect to a Superior Proposal and (iii) the Company immediately prior
to or substantially concurrently with such termination pays to the Parent in

8.3; or

 

(g) by the Parent, if there has been a breach of or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company
set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would
cause the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b) not to be
satisfied, and (ii) shall not have been cured, if capable of being cured,
within 20 days following receipt by the Company of written notice of such
breach or failure to perform from the Parent (or, if earlier, the Outside
Date); or

(h) by the Company, if there has been a breach of or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Parent or

not to be satisfied, and (ii) shall not have been cured, if capable of being
cured, within 20 days following receipt by the Parent of written notice of
such breach or failure to perform from the Company (or, if earlier, the

Sections 5.2 (Confidentiality), this Section 8.2 (Effect of Termination),
Section 8.3 (Fees and Expenses), Section 8.4 (Amendment), Section 8.5

remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement.
Nothing shall limit or prevent any party from exercising any rights or
remedies it may have under Section 9.10 hereof in lieu of terminating this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1.

8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) Except as set forth in this Section 8.3 or as otherwise expressly
provided herein, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees and expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

(b) The Company shall pay the Parent a termination fee of $14,500,000.00 (the
"Termination Fee") if this Agreement is terminated:

(i) pursuant to Section 8.1(b), Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(g) and (A)
before the date of such termination, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall
have been publicly announced and not subsequently withdrawn prior to such
termination (or with respect to a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(d),
prior to the Company Meeting), and (B) within twelve

 



\- 55 -   (12) months after the date of such termination, (1) the Company shall have
entered into a definitive agreement in respect of any Acquisition Proposal and

Proposal referred to in this clause (B) need not be the Acquisition Proposal
described in clause (A)); or 

(ii) pursuant to Section 8.1(e) or Section 8.1(f).

The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not
the Termination Fee may be payable under more than one provision of this
Agreement at the same or at different times and the occurrence of different
events. For purposes of this Section 8.3(b), all references to "15%" in the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to
"50%". Any Termination Fee due shall be paid to the Parent by wire transfer of
same-day funds (x) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b),
(d) or (g) within two Business Days after the consummation of the Acquisition
Proposal triggering the obligation to pay the Termination Fee, (y) if this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(e), within two Business Days
after the date of termination of this Agreement or (z) if this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(f), prior to or concurrently with such
termination.

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in Section
8.3(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties hereto would not
enter into this Agreement. In the event that this Agreement has been
terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b), (d), (e), (f) or (g) and the Parent
shall be entitled to receive and shall have received full payment of the
Termination Fee in accordance with Section 8.3(b), the receipt of the
Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all
losses or damages suffered by the Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates in
connection with this Agreement and the Company and its Subsidiaries and any
of their respective former, current or future direct or indirect equity
holders, controlling Persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, general
or limited partners, managers, management companies, members, stockholders,
Affiliates or assignees and any and all former, current or future equity
holders, controlling Persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, general
or limited partners, managers, management companies, members, stockholders,
Affiliates or assignees of any of the foregoing, and any and all former,
current or future heirs, executors, administrators, trustees, successors or
assigns of any of the foregoing (collectively, "Company Related Parties")
shall not have any other liability or obligation for any or all losses or
damages suffered or incurred by the Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person in
connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof) or any matter
forming the basis for such termination and none of the Parent, Merger Sub,
any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to
bring or maintain any other claim, action or proceeding against the Company,
any of its Affiliates or any other Company Related Party arising out of this
Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated hereby or any matters forming
the basis for such termination. The Parents former, current or future direct
or indirect equity holders, controlling persons, directors, officers,
employees, agents, Financing Sources, general or limited partners, managers,
management companies, members, stockholders, Affiliates or assignees, any and
all former, current or future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling
Persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, Financing Sources, general or
limited partners, managers, management companies, members, stockholders,
Affiliates or assignees of

 



\- 56 -   any of the foregoing, and any and all former, current or future heirs,
executors, administrators, trustees, successors or assigns of any of the
foregoing (collectively, "Parent Related Parties") shall not have any
liability or obligation for any or all losses or damages suffered or incurred
by the Company or any other Person in connection with this Agreement or the
termination hereof (or any matter forming the basis for such termination),
and none of the Company, any of its Affiliates or any other Person shall be
entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against any
Parent Related Party arising out of this Agreement, any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis for such
termination. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 8.3(c) shall
limit the rights of the parties under Section 9.10 or the liability of, or the
remedies any Person may have against, the Parent or Merger Sub under this
Agreement.

(d) If the Company fails to pay the Parent any amounts due to the Parent
pursuant to this Section 8.3 within the time periods specified in this Section
8.3, then the Company shall pay the costs and expenses (including reasonable
legal fees and expenses) incurred by the Parent in connection with any
action, including the filing of any lawsuit, taken to collect payment of such
amounts, together with interest on such unpaid amounts at the prime lending
rate prevailing during such period as published in The Wall Street Journal,
calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be
paid until the date of actual payment.

8.4 _Amendment_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may
be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after the Company
Stockholder Approval, but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be
made which by Law requires further approval by such stockholders without such
further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the consent of any entities that have committed to provide or have
otherwise entered into agreements in connection with any debt financing
proposed to be obtained by the Parent in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (any such debt financing, a "Debt Financing"
and any such entities, the "Financing Sources") shall be required for any
amendment, supplement modification or waiver of this Section 8.4 or Sections
6.4, 8.3(c), 9.4, 9.11 or 9.12 hereof to the extent such amendment,
supplement, modification or waiver affects the rights afforded to the
Financing Sources thereunder.

8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors,
may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein
or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with
any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. Such
extension or waiver shall not be deemed to apply to any time for performance,
inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, or noncompliance with any
agreement or condition, as the case may be, other than that which is specified
in the extension or waiver. The failure of any party to this Agreement to
assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of such rights.

9.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Exhibits hereto, the
Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter and the documents and
instruments referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement among the
parties to this Agreement and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements
or representations by or among the parties hereto, or any of them, written or
oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof, and the parties hereto
specifically disclaim reliance on any such prior understandings, agreements or
representations to the extent not embodied in this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in effect
in accordance with its terms until the Effective Time.

9.4 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except (i) from and after the Effective
Time, for the rights of holders of equity securities issued by the Company to
receive the consideration set forth in Article II (with respect to which such
holders shall be third party beneficiaries), (ii) as provided in Section 6.8
(with respect to which the Indemnified Parties shall be third party
beneficiaries, including the ability to enforce the obligations of Parent as
set forth in Section 9.15), (iii) as provided in Section 8.3 (with respect to
which the Company Related Parties and Parent Related Parties shall be third
party beneficiaries) and (iv) as provided in Section 8.4, Section 9.11 and
Section 9.12 (with respect to which any Financing Source (and each of its
successors and assigns) shall be third party beneficiaries), this Agreement
(including Section 6.11) is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer
any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns, to create any agreement of
employment with any Person or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary
hereto. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product
of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 8.5 without
notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

 

9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except that the 

 



\- 59 -   Parent may assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights,
interests and obligations under this Agreement to any entity that is directly
or indirectly wholly-owned by the Parent without the consent of the Company,
provided that the Parent shall not be relieved of any of its obligations
hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.

9.6 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In
the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such invalid or unenforceable term.

 

9.7 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts (including by facsimile or by an electronic scan delivered
by electronic mail), each of which shall be deemed an original but all of
which together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto
and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need
not sign the same counterpart.

9.8  _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to an Article
or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this
Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, table of defined
terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and
no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any party. Whenever
the context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the
corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of
nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa. Any reference to
any federal, state, local or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to
refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the
context requires otherwise. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation." The words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. No
summary of this Agreement prepared by any party shall affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice or

 



\- 60 -   conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of any
jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware.

9.10 _Remedies_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a Person will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of
any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such Person, and
the exercise by a Person of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy.

 

(b) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, in each case without posting a bond or
undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that (i) the party seeking such remedy has an
adequate remedy at law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. 

(c) If, notwithstanding this Section 9.10, a court declines to order specific
performance of the parties obligations under this Agreement and this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, the parties
agree that they are entitled to seek any measure of damages, including in the
case of the Company damages based upon the loss of the economic benefits to
the Companys stockholders of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
without agreeing that such damages will be recoverable; provided that this
Section 9.10(c) shall apply only with respect to the obligations of, and
rights against, the Parent, Merger Sub and the Company under this Agreement
and shall not apply to any obligations of, or rights against, any other Parent
Related Party. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 9.10(c) is not
intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer any rights or remedies upon any
Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary hereto.

 

9.11 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to
submit itself to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware, New Castle County, or, if that court does not have
jurisdiction, a federal court sitting in Wilmington, Delaware in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in
respect of such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined only in any
such court, (c) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat
such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, and (d) agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in any other court. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees that it will
not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-
party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether
in contract or in

 



\- 61 -   tort or otherwise, against any Financing Sources in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including but not
limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to any agreement
related to any Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum other
than any New York State court or Federal court of the United States of America
sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, and any appellate court from any thereof
and that no Financing Source shall be subject to or liable for any special,
consequential, punitive or indirect damages or damages of a tortious nature in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (including any Debt Financing). Each of the parties hereto waives any
defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding
so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be
required of any other person with respect thereto. Any party hereto may make
service on another party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the
party to be served at the address and in the manner provided for the giving of
notices in Section 9.2. Nothing in this Section 9.11, however, shall affect
the right of any person to serve legal process in any other manner permitted
by law.

9.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY
AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES
HERETO ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING ANY DEBT FINANCING AND THE OBLIGATIONS OF ANY
FINANCING SOURCES IN RESPECT THEREOF).

9.13 _Disclosure Letters_. The Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent
Disclosure Letter shall each be arranged in Sections corresponding to the
numbered Sections contained in this Agreement and the disclosure in any
Section shall qualify (a) the corresponding Section of this Agreement and (b)
the other Sections of this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably
apparent from a reading of such disclosure that it also qualifies or applies
to such other Sections. The inclusion of any information in the Company
Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to be an
admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such information is
required by the terms hereof to be disclosed, is material, has resulted in or
would result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, or is outside the Ordinary Course of Business.

 

9.14 _Company s Knowledge_. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Companys Knowledge" means the actual knowledge, after reasonable inquiry,
as of the date hereof of the individuals identified in Section 9.14 of the
Company Disclosure Letter.

9.15 _Parent Obligations_. The Parent agrees to take all action necessary
(including providing any necessary funds) to cause each of Merger Sub and the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to perform all of its agreements,
covenants and obligations under this Agreement and shall be jointly and
severally liable with Merger Sub for any breach of this Agreement by Merger
Sub.

\- 63 -  EXHIBIT A  FORM OF WARRANT LETTERS

 

[ISTA Pharmaceuticals Letterhead]

March , 2012

[Addressee]

 

Dear:

As we have discussed, we would like to confirm our mutual understanding of
certain of the provisions in the Facility Agreement (the "Facility Agreement")
dated as of September 26, 2008, as well as the warrant to acquire [] shares
of our common stock issued under the Facility Agreement, as to which you are
the Holder (the "Warrant"). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein
shall have their respective meanings assigned in the Facility Agreement or the
Warrant, as the case may be.

 

In connection with a Major Transaction, the Lenders may elect to require, upon
consummation of such Major Transaction, the prepayment of amounts outstanding
under the Facility Agreement for an amount equal to the Put Price in
accordance with Section 5.4 of the Facility Agreement. You hereby confirm that
other than the payment of 110% of principal amount of the Note and accrued
and unpaid interest, there are no other amounts currently accrued or payable
under the Financing Documents that would be payable upon a Major Transaction
in accordance with Section 5.4 of the Facility Agreement.

 

Upon receipt of the Put Price and termination of the Obligations in accordance
with Section 5.4 of the Facility Agreement, you hereby confirm that the
Lenders shall terminate any security interest arising under the Financing
Documents.

Following the consummation of a merger of the Company that is a Cash-Out
Major Transaction, to the extent that the Holder of a Warrant had not
previously elected to terminate all of the Warrant pursuant to Sections
5(c)(i) and 5(c)(iii) of the Warrant, you hereby confirm that the only
remaining right of the Holder pursuant to the Warrant shall be the right to
receive from the Company, upon Exercise of the Warrant in full (or the
remaining portion of the Warrant that has not previously been Exercised or
terminated, as the case may be) in accordance with the terms of the Warrant
(including payment of the applicable Exercise Price), an amount in cash equal
to the amount in cash that would have been payable to such Holder pursuant to
such merger in exchange for the number of Warrant Shares such Holder would
have been entitled to receive had such Holder effected a Cash Exercise of this
Warrant in full (or the remaining portion of this Warrant that had not
previously been Exercised or terminated, as the case may be)
immediately prior to such merger (without taking into consideration the 9.98%
Cap).

Without limitation of the foregoing, upon consummation of a merger of the
Company that is a Cash-Out Major Transaction, obligations of the Company under
the Registration Rights Agreement (other than any pursuant to Section 7, and 8
and 12 thereof), and the right of the Holder to receive any dividends or
other distributions of any kind made to the holders of the Companys common
stock in accordance with Section 5 of the Warrant (other than previously
payable and unpaid dividends or distributions under said Section 5), shall
terminate.  The Company is contemporaneously obtaining letters substantially in the form
of this letter from the holders of each of the other warrants currently
outstanding that were issued under the Facility Agreement.

Prior to any transfer or assignment of all or a portion of the Warrant, you
agree to obtain an executed letter, substantially in the same form as and
confirming the understandings set forth in this letter, from any transferee or
assignee of the Warrant.

 

This letter shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal
laws of the State of New York.

 

Please confirm that this is our mutual understanding by signing this letter
below and returning it to the undersigned.

 

Very truly yours,
