the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Sub, the Company or
the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital
stock of Sub:



(a) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall be a wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent or of a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Each stock certificate of
Sub evidencing ownership of any shares of common stock of Sub shall, following
the Merger, evidence ownership of the same number of shares of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation.



(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent Owned Stock_. Each share of
Company Common Stock owned by the Company, Parent or Sub or any subsidiary of
the Company or Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer
be outstanding and shall  



 

10  automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no cash,
Parent Common Stock or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable
in exchange therefor.



(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to adjustment as provided
in _Section 2.01(c)(iv)_ and other than Dissenter Shares (as defined in
_Section 2.04)_ and fractional shares subject to _Section 2.02(e)_, each
issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock held by stockholders of
the Company (other than shares cancelled pursuant to _Section 2.01(b)_) shall
be converted into the right to receive:



(i) a fraction of a share (rounded to four (4) decimal places) of validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent Common Stock at an exchange ratio
(the " _ _Exchange Ratio__ ") as determined in accordance with this _Section
2.01(c)_ (the " _ _Stock Consideration__ "); and 



(ii) an amount in cash equal to $6.50 (the " _ _Cash Consideration__ " and,
together with the Stock Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.02(e)_, the "
_ _Merger Consideration__ ").



(iii) The Exchange Ratio shall be calculated as follows:



(A) If the Average Parent Stock Price (as defined below in _Section
2.01(c)(iii)(D)_) is equal to or more than $72.86 (the " _ _Upper Limit__ "),
then the Exchange Ratio shall be 0.0892 shares of Parent Common Stock for
each share of Company Common Stock.



(B) If the Average Parent Stock Price is less than the Upper Limit but more
than $53.86 (the " _ _Lower Limit__ "), then the Exchange Ratio shall be equal
to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock for each share of Company
Common Stock determined by dividing $6.50 by the Average Parent Stock Price.



(C) If the Average Parent Stock Price is equal to or less than the Lower
Limit, then the Exchange Ratio shall be 0.1207 shares of Parent Common Stock
for each share of Company Common Stock.



(D) For purposes of this Agreement, " _ _Average Parent Stock Price__ " means
an amount equal to the average of the daily closing sale prices for the Parent
Common Stock on the NYSE, as reported in The Wall Street Journal,
Northeastern edition, for each of the twenty (20) consecutive trading days
ending with and including the second (2nd) complete trading day prior to the
Effective Time (as adjusted for any reclassification, recapitalization,
subdivision, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment of, or
a stock dividend on, the Parent Common Stock as provided in _Section
2.01(c)(iv)_).



(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of
Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares
or a different class by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization,
subdivision, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or a
stock dividend thereon shall be  



 

11  declared with a record date within said period, the Exchange Ratio and the
Option Exchange Ratio (as defined in _Section 2.03(e)_) shall
be correspondingly adjusted.



(v) As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate (excluding any shares
of Company Common Stock canceled pursuant to _Section 2.01(b)_ and any
Dissenter Shares) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such
Certificate (or, in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, upon
delivery of an affidavit or bond, as applicable, pursuant to _Section
2.02(k)_) in accordance with _Section 2.02_, and any Dissenter Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
Merger Consideration upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with
_Section 2.04_, without interest.



SECTION 2.02. _Exchange Procedures_.



(a) _Exchange Agent_. As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement and in any event not less than three (3) days prior
to dissemination of the Company Proxy Statement (as defined in _Section
6.01(a)_) to the stockholders of the Company, Parent shall select and enter
into an exchange agreement with a bank or trust company reasonably
satisfactory to the Company to act as exchange agent (the " _ _Exchange
Agent__ ") for payment of Merger Consideration upon surrender of Certificates
(or, in the case of lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, upon delivery of an
affidavit or bond, as applicable, pursuant to _Section 2.02(k)_). At the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit
of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance
with this _Article II_ , through the Exchange Agent (i) certificates
representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable and (ii) the
amount of cash consideration payable, in each case, pursuant to _Section
2.01(c)_ in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (such
shares of Parent Common Stock and cash, together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the " _
_Exchange Fund__ "). For the purposes of such deposit, Parent shall assume
that there will not be any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. Parent
shall make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash
sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with
_Section 2.02(e)_. The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the Parent Common Stock contemplated to be issued
pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_ out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund
may not be used for any other purpose.



(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate or Certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were
converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
2.01(c)_, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, together with  



 

12  such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as promptly as
practicable, the amount of cash and the number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock that the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant
to _Section 2.01(c)_ into the right to receive, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment may be made to a person other than the person
in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.02_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common
Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant
to _Section 2.01(c)_. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable
upon surrender of any Certificate.



(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date on or
after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any Certificate
formerly representing Company Common Stock with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable upon surrender thereof, and no cash payment in
lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to
_Section 2.02(e)_ until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with
this _Article II_. Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the Certificate representing
whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without
interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable
in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.02(e)_ and the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock.



(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid (and issued) in accordance with the terms of this
_Article II_ upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be
deemed to have been paid (and issued) in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, subject, however, to the
Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have
been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this
Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time; _provided_ that the
Company has deposited the funds to pay such dividend or distribution with its
transfer agent prior to the Closing, and after the Effective Time there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,  



 

13  after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of
Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article II_.



(e) _No Fractional Shares_.



(i) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Company Common Stock pursuant to
_Section 2.01(c)_, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of Parent Common Stock. For
purposes of this _Section 2.02(e)_, all fractional shares to which a single
record holder would be entitled shall be aggregated and calculations shall be
rounded to three (3) decimal places.



(ii) In lieu of any such fractional shares, each holder of Company Common
Stock who would otherwise be entitled to such fractional shares shall be
entitled to an amount in cash, without interest, rounded to the nearest cent,
equal to the product of (A) the amount of the fractional share interest in a
share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled under  _Section
2.01(c)_ (or would be entitled but for this _Section 2.02(e)_) and (B) the
Average Parent Stock Price.



(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for six (6)
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and
any holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this
_Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Parent and the
Surviving Corporation for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration and
any applicable dividends or distributions with respect to any Parent Common
Stock constituting Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.02(c)_.



(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash or any shares of Parent
Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to five (5)
years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on
which Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such cash,
shares, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.



(h)  _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis;
_provided, however,_ that all such investments shall be in (i) obligations of,
or guaranteed by, the United States of America, (ii) commercial paper
obligations receiving the highest rating from either Moodys Investors
Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation or (iii) certificates of
deposit of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent.



 

14 (i) _Withholding Rights_. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Company Common Stock
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under
any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing authority, the
Surviving Corporation will be treated as though it withheld an appropriate
amount of the type of consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock, sold such consideration for
an amount of cash equal to the fair market value of such consideration at the
time of such deemed sale and paid such cash proceeds to the
appropriate Taxing authority.



(j) _Income Tax Treatment_. It is intended by the Parties that the Merger
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. The Parties hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) of the U.S. Treasury Regulations
promulgated under the Code.



(k) _Lost Stock Certificates_. If any Certificate representing Company Common
Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting
by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving
Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration, pursuant to this _Article II_.



(l) _Transfer Taxes on Surrendered Certificates_. If any cash is to be
remitted to a person (other than the person in whose name any Certificate
representing Company Common Stock surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered), it shall be a condition of such exchange that such Certificate
shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.



(m) _Affiliates_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any
Certificate representing Company Common Stock surrendered for exchange by
any "affiliate" (as determined pursuant to _Section 6.10_) of the Company
shall not be exchanged until Parent has received a written agreement from such
person as provided in _Section 6.10_.



SECTION 2.03. _Company Stock Options; Holding Stock Options._  



(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, (i) each option to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock (other than the Holding Stock Options) that (A) was granted
pursuant to the Earle M. Jorgensen Company 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (the " _
_Company Option Plan__ ") and (B) is outstanding at the Effective Time (the "
_ _Company Stock Options__ ") shall (1) cease to represent a right to acquire
shares of Company Common Stock, and (2) shall be converted automatically into
options to purchase, on the same terms and conditions _mutatis mutandis_ as
were applicable to such options prior to the  



 

15  Effective Time, shares of Parent Common Stock (each such option an " _
_Adjusted Option__ "), and (ii) Parent shall assume all of the obligations of
the Company under the Company Option Plan, with respect to each outstanding
Adjusted Option and the agreements evidencing the grants thereof; _provided,
however_ , that from and after the Effective Time, (x) the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of such Adjusted Option shall
be equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were purchasable
under the applicable Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio, and (y) the per share exercise
price under each such Adjusted Option shall be equal to the price obtained by
dividing the per share exercise price of each such Company Stock Option by the
Option Exchange Ratio; _provided, however_ , that, in the case of any Company
Stock Option, the exercise price and the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to such option shall be determined in a manner consistent with
the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the number of shares and the per share exercise price of each Adjusted Option
shall be adjusted in accordance with the requirements of Section 424 of the
Code. Accordingly, with respect to any stock options, fractional shares shall
be rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares and where necessary the
per share exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest cent.



(b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver
to the holders of Adjusted Options appropriate notices setting forth such
holders rights pursuant to the Company Option Plan and indicating that the
agreements evidencing the grants of such Adjusted Options shall continue in
effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required
by this _Section 2.03_ after giving effect to the Merger). Parent shall
comply with the terms of the Company Option Plan and ensure, to the extent
required by, and subject to the provisions of, the Company Option Plan, that
the Company Stock Options, which qualify as "incentive stock options" at the
Effective Time, continue to qualify as "incentive stock options" after the
Effective Time.



(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall reserve for issuance the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock necessary to satisfy Parents
obligations under _Section 2.03(a)_. Promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent shall file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 or such
other appropriate form or a post-effective amendment to a previously filed
registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to options to acquire Parent Common Stock issued
or issuable pursuant to  _Section 2.03(a)_, shall file with the NYSE an
amendment to its listing application covering the issuance and shall use its
best efforts to maintain the current status of the prospectus contained, or
incorporated by reference, in such registration statement, as well as comply
with any applicable listing requirements of the NYSE and state securities or
"blue sky" laws, for so long as such options remain outstanding.



(d) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Holding Stock Option shall
be exchanged for the right to receive an amount, if any, equal to (i) the
difference between (x) $13.00 and (y) the applicable per share exercise price,
multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Holding Stock Option, and subject to any applicable withholding of
Taxes.



 

16 (e) For purposes of this Agreement, the " _ _Option Exchange Ratio__ " shall
mean the Exchange Ratio multiplied by two (2).



SECTION 2.04.  _Dissenter Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, shares (" _ _Dissenter Shares__ ") of Company Common Stock
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held
by any person who is entitled to demand and properly demands payment for such
Dissenter Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section
262 of the DGCL (the " _ _Dissenter Rights__ ") shall not be converted into
Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.01(c)_, but rather the holders
of Dissenter Shares shall be entitled to payment for such Dissenter Shares in
accordance with the Dissenter Rights; _provided, however_ , that if any such
holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the
right to receive payment under the Dissenter Rights, then the right of such
holder to be paid in accordance with the Dissenter Rights shall cease and
such Dissenter Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to
receive, Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.01(c)_. The Company
shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any written notice of intent to demand
payment, or any written demand for payment, received by the Company in respect
of any shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Except as (i) expressly set forth in the corresponding section of that certain
letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement, from the Company to Parent
and Sub (the " _ _Company Disclosure Letter__ "), it being understood that
disclosure of any matters under any section of the Company Disclosure Letter

reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
has delivered or made available to Parent true and complete copies of the

stock-based performance units, commitments, Contracts, arrangements or
undertakings of any kind to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
party or by which any of them is bound (x) obligating the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered

the consummation of the Transactions and compliance with the terms hereof
will not (either alone or in combination with any other event), (i) entitle
any Participant to any additional compensation, severance or other benefits,
(ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or
funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits
under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation
pursuant to, any Company Benefit Plan, or (iii) result in any breach or

which is a Company Multiemployer Pension Plan), or (ii) pending investigations
(other than routine inquiries) by any Governmental Entity with respect to any
Company Benefit Plan (other than a Company Benefit Plan which is a Company
Multiemployer Benefit Plan). Except as could not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect, all contributions, premiums and
benefit payments under or in connection with the Company Benefit Plans that
are required to have been made by the Company or any Company Subsidiary have
been timely made, accrued or reserved for in all material respects. 



(h) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any material liability
or obligations, including under or on account of a Company Benefit Plan,
arising out of the hiring of persons to provide services to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary and treating such persons as consultants or
independent contractors and not as employees of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary.



(i) The Company has no legally binding plan or commitment to create any
additional Company Benefit Plan or modify or change any existing Company
Benefit Plan that would be reasonably expected to result in
material liabilities to the Company, except as may be required by applicable
Law. To the extent that any such plan or commitment exists, whether or not
expected to result in material liability to the Company, the Company has
provided a copy of such plan or commitment to Parent.



 

27 (j) No employee, director or consultant is or will become entitled to death or
medical post-employment benefits by reason of service to the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries, other than coverage mandated by section 4980B of the
Code or similar state law, where the payment of any such benefits would have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. 



SECTION 3.12. _Litigation_. The Company SEC Documents accurately disclose as
of the date hereof all suits, claims, actions, investigations or proceedings
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or
any Company Subsidiary that are required to be disclosed therein by the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act. As of the date of this Agreement, there
is no action, suit, proceeding or investigation pending or, to the knowledge
of the Company, threatened against the Company or any Company Subsidiary that
would have a Company Material Adverse Effect.



SECTION 3.13. _Compliance with Applicable Laws_. The Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and their relevant personnel and operations are in compliance
with all applicable Laws, including Laws relating to occupational health and
safety, except to the extent that the failure to be in compliance with any
such Law has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the Company, no employee or agent
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has been engaged in any activities
that are prohibited or are cause for criminal or civil penalties, including,
but not limited to, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or
receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate),
directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to any
Governmental Entity, governmental official or any relative of such official,
to obtain or retain business or to receive favorable treatment with regard to
the Companys business or operations. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has received any written communication during the past two (2)
years from a Governmental Entity that alleges that the Company or a Company
Subsidiary is not in compliance in any material respect with any applicable
Law. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have in effect all Permits
necessary or advisable for them to own, lease or operate their properties and
assets and to carry on their businesses as now conducted, except for such
Permits the absence of which has not had or would not reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. There has occurred no violation of,
default (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) under, or
event giving to others any right of termination, amendment or cancellation
of, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, any such Permit, except
for any such violation, default or event which has not had or would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. There is no
event, other than the Merger and the other Transactions, which, to the
knowledge of the Company, would reasonably be expected to result in the
revocation, cancellation, non-renewal or adverse modification of any such
Permit, except for any such event that has not had or would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this _Section 3.13_ does not relate to matters with respect to
Taxes (which are the subject of _Section 3.09_), ERISA (which are the subject
of _Section 3.11_), labor Laws (which are the subject of _Section 3.16_) or
Environmental Laws (which are the subject of  _Section 3.18_).



SECTION 3.14. _Assets Other than Real Property Interests_. The Company and
the Company Subsidiaries have good and valid title to all of their respective
properties and assets, in each case free and clear of all Liens, except (a)
mechanics, carriers, workmens, repairmens or other like Liens arising or
incurred in the ordinary course of business relating to obligations that



 

28  are not delinquent or that are being contested by the Company or a Company
Subsidiary and for which the Company or a Company Subsidiary has
established adequate reserves, (b) Liens for Taxes that are not due and
payable or that may thereafter be paid without interest or penalty, (c) Liens
that secure debt obligations that are reflected as liabilities on the
consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of March 31, 2005 contained in
the Company SEC Documents and the existence of which is referred to in the
notes to such balance sheet, (d) Liens arising under original purchase price
conditional sales contracts and equipment leases with third parties entered
into in the ordinary course of business, (e) leases, subleases and similar
agreements set forth in _Section 3.14_ of the Company Disclosure Letter or
(f) other imperfections of title or encumbrances, if any, that, individually
or in the aggregate, do not materially impair, and would not reasonably be
expected materially to impair, the continued use and operation of the assets
to which they relate in the conduct of the business of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as presently conducted. This _Section 3.14 _does not
relate to real property or interests in real property, such items being the
subject of _Section 3.15_, or to Intellectual Property, such items being the
subject of _Section 3.19_.



SECTION 3.15. _Real Property_. _Section 3.15_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter sets forth a complete list of all Company Property, including any prime
or underlying leases relating thereto, which is necessary to conduct
the business and operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as
they are presently conducted. The Company or a Company Subsidiary has good,
valid and marketable fee title to all Owned Property and good and valid
leasehold title to all Leased Property, in each case subject only to (a)
Liens described in clause (a), (b), (c) or (f) of _Section 3.14_ or Liens
imposed or promulgated under applicable Law or by any Governmental Entity with
respect to real property, including zoning, building, environmental or
similar restrictions, (b) leases, subleases and similar agreements set forth
in _Section 3.15_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, (c) easements, covenants,
rights-of-way and other similar restrictions of record (other than options or
rights of first refusal or offer to purchase) or (d) any conditions that would
be shown by a current, accurate survey or physical inspection of any Company
Property made on the date of this Agreement. Any material reciprocal easement
or operating agreements with respect to Company Property are set forth in
_Section 3.15_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. With respect to the Company
Leased Property, (i) the Company or one of the Company Subsidiaries has the
right to use and occupancy of the Company Leased Property for the full term of
the lease relating thereto, (ii) each lease for the Company Leased Property is
a legal, valid and binding agreement, enforceable in accordance with its
terms, of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws
relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally and
to general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law), (iii) to the knowledge of the Company, there
is no, nor has the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries received written
notice of any, default under any lease for the Company Leased Property (or
any condition or event, which, after notice or a lapse of time or both would
constitute a default thereunder) and (iv) neither the Company nor any of the
Company Subsidiaries has assigned its interest under any lease for the
Company Leased Property or sublet any part of the premises covered thereby or
exercised any option or right thereunder.



SECTION 3.16. _Labor Matters_. _Section 3.16_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter contains a list of each collective bargaining agreement between the
Company or any Company



 

29  Subsidiary and any labor union. Since March 31, 2005, neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has experienced any labor strikes,
union organization attempts, requests for representation, work slowdowns or
stoppages or disputes due to labor disagreements, and, to the knowledge of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, there is currently no such action
threatened against or affecting the Company or any Company Subsidiary that
would reasonably be expected to result in a material liability to the Company.
The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are each in compliance with all
applicable Laws with respect to labor relations, employment and employment
practices, occupational safety and health standards, terms and conditions of
employment and wages and hours, human rights, pay equity and workers
compensation, except to the extent that the failure to be in compliance with
any such Law has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. There is no unfair labor practice charge or
complaint against the Company or any Company Subsidiary pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, threatened before the
National Labor Relations Board or any comparable Federal, state, provincial or
foreign agency or authority that would reasonably be expected to result in
material liability to the Company. No grievance or arbitration proceeding
arising out of a collective bargaining agreement is pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, threatened against the
Company or any Company Subsidiary that would reasonably be expected to result
in material liability to the Company.

with regard to Parents business or operations. Neither Parent nor any Parent
Subsidiary has received any written communication during the past two (2)
years from a Governmental Entity that alleges that Parent or a Parent

39 SECTION 4.11. _Controls and Procedures_.



(a) Each of the principal executive officer and the principal

and the Parent Subsidiaries as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure, (ii) disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation, to
its auditors and the audit committee any significant deficiencies or material

concerning the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including
reasonable assurance (i) that transactions are executed in accordance with
managements general or specific authorizations and recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to
maintain asset accountability and (ii) regarding prevention or timely
detection of any unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that
could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Parent Financial Statements.
Parents management, with the participation of Parents principal executive
and financial officers, has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of
Parents internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended

were effective using the framework specified in Parents Annual Report filed

SECTION 6.01. _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Company Proxy Statement;
Company Stockholders  Meetings_.



(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a Company proxy statement (the
" _ _Company Proxy Statement__ ") in preliminary form and Parent shall
prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4, in which the Company Proxy
Statement and a Parent prospectus relating to the Share Issuance will be
included, and each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable efforts
to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to
have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing, but, in any event, no more than three (3)
business days after the SEC notifies Parent that the SEC will consider a
written request for the acceleration of the effective date of the Form S-4 and
shall use reasonable efforts to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as
necessary to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions. Absent any
restraint under applicable Law, the Company will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Company Proxy Statement to be mailed to
its stockholders as promptly as practicable (but no more than five (5)
business days) after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities
Act. Parent shall also take any action (other than qualifying to do business
in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified) required to be taken
under any applicable state securities laws in connection with the issuance of
Parent Common Stock in the Merger and the Transactions and the Company shall
furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders of the Company
Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such
action. The parties shall notify each other promptly of the receipt of any
comments from  



 

52  the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for
amendments or supplements to the Company Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or

correspondence between such or any of its representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Company Proxy
Statement, the Form S-4 or the Merger.



(b) The Form S-4 shall comply in all material respects with all applicable
Laws respecting securities, including rules and regulations promulgated by the
SEC.



(c) No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4, and no
correspondence with the SEC with respect thereto, will be made by Parent or
the Company without the prior consent of the other Party (including providing
the other Party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
amendment or supplement). Parent will advise the Company, promptly after it
receives notice thereof, of the time when any of the Form S-4 has become
effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any
stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock
that comprises the Stock Consideration issuable in connection with the Merger
for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for
amendment of the Form S-4 or comments thereon and responses thereto or
requests by the SEC for additional information. If, at any time prior to
the Closing Date, any information relating to Parent or the Company, any of
their respective subsidiaries or affiliates, officers or directors, should be
discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Form S-4, so that any of such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the Party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other Parties and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated
to the stockholders of the Company.



(d) Each of Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause to be delivered to each other a letter of its independent auditors,
dated (i) a date within two (2) business days prior to the date on which the
Form S-4 shall become effective and (ii) the Closing Date, and addressed to
such other Party and its directors, in form and substance customary for
"comfort" letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection
with registration statements similar to the Form S-4 and reasonably
acceptable to the recipient Party.



(e) Subject to _Section 5.02_ and other than pursuant to Rule 14a-12 of the
Exchange Act with respect to public announcements made in compliance with
_Section 6.08_, no amendment or supplement to the Company Proxy Statement,
nor any response to any comments or inquiry from the SEC, will be made by the
Company or Parent without the approval of such other Party, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.



(f) The Company shall, as soon as practicable following the date of
this Agreement, and in any event, subject to _Section 6.01(g)_ and any
applicable Law or Judgment, within forty-five (45) days following the mailing
of the Company Proxy Statement, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold
the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of seeking the Company
Stockholder Approval; _provided, however_ , that the Company may delay
calling, giving notice of,  



 

53  convening or holding the Company Stockholders Meeting for a reasonable
period to address and resolve any restraint affecting this Agreement or
the Transactions arising from an applicable Law or Judgment (including,
without limitation, addressing and resolving any comments from the SEC);
_provided, further_ , that, when scheduling the Stockholders Meeting, the
Company will consider the Parents desire that the Closing, if practicable,
occur on the first (1st) business day of a calendar month. Subject to
_Section 5.02(b)_, the Company Proxy Statement shall include the
recommendation of the Company Board that the adoption of this Agreement by the
Companys stockholders is advisable and that the Company Board has determined
that the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to and in the best
interests of the Companys stockholders (the " _ _Company Recommendation__ ").



(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding paragraph,
at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting and subject to
compliance with _Section 5.02_, the Company may adjourn or postpone the
Company Stockholders Meeting in response to a Company Takeover Proposal for
such time as the Company Board determines is appropriate to investigate and
consider such Company Takeover Proposal, if the Company Board determines in
good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors that such Company Takeover Proposal may reasonably be expected to
lead to a Superior Company Proposal and that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The Company shall
not be required to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting if this Agreement
is terminated before the Company Stockholders Meeting is held.



(h) Each of the Company and Parent agrees, as to itself and its subsidiaries,
that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it or its

of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (ii) the
Company Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the
date of mailing to stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The Company and Parent will cause the
Form S-4 to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated

Party may reasonably request;  _provided_ that each of the Company and Parent

sampling or analysis of the sort commonly referred to as a Phase II

obligations of the Company with respect to the Company RSP and the
Supplemental SBP. Parent shall guarantee performance of the Surviving
Corporations obligation to make an Additional Employer Contribution to the
Company RSP and the Supplemental SBP. Parent agrees to register and list any
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to the Company RSP as the Additional
Employer Contribution. At the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) amend the definition
of "Company Stock" in the Company RSP and Supplemental SBP to mean shares of
Parent Common Stock, (ii) amend the "Additional Employer Contribution"
required by Appendix 3.3 of the Company RSP to be made for the "Plan Year"
ended March 31, 2006, to state that such Additional Employer Contribution
will be made in a number of shares of Parent Common Stock at least equal to
the number of shares of Company Common Stock that would have been contributed
for such Plan Year had the Merger not occurred, multiplied by the Option
Exchange Ratio and (iii) amend Section 6.5 of the Company RSP to delete
restrictions on trading Company Common Stock contained in subsections 6.5(b)
and 6.5(c)(5) therein (but not the diversification rules in Section 6.5(c)(2)
and (3)). Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall reserve for issuance the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock necessary to satisfy Parents
obligations under this _Section 6.05(a)_. The Form S-4 and the NYSE listing
application shall include the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to the
Company RSP (and the Supplemental SBP) as Merger Consideration and as the
Additional Employer Contribution.



(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall file with the SEC
a registration statement on Form S-8 or such other appropriate form with
respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or issuable pursuant
to the Company RSP and shall use its best efforts to maintain the current
status of the prospectus contained, or incorporated by reference, in such
registration statement, as well as comply with any applicable listing
requirements of the NYSE and state securities or "blue sky" laws, for so long
as the Company RSP has an investment option including Parent Common Stock,
which investment option shall be continued for not less than one (1) year
after the Effective Time.



 

57 (c) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain for not less than one (1) year after the Effective
Time the Company Benefit Plans as in effect on the date of this Agreement as
set forth on the Company Disclosure Letter (other than the Company Option
Plan) or to provide coverage and benefits, including, without limitation,
with respect to the Company RSP, to make annual contributions pursuant to
Section 3.3 of the Company RSP consistent with past practice, to each employee
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the " _
_Covered Employees__ ") that are at least as favorable in the aggregate to
such employees as those in effect on the date of this Agreement, except as may
be required pursuant to any applicable collective bargaining agreement.



(d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor in accordance with their respective terms (as
in effect on the date of this Agreement), all of the Companys employment,
change of control, severance and termination agreements, plans and policies
(including, without limitation, bonuses, incentives or deferred compensation)
with its employees disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter. Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, timely amend any and all plans
and arrangements (and any and all related documents) adopted or maintained by
the Company prior to the Effective Time that provide for the deferral of
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code to the extent necessary to
avoid liability under such Section 409A.



(e) For a period of one (1) year from the Closing Date, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall provide the Covered Employees, who, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, were employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and had not entered into an employment, change of control,
severance or termination agreement with the Company, with annual rates of base
salary or hourly wages, as applicable, and annual incentive opportunities that
are at least as favorable in the aggregate to such employees as those in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Parties agree that the Companys Management Incentive Cash Bonus Plan for
fiscal year ending March 31, 2007 will be paid on a twelve-month fiscal year
basis consistent with the general approach of the same plan for the fiscal
year ending March 31, 2006, and the Companys Management Incentive Cash Bonus
Plan may change to a calendar year basis for the nine-month period ending
December 31, 2007.



(f) With respect to any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement
maintained by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary (including any severance plan),
for all purposes of determining eligibility to participate and vesting and,
except under any defined benefit pension plans, for purposes of benefit
accrual, service by a Company employee with the Company or any Company
Subsidiary shall be treated as service with Parent or any Parent Subsidiary;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.



(g) From and after the Effective Time, those certain transfer restriction
letter agreements between the Company and each of its executive officers and
district managers shall terminate and be of no further force and effect.

proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative (a " _
_Claim__ "), including any such Claim in which an individual who is now, or
has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior
to the Effective Time, a director, officer or employee of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries or who is or was serving at the request of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a director, officer or employee
of another person (the " _ _Indemnified Parties__ ") is, or is threatened to
be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part
out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is or was a director,
officer or employee of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries prior
to the Effective Time or (ii) this Agreement or any of the Transactions,
whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the Parties
shall cooperate and use their best efforts to defend against and respond
thereto. Parent shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to (i) maintain and preserve, for a period of six
(6) years after the Effective Time, the rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses of all Indemnified Parties as
provided in the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws and the comparable charter
and organization documents of each Company Subsidiary as in effect on
the date hereof and (ii) honor all of the Companys obligations to indemnify
(including any obligations to advance funds for expenses) all Indemnified
Parties, for and in connection with acts or omissions by such persons
occurring prior to the Effective Time to the extent that such obligations of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary exist on the date of this Agreement,
whether pursuant to the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, the comparable
charter and organizational documents of each Company Subsidiary, individual
indemnity agreements or otherwise, as the case may be, and such obligations
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with the terms of the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, each
Company Subsidiarys charter and organizational documents and such individual
indemnity agreements from the Effective Time until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations with respect to any Claims against such
persons arising out of such acts or omissions.



(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, each Indemnified Party
against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or
judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any
Claim based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the
fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, while serving in such capacity, and
pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or any acts or omissions
occurring, at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time (including matters, acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions).



 

(c) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance maintained by the Company and each Company Subsidiary (
_provided_ that Parent may substitute therefor policies with reputable and
financially sound carriers of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous) with
respect to claims arising from or related to facts or events which occurred at
or before the Effective Time and with a total  



 

59  insured coverage of $50,000,000 of directors and officers liability
insurance and $5,000,000 of fiduciary liability insurance for such six (6)
year period; _provided, however_ , that Parent shall not be obligated to make
aggregate premium payments for the entire six (6) year run-off period for such
insurance policies to the extent such premiums exceed $2,200,000 (the " _
_Maximum Premium__ "). If such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all,
or can only be obtained at an aggregate premium in excess of the Maximum
Premium after giving effect to any credit obtainable from the premiums paid
for the directors and officers liability insurance and the fiduciary
liability insurance for the current year, Parent shall maintain the most
advantageous policies of directors and officers insurance obtainable for
an aggregate premium equal to the Maximum Premium.



(d) The obligations under this _Section 6.06_ shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to affect adversely any Indemnified Party to whom
this _Section 6.06_ applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified
Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Party to whom this
_Section 6.06_ applies and their respective heirs, successors and assigns
shall be express third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.06_). In the
event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or
surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may
be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.06_ for the
benefit of the Indemnified Parties.



(e) This _Section 6.06_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the
Indemnified Parties, their heirs and personal representatives and shall be
binding on Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their successors and assigns.



SECTION 6.07. _Fees and Expenses_.



(a) Except as provided below, all fees and expenses (including all fees and
expenses of attorneys, accountants, investment bankers, experts and
consultants) incurred in connection with the Merger shall be paid by the Party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated,
except that expenses incurred in connection with filing, printing and mailing
of (i) the Company Proxy Statement and the Form S-4 shall be the sole
responsibility of Parent and Sub and (ii) the HSR filings shall be shared
equally between Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other
hand.



(b) If (x) (i) after the date of this Agreement, any person makes a Company
Takeover Proposal, and (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant
to _Section 8.01(c)_, or (y) after the date of this Agreement, the Company or
Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_, then the
Company shall pay to Parent by wire transfer of same day funds a fee amount
equal to $20,476,157, which fee shall be payable and shall be paid five (5)
business days after the date of the termination of this Agreement as provided
in the foregoing clause (x) or (y).



SECTION 6.08. _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect
to the Merger and the Transactions shall be a joint press release. Thereafter,
except for any press  



 

60  release concerning a Company Takeover Proposal or a withdrawal or
modification of the Company Recommendation, Parent and Sub, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, shall use reasonable efforts to consult
with each other before issuing, and provide each other reasonable opportunity
to review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with
respect to the Merger and the other Transactions and shall use reasonable
efforts to not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, court
process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with the NYSE.



SECTION 6.09. _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes incurred in connection

Agreement, the Company shall deliver to Parent a letter identifying all
persons who are expected by the Company to be, at the date of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, "affiliates" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145
under the Securities Act. The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to
cause each such person to deliver to Parent on or prior to the date of mailing
of the Company Proxy Statement a written affiliate agreement substantially in
the form attached as _Exhibit B_.

shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for

are to be exchanged for and converted into Parent Common Stock pursuant to
_Section 2.01(c)_ to be de-listed from the NYSE and de-registered under the
Exchange Act as soon as practicable after the Effective Time.



SECTION 6.12. _Tax Treatment_. The Parties intend the Merger to qualify as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. Each of Parent, Sub and the
Company and each of their respective affiliates shall not take any action and
shall not fail to take any action or suffer to exist any condition which
action or failure to act or condition would prevent, or would be reasonably
likely to prevent, the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.



SECTION 6.13.  _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder

effect to the transactions contemplated by _Section 2.03_) as may be
necessary or appropriate pursuant to Rule 16b-3(d) and Rule 16b-3(e)
promulgated under the  



 

61  Exchange Act to exempt (i) the conversion of Company Common Stock into cash

pursuant to the terms of this Agreement by officers and directors of the
Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act or by employees or directors of the Company who may become an officer or
director of Parent subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of

party copies of the resolutions to be adopted by the respective Boards of
Directors to implement the foregoing.

consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions if the failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to
obtain such consent would be material to the Company or Parent as applicable;



(b) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity in

SECTION 9.03. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or
Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.



SECTION 9.04. _Counterparts; Facsimile_. This Agreement may be executed in
one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties. Facsimile
transmission of any signed original document and/or retransmission of any
signed facsimile transmission will be deemed the same as delivery of an
original. At the request of any Party, the parties will confirm facsimile
transmission by signing a duplicate original document.



SECTION 9.05. _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement, taken together with the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent
Disclosure Letter, the Confidentiality Agreement and the Voting Agreement,
constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to
the Merger and are not intended to confer upon any person other than the
parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, except as provided in
_Sections 6.05_ and  _6.06_.



 

68 SECTION 9.06. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless
of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of
conflicts of laws thereof.



SECTION 9.07. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the
prior written consent of the other Parties, except that Sub may assign, in its
sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under
this Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Sub of any of its obligations
under this Agreement. Any purported assignment without any required consent
shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and
their respective successors and assigns.



SECTION 9.08. _Enforcement_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any California
state court or any Federal court located in the County of Los Angeles in the
State of California, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. In addition, each of the Parties hereto (a)
consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any California state
court or any Federal court located in the County of Los Angeles in the State
of California in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or the
Merger, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (c)
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the
Merger in any court other than any California state court or any Federal court
sitting in the County of Los Angeles in the State of California and (d) waives
any right to trial by jury with respect to any action related to or arising
out of this Agreement or the Merger.
