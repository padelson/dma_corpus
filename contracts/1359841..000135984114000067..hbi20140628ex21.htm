Sellers (in the case of the Institutional Seller, on the Institutional
Sellerâ€Ÿs behalf and on the behalf of each other member of the Institutional
Sellerâ€Ÿs Group) (the "Guarantee Beneficiaries") the due and punctual payment
by the Purchaser of any amounts which it is, or becomes, obliged to pay
pursuant to any of the Transaction Documents (the "Purchaser's Guaranteed
Obligations"). 13.2 146BIf and whenever the Purchaser defaults for any reason
whatsoever in the performance of any of the Purchaserâ€Ÿs Guaranteed
Obligations, the Purchaserâ€Ÿs Guarantor shall forthwith upon demand
unconditionally perform (or procure performance of) and satisfy (or procure
the satisfaction of) the Purchaserâ€Ÿs Guaranteed Obligations in regard to which
such default has been made in the manner prescribed by this Agreement or the
relevant Transaction Document so that the same benefits shall be conferred on
the relevant Guarantee Beneficiary as such person would have received if the
Purchaserâ€Ÿs Guaranteed Obligations had been duly performed and satisfied by
the Purchaser. 13.3 147BThis guarantee is to be a continuing guarantee and
accordingly is to remain in force until all the Purchaserâ€Ÿs Guaranteed
Obligations have been performed or satisfied. This guarantee is in addition to
and without prejudice to and not in substitution for any rights or security
which the Sellers or any member of the Institutional Sellerâ€Ÿs Group may now or
hereafter have or hold for the performance and observance of the Purchaserâ€Ÿs
Guaranteed Obligations. 13.4 148BAs a separate and independent obligation the

Obligations (including any moneys payable) which may not be enforceable
against or recoverable from any member of the Purchaserâ€Ÿs Group by reason of
any legal limitation, disability or incapacity on or of any such members or
any other fact, matter, event or circumstance (other than any limitation
imposed by this Agreement or any other Transaction Document) shall
nevertheless be enforceable against and recoverable from the Purchaserâ€Ÿs
Guarantor as though the same had been incurred by the Purchaserâ€Ÿs
Representative and the Purchaserâ€Ÿs Guarantor were the sole or principal
obligor in respect thereof and shall be performed or paid by the Purchaserâ€Ÿs
Guarantor on demand. 13.5 149BThe liability of the Purchaserâ€Ÿs Guarantor under
this Clause 13: (a) 369Bshall not be released or diminished by any variation
of the Purchaserâ€Ÿs Guaranteed Obligations or any forbearance, neglect or delay
in seeking performance of the Purchaserâ€Ÿs Guaranteed Obligations or any
granting of time for such performance; and (b) 370Bshall not be affected or
impaired by reason of any other fact or event which in the absence of this
provision would or might constitute or afford a legal or equitable discharge
or release or a defence to a guarantor.

provided that this does not interfere with the proper operation of the Group
after Completion. 5. If the Institutional Seller: (a) notifies the Purchaser
in accordance with Paragraph 3(a) above that the draft Completion Statement is
agreed; or (b) fails to give notice to the Purchaser as required by Paragraph
3 above, then the draft Completion Statement shall be final and binding and
shall, for the purposes of this Agreement, be treated as agreed on the date on
which such notice is served or the next date after the last date on which such
notice could be served (as applicable). 6. If the Institutional Seller serves
a Sellersâ€Ÿ Disagreement Notice in accordance with Paragraph 3(b) above, the
Purchaser and the Institutional Seller shall use reasonable efforts to resolve
the matters in dispute within 10 Business Days after (and excluding) the day
of receipt of the Sellersâ€Ÿ Disagreement Notice. 7. If the disputed items are
agreed within the period specified in Paragraph 6, the draft Completion
Statement (amended as agreed) shall be final and binding and shall, for the
purposes of this Agreement, be treated as agreed on the date on which such
agreement is reached. 8. If the disputed matters are not agreed within the
period specified in Paragraph 6, either the Purchaser or the Institutional
Seller may refer the remaining matters in dispute to the Reporting Accountants
(as defined in Paragraph 9 below), provided that, upon such referral, all
matters contained in the draft Completion Statement other than those items
that are the subject of the referral shall become final and binding on all
Parties. 9. UReporting Accountants U (a) Mazars shall be engaged jointly by
the Institutional Seller and the Purchaser as reporting accountants (the
"Reporting Accountants") on the terms set out below. If either (i) Mazars is
unable or unwilling to act or (ii) the terms of engagement of the Reporting
Accountants have not been settled within five Business Days of the referral
pursuant to Paragraph 8 (or such longer period as the Institutional Seller and
the Purchaser may agree) then, those accountants shall be deemed never to have
become the Reporting Accountants and new Reporting Accountants shall be
selected by the Institutional Seller and the Purchaser within five days of a
notice by one to the other requiring such agreement or failing such agreement
to be nominated on the application of either of them by or on behalf of the
President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales (or
any successor thereto). (b) Except to the extent that the Institutional Seller
and the Purchaser agree otherwise, the Reporting Accountants:  

   

 ![](hbi20140628ex21134.jpg) 

114 (i) shall determine only whether any, and if so which, adjustments to the
draft Completion Statement required by the Institutional Seller on which the
Institutional Seller and the Purchaser still disagree shall be made and shall
not put forward any alternative adjustment(s) that is outside of the range
provided by the Institutional Seller and the Purchaser; (ii) shall apply the
accounting principles, policies, procedures, practices, categorisations,
definitions, methods and techniques set out in USchedule 7U; and (iii) for the
avoidance of doubt shall not be entitled to determine the scope of their own
jurisdiction. (c) The Reporting Accountants shall act as experts and not as
arbitrators and their determination of any matter falling within their
jurisdiction shall be final and binding on the Parties save in the event of
manifest error (when the relevant part of their determination shall be void
and the matter shall be remitted to the Reporting Accountants for correction).
In particular, without limitation, their determination shall be deemed to be
incorporated into the draft Completion Statement. (d) Each Party shall bear
its own costs and expenses in relation to this USchedule 6 U (including the
fees of their respective accountants and other advisers incurred in connection
with the determination of the Completion Statement), provided that the fees
and expenses of the Reporting Accountants shall be allocated between the
Sellers, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, as determined
(and recorded in their final determination) by the Reporting Accountants based
upon the relative success (in terms of percentages) of each such Partyâ€Ÿs
claims. For example, if the final determination reflects a 60-40 compromise of
the Partiesâ€Ÿ claims, the Reporting Accountants would allocate expenses 40% to
the Party whose claims determined to be 60% successful and 60% to the Party
whose claim was determined to be 40% successful. (e) Nothing in this Paragraph
9 shall entitle a Party or the Reporting Accountants access to any information
or document that is protected by legal professional privilege or litigation

Completion Statement, the proceedings of the Reporting Accountants or another
matter arising out of this Agreement or in defending any claim or argument or
alleged claim or argument relating to this Agreement or its subject matter.

Agreement, and not on the basis of an independent review. The Reporting
Accountants shall consider only the disputed matters that were included in the
Sellersâ€Ÿ Disagreement Notice and the Reporting Accountants may not assign a
value to any item other than within the range of the values assigned by the
Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Institutional Seller, on the other hand.

(but shall not be obliged to) submit to the Reporting Accountants three copies
of a memorandum responding to the Initial Report submitted to the Reporting
Accountants by the other Party (the "Rebuttal Report"). If a Party elects not
to submit a Rebuttal Report, it shall notify the Reporting Accountants in
writing that it has waived its right to do so. The Rebuttal Report may respond
solely to the arguments raised, and information submitted, by the other Party
in its Initial Report and no Party may introduce new arguments or rely on new
information in the Rebuttal Report that was not part of such Partyâ€Ÿs Initial
Report or which are not directly responsive to an argument raised by the other

Purchaser, the Reporting Accountants shall distribute a copy of each Rebuttal
Report to the other Party. (v) At any time within ten Business Days of the
submission of the Initial Reports or any Rebuttal Reports by the Institutional
Seller and the Purchaser, the Reporting Accountants may submit written
questions to either Party following the procedures set out in Paragraph 10(c)

submit such a report from both the Institutional Seller, on the one hand, and
the Purchaser, on the other hand, and receipt of all responses to any written
questions submitted by the Reporting Accountants (and responses thereto), the
Reporting Accountants shall endeavour to issue a report containing their
determination within ten Business Days after the later of (i) receiving
Rebuttal Reports from both the Institutional Seller and the Purchaser or

responses (if any) to any written questions submitted by the Reporting
Accountants to either Party following the procedures set out in Paragraph
10(c) below. (vii) Unless requested by the Reporting Accountants in writing
pursuant to the terms of Paragraph 10(c) below, neither the Institutional
Seller nor the Purchaser may present any additional information or arguments
to the Reporting Accountants, either orally or in writing. (viii) The
Reporting Accountants shall render their decision without conducting a hearing
but shall provide reasons for their determination. (c) After receiving both
Initial Reports and Rebuttal Reports, if any, the Reporting Accountants may
submit written questions to the Institutional Seller, on the one hand, and the
Purchaser, on the other hand, for written responses or may direct requests for
additional information, calculations, or supporting documentation to the
Parties reasonably needed by the Reporting Accountants in order to clarify or
understand any position or argument made by a Party in its written submission,
in which case the Parties agree to co-operate with such requests (including,
without limitation, by ensuring that the Reporting Accountants are provided
copies of all relevant books and records and other information) in the manner
and in accordance with the timing described in this USchedule 6 U. If any such
questions are addressed to only one Party, the Reporting Accountants shall
submit the questions to that Party, with a copy to the other Party. Once

provided to the Reporting Accountants. In response thereto, the other Party
may, within five Business Days, submit a response to such answer(s) to the
Reporting Accountants and shall provide a copy of its response to the other
Party at the time it is provided to the Reporting Accountants. If any such
questions are addressed to both the Institutional Seller and the Purchaser,
both Parties shall have five Business Days from the date of receipt to respond
to the Reporting Accountants and each Party shall provide a copy of its
written answers to the other Party at the time they are provided to the
Reporting Accountants. In response thereto, each Party may, within five
Business Days, submit a response to the other Partyâ€Ÿs answer(s) to the
Reporting Accountants and shall provide a copy to the other Party at the time
it is provided to the Reporting Accountants. (d) The Parties agree not to
engage in any ex parte communication with the Reporting Accountants. The
Reporting Accountants will be required to include a representation in their
engagement letter that they have not discussed

Parties, and to include a covenant in their engagement letter not to engage in
ex parte communications with any Party throughout the course of their
engagement. (e) The Reporting Accountants will be required to agree that, if
between the delivery of the Sellersâ€Ÿ Disagreement Notice and their engagement,
the Institutional Seller and the Purchaser have exchanged certain proposals
relating to the disputed items, such proposals were (i) intended solely for
purposes of facilitating settlement discussions, (ii) were confidential and
(iii) were provided solely on the condition and understanding that such
proposals would not be permitted to be disclosed in any court or arbitration
hearing, including with respect to the Reporting Accountantsâ€Ÿ engagement in
the dispute. The Reporting Accountants will be instructed to disregard any
evidence of such settlement proposals and negotiations in their consideration
of the disputed matters. (f) Except in connection with the dispute being
resolved with respect to this Agreement, during the term of their engagement
no member of the Reporting Accountantsâ€Ÿ team may work on any matters related
to the Sellers or the Purchaser or otherwise perform services for any person
that in any case may present a conflict of interest that is reasonably likely
to affect the Reporting Accountantsâ€Ÿ services or the unbiased performance of
services by any member of the Reporting Accountantsâ€Ÿ team. The foregoing
restrictions on the Reporting Accountants will not apply to employees of the
Reporting Accountants not assigned to work on this engagement. On the date
they are engaged to resolve any dispute under this Agreement, the Reporting
Accountants will be required to confirm to the Parties that they have not had
any communication with any Party or discussed the matter with any person
except as disclosed in writing to the Parties or a communication in which
representatives of both the Parties participated. 11. UInstitutional Seller

 ![](hbi20140628ex21141.jpg) 

121 and procedures applied in each local business unit for year-end reporting

Inventory Inventory shall be valued at the lower of acquisition cost or
manufacturing cost, and net realisable value. Net realisable value shall be
deemed to be acquisition cost or manufacturing cost, including all costs of
purchase, costs of conversion and other costs in bringing the inventories to

consistent with that applied in the 2013 Audited Accounts - Raw materials that
are damaged and cannot be used or sold, or have passed their sell by date -
95% - 100%, on a basis consistent with that applied in the 2013 Audited
Accounts - Packaging that is damaged and cannot be used or sold, or has passed
its sell by date - 100% - Raw materials that have a quality issue and are
therefore unusable where DBA has no recourse to the vendor - 95% - 100%, on a
basis consistent with that applied in the 2013 Audited Accounts - WIP that is

future requirement and that cannot be reprocessed for alternative use - 75% -
Finished goods for which no sale or utilization are forecasted - 75% -

classified as such on a consistent basis to the classification used in the
2013 Audited Accounts) - 75% Provisions for slow moving inventory shall be
calculated as follows:  

   

 ![](hbi20140628ex21142.jpg)

the basis of historical sales), and all products of a "fashion" or seasonable
nature: i) Raw materials - 75% ii) WIP and finished goods - 50% - Excess

for current products; (b) previous collections classified in three categories:
discount - 25% reserve, out of collection - 50% reserve, and non-current - 75%
reserve; (c) other slow moving: returns - 50% reserve; (d) Yellowing issues to
be provisioned on a basis consistent with that applied in the March 2014
Management Accounts - Russia: (a) obsolete items with no sales forecasted -
75% reserve; (b) slow moving - second last collection - 25% reserve On a
consistent basis with that applied in the March 2014 Management Accounts, the
calculation for obsolete, slow moving and excess inventory provisions shall be
reduced to the extent that management considers the sale of provided products
in excess of their NRV is likely to occur. Except for the specific provisions
noted above, no provisions against inventory shall be made in the Completion
Statement. Standard costs are updated annually by the Group at the start of
the financial year and the FY15 budget standard costs shall be applied for the
purposes of the Completion Statement. Standard costs shall be calculated using
the same methodology as that used to prepare standard costs in the 2013
Audited Accounts. (d) Trade accounts receivable Provision shall be made for
trade receivables as at the Effective Time using the same criteria as that

parties, and prepared using the same criteria as that used by management in
the preparation of the 2013 Audited Accounts. (g) Liabilities (i) To the
extent that vendors have not invoiced on or before the Effective Time in
respect of goods or services (where contractual criteria have been met such
that a liability to the vendor exists) on or before the Effective Time, an

consistent basis with that applied in the 2013 Audited Accounts. (ii) The
