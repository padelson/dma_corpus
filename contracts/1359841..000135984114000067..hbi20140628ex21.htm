provided by the Institutional Seller and the Purchaser; (ii) shall apply the
accounting principles, policies, procedures, practices, categorisations,
definitions, methods and techniques set out in USchedule 7U; and (iii) for the
avoidance of doubt shall not be entitled to determine the scope of their own
jurisdiction. (c) The Reporting Accountants shall act as experts and not as
arbitrators and their determination of any matter falling within their
jurisdiction shall be final and binding on the Parties save in the event of
manifest error (when the relevant part of their determination shall be void
and the matter shall be remitted to the Reporting Accountants for correction).
In particular, without limitation, their determination shall be deemed to be
incorporated into the draft Completion Statement. (d) Each Party shall bear
its own costs and expenses in relation to this USchedule 6 U (including the
fees of their respective accountants and other advisers incurred in connection
with the determination of the Completion Statement), provided that the fees
and expenses of the Reporting Accountants shall be allocated between the
Sellers, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, as determined
(and recorded in their final determination) by the Reporting Accountants based
upon the relative success (in terms of percentages) of each such Party‟s
claims. For example, if the final determination reflects a 60-40 compromise of
the Parties‟ claims, the Reporting Accountants would allocate expenses 40% to
the Party whose claims determined to be 60% successful and 60% to the Party
whose claim was determined to be 40% successful. (e) Nothing in this Paragraph
9 shall entitle a Party or the Reporting Accountants access to any information
or document that is protected by legal professional privilege or litigation
privilege, provided that a Party shall not be entitled to refuse to supply
such part or parts of documents as contain only the facts on which the
relevant claim or argument is based. (f) Each Party and the Reporting
Accountants shall, and shall procure that its accountants and other advisers
shall, keep all information and documents provided to them pursuant to this
Paragraph 9 confidential and shall not use the same for any purpose, except
for disclosure or use in connection with the preparation of the draft
Completion Statement, the proceedings of the Reporting Accountants or another
matter arising out of this Agreement or in defending any claim or argument or
alleged claim or argument relating to this Agreement or its subject matter.

115 10. UDetermination (a) The determination of the Reporting Accountants
shall be based solely on written presentations submitted by or on behalf of
the Institutional Seller and the Purchaser which are in accordance with the
guidelines and procedures set out below and otherwise in accordance with this
Agreement, and not on the basis of an independent review. The Reporting
Accountants shall consider only the disputed matters that were included in the
Sellers‟ Disagreement Notice and the Reporting Accountants may not assign a
value to any item other than within the range of the values assigned by the
Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Institutional Seller, on the other hand.
(b) The timetable for the Reporting Accountants to make their determination
will be governed by the following procedures: (i) Within ten Business Days of
retaining the Reporting Accountants, the Institutional Seller and the
Purchaser shall each submit to the Reporting Accountants three copies of a
memorandum (which must include supporting exhibits) explaining their
respective positions of all unresolved disputed items (the "Initial Report").
(ii) Within one Business Day of receiving Initial Reports from both the
Institutional Seller and the Purchaser, the Reporting Accountants shall
distribute a copy of each Initial Report to the other Party. (iii) Within ten
Business Days of receiving the other Party‟s Initial Report from the Reporting
Accountants, each of (i) the Institutional Seller and (ii) the Purchaser may
(but shall not be obliged to) submit to the Reporting Accountants three copies
of a memorandum responding to the Initial Report submitted to the Reporting
Accountants by the other Party (the "Rebuttal Report"). If a Party elects not
to submit a Rebuttal Report, it shall notify the Reporting Accountants in
writing that it has waived its right to do so. The Rebuttal Report may respond
solely to the arguments raised, and information submitted, by the other Party
in its Initial Report and no Party may introduce new arguments or rely on new
information in the Rebuttal Report that was not part of such Party‟s Initial
Report or which are not directly responsive to an argument raised by the other
Party‟s Initial Report, except to the extent such new arguments or new
information are used in direct response to arguments raised and information
submitted by the other Party in its Initial Report. (iv) Within one Business
Day of receiving Rebuttal Reports from both the Institutional Seller and the
Purchaser, the Reporting Accountants shall distribute a copy of each Rebuttal
Report to the other Party. (v) At any time within ten Business Days of the
submission of the Initial Reports or any Rebuttal Reports by the Institutional
Seller and the Purchaser, the Reporting Accountants may submit written
questions to either Party following the procedures set out in Paragraph 10(c)  

   

 ![](hbi20140628ex21136.jpg) 

116 (vi) Upon receipt of the Rebuttal Report or notice waiving the right to
submit such a report from both the Institutional Seller, on the one hand, and
the Purchaser, on the other hand, and receipt of all responses to any written
questions submitted by the Reporting Accountants (and responses thereto), the
Reporting Accountants shall endeavour to issue a report containing their
determination within ten Business Days after the later of (i) receiving
Rebuttal Reports from both the Institutional Seller and the Purchaser or
notice waiving the right to submit such report, as applicable, or (ii) any
responses (if any) to any written questions submitted by the Reporting
Accountants to either Party following the procedures set out in Paragraph
10(c) below. (vii) Unless requested by the Reporting Accountants in writing
pursuant to the terms of Paragraph 10(c) below, neither the Institutional
Seller nor the Purchaser may present any additional information or arguments
to the Reporting Accountants, either orally or in writing. (viii) The
Reporting Accountants shall render their decision without conducting a hearing
but shall provide reasons for their determination. (c) After receiving both
Initial Reports and Rebuttal Reports, if any, the Reporting Accountants may
submit written questions to the Institutional Seller, on the one hand, and the
Purchaser, on the other hand, for written responses or may direct requests for
additional information, calculations, or supporting documentation to the
Parties reasonably needed by the Reporting Accountants in order to clarify or
understand any position or argument made by a Party in its written submission,
in which case the Parties agree to co-operate with such requests (including,
without limitation, by ensuring that the Reporting Accountants are provided
copies of all relevant books and records and other information) in the manner
and in accordance with the timing described in this USchedule 6 U. If any such
questions are addressed to only one Party, the Reporting Accountants shall
submit the questions to that Party, with a copy to the other Party. Once
received, the Party to whom the questions are addressed shall have five
Business Days to answer the Reporting Accountants‟ questions, and shall
provide a copy of its written answers to the other Party at the time they are
provided to the Reporting Accountants. In response thereto, the other Party
may, within five Business Days, submit a response to such answer(s) to the
Reporting Accountants and shall provide a copy of its response to the other
Party at the time it is provided to the Reporting Accountants. If any such
questions are addressed to both the Institutional Seller and the Purchaser,
both Parties shall have five Business Days from the date of receipt to respond
to the Reporting Accountants and each Party shall provide a copy of its
written answers to the other Party at the time they are provided to the
Reporting Accountants. In response thereto, each Party may, within five
Business Days, submit a response to the other Party‟s answer(s) to the
Reporting Accountants and shall provide a copy to the other Party at the time
it is provided to the Reporting Accountants. (d) The Parties agree not to
engage in any ex parte communication with the Reporting Accountants. The
Reporting Accountants will be required to include a representation in their
engagement letter that they have not discussed  

   

 ![](hbi20140628ex21137.jpg) 

117 the disputed matter with any Party prior to their being retained by the
Parties, and to include a covenant in their engagement letter not to engage in
ex parte communications with any Party throughout the course of their
engagement. (e) The Reporting Accountants will be required to agree that, if
between the delivery of the Sellers‟ Disagreement Notice and their engagement,
the Institutional Seller and the Purchaser have exchanged certain proposals
relating to the disputed items, such proposals were (i) intended solely for
purposes of facilitating settlement discussions, (ii) were confidential and
(iii) were provided solely on the condition and understanding that such
proposals would not be permitted to be disclosed in any court or arbitration
hearing, including with respect to the Reporting Accountants‟ engagement in
the dispute. The Reporting Accountants will be instructed to disregard any
evidence of such settlement proposals and negotiations in their consideration
of the disputed matters. (f) Except in connection with the dispute being
resolved with respect to this Agreement, during the term of their engagement
no member of the Reporting Accountants‟ team may work on any matters related
to the Sellers or the Purchaser or otherwise perform services for any person
that in any case may present a conflict of interest that is reasonably likely
to affect the Reporting Accountants‟ services or the unbiased performance of
services by any member of the Reporting Accountants‟ team. The foregoing
restrictions on the Reporting Accountants will not apply to employees of the
Reporting Accountants not assigned to work on this engagement. On the date
they are engaged to resolve any dispute under this Agreement, the Reporting
Accountants will be required to confirm to the Parties that they have not had
any communication with any Party or discussed the matter with any person
except as disclosed in writing to the Parties or a communication in which
representatives of both the Parties participated. 11. UInstitutional Seller

 ![](hbi20140628ex21141.jpg) 

121 and procedures applied in each local business unit for year-end reporting
purposes shall be applied. A provision for product returns shall be recognized
as soon as the business authorises such returns, with no delay for either
receipt of product or processing of product. Retail - revenue shall be
recognised when an entity has sold a product to the customer. The Group
provides various sales incentives to resellers and consumers which are
recognised as a reduction of revenue such as discounts, rebates, coupons,
slotting fees, volume based incentives and cooperative advertising. (c)
Inventory Inventory shall be valued at the lower of acquisition cost or
manufacturing cost, and net realisable value. Net realisable value shall be
deemed to be acquisition cost or manufacturing cost, including all costs of
purchase, costs of conversion and other costs in bringing the inventories to
their present location and condition, less provisions for obsolete and slow
moving inventory. In determining manufacturing cost, standard costs shall be
used. a) Provisions for obsolete inventory shall be calculated as follows: -
Raw materials and packaging for which no sales or utilization is forecast
(including by substitution in another product) - 95 % - 100%, on a basis
consistent with that applied in the 2013 Audited Accounts - Raw materials that
are damaged and cannot be used or sold, or have passed their sell by date -
95% - 100%, on a basis consistent with that applied in the 2013 Audited
Accounts - Packaging that is damaged and cannot be used or sold, or has passed
its sell by date - 100% - Raw materials that have a quality issue and are
therefore unusable where DBA has no recourse to the vendor - 95% - 100%, on a
basis consistent with that applied in the 2013 Audited Accounts - WIP that is
sitting in the production line (or plant inventory) for which there is no
future requirement and that cannot be reprocessed for alternative use - 75% -
Finished goods for which no sale or utilization are forecasted - 75% -
Finished goods that are classified as „seconds‟ or „off quality‟ (and
classified as such on a consistent basis to the classification used in the
2013 Audited Accounts) - 75% Provisions for slow moving inventory shall be
calculated as follows:  

   

 ![](hbi20140628ex21142.jpg) 

122 - Red flag inventory i.e. inventory representing more than 12 months of
forecast sales (other than in a limited number of business units which in the
year ended 30 June 2013 calculated red flag inventory on the basis of
inventory representing more than 12 months of historical sales ("Business
Units Applying Historical Sales"), which shall continue to calculate this on
the basis of historical sales), and all products of a "fashion" or seasonable
nature: i) Raw materials - 75% ii) WIP and finished goods - 50% - Excess
inventory i.e. inventory representing more than 17 weeks of future sales but
less than 12 months of forecast sales (other than Business Units Applying
Historical Sales which shall calculate this by reference to historical sales):
i) Raw materials - 50% ii) WIP and finished goods - 25% No other provisions
for inventory shall be made with the exception of provisions specific to the
following countries (on the basis that no double-counting of provisions shall
be included): - France: (a) inventories over expected sales depreciated at 25%
for current products; (b) previous collections classified in three categories:
discount - 25% reserve, out of collection - 50% reserve, and non-current - 75%
reserve; (c) other slow moving: returns - 50% reserve; (d) Yellowing issues to
be provisioned on a basis consistent with that applied in the March 2014
Management Accounts - Russia: (a) obsolete items with no sales forecasted -
75% reserve; (b) slow moving - second last collection - 25% reserve On a
consistent basis with that applied in the March 2014 Management Accounts, the
calculation for obsolete, slow moving and excess inventory provisions shall be
reduced to the extent that management considers the sale of provided products
in excess of their NRV is likely to occur. Except for the specific provisions
noted above, no provisions against inventory shall be made in the Completion
Statement. Standard costs are updated annually by the Group at the start of
the financial year and the FY15 budget standard costs shall be applied for the
purposes of the Completion Statement. Standard costs shall be calculated using
the same methodology as that used to prepare standard costs in the 2013
Audited Accounts. (d) Trade accounts receivable Provision shall be made for
trade receivables as at the Effective Time using the same criteria as that
used by management in the preparation of the 2013 Audited Accounts.

warranty claim for tax liabilities. (f) Intercompany balances No provisions
shall be made in respect of intercompany trading balances due to/from the
Institutional Seller or any subsidiaries of the Institutional Seller that do
not form part of the Group. All intercompany balances shall be reconciled and
outstanding receivable/payable balances shall be agreed between respective
parties, and prepared using the same criteria as that used by management in
the preparation of the 2013 Audited Accounts. (g) Liabilities (i) To the
extent that vendors have not invoiced on or before the Effective Time in
respect of goods or services (where contractual criteria have been met such
that a liability to the vendor exists) on or before the Effective Time, an
amount of accrued expense shall be included in the Completion Statement on a
consistent basis with that applied in the 2013 Audited Accounts. (ii) The
Completion Statement shall include an accrual for external loan interest
accrued but not paid as at the Effective Time. (iii)Leases classified as

penalties of DBApparel S.A.S., acting as head of the French DBA tax group and
sole tax payer vis-a-vis the French treasury, in respect of the Financial Year
2010, which arises as a result of the denial of some or all of the 2009 RandD
tax credit generated by DIM S.A.S., as determined in accordance with the most
recent decisions of the Ministry of Research or the French Tax Authorities
issued as at the date of the Completion Statements in respect of the RandD tax
credit audit currently being undertaken at the level of DIM S.A.S. (the "2009
Denied French RandD Tax Credit"); (ii) an amount equal to any additional
corporate tax liability including any related interest and penalties of
DBApparel S.A.S., acting as head of the French DBA tax group and sole tax
payer vis-a-vis the French treasury, in respect of the Financial Year 2011,
which arises as a result of the denial of some or all of the 2010 RandD tax

recent decisions of the Ministry of Research or the French Tax Authorities
issued as at the date of the Completion Statements in respect of the RandD tax
credit audit currently being undertaken at the level of DIM S.A.S. (the "2010
Denied French RandD Tax Credit"); (iii)an amount equal to any additional

French DBA tax group and sole tax payer vis-a-vis the French treasury, in
respect of the Financial Years 2012, 2013 and 2014, which would arise as a
result of a denial of some or all of the 2011, 2012 and/ or 2013 RandD tax
credits generated by DIM S.A.S. if the  

   

 ![](hbi20140628ex21145.jpg) 

125 denial were determined by (1) calculating the percentage of denied RandD tax
credits in accordance with the most recent decisions of the Ministry of
Research or the French Tax Authorities issued as at the date of the Completion
Statements for Financial Year 2010 described in i. above, (2) calculating the
percentage of denied RandD tax credits in accordance with the most recent
decisions of the Ministry of Research or the French Tax Authorities issued as
at the Completion Date for Financial Year 2011 described in ii. above, (3)
calculating the average of the two percentages calculated in (1) and (2), and
(4) applying that average percentage to the RandD tax credits claimed in
Financial Years 2012, 2013 and 2014 (the "2011, 2012, and 2013 Denied French
RandD Tax Credits"). (iv) To the extent that an appeal of any decision of the
Ministry of Research or the French Tax Authorities is made by DBApparel S.A.S.
or DIM S.A.S resulting after Completion in a final decision from any Taxation
Authority denying an amount of French RandD Tax Credits for 2009, 2010, 2011,
2012 and 2013 lower than the 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 Denied French RandD
Tax Credits, or the actual amount of denied French RandD Tax Credits for those
Financial Years is otherwise found after Completion to be lower than the 2009,
2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 Denied French RandD Tax Credits, the Sellers hereby
agree not to request the repayment of any excess French RandD Tax Credit Denial
Amount from the Purchaser. (v) In the event that the most recent decisions of
the Ministry of Research or the French Tax Authorities mentioned in i. and ii.
above do not specify the additional corporate tax liability of DBApparel
S.A.S. for the relevant Financial Years, such amounts shall be calculated by
the Purchaser and the Institutional Seller acting together in good faith and
on the basis of the information provided in such decisions. In the event that
the Purchaser and the Institutional Seller are required to make such
calculations then the amounts calculated in accordance with iii. above shall
also be made on the basis of such calculations. The Purchaser and the
Institutional Seller shall endeavour to agree such amounts within a reasonable
time and in any event not later than 15 Business Days prior to the date on
which the draft Completion Statement is submitted to the Institutional Seller
in accordance with Schedule 6 to this Agreement. In the event that the
Purchaser and the Institutional Seller do not agree such amounts by that date,
the Purchaser and Institutional Seller shall jointly appoint Grande Armee
Conseil (the "RandD Advisor") to calculate such amounts. If any member of the
team assigned by the RandD Advisor to determine the dispute in question has
previously worked, or is currently working, on any matter related to the
Sellers or the Purchaser or has otherwise performed or is performing services
for any person that in any case may present a conflict of interest that is
reasonably likely to affect the services to be provided by the RandD Advisor or
the unbiased performance of services by any member of the RandD Advisor‟s team,
then the RandD Advisor shall be  

   

 ![](hbi20140628ex21146.jpg)

Accountants of England and Wales (or any successor thereto) on the application
of either of the Purchaser or the Institutional Seller . The fees and expenses
of the RandD Advisor being shared equally by the Purchaser and the Institutional
Seller. The RandD Advisor shall act as expert and not as arbitrator and its
determination of the amounts pursuant to this sub-paragraph (v) shall be (A)
in accordance with the procedures in Paragraphs 9 and 10 of Schedule 6 (Post
Completion Adjustments) the provisions of which shall be applied mutatis
mutandis and (B) final and binding on the Parties save in the event of
manifest error (when the relevant part of their determination shall be void
and the matter shall be remitted to the RandD Advisor for correction). (ix) Any
outstanding Transaction related expenses incurred by the Group pre- Completion
in respect of the Transaction, including without limitation payments to
employees and advisors. (x) The Group operates hedges against certain foreign
exchange risks. These derivative financial instruments shall be recognised at
