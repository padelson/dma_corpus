Shares will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenters&#146; Shares
in accordance with those provisions unless and until such holders fail to perfect or effectively
withdraw or lose their rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective
Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such rights to appraisal
and payment under the DGCL, such Dissenters&#146; Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been
converted into and have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of
any demands received by the Company for appraisals of Shares. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or
offer to settle or settle any such demands. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, if Parent or the Company abandon or are finally enjoined or prevented from carrying out
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated under this Agreement, the right of each holder
of Dissenters&#146; Shares to receive payment of the appraised value of Shares as provided herein shall

commitment letter (the &#147;<U>Debt Commitment Letter</U>&#148;), dated as of November&nbsp;16, 2007, from
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (the &#147;<U>Lender</U>&#148;), with Lender acting in arranging and
bookrunning roles. Pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter and subject to the terms and conditions
contained therein (including the exhibits thereto), the Lender has committed to provide $1.5
billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness to Merger Sub at the Closing (the &#147;<U>Debt
Commitment</U>&#148;). The obligations to fund the commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter are not
subject to any condition other than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. Merger Sub has
no knowledge of any fact or occurrence that would reasonably be expected to (i)&nbsp;make any of the
assumptions or statements set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter inaccurate, (ii)&nbsp;cause the Debt
Commitment Letter to be ineffective or (iii)&nbsp;preclude in any material respect the satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt
Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and has not been amended in any material respect, and
the financing and other fees that are due and payable on or before the date hereof under the Debt
Commitment Letter have been paid in full. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Debt
Commitment letter, assuming for purposes of this representation that the conditions set forth in
Article&nbsp;VI are satisfied, the funds contemplated to be received pursuant to the Debt Commitment
Letter will be sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration and to make all other necessary payments
(including related fees and expenses) by Merger Sub in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, prior to the Distribution Date, Quanex may cause one or more of members of the Spinco
Group that are corporations to convert into, merge with and into or otherwise transfer all of their
assets, subject to all of their liabilities, to limited liability companies, of which Quanex or
another member of the Spinco Group will be the sole member (collectively, such transactions are the
&#147;<U>Conversions</U>&#148;);
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, after the Conversions and prior to the Distribution Date, Quanex will, pursuant to
this Agreement, transfer or cause to be transferred to Spinco all of the Spinco Assets, which
represent substantially all of the assets comprising Quanex&#146; building products divisions, and will
assume all of the Spinco Liabilities, as contemplated by this Agreement (the
&#147;<U>Contribution</U>&#148;);
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, either before or after the Distribution, Spinco will merge with and into Spinco Sub
(the &#147;<U>Spinco Merger</U>&#148;) pursuant to the Spinco Merger Agreement;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, on the Distribution Date and pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
Quanex will distribute (the &#147;<U>Distribution</U>&#148;) to the holders as of the Record Date of the
outstanding common stock of Quanex, par value $0.50 per share (&#147;<U>Quanex Common Stock</U>&#148;), for
each share of Quanex Common Stock outstanding, either (a)&nbsp;one unit of limited liability company
interest (the &#147;<U>Spinco Interest</U>&#148;) of Spinco (if the Spinco Merger occurs after the
Distribution) or (b)&nbsp;one share of Spinco Sub common stock (the &#147;<U>Spinco Sub Common Stock</U>&#148;)
(if the Spinco Merger occurs prior to the Distribution); and
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Quanex has filed with the SEC a Form&nbsp;10 Registration Statement pursuant to the
Exchange Act in connection with the Distribution;

assumptions and valuation methodology set forth on <U>Schedule&nbsp;6.2(b)</U> attached hereto (the
&#147;<U>Revised Pension Plan Transfer Amount</U>&#148;). Spinco may submit, at its sole cost and expense,
the Revised Pension Plan Transfer Amount to the actuary for the Spinco Pension Plan (which actuary

verification process and any calculation performed by the actuary of the Spinco Pension Plan in

methodology set forth on <U>Schedule&nbsp;6.2(b)</U> attached hereto. In order to perform such
verification, upon request from Spinco, the actuary of the Spinco Pension Plan will receive the
data and additional detailed methodology used to calculate the Initial Transfer Amount and the
Final Pension Plan Transfer Amount (if reasonably needed) from the actuary of the Quanex Employees
Pension Plan. Spinco will be responsible for the cost and expense of the actuary of the Spinco
Pension Plan and Quanex will be responsible for the cost and expense for the actuary of the Quanex
Employees Pension Plan for such data transfer. If the actuary of the Spinco Pension Plan so
determines that the value, as of the Distribution Date, of the assets to be transferred to the
Spinco Pension Plan differs from the Revised Pension Plan Transfer Amount, the actuary of the
Spinco Pension Plan shall identify in writing to the actuary of the Quanex Employees Pension Plan
all objections to the determination within sixty (60)&nbsp;days following provision of the revised value
calculation to Spinco pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph (iii), and the actuaries
shall use good faith efforts to reconcile any such difference. If the actuaries fail to reconcile
such difference, the actuaries shall jointly designate a third, independent actuary whose
calculation of the value, as of the Distribution Date, of the assets to be transferred to the

<I>provided, further</I>, that such value shall be between the value determined by the actuary of the
Spinco Pension Plan and the Revised Pension Plan Transfer Amount or equal to either such value.
Quanex and Spinco shall each pay one-half of the costs incurred in connection with the retention of
such independent actuary. The final, verified value, as of the Distribution Date, of the assets to
be transferred to the Spinco Pension Plan as determined in accordance with this Section&nbsp;6.2(b)(iii)
