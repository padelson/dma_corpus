    ##### 

   

  

 1.3 _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the Company and Parent will cause a Certificate of Merger (the " _Delaware Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time when the Delaware Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as may be agreed by the parties and specified in the Delaware Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

 2.2 _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to read as set forth in Exhibit B attached hereto (the " _Bylaws_ ") and, as so amended and restated, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Entity until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

  

ARTICLE III

 4.2 _Exchange of Shares for Merger Consideration_. 

  

 (a) _Exchange of Certificates_. Parent shall select a bank or trust company in the United States reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the paying agent hereunder (the " _Paying Agent_ "). At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of certificates, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ "), the Merger Consideration, (the " _Exchange Fund_ "), payable pursuant to _Section 4.1(c)_ in exchange for outstanding Shares. 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. 

   

 (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent will mail to each holder of record of a Certificate whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, (A) a letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and will be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may specify consistent with this Agreement) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (ii) After the Effective Time, upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive therefor pursuant to the provisions of this _Article IV_, and the Certificate so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that are not registered in the transfer records of the Company,

payment may be issued to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered (the " _Transferee_ ") if such
Certificate is properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and
the Transferee pays any transfer or other taxes required by reason of such
payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establishes to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such tax has
been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 4.2(b)_ , each Certificate will be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender,
the Merger Consideration that the holder thereof has the right to receive in
respect of such Certificate pursuant to the provisions of this _Article IV_.
No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of
Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this _Article IV_. 

  

 4.3 _Return and Investment of Exchange Fund_. 

  

 (a) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the former stockholders of the Company for 15 months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Entity upon demand of the Surviving Entity, and any former stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this _Article IV_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration; provided, that such former stockholder of the Company shall have no greater rights against the Surviving Entity than may be accorded to general creditors of the Surviving Entity under applicable Laws. None of the Company, Parent or the Surviving Entity shall be liable to any holder of Shares for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

 (b) The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided, that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptance of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion and provided that such investments shall be made in such a manner so as not to impair the availability of the Merger Consideration for payment on the Shares when required. 

  

 4.4 _Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to Shares, subject, however, to the Surviving Entitys obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distribution with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been declared or made by the Company on Shares in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 4.5 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which such person is entitled pursuant to  _Section 4.1_ with respect to Shares formerly represented thereby.

 4.6 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Entity and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares and Company Options such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Entity or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holders of Shares and Company Options in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Entity or Parent, as the case may be. 

  

 4.7 _Closing of the Company Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of Shares shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Entity, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article IV_. 

  

 4.8 _Dissenters  Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by holders of such Shares who exercise appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with applicable provisions of the DGCL, including, without limitation, Section 262 thereof (the " _Dissenters  Shares_") will not be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenters Shares will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenters Shares in accordance with those provisions unless and until such holders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or lose their rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, such Dissenters Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisals of Shares. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if Parent or the Company abandon or are finally enjoined or prevented from carrying out the Merger and the other transactions contemplated under this Agreement, the right of each holder of Dissenters Shares to receive payment of the appraised value of Shares as provided herein shall terminate, effective as of the time of such abandonment, injunction, prevention or rescission. 

  

 4.9 _Company Options._  

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase Shares granted under the Stock Plans that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Company Option_ ") shall become fully vested and exercisable, and shall be cancelled and entitle the holder thereof to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event more than three business days following the Effective Time), an amount in cash equal to (x) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Option times (y) the excess of (i) the sum of (A) the Merger Consideration and (B) the closing sales price of a share of Spinco Common Stock on the Distribution Date as reported on the Exchange over (ii) the

exercise price per share under such Company Option (the terms "Spinco Common
Stock," "Distribution Date" and "Exchange" being defined in the Distribution
Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit C-1 (the " _Distribution Agreement_ ")),
less any applicable withholding. 

   

 (b) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit in respect of a share of Company Common Stock (collectively, the " _RSUs_ ") shall become fully vested and shall be converted into the right of each RSU holder to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event more than three business days following the Effective Time), an amount per RSU equal to the sum of (y) the Merger Consideration and (z) the closing sales price of a share of Spinco Stock on the Distribution Date as reported on the Exchange.

 (ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Parent or Merger Sub or the comparable governing instruments of any of Parents Subsidiaries, (B) a breach or violation of, a termination (or right of termination) or a default under, the

 (f) _Compliance with Laws; Permits_. The businesses of each of Parent and its Subsidiaries have not been, and are not being, conducted in violation of any Laws, except for violations or possible violations that prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as disclosed in the Parent Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement or with respect to regulatory matters covered by _Section 6.5_, no investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated an intention to conduct the same, except for those the outcome of which prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein (including the exhibits thereto), the Lender has committed to provide $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness to Merger Sub at the Closing (the " _Debt Commitment_ "). The obligations to fund the commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter are not subject to any condition other than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. Merger Sub has no knowledge of any fact or occurrence that would reasonably be expected to (i) make any of the assumptions or statements set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter inaccurate, (ii) cause the Debt Commitment Letter to be ineffective or (iii) preclude in any material respect the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and has not been amended in any material respect, and the financing and other fees that are due and payable on or before the date hereof under the Debt Commitment Letter have been paid in full. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment letter, assuming for purposes of this representation that the conditions set forth in Article VI are satisfied, the funds contemplated to be received pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter will be sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration and to make all other necessary payments (including related fees and expenses) by Merger Sub in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 6.2 _Acquisition Proposals_. 

  

 (a) No Solicitation or Negotiation. The Company hereby covenants that, except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.2, the Company shall not, and the Company shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to instruct and cause its officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors or representatives (such officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors or representatives, collectively, "Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly: 

   

 (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly take any action to facilitate or encourage, whether publicly or otherwise, the submission of any inquiries or the making of any inquiry, proposal or offer or other efforts or attempts that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below); 

   

 (ii) enter into, or participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any non-public information for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, any Acquisition Proposal; or 

   

 (iii) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement or agreement in principle requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or breach its obligations hereunder or propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. 

 

The Company shall, and shall direct its Representatives to, cease immediately
all discussions and negotiations that commenced prior to the date of this
Agreement regarding any Acquisition Proposal existing on the date of this
Agreement and shall use its (and will cause the Company Representatives to
use their) commercially reasonable efforts to require the other parties
thereto to promptly return or destroy in accordance with the terms of such
agreement any confidential information previously furnished by the Company,
its Subsidiaries or its Representatives thereunder. 

   

 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement the Company may, to the extent failure to do so would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of the fiduciary obligations of the Company Board under applicable Law, as determined in good faith by the Company Board after consultation with outside counsel, in response to (1) a Superior Proposal (as defined below) or (2) a bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor is or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal (any such Acquisition Proposal, a " _Potential Superior Proposal_ "), (x) furnish information with respect to the Company to the Person making such Superior Proposal or Potential Superior Proposal and its Representatives (provided that the Company shall promptly make available to Parent and Merger Sub any material non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is made available to any Person given such access which was not previously made available to Parent and Merger Sub) pursuant 

   ##### 

  

    

to a customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of the other
party than the Confidentiality Agreement, dated July 17, 2007, between Gerdau
Ameristeel Corporation and the Company, but excluding any "standstill"
provisions (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and (y) participate in
discussions or negotiations with such Person and its Representatives
regarding any such Superior Proposal or Potential Superior Proposal. The
Company shall promptly advise Parent of the receipt by the Company of any
Acquisition Proposal or any request for non public information made by any
Person or group of Persons that has informed the Company it is
considering making an Acquisition Proposal or any request for discussions or
negotiations with the Company or the Company Representatives relating to an
Acquisition Proposal (in each case within 48 hours of receipt thereof), and
the Company shall provide to Parent (within such 48 hour time frame)
a written summary of the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal (it
being understood that such material terms shall include the identity of the
Person or group of Persons making the Acquisition Proposal) and if the
Company determines to begin providing information or to engage in
discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed of any material change to the terms and conditions of any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will
not enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to
the date hereof which prohibits the Company from providing such information
to Parent. 

  

 (b) _No Change in Company Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. The Company Board and each committee thereof shall not: 

   

 (i) except as expressly permitted by this _Section 6.2_, withdraw or modify (or publicly propose to withdraw or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the approval or recommendation by the Company Board or any committee thereof with respect to this Agreement and the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby; 

   

 (ii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") providing for the consummation of a transaction contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement entered into in the circumstances referred to in _Section 6.2(a)_); or 

   

 (iii) except as expressly permitted by this _Section 6.2_, approve, recommend or propose publicly to approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal. 

  

 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may withdraw, qualify or modify or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify in any manner adverse to Parent, its approval or recommendation with respect to this Agreement and the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby or approve or recommend any Superior Proposal made or received after the date of this Agreement, if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to do so would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its obligations under applicable Law (a " _Change in Company Recommendation_ "); provided, however, that no Change in Company Recommendation may be made in response to a Superior Proposal until three business days (the " _Notice Period_ ") following Parents receipt of written notice from the Company (an " _Adverse Recommendation Notice_ ") (x) advising Parent 

    

-31- 

      

* * *

 

##### 

 

  

that the Company Board intends to make such Change in Company Recommendation
and the reason for such change, (y) specifying the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal (including the proposed financing for
such proposal) and (z) identifying any party making such Superior Proposal;
provided further prior to effecting such Change in Company Recommendation
in response to a Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its
legal and financial advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with
Parent and Merger Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent and Merger Sub
desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a
Superior Proposal. In the event that during the Notice Period any revisions
are made to the Superior Proposal to which the proviso in this _Section
6.2(b)_ applies and the Company Board in its good faith judgment determines
such revisions are material (it being agreed that any change in the purchase
price in such Superior Proposal shall be deemed a material revision), the
Company shall be required to deliver a new Adverse Recommendation Notice to
Parent and Merger Sub and to comply with the requirements of this _Section
6.2(b)_ with respect to such new written notice, except that the Notice
Period shall be reduced to two business days. In determining whether to make
a Change in Company Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal, the
Company Board shall take into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent (in response to an Adverse Recommendation Notice
or otherwise) in determining whether such third party Acquisition Proposal
still constitutes a Superior Proposal. 

   

 (c) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position with respect to a tender offer contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any other disclosure to the Companys stockholders or the general public if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure to so disclose would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that neither the Company nor the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall be permitted to recommend that the Company stockholders tender any securities in connection with any tender or exchange offer (or otherwise approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal), unless in each case, in connection therewith, the Company Board effects a Change in Company Recommendation; provided further that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Change in Company Recommendation unless the Company Board expressly reaffirms the Company Recommendation at least two business days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting if Parent has delivered to the Company a written request to so reaffirm at least 48 hours (or if 48 hours is impracticable, as far in advance as is practicable) prior to the time such reaffirmation is to be made. 

  

 (d) _Definitions_. As used in this Agreement: 

  

 " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means, except as set forth in _Section 6.2_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, (i) any proposal or offer for a merger, consolidation, dissolution, tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange, business combination or similar transaction involving the Company or (ii) any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, over 20% of the equity securities or consolidated total assets (including, without

case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal made by a third party and not solicited in violation of _Section 6.2(a)_ to acquire more than 50% of the equity securities or more than 50% of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole but excluding the Building Products Business, pursuant to a tender or exchange offer, a merger, a recapitalization, a consolidation or a sale of its assets, which the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with its financial advisor) (i) to be more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of Company Common Stock than the Merger and (ii) is reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed therein, after taking into account the likelihood and timing of completion (as compared to the Merger) and after taking into account all financial (including the financing terms of such Acquisition Proposal), regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal. 

  

 6.3 _Proxy Statement_. 

  

 (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall, in consultation with the Parent, prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement.

Each of the parties hereto shall provide promptly to the other parties hereto such information concerning its business and financial statements and affairs as, in the reasonable judgment of such party and its counsel, may be required or appropriate for inclusion in the Proxy Statement or the Other Filings, as applicable, or in any amendments or supplements thereto, and to cause its counsel and auditors to cooperate with the other partys counsel and auditors in the preparation of the Proxy Statement.

No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or correspondence to the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Other Filings will be made by the Company without providing Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by such party and which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the Other Filings, so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such 

   ##### 

  

    

information shall promptly notify the other party or parties hereto, as
applicable, and an appropriate amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement
or the Other Filings describing such information shall be promptly filed with
the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement
and the Other Filings to comply as to form and substance in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules
of the NYSE. All Other Filings that are filed by the Parent or Merger Sub

 6.4 _Company Stockholders Meeting_. The Company, acting through the Company Board, will take, in accordance with applicable Law and its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, all action necessary to convene a meeting of holders of Shares (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") as promptly as practicable after the Proxy Statement is available for mailing to consider and vote upon the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Merger. Subject to _Section 6.2(b)_, the Company Board shall recommend, and continue to recommend, such adoption and shall take all lawful action to solicit the Company Stockholder Approval. 

  

 6.5 _Filings; Other Actions; Notification; Access_. 

  

 (a) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other on, all the information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appear in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and the Company shall each file a Pre-Merger Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act with

 (b) if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement, or any such representation and warranty shall have become untrue after the date of this Agreement, such that _Section 7.3(a)_ or _7.3(b)_ would not be satisfied and such breach or condition is not curable or, if curable, is not cured by the Termination Date; _provided_ that the Company is not then in breach of this Agreement such that any of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2(a) _or _Section 7.2(b)_ would not be satisfied. 

  

 8.4 _Termination by Parent_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time by action of the Parent Board: 

  

 (a) in the event that (i) the Company Board shall have effected a Change in Company Recommendation or (ii) the Company Board fails publicly to reaffirm its adoption and recommendation of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this 

   ##### 

  

    

Agreement within ten business days of receipt of a written request by Parent
to provide such reaffirmation following an Acquisition Proposal. 

  

 (b) if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company in this Agreement, or any such representation and warranty shall have become untrue after the date of this Agreement, such that _Section 7.2(a)_ or _7.2(b)_ would not be satisfied and such breach or condition is not curable by the Termination Date; _provided_  that Parent and Merger Sub are not then in breach of this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ and _Section 7.3(b) _would not be satisfied. 

  

 8.5 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_. 

  

 (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this _Article VIII_, this Agreement (other than as set forth in _Section 9.1_) shall become void and of no effect with no liability on the part of any party hereto (or of any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, legal and financial advisors or other representatives); provided, however, except as otherwise provided herein, no such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages resulting from any willful or intentional breach of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) The Company agrees to pay Parent a fee in immediately available funds (in recognition of the fees and expenses incurred to date by Parent in connection with the matters contemplated hereby) of $50,190,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") if this Agreement is terminated: 

   

 (i) (A) by Parent as permitted by _Sections 8.2(a),_ _8.2(b)_ or  _8.4(b)_ or the Company as permitted by _Sections 8.2(a)_ or _8.2(b)_ , (B) after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal has been publicly made to the Company or shall have been made directly to the stockholders of the Company or shall have otherwise become publicly known or any person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting and (C) within twelve months of such termination the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have entered into a definitive agreement, or consummated any Acquisition Proposal (regardless of whether such Acquisition Proposal is made before or after the termination of this Agreement) (for purposes of the foregoing clause the term "Acquisition Proposal" has the meaning assigned to such term in _Section 6.2(d)_ except that the references to "20%" in the definition are deemed to be references to "50%" _)_ ; 

   

 (ii) by the Company as permitted by _Section 8.3(a)_; or 

   

 (iii) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.4(a)_. 

  

 (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by either party pursuant to Section 8.2(a) and at the time of such termination there exists a decision, injunction, order, judgment, determination or decree based upon or purportedly enforcing any federal or state antitrust, competition or trade regulation law, rule or regulation that would make consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or in violation of any court order, then Parent shall pay the Company, as directed in writing by the Company, a fee in 

   ##### 

  

    

immediately available funds of $60 million no later than two business days
following such termination. 

  

 The Termination Fee shall be paid promptly by the Company, but in no event later than: (x) two business days after the first to occur of the execution of an acquisition agreement or the consummation of the Acquisition Proposal, in the case of clause (i) above; (y) on the date of termination of this Agreement in the case of clause (ii) above; and (z) two business days after termination of this Agreement in the case of clause (iii) above. The Companys payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and any of its Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors or other representatives with respect to the breach of any covenant or agreement giving rise to such payment. The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section 8.5(b)_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement.

On or prior to the Distribution Date, Quanex and the Surviving Entity will use their commercially reasonable efforts to amend all contractual arrangements between or among Quanex, the Surviving Entity, their respective Affiliates and any other Person (other than the contractual arrangements relating to the Distribution) that either (i) relate to the Spinco Business but relate predominantly to the Quanex Business or (ii) relate solely to the Quanex Business, but, by their terms, contain provisions relating to a member of the Spinco Group, so that, after the Distribution Date, such contractual arrangements (x) will relate solely to the Quanex Business and (y) will eliminate any provisions relating to a member of the Spinco Group and, in either event, will inure to the benefit of the Quanex Group on substantially the same economic terms as such arrangements exist as of the date hereof.

To the extent that any transfers contemplated by this _Article II_ shall not have been consummated on or prior to the Distribution Date, the parties hereto shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to effect such transfers as promptly following the Distribution Date as shall be practicable.

The Agent shall (a) determine the number of whole Shares and fractional Shares of Spinco Sub Common Stock allocable to each holder of record or beneficial owner of Quanex Common Stock as of the close of business on the Record Date, (b) aggregate all such fractional Shares into whole Shares and sell the whole Shares of Spinco Sub Common Stock obtained thereby in open market transactions at then prevailing prices on behalf of holders who would otherwise be entitled to fractional Shares of Spinco Sub Common Stock, and (c) distribute to each such holder, or for the benefit of each such beneficial owner, such holder or owners ratable share of the net proceeds of such sale, based upon the average gross selling price per Share of Spinco Sub Common Stock, after making appropriate deductions for any amount required to be withheld for Tax purposes. The Surviving Entity shall bear the cost of brokerage fees incurred in connection with these sales of fractional Shares, which such sales shall occur as soon after the Distribution Date as practicable and as determined by the Agent. None of Quanex, the Surviving Entity or the Agent will guarantee any minimum sale price for the fractional Shares of Spinco Sub Common Stock. Neither the Surviving Entity nor Quanex will pay any interest on the proceeds from the sale of fractional Shares. The Agent will have the sole discretion to select the broker-dealers through which to sell the aggregated fractional Shares and to determine when, how and at what price to sell such Shares. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 3.6 _The Spinco Merger_. 

  

 (a) The Spinco Merger may occur either before or after the Distribution, at the election of Spinco and Spinco Sub. If the Spinco Merger occurs after the Distribution, as a result of the Spinco Merger, the holders of Shares of Spinco Interest will receive one share of Spinco Sub Common Stock for each Share of Spinco Interests allocated to them in the Distribution. The Spinco Merger shall be effective at as set forth in the certificate of merger filed with the Delaware Secretary of State to effect the Spinco Merger. 

   

 (b) Prior to the Distribution Date, Spinco will deliver to the Agent for the benefit of the holders of Quanex Common Stock on the Record Date (if the Spinco Merger is effected prior to the Distribution) or the holders of the Shares of the Spinco Interest (if the Spinco Merger is effected after the Distribution), stock certificates, endorsed by Spinco in blank, representing all of the outstanding Shares of Spinco Sub Common Stock then owned by Spinco. Spinco will cause the transfer agent for the Spinco Sub Common Stock to credit the appropriate class and number of such Shares of Spinco Sub Common Stock to book entry accounts for each such holder or designated transferee of such holder. For stockholders of Quanex who own Quanex Common Stock through a broker or other nominee, their shares of Spinco Sub Common Stock will be credited to their respective accounts by such broker or nominee.

SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION  

  

 Section 4.1 _Survival of Agreements_. All representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties hereto contained in this Agreement shall survive the Distribution Date and remain in full force and effect in accordance with their applicable terms. 

  

 Section 4.2 _Indemnification._  

  

 (a) Except as specifically otherwise provided in the other Transaction Agreements, the Surviving Entity shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Quanex Indemnitees from and against all Indemnifiable Losses arising out of or due to the failure of any member of the Spinco Group (i) to pay or satisfy any Spinco Liabilities, whether such Indemnifiable Losses relate to events, occurrences or circumstances occurring or existing, or whether such Indemnifiable Losses are asserted, before, on or after the Distribution Date, (ii) to cause the termination or substitution required by _Section 5.5(a)_ to occur by the Distribution Date or (iii) to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement including any breach by the Surviving Entity of any representation, warranty, covenant or other provision in this Agreement. 

   

 (b) Except as specifically otherwise provided in the other Transaction Agreements, Quanex shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Spinco Indemnitees from and against all Indemnifiable Losses arising out of or due to the failure of any member of the Quanex Group (i) to pay or satisfy any Quanex Liabilities, whether such Indemnifiable Losses relate to events, occurrences or circumstances occurring or existing, or whether such Indemnifiable Losses are asserted, before, on or after the Distribution Date, (ii) to transfer to the Surviving Entity or any member of the Spinco Group all of the Spinco Assets, (iii) to cause the termination or substitution required by  _Section 5.5(b)_ to occur by the Distribution Date or (iv) to

##### 

 

  

perform any of its obligations under this Agreement including any breach by
Quanex of any representation, warranty, covenant or other provision in this
Agreement. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, indemnification relating to any arrangements between any member of the Quanex Group and any member of the Spinco Group for the provision after the Distribution Date of goods and services in the ordinary course shall be governed by the terms of such arrangements and not by this Section or as otherwise set forth in this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements. 

   

 (d) Indemnification for matters subject to the Tax Matters Agreement is governed by the terms, provisions and procedures of the Tax Matters Agreement and not by this _Article IV_. 

   

 Section 4.3 _Procedures for Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) Quanex shall, and shall cause the other Quanex Indemnitees to, notify the Surviving Entity in writing promptly (i) of any claim for indemnification for which any Quanex Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification from the Surviving Entity under this Agreement or (ii) after learning of any Third-Party Claim for which any Quanex Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification from the Surviving Entity under this Agreement. the Surviving Entity shall, and shall cause the other Spinco Indemnitees to, notify Quanex in writing promptly (i) of any claim for indemnification for which any Spinco Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification from Quanex under this Agreement or (ii) after learning of any Third-Party Claim for which any Spinco Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification from Quanex under this Agreement. The failure of any Indemnitee to give such notice shall not relieve any Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this _Article IV_ except to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice. Such notice shall describe such indemnification claim or Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail considering the Information provided to the Indemnitee and shall indicate the amount (estimated if necessary) of the Indemnifiable Loss that has been claimed against or may be sustained by such Indemnitee. 

   

 (b) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this _Section 4.3_, an Indemnifying Party may, by notice to the Indemnitee and to Quanex, if the Surviving Entity is the Indemnifying Party, or to the Indemnitee and the Surviving Entity, if Quanex is the Indemnifying Party, at any time after receipt by such Indemnifying Party of such Indemnitees notice of a Third-Party Claim, undertake (itself or through another member of the Group of which the Indemnifying Party is a member) the defense or settlement of such Third-Party Claim, at such Indemnifying Partys own expense and by counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee. If an Indemnifying Party undertakes the defense of any Third-Party Claim, such Indemnifying Party shall control the investigation and defense or settlement thereof, and the Indemnitee may not settle or compromise such Third-Party Claim, except that such Indemnifying Party shall not (i) require any Indemnitee, without its prior written consent, to take or refrain from taking any action in connection with such Third-Party Claim, or make any public statement, which such Indemnitee reasonably considers to be against its interests, or (ii) without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee and of Quanex, if the Indemnitee is a Quanex Indemnitee, or the Indemnitee and of the Surviving Entity, if the Indemnitee is a Spinco Indemnitee, consent to any settlement that does not include as a part thereof an unconditional release of the relevant Indemnitees from Liability with respect to such Third-Party Claim or that requires the 

    ##### 

  

    

Indemnitee or any of its Representatives or Affiliates to make any payment
that is not fully indemnified under this Agreement or to be subject to any
non-monetary remedy. Subject to the Indemnifying Partys control rights, as
specified herein, the Indemnitees may participate in such investigation and
defense, at their own expense. Following the provision of notices to
the Indemnifying Party, until such time as an Indemnifying Party has
undertaken the defense of any Third-Party Claim as provided herein, such
Indemnitee shall control the investigation and defense or settlement thereof,
without prejudice to its right to seek indemnification hereunder. 

   

 (c) If an Indemnitee reasonably determines that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to its Indemnifying Party which make it inappropriate for the Indemnifying Party to undertake the defense or settlement thereof, then such Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to undertake the defense or settlement of such Third-Party Claim; and counsel for the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to conduct the defense of such Indemnifying Party and counsel for the Indemnitee (selected by the Indemnitee) shall be entitled to conduct the defense of such Indemnitee, in which case the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnitee (but not more than one counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party) shall be paid by such Indemnifying Party, it being understood that both such counsel shall cooperate with each other to conduct the defense or settlement of such action as efficiently as possible. 

   

 (d) In no event shall an Indemnifying Party be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all Indemnitees (in addition to local counsel and its own counsel, if any) in connection with any one action, or separate but similar or related actions, in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances of a Third-Party Claim. 

   

 (e) If the Indemnifying Party undertakes the defense or settlement of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall make available to the Indemnifying Party and its counsel all information and documents reasonably available to it which relate to any Third-Party Claim, and otherwise cooperate as may reasonably be required in connection with the investigation, defense and settlement thereof, subject to the terms and conditions of a mutually acceptable joint defense agreement. 

   

 Section 4.4 _Reductions for Insurance Proceeds and Other Recoveries_. The amount that any Indemnifying Party is or may be required to pay to any Indemnitee pursuant to this _Article IV_ shall be reduced (retroactively or prospectively) by any insurance proceeds or other amounts actually recovered from third parties by or on behalf of such Indemnitee in respect of the related Indemnifiable Losses (net of retrospective premium adjustments, experience-based premium adjustments or other costs to the Indemnifying Party). Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that the possibility that insurance proceeds may be realized by the Indemnifying Party shall not delay payment or indemnification of such Indemnifiable Losses by Indemnifying Party. All Indemnifiable Losses shall be paid or reimbursed promptly upon determination; the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the other party in the amount of any insurance proceeds received on account of the facts and circumstances resulting in such Indemnifiable Losses. The Indemnifying Party shall act in good faith to pursue insurance proceeds relating to the Indemnifiable Losses. The existence of a claim by an Indemnitee for insurance or against a third party in respect of any Indemnifiable Loss shall not, however, delay or reduce any payment pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained herein and otherwise determined to be due and owing by an Indemnifying Party. Rather the Indemnifying 

   ##### 

  

    

Party shall make payment in full of such amount so determined to be due and
owing by it and, if, and to the extent that, there exists a claim against any
third party (other than an insurer) in respect of such Indemnifiable Loss,
the Indemnitee shall assign such claim against such third party to the
Indemnifying Party or shall otherwise diligently pursue such claim against its
insurer. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, it is the
intention of the parties hereto that no insurer or any other third party
shall be (i) entitled to a benefit it would not be entitled to receive in the
absence of the foregoing indemnification provisions or (ii) relieved of the
responsibility to pay any claims for which it is obligated. If an Indemnitee
shall have received the payment required by this Agreement from an
Indemnifying Party in respect of any Indemnifiable Losses and shall
subsequently actually receive insurance proceeds or other amounts in respect
of such Indemnifiable Losses, then such Indemnitee shall hold such insurance
proceeds in trust for the benefit of such Indemnifying Party and shall pay to
such Indemnifying Party a sum equal to the amount of such insurance proceeds
or other amounts actually received, up to the aggregate amount of any
payments received from such Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement in
respect of such Indemnifiable Losses. 

  

 Section 4.5 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the failure of any party to perform its agreements and covenants hereunder, including its failure to take all actions as are necessary on its part to the consummation of the Contribution and the Distribution, will cause irreparable injury to the other party for which damages, even if available, will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party hereby consents to the issuance of injunctive relief by any court of competent jurisdiction to compel performance of such partys obligations and to the granting by any court of the remedy of specific performance of its obligations hereunder. 

  

 Section 4.6 _Remedies Exclusive_. The remedies provided in this _Article IV_ shall be the exclusive remedies of the parties with respect to a claim for Indemnifiable Losses hereunder or any other claim with respect to this Agreement. 

  

 Section 4.7 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity and Other Payments_. For all Tax purposes, the parties agree to treat any payment to the other party required by this Agreement as either a contribution by Quanex to Spinco or a distribution by Spinco to Quanex, as the case may be, occurring immediately prior to the Distribution, except as otherwise mandated by applicable Law. 

  

 Section 4.8 _Survival of Indemnities_. The obligations of each of Quanex and the Surviving Entity under this _Article IV_ shall survive the sale or other transfer by it of any of its assets or business or the assignment by it of any of its Liabilities, with respect to any Indemnifiable Loss of the other related to such assets, business or Liabilities.

From and after the Distribution Date, no member of either Group shall have any rights under any such contract, license, agreement, commitment or arrangement with any member of the other Group, except as specifically provided in this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements. Each intercompany account between any member of the Quanex Group, on the one hand, and any member of the Spinco Group, on the other hand, as of October 31, 2007 shall be satisfied or settled in the equity accounts of the relevant members of the Spinco Group and the Quanex Group no later than the Distribution Date (unless previously satisfied in accordance with its terms). All intercompany balances created in the ordinary course of business in the Separation Period shall be settled in accordance with Section 5.7 below.

Without limiting the foregoing, each party hereto shall cooperate with the other party, and execute and deliver, or use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be executed and delivered, all instruments, and to make all filings with, and to obtain all consents, approvals or authorizations of, any governmental or regulatory authority or any other Person under any permit, license, agreement, indenture or other instrument, and take all such other actions as such party may reasonably be requested to take by any other party hereto from time to time, consistent with the terms of this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, in order to effectuate the provisions and purposes of this Agreement.

 Section 5.6 _Insurance._  

  

 (a) _Rights Under Policies_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, from and after the Distribution Date, the Surviving Entity and the Spinco Subsidiaries will have no rights with respect to any Policies, except that (i) Quanex will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Surviving Entity in asserting claims for any loss, liability or damage with respect solely to the Spinco Assets or Spinco Liabilities under Policies with third-party insurers which are "occurrence basis" insurance policies (" _Occurrence Basis Policies_ ") arising out of insured incidents occurring from the date coverage thereunder first commenced until the Distribution Date to the extent that the terms and conditions of any such Occurrence Basis Policies and agreements relating thereto so allow and (ii) Quanex will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Surviving Entity to continue to prosecute claims 

    ##### 

  

    

with respect solely to Spinco Assets or Spinco Liabilities properly asserted
with an insurer prior to the Distribution Date under Policies with third-
party insurers which are insurance policies written on a "claims made" basis
(" _Claims Made Policies_ ") arising out of insured incidents occurring from
the date coverage thereunder first commenced until the Distribution Date to
the extent that the terms and conditions of any such Claims Made Policies and
agreements relating thereto so allow; provided, that in the case of both
clauses (i) and (ii) above, (A) all of Quanexs and each Quanex Subsidiarys
reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the foregoing are
promptly paid by the Surviving Entity, (B) Quanex and the Quanex Subsidiaries
may, at any time, without Liability or obligation to the Surviving Entity or
any Spinco Subsidiary (other than as set forth in _Section 5.6(c)_), amend,
commute, terminate, buy-out, extinguish liability under or otherwise modify
any Occurrence Basis Policies or Claims Made Policies (and such claims shall
be subject to any such amendments, commutations, terminations, buy-
outs, extinguishments and modifications), and (C) any such claim will be
subject to all of the terms and conditions of the applicable Policy. Quanexs
obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Surviving
Entity in asserting claims under applicable Policies will include
using commercially reasonable efforts in assisting the Surviving Entity to
establish its right to coverage under such Policies (so long as all of
Quanexs reasonable costs and expenses in connection therewith are promptly
paid by Spinco). In the event that the terms and conditions of any Policy do
not allow the Surviving Entity the right to assert or prosecute a claim as set
forth in clause (i) or (ii) above, then in such case, Quanex shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to pursue such claim under such Policy and
the Surviving Entity shall promptly pay all of Quanexs and each Quanex
Subsidiarys reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith. 

   

 (b) _Assistance by Quanex_. Until the first anniversary of the Distribution Date, Quanex will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Surviving Entity in connection with any efforts by the Surviving Entity to acquire insurance coverage with respect to the Spinco Business for incidents occurring prior to the Distribution Date; as described in _Section 5.6(a)_ hereof, provided, that all of Quanexs reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the foregoing are promptly paid by the Surviving Entity.

The Tax treatment of any such payments to Spinco by Quanex shall be handled in accordance with _Section 4.7_. 

   

 (d) _Administration_. From and after the Distribution Date:

 (ii) the Surviving Entity or a Spinco Subsidiary, as appropriate, will be responsible for the Claims Administration with respect to claims of the Surviving Entity and the Spinco Subsidiaries under the Policies. 

   

 (e) _Insurance Premiums_. Subject to clause (B) of the proviso to _Section 5.6(a)_, from and after the Distribution Date, Quanex will pay, if so directed by the Surviving Entity, all premiums (retrospectively-rated or otherwise) as required under the terms and conditions of the respective Policies in respect of periods prior to the Distribution Date, whereupon the Surviving Entity will upon the request of Quanex, promptly reimburse Quanex for that portion of such premiums paid by Quanex as are reasonably determined by Quanex (and reasonably approved by Spinco) to be attributable to the Spinco Business. 

   

 (f) _Agreement for Waiver of Conflict and Shared Defense_. In the event that a Policy provides coverage for both Quanex and/or a Quanex Subsidiary, on the one hand, and the Surviving Entity and/or a Spinco Subsidiary, on the other hand, relating to the same occurrence or claim, Quanex and the Surviving Entity agree to defend jointly and to waive any conflict of interest necessary to the conduct of that joint defense. 

   

 (g) Nothing in this _Section 5.6_ will be construed to limit or otherwise alter in any way the indemnity obligations of the parties to this Agreement, including those created by this Agreement. 

   

 Section 5.7 _Cash Separation._  

  

 (a) During the Separation Period, Quanex covenants, represents and warrants with the Surviving Entity that separate and independent bank accounts (the " _Quanex Accounts_ ") or ledgers for the Quanex Business have and will be operated by, or, as applicable, on behalf of, Quanex and maintained in accordance with Quanex normal practice and such records and bank accounts shall be capable of evidencing, on a daily basis, all Cash Inflows and Cash Outflows of the Quanex Business during the Separation Period.

Within ten days following the end of each calendar month during the Separation Period, Quanex and the Surviving Entity shall settle the net amount of any Liabilities paid for by the other during the previous calendar month. A final settlement between Quanex and the Surviving Entity of the net amount of any Liabilities paid for 

    ##### 

  

    

by the other in the calendar month including the Distribution Date shall be
made prior to the Distribution. 

   

 (d) During the Separation Period, Quanex covenants, represents and warrants with the Surviving Entity and the Surviving Entity covenants, represents and warrants with Quanex that no intercompany receivable or payable has or shall be created other than in the ordinary course of business at the then applicable current market prices and on terms no less favorable than could be obtained from a third-party in the ordinary course of business.

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 6.2 _Access to Information_. From and after the Distribution Date, each of Quanex and the Surviving Entity shall afford to the other and to the others Representatives reasonable access and duplicating rights during normal business hours to all Information within the possession or control of such partys Group relating to the other partys Groups pre-Distribution business, Assets or Liabilities or relating to or arising in connection with the relationship between the Groups on or prior to the Distribution Date, to the extent such access is reasonably required for a reasonable purpose, subject to the provisions below regarding Privileged Information. Without limiting the foregoing, Information may be requested under this _Section 6.2_ for audit, accounting, regulatory, claims and litigation purposes, as well as for purposes of fulfilling disclosure and reporting obligations. 

  

 In furtherance of the foregoing: 

  

 (a) Each party hereto acknowledges that: (i) each of Quanex and the Surviving Entity (and the members of the Quanex Group and the Spinco Group, respectively) has or may obtain Privileged Information; (ii) there are and/or may be a number of Litigation Matters affecting each or both of Quanex and the Surviving Entity; (iii) both Quanex and the Surviving Entity have a common legal interest in Litigation Matters, in the Privileged Information and in the preservation of the confidential status of the Privileged Information, in each case relating to the pre-Distribution business of the Quanex Group or the Spinco Group or relating to or arising in connection with the relationship between the Groups on or prior to the Distribution Date; and (iv) both Quanex and the Surviving Entity intend that the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Transaction Agreements and any transfer of Privileged Information in connection therewith shall not operate as a waiver of any potentially applicable privilege. 

   

 (b) Each of Quanex and the Surviving Entity agrees, on behalf of itself and each member of the Group of which it is a member, not to disclose or otherwise waive any privilege attaching to any Privileged Information relating to the pre-Distribution business of the other Group or relating to or arising in connection with the relationship between the Groups on or prior to the Distribution Date, without providing prompt written notice to and obtaining the prior written consent of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that Quanex and the Surviving Entity shall not be required to give any such notice or obtain any such consent and may make such disclosure or waiver with respect to Privileged Information if such Privileged Information relates solely to the pre-Distribution business of the Quanex Group in the case of Quanex or the Spinco Group in the case of the Surviving Entity. In the event of a disagreement between any member of the Quanex Group and any member of the Spinco Group concerning the reasonableness of withholding such consent, no disclosure shall be made prior to a resolution of such disagreement by a court of competent jurisdiction, provided that the limitations in this sentence shall not apply in the case of disclosure required by Law. 

   

 (c) Upon any member of the Quanex Group or any member of the Spinco Group receiving any subpoena or other compulsory disclosure notice from a court, other governmental agency or otherwise which requests disclosure of Privileged Information, in each case relating to pre-Distribution business of the Spinco Group or the Quanex Group, respectively, or relating to or arising in connection with the relationship between the Groups on or prior to the Distribution Date, the recipient of the notice shall promptly provide to the other Group (following the notice provisions set forth herein) a copy of such notice, the intended 

    ##### 

  

    

response, and all materials or information relating to the other Group that
might be disclosed. In the event of a disagreement as to the intended
response or disclosure, unless and until the disagreement is resolved by a
court of competent jurisdiction as provided in paragraph (b) of this Section,
each of Quanex and the Surviving Entity shall cooperate to assert all
defenses to disclosure claimed by either partys Group, and shall not
disclose any disputed documents or information until all legal defenses and
claims of privilege have been finally determined, except as otherwise
required by a court order requiring such disclosure. 

   

 Section 6.3 _Production of Witnesses_. Subject to _Section 6.2_, after the Distribution Date, each of Quanex and the Surviving Entity shall, and shall cause each member of its respective Group to make available to the Surviving Entity or Quanex or any member of the Spinco Group or of the Quanex Group, as the case may be, upon written request, such Groups directors, officers, employees and agents as witnesses to the extent that any such Person may reasonably be required in connection with any Litigation Matters, administrative or other proceedings in which the requesting party may from time to time be involved and relating to the pre-Distribution business of the Quanex Group or the Spinco Group or relating to or in connection with the relationship between the Groups on or prior to the Distribution Date. The costs and expenses incurred in the provision of such witnesses shall be paid by the party requesting the availability of such persons. 

  

 Section 6.4 _Retention of Records_. Except as otherwise agreed in writing, or as otherwise provided in the other Transaction Agreements, each of Quanex and the Surviving Entity shall, and shall cause the members of the Group of which it is a member to, retain all Information in such partys Groups possession or under its control, relating directly and predominantly to the pre-Distribution business, Assets or Liabilities of the other partys Group until such Information is at least ten years old or until such later date as may be required by Law, except that if, prior to the expiration of such period, any member of either partys Group wishes to destroy or dispose of any such Information that is at least three years old, prior to destroying or disposing of any of such Information, (a) the party whose Group is proposing to dispose of or destroy any such Information shall provide no less than 30 days prior written notice to the other party, specifying the Information proposed to be destroyed or disposed of, and (b) if, prior to the scheduled date for such destruction or disposal, the other party requests in writing that any of the Information proposed to be destroyed or disposed of be delivered to such other party, the party whose Group is proposing to dispose of or destroy such Information promptly shall arrange for the delivery of the requested Information to a location specified by, and at the expense of, the requesting party. 

  

 Section 6.5 _Confidentiality_. Subject to _Section 6.2_, which shall govern Privileged Information, from and after the Distribution Date, each of Quanex and the Surviving Entity shall hold, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its Affiliates and Representatives to hold, in strict confidence all Information concerning the other partys Group obtained by it prior to the Distribution Date or furnished to it by such other partys Group pursuant to this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements and shall not release or disclose such Information to any other Person, except its Affiliates and Representatives, who shall be advised of the provisions of this  _Section 6.5_, and each party shall be responsible for a breach by any of its Affiliates or Representatives; provided, however, that any member of the Quanex Group or the Spinco Group may disclose such Information to the extent that (a) disclosure is compelled by judicial or administrative process or, based on advice of such Persons counsel, by other requirements of 

   ##### 

  

    

law, so long as the other party is provided with reasonable prior notice of,
and a reasonable opportunity to challenge, any such disclosure, or (b) such
party can show that such Information was (i) in the public domain through no
fault of such Person or (ii) lawfully acquired by such Person from another
source after the time that it was furnished to such Person by the other
partys Group, and not acquired from such source subject to any
confidentiality obligation on the part of such source known to the acquiror.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of Quanex and the Surviving Entity shall
be deemed to have satisfied its obligations under this _Section 6.5_
with respect to any Information (other than Privileged Information) if it
exercises the same care with regard to such Information as it takes to
preserve confidentiality for its own similar Information, provided that such
care is at least a reasonable degree of care. 

  

 Section 6.6 _Cooperation with Respect to Government Reports and Filings_. Quanex, on behalf of itself and each member of the Quanex Group, agrees to provide any member of the Spinco Group, and the Surviving Entity, on behalf of itself and each member of the Spinco Group, agrees to provide any member of the Quanex Group, with such cooperation and Information as may be reasonably requested by the other in connection with the preparation or filing of any government report or other government filing contemplated by this Agreement or in conducting any other government proceeding relating to the business of the Quanex Group or the Spinco Group, Assets or Liabilities of either Group or relating to or in connection with the relationship between the Groups prior to, on or after the Distribution Date. Each party shall promptly forward copies of appropriate notices, forms and other communications received from or sent to any government authority which relate to the Quanex Group, in the case of the Spinco Group, or the Spinco Group, in the case of the Quanex Group. Each party shall make its employees and facilities available during normal business hours and on reasonable prior notice to provide explanation of any documents or Information provided hereunder.

Each of Quanex and Spinco shall, for two years after the termination of this Agreement, maintain records and other evidence sufficient to accurately and properly calculate the amounts due determined in accordance with Section 3 hereof.

of auditing and verifying the accuracy of the invoices submitted regarding
such amounts due.  Any such audits performed by or on behalf of Quanex or
Spinco shall be at the requesting partys sole cost and expense. The party

other partys books for a period of one year after the month in which the
Services were rendered.

So long as the parties are attempting in good faith to resolve the dispute, neither party shall be entitled to terminate the Services related to, or that are the cause of, the disputed amounts. If it is determined that the party receiving Services is required to pay all or a portion of the disputed amounts to the party providing Services, the party receiving the Services shall pay such amounts promptly and in no case more than five days after such determination is made.

 _SECTION 6. CONFIDENTIALITY_ 

   

 Each party acknowledges that in connection with its performance under this Agreement, it may gain access to confidential material and information that is of a proprietary, technical or business nature to the other party with respect to the Services being performed hereunder. Therefore, each party agrees that it shall not, and shall cause each of its respective officers, directors, employees, and other agents and representatives, including attorneys, agents, customers, suppliers, contractors and consultants (collectively, such partys "Representatives"), not to, directly or indirectly, disclose, reveal, divulge or communicate to any person (other than Representatives of such party who reasonably need to know such information in providing Services hereunder) or use or otherwise exploit for its own benefit or for the benefit of any third party, any of the other partys Confidential Information (as defined below). If any disclosures are made by a party to its Representatives in connection with such Representatives providing Services hereunder, then the Confidential Information so disclosed shall be used only as required to perform the Services. Such party shall use the same degree of care to prevent and restrain the unauthorized use or disclosure of the other partys Confidential Information by any of its Representatives as they currently use for their own confidential information of a like nature, but in no event less than a reasonable standard of care. If a party is required to disclose Confidential Information of the other party due to a provision of law or a compulsory disclosure notice of a court or governmental agency, the party needing to make such disclosure shall promptly notify the other party and shall assist the other party in obtaining confidential treatment of such Confidential Information. "Confidential Information" of a party means any information, material or documents relating to the business of such party currently or formerly conducted, or 

   ##### 

  

    

proposed to be conducted, by such party furnished to or in possession of the
other party, irrespective of the form of communication, and all notes,
analyses, compilations, forecasts, data, translations, studies, memoranda or
other documents prepared by or on behalf of the other party that contain or
otherwise reflect such information, material or documents.
"Confidential Information" does not include, and there shall be no obligation
hereunder with respect to, information that (i) is or becomes generally
available to the public, other than as a result of a disclosure by any member
of the other party or any of its Representatives not otherwise
permissible hereunder, (ii) the other party can demonstrate was or became
available to such other party from a source other than the first party, or
(iii) is developed independently by the other party without reference to the
Confidential Information; provided, however, that, in the case of clause
(ii) above, the source of such information was not known by the other party
to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal
or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, the first party with respect
to such information. 

  

 Following termination of the Services hereunder, upon written request at any time by either party, the parties shall account for and return or destroy all papers, books, records and electronic records containing any Confidential Information. 

  

  _SECTION 7. TERM OF AGREEMENT_

 _SECTION 8. TERMINATION_  

   

 8.1 __Termination of Agreement__. At any time or from time to time, either party may terminate this Agreement for any reason whatsoever by giving the other party at least 45 days prior written notice to that effect. Each party shall pay the other party for all charges determined pursuant to Section 3 and incurred up to the date of such termination. Subject to Section 5, either party may also immediately terminate this Agreement if the other party does not tender payment for the Services within fifteen days after such party is given written notice of a failure to pay. 

   

 8.2 __Termination of Services__. At any time or from time to time, either party may terminate any one or more of the specific Services provided hereunder by giving the other party at least thirty days prior written notice to that effect. At any time or from time to time, either party may immediately terminate any one or more of the specific Services if the providing of such Service would violate any applicable regulation, statute, ordinance or other law; __provided__ , __however__ , that a party shall give the other party prompt written notice when it intends to terminate any specific Services for this reason. 

   

 _SECTION 9. MISCELLANEOUS_  

   

 9.1 __Force Majeure__. Neither party shall have any obligation to perform any specific Service hereunder if its failure to do so is caused by or results from any act of God, governmental action, natural disaster, strike, terrorism, war, insurrection or other cause or 

   ##### 

  

    

circumstances beyond its control, which acts or occurrences make it impossible
for such party to carry out its obligations under this Agreement. During the
term of the force majeure, the party receiving the Service shall have no
obligation to pay for the specific Service that the other party does not
provide as a result of the force majeure. 

   

 9.2 __Limitation of Liability__. EXCEPT FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE CONFIDENTIALITY PROVISIONS HEREIN AND FOR FRAUD, GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSSES OR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS AND GOODWILL, WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

The foregoing shall not be interpreted to require either party to indemnify the other party against the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the other party, its employees, contractors or agents.   

  

 9.4 __Independent Contractor__ : The parties hereto agree that the Services rendered by the Quanex Group and the Spinco Group in the fulfillment of the terms and obligations of this Agreement shall be as an independent contractor and not as an employee, and with respect thereto, the Quanex Group, the Spinco Group and their respective employees, contractors or agents are not entitled to the benefits provided by the other party to its employees including, but not limited to, group insurance and participation in any employee benefit and pension plans. Further, nothing stated in this Agreement shall be construed to make any member of the Quanex Group an agent, partner or joint venturer of or with any member of the Spinco Group or to make any member of the Spinco Group an agent, partner or joint venturer of or with any member of the Quanex Group. No employee, contractor or agent of either the Quanex Group or the Spinco Group shall represent himself to third persons to be other than an independent contractor of the other party, nor shall he permit himself to offer or agree to incur or assume any obligations or commitments in the name of such party or for such party without the prior consent and authorization of such party.

 Whereas, after the Conversions and prior to the Distribution Date, Quanex intends, pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement and subject to conditions set forth therein, to transfer or cause to be transferred to Spinco all of the Spinco Assets, which represent substantially all of the assets comprising the Building Products Business, and Spinco intends to assume all of the Spinco Liabilities, as contemplated by the Distribution Agreement (the " _Contribution_ "); 

  

 Whereas, either before or after the Distribution, Spinco will merge with and into Spinco Sub (the " _Spinco Merger_ ") pursuant to the Spinco Merger Agreement; 

  

 Whereas, on the Distribution Date and pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement and subject to conditions set forth therein, Quanex will distribute (the " _Distribution_ ") on a pro rata basis to the holders as of the Record Date of the outstanding Quanex Common Stock (the " _Quanex Stockholders_ ") either (a) all of the limited liability company interest (the " _Membership Interest_ ") of Spinco (if the Spinco Merger occurs after the Distribution) or (b) the shares of Spinco Sub stock (if the Spinco Merger occurs prior to the Distribution); and 

  

 Whereas, in contemplation of the Conversions, the Contribution, the Distribution and the Spinco Merger, the Companies desire to enter into this Agreement (a) to provide for the allocation between them of the liabilities for Taxes arising prior to, as a result of and subsequent to the Distribution and (b) to provide for and agree upon other matters relating to Taxes;

If the Cutoff Date is not an Accounting Cutoff Date, the principles of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(iii) shall be applied to ratably allocate the Tax Items (other than extraordinary items) of the month that includes the Cutoff Date. 

  

 (b) _Restructuring Tax Items_. 

   

 In determining the apportionment of Tax Items between Pre-Cutoff Periods and Post-Cutoff Periods, any Tax Items relating to the Restructuring shall be treated as "extraordinary items" described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(C) and shall be allocated to Pre-Cutoff Periods, and any Taxes related to such Tax Items shall be treated under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(iv) as relating to such "extraordinary item" and shall be allocated to Pre-Cutoff Periods. 

  

 Section 3.2. _Allocation of Tax Assets_. 

  

 Quanex shall determine in accordance with applicable Tax Laws the allocation of any applicable Tax Assets among Quanex, each other Quanex Group Member, Spinco and each other Spinco Group Member. The Companies hereby agree that in the absence of controlling legal authority or unless otherwise provided under this Agreement, each Tax Asset shall be allocated to the Group Member who generated such Tax Asset. 

  

 Section 3.3. _Quanex Equity Awards_. 

  

 Except as otherwise required by applicable Tax Law and subject to the following sentence, Quanex shall be entitled to claim on its Tax Returns any and all Tax deductions attributable to an exercise, or a disqualifying disposition, grant, vesting, payment or delivery of shares, or other consideration in lieu of shares, by Quanex, under or in connection with an Equity Award (including a payment of dividends in connection with an Equity Award), and neither the Surviving Entity nor any Spinco Group Member shall attempt to claim on any Tax Return any such Tax deductions. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if Quanex determines that under applicable Tax Law (or as a result of a Final Determination) no Quanex Group Member is entitled to claim such Tax deductions but the Surviving Entity or a Spinco Group Member is entitled to claim such Tax deductions, the Surviving Entity or such Spinco Group Member shall be entitled to claim such Tax deductions on its applicable Tax Returns, and the Surviving Entity shall pay to Quanex the "deemed tax benefit" of such Tax deductions, regardless of whether the 

   ##### 

  

    

Surviving Entity or any Spinco Group Member actually claims such Tax
deductions or realizes a Tax Benefit from claiming any such Tax deductions.
For purposes of this _Section 3.3_, the "deemed tax benefit" shall
conclusively be the total amount of the available Tax deductions for any such
exercise, disqualifying disposition, grant, vesting or payment multiplied by
36%. The Surviving Entity shall pay the "deemed tax benefit" amount, if any,
to Quanex no later than 20 days after the later of (a) Quanex notification
to the Surviving Entity that the Surviving Entity or a Spinco Group Member is
entitled to claim such Tax deductions or (b) the occurrence of any applicable
exercise, disqualifying disposition, grant, vesting, payment or delivery of
shares, or other consideration in lieu of shares, by Quanex under or in
connection with an Equity Award. Further, if the performance of the
obligations described in this _Section 3.3_ shall become impracticable or
impossible due to any change in Tax Law or the interpretation thereof by any
Tax Authority subsequent to the date of this Agreement, the Companies shall
use their best efforts to find an alternative means to achieve the same or
substantially the same result as that contemplated by this _Section 3.3_.

 The Surviving Entity hereby irrevocably designates, and agrees to cause each Spinco Group Member to so designate, Quanex as its sole and exclusive agent and attorney-in-fact to take such action (including execution of documents) as Quanex, in its reasonable discretion, may deem appropriate in any and all matters (including Tax Contests) relating to any Quanex Combined Tax Return.

 Section 4.3. _Tax Accounting Practices_. 

  

 (a) _In General_. 

   

 Except as otherwise provided in _Section 4.3(b)_, to the extent the Tax accounting practices or reporting position with respect to Tax Items reported on any Spinco Filed Return might reasonably affect any Tax liability for which Quanex is responsible under this Agreement, the Surviving Entity shall prepare such Spinco Filed Return and report such Tax Items in a manner that is consistent with Quanex past Tax accounting practices and reporting positions with respect to such Tax Items (unless such past Tax accounting practices or reporting positions are no longer permissible under the Code or other applicable Tax Law). 

   ##### 

  

     

 (b) _Reporting of Distribution Tax Items_. 

   

 (1) _Tax Consequences of the Distribution_. If the Spinco Merger has not occurred prior to the Distribution and Quanex distributes the Membership Interest of Spinco to the Quanex Stockholders, the Companies intend for U.S. federal income purposes: 

   

 (i) that, prior to the Distribution, Spinco and each other Spinco Group Member (the " _Disregarded Entities_ ") eligible to be disregarded as entities separate from Quanex for U.S. federal tax purposes under Treasury Regulations section 301.7701-3 shall be so treated; 

   

 (ii) that the Distribution be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a distribution of the Spinco Assets (subject to the Spinco Liabilities) held by the Disregarded Entities to the Quanex Stockholders, followed by a contribution of such Spinco Assets (subject to the Spinco Liabilities) by the Quanex Stockholders to Spinco in exchange for a pro rata share of the Membership Interest of Spinco (which Company intends to be classified as a partnership for U.S. federal tax purposes immediately following such exchange); and 

   

 (iii) that the Spinco Merger be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a contribution by Spinco of all of the Spinco Assets (subject to the Spinco Liabilities) to Spinco Sub in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Spinco Sub stock, followed by the distribution of such Spinco Sub shares to the Quanex Stockholders in liquidation of Spinco. 

  

 (2) _Reporting of Distribution_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Surviving Entity shall determine, in a manner consistent with _Section 4.3(b)(1)_ if applicable, the amount of the Distribution and Restructuring Taxes and the proper Tax treatment of Tax Items relating to the Restructuring and the Distribution and the method for reporting any such Tax Item on any Tax Return; _provided_ , that Quanex shall have the opportunity to review and comment upon the Surviving Entitys determinations, such comments to be reasonably accepted by the Surviving Entity. Such amount, treatment and reporting method shall be used by (i) the Surviving Entity in preparing and filing any Spinco Filed Return and (ii) Quanex in preparing and filing any Quanex Filed Return; _provided_ that, after Quanex has had the opportunity to comment upon the Surviving Entitys determinations, Quanex believes that it is more likely than not that such positions will be sustained. To the extent any Quanex Filed Return includes a Tax Item relating to the Distribution or the Restructuring, Quanex shall submit a copy of the relevant portion of such Quanex Filed Return to the Surviving Entity for its review. Quanex shall use its reasonable best efforts to make the relevant portions of such Quanex Filed Return available for the Surviving Entitys review sufficiently in advance of the due date for filing such Quanex Filed Return to provide the Surviving Entity with a meaningful opportunity to analyze and comment on such Quanex Filed Return and have such Quanex Filed Return modified before filing. If, after reviewing Spincos determinations under this _Section 4.3(b)(2)_ there is any dispute regarding the proper Tax treatment of any Tax Item relating to the Distribution or the Restructuring, such dispute shall be referred for resolution pursuant to _Section_  

   ##### 

  

 

 _9_ sufficiently in advance of the filing date for such Quanex Filed Return

Return. 

   

 Section 4.4. _Right to Review Combined Tax Returns_.

The Company responsible for preparing and filing such Combined Tax Return shall use its reasonable best efforts to make the relevant portions of such Combined Tax Return available for review as required under this _Section 4.4_ sufficiently in advance of the due date for filing such Combined Tax Return to provide the other Company with a meaningful opportunity to analyze and comment on such Combined Tax Return and have such Combined Tax Return modified before filing. Quanex and the Surviving Entity shall attempt in good faith to resolve any issues arising out of the review of such Combined Tax Returns. 

  

 Section 4.5. _Adjustment Requests; Carrybacks; Utilization of Tax Assets_. 

  

 (a) _Adjustment Requests and Carrybacks Requiring Quanex  Consent_. 

   

 Except as otherwise required by applicable Tax Law or unless Quanex otherwise consents in writing, the Surviving Entity hereby agrees to cause each Spinco Group Member (i) to not make any Adjustment Request with respect to any Tax for any Pre-Cutoff Period applicable to such Spinco Group Member and (ii) to make any available elections to relinquish the right to claim in any Pre-Cutoff Period any Carryback Items of any Spinco Group Member arising in a Post-Cutoff Period, including making the election under Section 172(b)(3) of the Code (and any similar provision of any other applicable Tax Laws) to relinquish the right to carry back net operating losses. With respect to any Adjustment Request to which Quanex grants its consent under the preceding sentence, the Surviving Entity shall reimburse Quanex for its legal, accounting, administrative and other related expenses incurred in preparing, filing and making any such Adjustment Request. 

  

 (b) _Carrybacks to Pre-Cutoff Periods_. 

   

 Notwithstanding _Section 4.5(a)_, if any Spinco Group Member is required by applicable Tax Law to carry back a Carryback Item arising in a Post-Cutoff Period to a Pre-Cutoff Period, the Companies agree that any Carryback Item of any Quanex Group Member that may be carried back to the same Pre-Cutoff Period shall be deemed to be used before any Carryback Item of any Spinco Group Member. If any Quanex Group Member receives a refund or realizes a Tax Benefit as a result of a Carryback Item of any Spinco Group Member arising in a Post-Cutoff Period being carried back to a Pre-Cutoff Period, Quanex shall make a payment to the Surviving Entity in an amount equal to such refund or the realized Tax Benefit within 30 days following either the receipt of such refund or the filing of the Tax Return reflecting the realization of such Tax Benefit. 

   ##### 

  

     

 (c) _Other Adjustment Requests Permitted_. 

   

 With respect to any Tax imposed on or attributable to any Group Member for any applicable Pre-Cutoff Period, Quanex may make an Adjustment Request with respect to such Tax, including carrying back a Carryback Item of any Quanex Group Member arising in a Post-Cutoff Period to any Pre-Cutoff Period. Any refund or other Tax Benefit obtained as a result of any such Adjustment Request pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be for the account of Quanex, and Quanex shall have no obligation to compensate or make a payment to any Spinco Group Member in the event any such Adjustment Request results in a Tax Detriment to any Spinco Group Member. 

  

 (d) _Utilization of Tax Assets_. 

   

 With respect to each Combined Tax Return and any adjustment to the Income Taxes reflected on a Combined Tax Return as a result of a Tax Contest, Adjustment Request or otherwise, each Group Member included in such Combined Tax Return shall be entitled to use, in accordance with applicable Tax Laws, any and all Tax Assets of each other Group Member included in such Combined Tax Return. Except as provided in _Section 5.1_, no Group Member that utilizes the Tax Assets of any other Group Member shall be required to compensate or make any payment to such other Group Member with respect to the utilization of such Tax Assets.

With respect to any estimated Income Tax payable on a Quanex Combined Tax Return that takes into account the Tax Items of any Spinco Group Member that are allocable pursuant to _Section 3.1_ to the portion of the Stub Period for which such estimated Income Taxes are payable, the Surviving Entity shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Quanex an amount (" _Spinco s Estimated Income Tax Payment_") equal to the estimated Income Tax such Spinco Group Member would pay if it filed a separate Income Tax Return based solely on the income, apportionment factors and other Tax Items of such Spinco Group Member for the applicable portion of the Stub Period; _provided_ , that to the extent that such Spinco Group Member would be entitled to file an Income Tax Return with respect to the applicable Income Tax on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis with any other Spinco Group Member, Spincos Estimated Income Tax Payment for such Spinco Group Members shall be determined as though such Spinco Group Members filed an Income Tax Return with respect to such Income Tax on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis based solely on the income, apportionment factors and other Tax Items of such Spinco Group Members for the Stub Period. 

  

 (ii) _Spinco Combined Tax Returns_. With respect to any estimated Income Tax payable on a Spinco Combined Tax Return that takes into account the Tax 

   ##### 

  

    

Items of any Quanex Group Member that are allocable pursuant to _Section 3.1_
to the portion of the Stub Period for which such estimated Income Taxes are
payable, Quanex shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Surviving Entity an
amount (" _Quanex  Combined Tax Return Estimated Income Tax Payment_") equal
to the estimated Income Tax such Quanex Group Member would pay if it filed a
separate Income Tax Return based solely on the income, apportionment factors
and other Tax Items of such Quanex Group Member for the applicable portion of
the Stub Period; _provided_ , that to the extent that such Quanex Group
Member would be entitled to file an Income Tax Return with respect to the
applicable Income Tax on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis with
any other Quanex Group Member, Quanex Combined Tax Return Estimated Income
Tax Payment for such Quanex Group Members shall be determined as though such
Quanex Group Members filed an Income Tax Return with respect to such Income
Tax on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis based solely on the income,
apportionment factors and other Tax Items of such Quanex Group Members for the
Stub Period. 

   

 (2) _Spinco Separate Return_. With respect to any estimated Income Tax payable on a Spinco Separate Return that takes into account the Tax Items of any Spinco Group Member that are allocable pursuant to _Section 3.1_ to Pre-Cutoff Periods for which such estimated Income Taxes are payable, Quanex shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Surviving Entity an amount (" _Quanex  Estimated Income Tax Payment_") equal to the estimated Income Tax such Spinco Group Member would pay if the amount of such estimated Income Tax were determined based solely on the income, apportionment factors and other Tax Items of such Spinco Group Member for the applicable portion of the Pre-Cutoff Period; _provided_ , that to the extent that such Spinco Group Member files an Income Tax Return with respect to the applicable Income Tax on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis with any other Spinco Group Member, the aggregate amount of Quanex Estimated Income Tax Payment payable with respect to such Spinco Group Members shall be determined by taking into account the fact that such Spinco Group Members file an Income Tax Return with respect to such Income Tax on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis. 

  

 (b) _Income Tax Liability_. 

  

 (1) _Combined Tax Returns_. 

   

 (i) _Quanex Combined Tax Returns_. With respect to any Income Tax payable on a Quanex Combined Tax Return that takes into account the Tax Items of any Spinco Group Member that are allocable pursuant to _Section 3.1_ to the portion of the Stub Period for which such Income Taxes are payable, the Surviving Entity shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Quanex an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of Income Taxes that would be incurred by the Spinco Group Member had such Spinco Group Member filed a separate Income Tax Return based solely on the income, apportionment factors and other Tax Items of such Spinco Group Member for the portion of the Stub Period for which such Income Taxes are payable (" _Spinco s Separate Income Tax Liability_"), over (ii) the aggregate amount of Spincos Estimated Income Tax Payments actually paid to Quanex with respect to Spincos Separate Income Tax Liability. If the aggregate amount of Spincos Estimated Income Tax Payments actually paid to Quanex with respect to Spincos Separate Income Tax Liability exceeds Spincos Separate Income Tax Liability, Quanex shall pay to the Surviving Entity an amount equal to such excess. In addition, to the extent that any Quanex Group Member utilizes 

   ##### 

  

    

any Tax Assets of a Spinco Group Member that accrues after the Cutoff Date and
such utilization results in a Tax Benefit being realized by such Quanex Group
Member (treating any Tax Assets attributable to the Quanex Group as utilized
prior to the utilization of any Tax Assets attributable to the Spinco Group),
then Quanex shall pay to the Surviving Entity the amount of such Tax Benefit
and such Tax Assets for which Quanex has paid the Surviving Entity shall not
be utilizable by any Spinco Group Member. For purposes of determining
Spincos Separate Income Tax Liability, to the extent that any Spinco Group
Member would be entitled to file an Income Tax Return on a consolidated,
combined or unitary basis with any other Spinco Group Member,
Spincos Separate Income Tax Liability shall be determined as though such
Spinco Group Members had filed a consolidated, combined or unitary Income Tax
Return based solely on the income, apportionment factors and other Tax Items
of such Spinco Group Members for the applicable portion of the Stub Period. 

   

 (ii) _Spinco Combined Tax Returns_. With respect to any Income Tax payable on a Spinco Combined Tax Return that takes into account the Tax Items of any Quanex Group Member that are allocable pursuant to _Section 3.1_ to the portion of the Stub Period for which such Income Taxes are payable, Quanex shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Surviving Entity an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of Income Taxes that would be incurred by the Quanex Group Member had such Quanex Group Member filed a separate Income Tax Return based solely on the income, apportionment factors and other Tax Items of such Quanex Group Member for the portion of the Stub Period for which such Income Taxes are payable (" _Quanex  Combined Tax Return Separate Income Tax Liability_"), over (ii) the aggregate amount of Quanex Combined Tax Return Estimated Income Tax Payments actually paid to the Surviving Entity with respect to Quanex Combined Tax Return Separate Income Tax Liability. If the aggregate amount of Quanex Combined Tax Return Estimated Income Tax Payments actually paid to the Surviving Entity with respect to Quanex Combined Tax Return Separate Income Tax Liability exceeds Quanex Combined Tax Return Separate Income Tax Liability, the Surviving Entity shall pay to Quanex an amount equal to such excess. In addition, to the extent that any Spinco Group Member utilizes any Tax Assets of a Quanex Group Member that accrues after the Cutoff Date and such utilization results in a Tax Benefit being realized by such Spinco Group Member (treating any Tax Assets attributable to the Spinco Group as utilized prior to the utilization of any Tax Assets attributable to the Quanex Group), then the Surviving Entity shall pay to Quanex the amount of such Tax Benefit and such Tax Assets for which the Surviving Entity has paid Quanex shall not be utilizable by any Quanex Group Member. For purposes of determining Quanex Combined Tax Return Separate Income Tax Liability, to the extent that any Quanex Group Member would be entitled to file an Income Tax Return on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis with any other Quanex Group Member, Quanex Combined Tax Return Separate Income Tax Liability shall be determined as though such Quanex Group Members had filed a consolidated, combined or unitary Income Tax Return based solely on the income, apportionment factors and other Tax Items of such Quanex Group Members for the applicable portion of the Stub Period.

   ##### 

  

    

filed an Income Tax Return based solely on the income, apportionment factors
and other Tax Items of such Spinco Group Member for the portion of the Pre-
Cutoff Period for which such Income Tax is payable (" _Quanex  Separate
Income Tax Liability_"), over (ii) the aggregate amount of Quanex Estimated
Income Tax Payments actually paid to the Surviving Entity with respect to
Quanex Separate Income Tax Liability. If the aggregate amount of Quanex
Estimated Income Tax Payments actually paid to the Surviving Entity with
respect to Quanex Separate Income Tax Liability exceeds Quanex Separate
Income Tax Liability, the Surviving Entity shall pay to Quanex an amount equal
to such excess. In addition, to the extent that any Spinco Group Member
utilizes any Tax Assets of a Spinco Group Member that accrues before the
Cutoff Date and such utilization results in a Tax Benefit being realized by
such Spinco Group Member (treating any Tax Assets accruing before the Cutoff
Date as utilized prior to the utilization of any Tax Assets accruing after the
Cutoff Date), then the Surviving Entity shall pay to Quanex the amount of
such Tax Benefit. For purposes of determining Quanex Separate Income Tax
Liability, to the extent that any Spinco Group Member files an Income Tax
Return on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis with any other Spinco
Group Member, Quanex Separate Income Tax Liability for such Spinco Group
Members shall be determined by taking into account the fact that such Spinco
Group Members file a consolidated, combined or unitary Income Tax Return. 

   

 (c) _Timing of Tax Payments_. 

   

 With respect to each Tax Payment required to be made by the Surviving Entity to Quanex or by Quanex to the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, under this _Section 5.1_, the Company responsible for preparing the Income Tax Return with respect to which such Tax Payment is attributable (the " _Preparing Company_ ") shall prepare and deliver a schedule (the " _Tax Schedule_ ") to the other Company (the " _Receiving Company_ ") showing in reasonable detail the Preparing Companys calculation of such Tax Payment not later than 15 days prior to the due date (including extensions if an extension with respect to the applicable Tax Return is requested) of such Income Tax Return. Within 15 days after the Receiving Companys receipt of the Tax Schedule, the Receiving Company shall pay to the Preparing Company the amount of the Tax Payment reflected on the Tax Schedule. 

  

 (d) _Adjustments to Tax Payments_. 

   

 If there is any adjustment to any Income Tax described in _Section 5.1(b)_, whether as a result of a Tax Contest, Adjustment Request or otherwise, the Preparing Company shall redetermine the amount of the Tax Payments due under _Section 5.1(b)_ (the " _Revised Tax Payment_ ") and deliver a statement (the " _Revised Tax Schedule_ ") to the Receiving Company setting forth in appropriate detail the Preparing Companys determination of the Revised Tax Payment. If the Revised Tax Payment exceeds the Tax Payment previously paid by the Receiving Company under  _Section 5.1(b)_ with respect to such Income Tax, the Receiving Company shall pay to the Preparing Company the difference between the Revised Tax Payment and the Tax Payment not more than 15 days after the Receiving Companys receipt of the Revised Tax Schedule. If the Revised Tax Payment is less than the Tax Payment previously paid by the Receiving Company under _Section 5.1(b)_ with respect to such Income Tax, the Preparing Company shall pay to the Receiving Company the difference between the Revised Tax Payment and the Tax Payment within 15 days after such adjustment.

 In the event a Company is required to make a payment to another Company under this Agreement and the time for making such payment is not otherwise provided for in this Agreement, the first Company shall make such payment within 15 days of its receipt of such other Companys written demand for such payment, which written demand shall include in reasonable detail an explanation and computation of the amount due. 

  

 Section 5.4. _Tax Treatment of Payments_. 

  

 Unless otherwise required by applicable Tax Law, the Companies agree that any payments made by one Company to another Company (other than any reimbursement of expense pursuant to _Section 4.5(a)_ and interest payments pursuant to _Section 5.5_) pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated for all Tax and financial accounting purposes as nontaxable payments (dividend distributions or capital contributions, as the case may be, between Quanex and Spinco) made immediately prior to the Distribution and, accordingly, as not includible in the Taxable income of the recipient Company or as deductible by the payor Company. 

  

 Section 5.5. _Interest_. 

  

 Any payment that is not made within the period prescribed in this Agreement (the " _Payment Period_ ") shall bear interest at the Default Rate, compounded semiannually, for the period from and including the date immediately following the last date of the Payment Period through and including the date of payment. Notwithstanding _Section 5.4_, the interest payment shall be treated as interest expense to the payor (deductible to the extent provided by applicable Tax Law) and as interest income by the recipient (includible in income to the extent provided by applicable Tax Law). 

  

Section 6\. _Assistance and Cooperation; Retention of Tax Records._  

   

 Section 6.1. _Assistance and Cooperation._

personnel (including each Group Members officers, directors, employees and
agents) responsible for preparing, maintaining and interpreting information
and documents relevant to Taxes, and personnel reasonably required

 Section 6.2. _Retention of Tax Records_. 

  

 Each Company shall preserve and keep all Tax Records exclusively relating to Separate Company Taxes of their respective Groups for Pre-Cutoff Periods, and Quanex shall preserve and keep all other Tax Records relating to Taxes of the Groups for Pre-Cutoff Periods, for so long as the contents thereof may become material in the administration of any matter under the Code or other applicable Tax Law, but in any event until the later of (i) the expiration of any applicable statutes of limitation, and (ii) seven years after the date of the Distribution. If, prior to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitation and such seven-year period, a Company reasonably determines that any Tax Records which it is required to preserve and keep under this _Section 6.2_ are no longer material in the administration of any matter under the Code or other applicable Tax Law, such Company may dispose of such Tax Records upon 90 days prior notice to the other Companies.

   ##### 

  

    

Contest. Such Companys rights shall extend to any matter pertaining to the
management and control of the Tax Contest, including execution of waivers,
choice of forum, scheduling of conferences and the resolution of any Tax
Item. Provided, however, if such Tax Contest relates to Taxes for which the
other Company may be responsible under this Agreement, such Company shall
be entitled to jointly control such Tax Contest at its own expense and such
Tax Contest shall not be settled without the consent of such Company, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Surviving Entity shall have the exclusive right, in its sole discretion, to control, contest and represent the interests of each Group in any Tax Contest relating, in whole or in part, to Distribution and Restructuring Taxes and to resolve, settle or agree to any deficiency, claim or adjustment proposed, asserted or assessed in connection with or as a result of any such Tax Contest. The Surviving Entitys rights shall extend to any matter pertaining to the management and control of the Tax Contest, including execution of waivers, choice of forum, scheduling of conferences and the resolution of any Tax Item. Provided, that Quanex may participate in such Tax Contests described in this _Section 7.2(b)_ at its own expense, and such Tax Contest shall not be settled without the consent of Quanex, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

  

 (c) _Other Taxes_. 

   

 In the case of any Tax Contest with respect to any Other Tax for which the Surviving Entity is solely responsible under _Section 2.5_, the Surviving Entity shall have the exclusive right, in its sole discretion, to control, contest and represent the interests of the Spinco Group in such Tax Contest and to resolve, settle or agree to any deficiency, claim or adjustment proposed, asserted or assessed in connection with or as a result of any such Tax Contest. With respect to any Other Tax not described in the preceding sentence, Quanex shall have the exclusive right, in its sole discretion, to control, contest and represent the interests of the Groups in such Tax Contest and to resolve, settle or agree to any deficiency, claim or adjustment proposed, asserted or assessed in connection with or as a result of any such Tax Contest. 

  

 Section 7.3. _Reimbursement of Expenses_. 

  

 If the Indemnifying Company is not the Company that has the right to control an applicable Tax Contest pursuant to _Section 7.2_ (the " _Controlling Company_ "), the Indemnifying Company shall reimburse the Controlling Company for its reasonable costs (including accountants fees, investigatory fees and fees and disbursements of tax counsel) (" _Indemnification Expenses_ ") incurred in any Tax Contest that are reasonably allocable to the portion of the contested Taxes that would be the responsibility of the Indemnifying Company hereunder upon a Final Determination that such contested Taxes are due. The Controlling Company shall provide the Indemnifying Company with a written statement (a " _Reimbursement Statement_ ") periodically (but not more often than monthly) that sets forth the amount of the Controlling Companys Indemnification Expenses since the most recent Reimbursement Statement and due hereunder. Within 15 days of the Indemnifying Companys receipt of each

Company the total amount of the Indemnification Expenses shown on such
Reimbursement Statement. 

  

Section 8\. _Covenants Relating to Taxes_. 

   

 Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Company (for itself and its Affiliates) agrees (i) not to take any action reasonably expected to result in an increased Tax liability to another Company, a reduction in a Tax Asset of another Company or an increased liability to another Company under this Agreement and (ii) to take any action reasonably requested by another Company that would reasonably be expected to result in a Tax Benefit or avoid a Tax Detriment to such requesting Company; _provided_ , that such action does not result in any additional direct or indirect cost not fully compensated for by the requesting Company. 

  

Section 9\. _Dispute Resolution_. 

   

 In the event that the Companies disagree as to the amount or calculation of any payment to be made under this Agreement, including a Tax Payment, or the interpretation or application of any provision under this Agreement, the Companies shall attempt in good faith to resolve such dispute. If such dispute is not resolved within 60 days following the commencement of the dispute, the Companies shall jointly retain an Independent Firm, reasonably acceptable to the Companies, to resolve the dispute; _provided_ , _however_ , that in order to pursue any such dispute resolution under this _Section 9_, the Indemnifying Company must first pay to the Indemnified Company, or place in an escrow reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Company pending resolution of such dispute, an amount equal to the payment, including any Tax Payment, which is the subject of such dispute. The Independent Firm shall act as an arbitrator to resolve all points of disagreement and its decision shall be final and binding upon the Companies. Following the decision of the Independent Firm, the Companies shall take, or cause to be taken, any action necessary to implement the decision of the Independent Firm. The fees and expenses relating to the Independent Firm shall be borne by the Company that does not prevail in the dispute resolution proceeding. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the dispute resolution provisions set forth in this _Section 9_ shall not be applicable to any disagreement between the Companies in connection with any matter relating to any Tax Contest.

 Section 6.2 _Spinco Pension Plan Participants_. 

  

 (a) _Assumption of Quanex Employees Pension Plan Liabilities_. Effective as of the Distribution Time, Spinco (acting directly or through its Affiliates) hereby agrees to cause the Spinco Pension Plan to assume, fully perform, pay and discharge, all Liabilities under the Quanex Employees Pension Plan relating to all Spinco Pension Plan Participants as of the Distribution Time. 

   

 (b) _Transfer of Quanex Employees Pension Plan Assets_. 

   

 (i) The parties intend that the portion of the Quanex Employees Pension Plan covering Spinco Pension Plan Participants shall be transferred to the Spinco Pension Plan in accordance with section 414( _l_ ) of the Code, Treasury Regulation § 1.414( _l_ )-1, and Section 208 of ERISA.

Prior to the Distribution Date (or such later time as mutually agreed by the parties), Quanex shall cause the actuary of the Quanex Employees Pension Plan to determine the estimated value, as of the Distribution Date, of the assets to be transferred to the Spinco Pension Plan in accordance with the assumptions and valuation methodology set forth on  _Schedule 6.2(b)_ attached hereto (the " _Estimated Pension Plan Transfer Amount_ "). 

  

 (ii) Not later than ten (10) business days following the Distribution Date (or such later time as mutually agreed by the parties), Quanex and Spinco (each acting directly or through their respective Affiliates) shall cooperate in good faith to cause an initial transfer of assets from the Quanex Employees Pension Plan to the Spinco Pension Plan in an amount equal (as determined in the discretion of Quanex) to ninety percent (90%) of the Estimated Pension Plan Transfer Amount (such amount, the " _Initial Transfer Amount_ "). Quanex shall satisfy its 

   ##### 

  

 

obligation pursuant to this Section 6.2(b)(ii) by causing the
Quanex Employees Pension Plan to transfer assets, in kind, equal to the
Initial Transfer Amount. 

   

 (iii) Within one hundred twenty (120) days (or such later time as mutually agreed by the parties) following the Distribution Date, Quanex shall cause the actuary of the Quanex Employees Pension Plan to provide Spinco with a revised calculation of the value, as of the Distribution Date, of the assets to be transferred to the Spinco Pension Plan determined in accordance with the assumptions and valuation methodology set forth on _Schedule 6.2(b)_ attached hereto (the " _Revised Pension Plan Transfer Amount_ "). Spinco may submit, at its sole cost and expense, the Revised Pension Plan Transfer Amount to the actuary for the Spinco Pension Plan (which actuary may be the same actuary as retained by the Quanex Plan) for verification; _provided, that_ , such verification process and any calculation performed by the actuary of the Spinco Pension Plan in connection therewith shall be performed solely on the basis of the assumptions and valuation methodology set forth on _Schedule 6.2(b)_ attached hereto. In order to perform such verification, upon request from Spinco, the actuary of the Spinco Pension Plan will receive the data and additional detailed methodology used to calculate the Initial Transfer Amount and the Final Pension Plan Transfer Amount (if reasonably needed) from the actuary of the Quanex Employees Pension Plan. Spinco will be responsible for the cost and expense of the actuary of the Spinco Pension Plan and Quanex will be responsible for the cost and expense for the actuary of the Quanex Employees Pension Plan for such data transfer. If the actuary of the Spinco Pension Plan so determines that the value, as of the Distribution Date, of the assets to be transferred to the Spinco Pension Plan differs from the Revised Pension Plan Transfer Amount, the actuary of the Spinco Pension Plan shall identify in writing to the actuary of the Quanex Employees Pension Plan all objections to the determination within sixty (60) days following provision of the revised value calculation to Spinco pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph (iii), and the actuaries shall use good faith efforts to reconcile any such difference. If the actuaries fail to reconcile such difference, the actuaries shall jointly designate a third, independent actuary whose calculation of the value, as of the Distribution Date, of the assets to be transferred to the Spinco Pension Plan shall be final and binding; _provided, that_ , such calculation must be performed within sixty (60) days following designation of such third actuary and in accordance with the assumptions and valuation methodology set forth on _Schedule 6.2(b)_ attached hereto; and  _provided, further_ , that such value shall be between the value determined by the actuary of the Spinco Pension Plan and the Revised Pension Plan Transfer Amount or equal to either such value. Quanex and Spinco shall each pay one-half of the costs incurred in connection with the retention of such independent actuary. The final, verified value, as of the Distribution Date, of the assets to be transferred to the Spinco Pension Plan as determined in accordance with this Section 6.2(b)(iii) shall be referred to herein as the " _Final Pension Plan Transfer Amount_."

equivalents (or, if determined by Quanex in its discretion, assets in kind)
from the Spinco Pension Plan to the Quanex Employees Pension Plan in amount
equal to the True-Up Amount. The parties acknowledge that the Quanex
Employees Pension Plans transfer of the True-Up Amount to the Spinco Pension
Plan shall be in full settlement and satisfaction of the obligations of
Quanex to cause the transfer of, and the Quanex Employees Pension Plan to
transfer, assets to the Spinco Pension Plan pursuant to this Section
6.2(b)(iv). 

   

 The True-Up Amount shall be paid from the Quanex Employees Pension Plan to the Spinco Pension Plan, as determined by Quanex in its discretion in kind, in cash, cash-like securities or other cash equivalents, and shall be adjusted to reflect earnings or losses during the period from the Distribution Date to the Final Transfer Date. Such earnings or losses shall be determined based on the actual rate of return of the Quanex Employees Pension Plan for the period commencing on the first day of the calendar month in which the Distribution Date occurs and ending on the last calendar day of the month ending immediately prior to the Final Transfer Date. Earnings or losses for the period from such last day of the month to the Final Transfer Date shall be based on the actual rate of return of the Quanex Employees Pension Plan during the last calendar month ending immediately prior to the Final Transfer Date determined as of the date that is as close as administratively practicable to the Final Transfer Date. If Spinco is obligated to cause the Spinco Pension Plan to reimburse the Quanex Employees Pension Plan pursuant to this Section 6.2(b)(iv), such reimbursement shall be performed in accordance with the same principles set forth herein with respect to the payment of the True-Up Amount. The parties acknowledge that the Spinco Pension Plans transfer of such reimbursement amount to the Quanex Employees Pension Plan shall be in full settlement and satisfaction of the obligations of Spinco to cause the transfer of, and the Spinco Pension Plan to transfer, assets to the Quanex Employees Pension Plan pursuant to this Section 6.2(b)(iv).

the parties hereby agree to negotiate in good faith regarding such other
actions that may be necessary or appropriate to achieve such objectives or,
to the extent such annuity contracts cannot be assigned to Spinco, to
