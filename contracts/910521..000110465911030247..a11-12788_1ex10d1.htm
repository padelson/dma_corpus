Brand"** ).

 



 

 **WHEREAS,** pursuant to that certain license agreement dated January 1,
2000, as amended, by and between Sanuk and CandC (the **"Sanuk License
Agreement"** ), CandC is the exclusive licensee for the Sanuk trademark (the
**"Sanuk Mark"** ) in the United States, Canada and Europe.

 



 

 **WHEREAS,** each Seller is engaged in the business of the design,

 **WHEREAS** , Purchaser desires to purchase substantially all of the assets

desires to sell such assets to Purchaser, on the terms and conditions set
forth herein.

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , subject to the rights of Purchaser to, among other things, the
record title of the Sanuk Intellectual Property and the CandC Intellectual
Property upon the closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
Deckers Bermuda will acquire from Sellers the International Exploitation
Rights (as defined below).

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the premises and the mutual

Participation Payment** ");

 



 

(iii) For the 2013 Participation Period, the Purchaser shall pay to the
Sellers (in accordance with _Sections 2.5(d)_ and _2.5(e)_ below) an
aggregate cash payment equal to 36.0% of the 2013 Gross Profit Dollars (the "

(in accordance with _Sections 2.5(d)_ and _2.5(e)_ below) an aggregate cash

(d) _Calculation of Participation Payments; Disputes_. The determination of
the amount of the Participation Payments owed to the Sellers at the end of
each Participation Period shall be made as follows:

 



 

(i) Within sixty (60) days after the end of each Participation Period, the
Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Sellers a consolidated statement of
income of the Business as of the last day each Participation Period, prepared
in accordance with GAAP on a consistent basis year-to-year (the "
**Participation Income Statement** "), together with a statement (the "
**Participation Payment Computation Statement** ") evidencing the Purchasers
determination of the Participation Payment for that Participation Period due
to the Sellers in accordance with _Section 2.5(c)_ above. In the event any of
the Sellers disputes or objects to Purchasers determination as provided in
subparagraph (ii) below, Purchaser shall make such payment as to the non-
disputed amount in accordance with _Section 2.5(e)_ below and acceptance of
such payment shall not constitute a waiver of any of the Sellers objection.

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) Any of the Sellers, the Sanuk Sellers or the CandC Sellers may object to
Purchasers determination of any Participation Payments set forth above. Any
such objection must be made by delivery of a written statement of objections
(stating the basis of the objections with reasonable specificity) (the "
**Participation Payment Dispute Notice** ") to Purchaser within thirty (30)
days following delivery by Purchaser of the applicable Participation Payment
Computation Statement and related supporting information. If any Seller so
objects, Purchaser and such Seller shall seek in good faith to resolve the
differences specified in such objection within ten (10) Business Days
following such Sellers delivery of the Participation Payment Dispute Notice.
During such time, if Purchaser disagrees with the Sellers objection,
Purchaser shall provide to the Sellers, with reasonable specificity, a written
statement of the basis of its disagreement. If no Seller timely objects to the
determination of the Participation Payment as reflected in the applicable
Participation Payment Computation Statement, or if Purchaser agrees with the
Sellers objections to the Participation Payment, then such initial
determination of the Participation Payment, or the modification thereof, as
the case may be, shall be final and binding upon Purchaser and the Sellers.

 



 

(iii) If Purchaser and the Sellers are unable to resolve a dispute with
respect to the Participation Payment for any Participation Period during such
ten (10) Business Day period following such Sellers delivery of the
Participation Payment Dispute Notice, then Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Sellers, on the other hand, jointly shall select an independent accounting
firm of recognized national or regional standing acceptable to the Purchaser
and the Sellers and not then rendering services to the Purchaser or any of the
Sellers to resolve any remaining disputes related to the Participation Payment
Dispute Notice. If Purchaser and the Sellers cannot agree on the selection of
an independent accounting firm of recognized national or regional standing
within five (5) Business Days following the expiration of the ten (10)
Business Day period, the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the
other hand, shall select an independent accounting firm of recognized national
or regional standing and each such selected independent accounting firm shall
select a third independent accounting firm of recognized national or regional
standing who is not then rendering services to the Purchaser or any of the
Sellers (such selected independent accounting firm whether pursuant to this
sentence or the preceding sentence, the " **Participation Payment Auditor**
").

 



 

(iv) Within two (2) Business Days following the selection of the Participation
Payment Auditor, each of the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on
the other hand: (i) shall submit to the Participation Payment Auditor their
respective calculation of the applicable Participation Payment (each, a "
**Proposed Amount** "), together with such work papers, documents and other
information related to the disputed issues as the Participation Payment
Auditor may reasonably request and are available to each party or its agents;
and (ii) shall be afforded the opportunity to present the Participation
Payment Auditor any such material related to the disputed issues and to
discuss the issues with the Participation Payment Auditor. The Participation
Payment Auditor shall be instructed to use every reasonable effort to perform
its services within thirty (30) days after the selection of the Participation
Payment Auditor, and in any case, as soon as practicable after such submission
of the Proposed Amounts. The Participation Payment Auditor shall be instructed
that, in making its final and binding resolution, it must select either the
Proposed Amount of Purchaser in its entirety or the Proposed Amount of the
applicable Sellers in its entirety. The Participation Payment Auditor shall
make a final and binding resolution of the dispute with respect to the
Participation Payment Computation

 



      
 

 



 

Statement, and the applicable Participation Payment as finally determined
thereby shall be deemed acceptable to Purchaser and the Sellers for all
purposes of this Agreement. No appeal from such determination shall be
permitted. The costs and expenses for the services of the Participation
Payment Auditor shall be borne by the Party whose Proposed Amount is not
selected by the Participation Payment Auditor. Judgment upon any award or
decision by the Participation Payment Auditor may be enforced by any court
having jurisdiction thereof. Following such resolution by the Participation
Payment Auditor, the Purchaser immediately shall wire to Sellers all amounts,
if any, to the accounts designated by the Sellers.

 



 

(e) _Payment of Participation Payments_. Within the later of: (i) sixty (60)
days from the end of each Participation Period; or (ii) if applicable, fifteen
(15) days of the decision by the Participation Payment Auditor pursuant to
_Section 2.5(d)_ above with respect to such Participation Period, the
Purchaser shall pay to each Seller cash in the amount equal to the product of
(x) such Sellers Participating Percentage, multiplied by (y) the aggregate
Participation Payment payable for the Participation Period as determined
above.

 



 

(f) _Tax Treatment of Participation Payments_. The parties acknowledge and
agree that the Participation Payments will result in the transaction being
treated as a contingent payment installment sale within the meaning of IRS
Treasury Regulation 15A.453-1(c), except to the extent that the respective
Sellers elect out.

 



 

2.6 **_Escrow_**. The parties hereto shall enter into the Escrow Agreements as
security for the Sellers indemnification obligations under _Article VIII_,
subject to the continuation or extension thereof if a claim for indemnity has
been filed prior to the expiration of such period and such claim remains
unresolved as of the date such Escrow Agreement would have expired in the
absence of an indemnity claim, or as otherwise set forth in the Escrow
Agreements. The Escrow Amount shall be subject to release from the Escrow
Account in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

2.7 **_Allocation of Aggregate Purchase Price_**. The allocation of the
Purchase Price shall be determined by Purchaser and Sellers in good faith and
set forth on _Schedule 2.7_ attached hereto. Purchaser and each Seller agree:
(i) to report the sale of the Purchased Assets for federal and state Tax
purposes in accordance with the allocations set forth on _Schedule 2.7_
hereto; and (ii) not to take any position inconsistent with such allocations
on any of their respective Tax Returns. Any adjustments to the Purchase Price,
including but not limited to purchase price adjustments or adjustments related
to Participation Payments shall, to the extent practical, be allocated to the
specific asset to which they relate, or, alternatively, be allocated to the
residual category of goodwill as reasonably determined in good faith by
Purchaser and Sellers.

 



 

2.8 **_Purchase of International Exploitation Rights_**. The parties
acknowledge and agree that: (i) immediately prior to and conditioned upon the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (A) the Sanuk
License Agreement shall be terminated and of no further force and effect, and
(B) Sellers hereby grant to Deckers Bermuda a perpetual, royalty-free,
exclusive right and license to use, exploit and derive economic benefit from

transfer and sale to Purchaser of all of CandCs and Sanuks right, title, and
interest in and to the Sanuk Intellectual Property and the CandC

at the Closing, Deckers Bermuda shall pay the amount set forth in _Schedule
2.8_ , which amount shall be determined prior to Closing, in consideration of
the acquisition of the International Exploitation Rights from Sellers and the
related Assumed Contracts related to such International Exploitation Rights.

 



 

2.9 **_Closing Costs; Transfer Costs; Taxes and Fees_**. Purchaser shall be
responsible for the timely payment of all sales, use, value added,

2.11 **_Working Capital Adjustment_**.

 



 

(a) Not more than 10 business days prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers and
the Purchaser will work in good faith to estimate the difference, if any, of
the "Specified Assets" over the "Specified Liabilities" (each such term
defined in _Schedule 2.11_ attached hereto) with respect to the Sellers, on a
consolidated basis, as of the Closing Date (such difference shall be referred
to herein as the **"Working Capital"** ). The estimate of the Working Capital
with respect to the Sellers (hereinafter referred to as the **"Estimated
Working Capital"** ) shall be prepared in good faith in accordance with the
methodology set forth in the sample pro forma Working Capital calculation
prepared by the Sellers and Purchaser and attached to this Agreement as
_Schedule 2.11_ (the **"Sample Working Capital Calculation"** ). At the
Closing, the Purchase Price will be adjusted on a dollar-for-dollar basis as
follows: if Estimated Working Capital exceeds $11,700,000 (the **"Budget
Working Capital"** ), then the Purchase Price will be increased by the amount
of such excess; if Estimated Working Capital is less than Budget Working
Capital, then the Purchase Price will be decreased by the amount of such
deficiency. By way of example, _Schedule 2.11_ sets forth a balance sheet for
the Sellers, on a consolidated basis, and a calculation of Working Capital as
calculated therefrom.

 



 

(b) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser will prepare and deliver
to each Seller: (i) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Sellers, as
of the Closing Date (the **"Closing Balance Sheet"** ); and (ii) a statement
setting forth Working Capital, as determined by reference to the Closing
Balance Sheet (such statement shall be referred to herein as the **"Working
Capital Statement"** ). The Closing Balance Sheet and Working Capital
Statement shall be prepared in conformity with GAAP, applied in a manner
consistent with that used by the Sellers (as applicable) in accordance with
the Sample Working Capital Calculation, and shall present fairly the balance
of the Specified Assets and Specified Liabilities as of the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) Each Seller will have a period of 30 days after its receipt of the Closing
Balance Sheet and Working Capital Statement to review such items and
Purchasers calculation of Working Capital, and to notify Purchaser of any
disputes with respect thereto (the **"Review Period"** ). As part of such
review, each Seller and its advisors will have reasonable access during normal
business hours to Purchasers work papers and to the preparers of the Closing
Balance Sheet and to the books and records on which the Closing Balance Sheet
is based.

 



 

(d) Prior to the expiration of the Review Period, each Seller shall notify
Purchaser of any objections or proposed changes to the Working Capital
Statement or the Closing Balance Sheet (a " **Dispute Notice** ") and the
parties shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to resolve any dispute. If
a Seller fails to so notify Purchaser of any objections or proposed changes
within the Review Period, if each Seller notifies Purchaser that he has no
objections or proposed changes to any of such items, or if each Seller and
Purchaser agree in writing on the resolution of all such objections or changes
within 30 days following delivery to Purchaser of such objections or proposed
changes, the Closing Balance Sheet and the Working Capital Statement, with any
changes as may be agreed upon in writing, shall be final and binding. If the
parties are unable to resolve such dispute within 30 days after Purchaser
receives such Dispute Notice, then Purchaser and the applicable Seller shall
jointly select an independent accounting firm of recognized national or
regional standing who is not then rendering services to the Purchaser or any
of the Sellers to resolve any disagreements. If the applicable Seller and

 



      
 

 



 

Purchaser are unable to jointly select such independent accounting firm within
ten (10) Business Days after the expiration of the Review Period, each of
Purchaser, on the one hand, and the applicable Seller, on the other hand,
shall select an independent accounting firm of recognized national or regional
standing and each such selected independent accounting firm shall select a
third independent accounting firm of recognized national or regional standing
who is not rendering services to the Purchaser or any of the Sellers (such
selected independent accounting firm whether pursuant to this or the preceding
sentence, the " **Arbiter** "). Each of Purchaser and each applicable Seller
will be afforded the opportunity to present to such Arbiter any material
related to the determination and to discuss the determination with such
Arbiter. The determination by such Arbiter will be conclusive and binding upon
the parties. The applicable Sellers and Purchaser will share the fees and
expenses of such Arbiter equally.

 



 

(e) If the Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to _Section
2.11(c)_ and _Section 2.11(d)_ (the **"Final Working Capital"** ) is less
than Estimated Working Capital (the **"Overpayment"** ), then within five
Business Days of determination of the Final Working Capital, the Sellers shall
remit the amount of the Overpayment to Purchaser, with each Seller paying such
amount according to the instructions set forth on _Schedule 2.5_. If the Final
Working Capital is greater than Estimated Working Capital (the
**"Underpayment"** ), then within five Business Days of determination of the
Final Working Capital, Purchaser shall pay to the Sellers the amount of the
Underpayment in cash, for distribution to the Sellers according to the
instructions set forth on _Schedule 2.5_.

There are no liens for Taxes upon or affecting any of the CandC Purchased

companies, or other arrangements or contracts to which CandC is a party and that

(b) CandC has not requested any extension of time within which to file any Tax
Return, which Tax Return has not since been filed, or except as set forth in

assessment of Taxes. CandC has not received any notice of deficiency or
assessment from any federal, state, local or foreign taxing authorities with
respect to liabilities for Taxes which have not been fully paid or finally
settled, and any such deficiency or assessment shown in _Section 3.15(b)_ of
the Disclosure Schedule is being contested in good faith through appropriate
proceedings. Further, to the Knowledge of the CandC Sellers, no state of facts
exists or has existed which would constitute grounds for the assessment of any
liability for Taxes with respect to the periods prior to the Closing Date that
have not been audited by any taxing authority. Neither the executive officers
of CandC nor the CandC Sellers are aware of any information that has caused or
should cause them to believe that an audit by any Tax authority may be
forthcoming. No claim has ever been made by an authority in a jurisdiction
where CandC does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to taxation
by that jurisdiction.

paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent

foreign law), (B) as a transferee or successor, (C) by contract, or (D)
otherwise.

 



 

(e) CandC has not filed and will not file prior to the Closing a consent under
Code § 341(f). CandC is not obligated to make any payments, and is not a party
to any agreement that under certain circumstances could obligate it to make
any payments that will not be deductible under Code § 162 or § 280G whether
paid prior to or after the Closing. Prior to the Closing, CandC will not have
experienced a change of ownership within the meaning of Code Section 382. CandC
is not and has not been a United States real property holding corporation
within the meaning of Code § 897(c)(2).

any collective bargaining agreement with any labor organization, group or
association covering any of its employees, and to the Knowledge of the CandC
Sellers, there are no attempts to organize any of CandCs employees by any
Person, unit or group seeking to act as their bargaining agent. CandC has
complied in all material respects with all applicable laws relating to the
employment of labor, including provisions thereof relating to wages, hours,
equal opportunity, collective bargaining, discrimination against race, color,
national origin, religious creed, physical or mental disability, sex, age,

withholding and payment of social security and other taxes. There are no
pending or, to the Knowledge of the CandC Sellers, threatened charges (by

of unfair labor practices or of employment discrimination or of any other
wrongful action with respect to any aspect of employment of any person
employed or formerly employed by CandC, and there is no investigation of CandCs

in 2010 (if applicable) and the current rate of pay for each such person on
the date of this Agreement. Except as set forth in _Section 3.17_ of the
Disclosure Schedule, none of such persons has an employment agreement or
understanding or commitment, whether oral or written, with CandC that is not
terminable within 30 days on notice by CandC without cost or other liability to
CandC. Except as set forth in _Section 3.17_ of the Disclosure Schedule or in

bonuses payable to employees, consultants, or contractors of CandC in connection
with the Business of CandC for services performed on or prior to the date hereof

as set forth in _Section 3.18_ of the Disclosure Schedule, no additional
Permits are necessary to enable CandC to conduct the CandC Business as presently
conducted, except such Permits the failure of which to obtain would not have a
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the execution, delivery nor performance of
this Agreement nor the mere passage of time (except as specifically noted in
_Section 3.18_ of the Disclosure Schedule) will have any effect on the
continued validity or sufficiency of the Permits (except for such Permits that
expire according to their terms). There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of

reflected in the Sanuk Financial Statements are sufficient for payment in full
of all unpaid Taxes (whether or not currently known or disputed) through the
date thereof. Sanuk has not incurred any liability for Taxes since the date of
the Sanuk Financial Statements other than in the Ordinary Course of Business.
There are no liens for Taxes upon or affecting any of the Sanuk Purchased
Assets. There are no joint ventures, partnerships, limited liability
companies, or other arrangements or contracts to which Sanuk is a party and
that could be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Except
as set forth in _Section 4.15(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, Sanuk has never
had a "permanent establishment" in any foreign country, as such term is
defined in any applicable Tax treaty or convention between the United States
and such foreign country, nor has it otherwise taken steps that have exposed,
or will expose, it to the taxing jurisdiction of a foreign country.

 



 

(b) Sanuk has not requested any extension of time within which to file any Tax
Return, which Tax Return has not since been filed, or except as set forth in
_Section 4.15(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, waived any statute of
limitations for, or agreed to any extension of time with respect to, the
assessment of Taxes. Sanuk has not received any notice of deficiency or
assessment from any federal, state, local or foreign taxing authorities with
respect to liabilities for Taxes which have not been fully paid or finally
settled, and any such deficiency or assessment shown in _Section 4.15(b)_ of
the Disclosure Schedule is being contested in good faith through appropriate
proceedings. Further, to the Knowledge of the Sanuk Sellers, no state of facts
exists or has existed which would constitute grounds for the assessment of any
liability for Taxes with respect to the periods prior to the Closing Date that
have not been audited by any taxing authority. Neither the executive officers
of Sanuk nor the Sanuk Sellers are aware of any information that has caused or
should cause them to believe that an audit by any Tax authority may be
forthcoming. No claim has ever been made by an authority in a jurisdiction
where Sanuk does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to taxation
by that jurisdiction.

 



 

(c) Sanuk has withheld and paid all Taxes required to have been withheld and
paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent
contractor, creditor, stockholder, or other third party.

 



 

(d) Except as set forth in _Section 4.15(d)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, Sanuk
does not have any liability for the Taxes of any other Person (A) under
Treasury Regulations § 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or
foreign law), (B) as a transferee or successor, (C) by contract, or (D)
otherwise.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Sanuk has not filed and will not file prior to the Closing a consent under
Code § 341(f). Sanuk is not obligated to make any payments, and is not a party
to any agreement that under certain circumstances could obligate it to make
any payments that will not be deductible under Code § 162 or § 280G whether
paid prior to or after the Closing. Prior to the Closing, Sanuk will not have
experienced a change of ownership within the meaning of Code Section 382.
Sanuk is not and has not been a United States real property holding
corporation within the meaning of Code § 897(c)(2).

 



 

4.16 **_Labor and Employment Relations_**. To the Knowledge of Sanuk and the
Sanuk Sellers, no officer, executive or other employees of Sanuk has expressed
any intention not to become an employee of Purchaser if Purchaser offers such
officer, executive or employee employment. Sanuk is not a party to or bound by
any collective bargaining agreement with any labor organization, group or
association covering any of its employees, and to the Knowledge of the Sanuk
Sellers, there are no attempts to organize any of Sanuks employees by any
Person, unit or group seeking to act as their bargaining agent. Sanuk has
complied in all material respects with all applicable laws relating to the
employment of labor, including provisions thereof relating to wages, hours,
equal opportunity, collective bargaining, discrimination against race, color,
national origin, religious creed, physical or mental disability, sex, age,
ancestry, medical condition, marital status or sexual orientation, and the
withholding and payment of social security and other taxes. There are no
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Sanuk Sellers, threatened charges (by
employees, their representatives or Governmental and Regulatory Authorities)
of unfair labor practices or of employment discrimination or of any other
wrongful action with respect to any aspect of employment of any person
employed or formerly employed by Sanuk, and there is no investigation of
Sanuks employment policies or practices by any Governmental or Regulatory
Authority pending or, to the Knowledge of the Sanuk Sellers, threatened.

 



 

4.17 **_Certain Employees_**. Set forth in _Section 4.17_ of the Disclosure
Schedule is a list of the names of Sanuks employees and consultants as of the
date hereof involved in the management and operation of the Business of Sanuk,
together with the title or job classification of each such person and the
total compensation (with wages and bonuses, if any, separately detailed) paid
in 2010 (if applicable) and the current rate of pay for each such person on
the date of this Agreement. Except as set forth in _Section 4.17_ of the
Disclosure Schedule, none of such persons has an employment agreement or
understanding or commitment, whether oral or written, with Sanuk that is not
terminable within 30 days on notice by Sanuk without cost or other liability
to Sanuk. Except as set forth in _Section 4.17_ of the Disclosure Schedule or
in the Sanuk Financial Statements, as of the date hereof, all commissions and
bonuses payable to employees, consultants, or contractors of Sanuk in
connection with the Business of Sanuk for services performed on or prior to
the date hereof have been paid in full and there are no outstanding
agreements, understandings or commitments of Seller with respect to any
commissions, bonuses or increases in compensation.

 



 

4.18 **_Permits_**. _Section 4.18_ of the Disclosure Schedule contains a true
and complete list of all Permits used in and material, individually or in the
aggregate, to the Business of Sanuk or the Sanuk Purchased Assets. All such
Permits are currently effective and valid and have been validly issued. Except
as set forth in _Section 4.18_ of the Disclosure Schedule, no additional
Permits are necessary to enable Sanuk to conduct the Sanuk Business as
presently conducted,

 



      
 

 



 

except such Permits the failure of which to obtain would not have a Material
Adverse Effect. Neither the execution, delivery nor performance of this
Agreement nor the mere passage of time (except as specifically noted in
_Section 4.18_ of the Disclosure Schedule) will have any effect on the
continued validity or sufficiency of the Permits (except for such Permits that
expire according to their terms). There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of
Sanuk and the Sanuk Sellers, threatened Action or Proceeding by any
Governmental or Regulatory Authority that could affect the Permits or their
sufficiency for the current conduct of Sanuks Business. Sanuk has provided
Purchaser with true and complete copies of all Permits listed in _Section
4.18_ of the Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

4.19 **_Brokers_**. Except for Moss Adams Capital, the fees of which will be
paid by CandC, the CandC Sellers, Sanuk or the Sanuk Sellers, neither the Sanuk
Sellers nor Sanuk has retained any broker in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereunder. Purchaser has, and will have, no obligation to pay any
brokers, finders, investment bankers, financial advisors or similar fee in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby by
reason of any action taken by or on behalf of the Sanuk Sellers or Sanuk.

 



 

4.20 **_Accounts Receivable_**. Except as set forth in _Section 4.20_ of the
Disclosure Schedule, all of Sanuks accounts receivable that are reflected on
the Sanuk Financial Statements and the accounts receivable arising after the

Receivable"** ): (i) have arisen from bona fide transactions entered into by
Sanuk involving the sale of products actually made or services actually
performed in the Ordinary Course of Business; and (ii) constitute valid
accounts receivable. There are no refunds, discounts, rights of setoff or
assignment affecting any such Sanuk Accounts Receivable that are not reflected
on the Sanuk Financial Statements or, with respect to Sanuk Accounts
Receivable arising after the date of the Sanuk Interim Financial Statements,
on the accounting records of Sanuk. The allowance for doubtful accounts
reflected in the Sanuk Financial Statements or, with respect to Sanuk Accounts
Receivable arising after the date of the Sanuk Interim Financial Statements on
the accounting Books and Records of Sanuk, have been determined in accordance
with GAAP. The Sanuk Sellers have provided to Purchaser a complete and
accurate list of all Sanuk Accounts Receivable as of the date of the Sanuk
Financial Statements, which list sets forth the aging of such Sanuk Accounts
Receivable.

 



 

4.21 **_Inventory_**. The materials, supplies and work-in-process included in
the inventory of Sanuk are, and at the Closing will be, as the case may be:
(i) substantially equivalent in quality and quantity, subject to seasonality,
to the materials, supplies and work-in-process, and additions thereto,
generally included in such inventory of Sanuk in the past; and (ii) suitable
for the manufacture and distribution of Sanuk products in a manner
substantially equivalent in quality to that achieved generally by Sanuk in the
past.

provide such Seller with any records or other information that may be relevant
to such return, audit or examination, proceeding or determination; and (iii)
provide any Seller with any final determination of any such audit or
examination, proceeding, or determination that affects any amount required to
be shown on any tax return of a Seller for any period. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Purchaser shall each retain, until the applicable
statutes of limitations (including any extensions) have expired, copies of all
tax returns, supporting work schedules, and other records

 



      
 

 



 

or information that may be relevant to such returns for all tax periods or
portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date and shall not destroy or
otherwise dispose of any such records without first providing the Sellers with
a reasonable opportunity to review and copy.

 



 

(c) **_Employee Matters_**. Subject to the condition that the Closing occurs,
Purchaser shall offer to employ, immediately following the Closing Date, each
of the employees of each Seller (including those employees, if any, on sick
leave or short-term leave of absence as of the Closing) on terms and with
employee benefits that are no less favorable to such employee than such
employee currently enjoys as an employee of a Seller. Each offer of employment
shall be made on or prior to the Closing Date for employment beginning the
next business day after the Closing. Effective upon, and subject to, the
Closing, each Seller shall terminate the employment of each employee of such
Seller. The employment of each employee of Sellers who accepts Purchasers
offer of employment (each, a **"Continuing Employee"** ) will be on an "at
will" basis and will be on terms and conditions including benefits comparable
to those set forth on _Section 3.8_ of the Disclosure Schedule (with respect
to CandC) and _Section 4.8_ of the Disclosure Schedule (with respect to Sanuk)
for such Continuing Employee, other than Clark, Carr, Kelley and Kessler, who
will be offered employment contracts. With respect to employee Plans and other
fringe benefits provided by the Purchaser to Continuing Employees after the
Closing: (i) the Purchaser shall provide that service with a Seller will be
credited as service for purposes of the Purchasers Plans, policies, programs,
agreements and arrangements, and will be recognized for purposes of
participation, eligibility and vesting under the Purchasers Plans, policies,
programs, agreements and arrangements; and (ii) the Purchaser will, subject to
the coverage restrictions of the Purchasers benefit providers, cause its
benefit providers to waive all waiting periods and pre-existing condition
requirements for any Continuing Employee under the Purchasers Plans for any
co-payments or deductibles actually paid by such employees under the Sellers
plans during the calendar year in which the Closing occurs. CandC shall
terminate the employment contract with Kelley effective at or prior to the
Closing. Purchaser does not assume, and each Seller shall be fully responsible
for the payment of, any severance or other benefits related to or payable upon
the termination of any of such Sellers employees including, without
limitation, any Continuing Employee who fails to accept Purchasers employment
offer. Each Seller shall cooperate with Purchasers efforts to employ and
retain the employees of such Seller. Each Seller shall be responsible for
compliance with all laws related to the termination by a Seller of such
Sellers employees. Each Seller shall give any notices required by Law and
take whatever other actions with respect to such Sellers Benefit Plans as may
be necessary to carry out the terms and conditions of this _Section 7.2(c)_.

 



 

(d) **_Collection of Accounts Receivable_**. Except as otherwise provided for
in this Agreement, at the Closing, Purchaser will acquire hereunder, and
thereafter Purchaser or its designee shall have the right and authority to
collect for Purchasers or its designees account, all receivables, letters of
credit and other items which constitute a part of the Purchased Assets, and
each Seller shall within five business days after receipt of any payment in
respect of any of the foregoing, properly endorse and deliver to Purchaser any
letters of credit, documents, cash or checks received on account of or
otherwise relating to any such receivables, letters of credit or other items.
Each Seller shall promptly transfer or deliver to Purchaser or its designee
any cash or other property that such Seller may receive in respect of any
deposit, prepaid expense, claim, contract, license, lease, commitment, sales
order, purchase order, letter of credit or receivable of any character, or any
other item, constituting a part of the Purchased Assets.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) **_HSR Filing_**. As promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, the Purchaser will, in cooperation with each Seller, complete and
file with the appropriate Governmental and Regulatory Authority the pre-merger
notification forms and any other documents required under the HSR Act.
Purchaser shall pay all filing fees due from the parties in connection with
compliance with the HSR Act.

 



 

(f) **_Reasonable Best Efforts_**. Between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing, each of Parent and Purchaser shall use their reasonable best efforts
to cause the conditions in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.3_ to be satisfied
as promptly as practicable.

 



 

(g) **_Participation Payments_**. Each of Parent and Purchaser hereby
covenants and agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts with respect to
the operation of the Business following the Closing, including but not limited
to decisions relating to issues arising, if any, with respect to the presence,
if any, in any of the Sellers products of any substance identified in
_Schedule 7.3_ of this Agreement, and agrees not to act in bad faith with
respect to attaining any Gross Profit Dollars for the purpose of reducing the
potential Participation Payments as contemplated by this Agreement. From and
after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall maintain a financial reporting system
that will be sufficient to permit it to determine the EBITDA and Gross Profit
of the consolidated Business, the Participation Payment Income Statement and,
consequently, the amount of Participation Payments payable, if any, pursuant
to _Section 2.5_.

 



 

(h) **_Email Addresses_**. The Purchaser agrees that Clark, Carr, Kelley and
Kessler shall retain any and all interests and rights to their respective
email addresses dacc@cctraders.com, dac.clark@cctraders.com,
paulc@cctraders.com, paul.carr@cctraders.com, jeff@sanuk.com, and
ian@sanuk.com, so long as such persons are employed or engaged as an employee
or service provider of Purchaser or its Affiliates.

 



 

(i) **_Most Favored Status; Friends and Family_**. After the Closing,
Purchaser shall provide each of the CandC Sellers, the Sanuk Sellers and Daniel
P. Murphy ("collectively, the **"F andF Beneficiaries"**) with the right and
ability to order Purchasers products on a "most favored" basis, "friends and
family" status, or other similar program. Specifically, for the five (5) year
period following the Closing, Purchaser shall make available to each FandF
Beneficiary the right to order up to Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000) per year in
Purchaser products at the wholesale cost of such products. Such products shall
not be for purposes of commercial distribution.

 



 

7.3 **_Restricted Substances Policy_**. Sellers acknowledge and understand
that Purchaser has a restricted substances policy that Purchaser previously
has made available to the Sellers (the " **Purchaser Restricted Substances
Policy** "). Prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall obtain reports from its
factories responsible for at least 80% of its production regarding such
factories use, with respect to materials sourced directly by such factories
and currently used in the manufacture of Sellers products, of any substances
that are listed in Purchaser Restricted Substances Policy. Sellers, together
with Purchaser, shall set forth in _Schedule 7.3_ substances found, if any,
that Sellers and Purchaser agree are not in compliance with the Purchaser
Restricted Substances Policy. In the event that any substances are set forth
in _Schedule 7.3_ , then Purchaser shall have the right to reduce the
Participation Payments owed to the Sellers at the end of the 2011
Participation Period and the 2012 Participation Period as follows:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) _2011 Participation Payment_. The 2011 Participation Payment shall be
reduced by an amount equal to the reduction of 2011 Gross Profit Dollars
caused by Lost Sales; _provided_ , _however_ , that: (i) there shall be no
reduction if the 2011 Gross Profit Dollars equals or exceeds $36,700,000 (the
" **2011 Gross Profit Dollar Base** "); and (ii) the amount of any such
reduction shall in no event exceed an amount equal to the 2011 Gross Profit
Dollar Base less the amount of the 2011 Gross Profit Dollars.

 



 

By way of example only and assuming that the 2011 EBITDA exceeds $15,500,000
which would provide for a 2011 Participation Payment of the $30,000,000
maximum:

 



 

(i) If the 2011 Gross Profit Dollars are $35,000,000 and there is a $1,700,000
reduction of 2011 Gross Profit Dollars caused by Lost Sales, then the 2011
Participation Payment shall be reduced by $1,700,000, from $30,000,000 to
$28,300,000.

 



 

(ii) If the 2011 Gross Profit Dollars are $35,000,000 and there is a $500,000
reduction of 2011 Gross Profit Dollars caused by Lost Sales, then the 2011
Participation Payment shall be reduced by $500,000, from $30,000,000 to
$29,500,000.

 



 

(iii) If the 2011 Gross Profit Dollars are $35,000,000 and there is a
$2,000,000 reduction of 2011 Gross Profit Dollars caused by Lost Sales, then
the 2011 Participation Payment shall be reduced by $1,700,000, from
$30,000,000 to $28,300,000.

 



 

(iv) If the 2011 Profit Dollars are $36,800,000 and there is a $2,000,000
reduction of 2011 Gross Profit Dollars caused by Lost Sales, then there would
be no reduction to the 2011 Participation Payment which would remain at
$30,000,000.

 



 

(b) _2012 Participation Payment_. Purchaser shall have the right to reduce the
2012 Participation Payment by an amount equal to the reduction of 2012 Gross
Profit Dollars caused by Lost Sales; _provided_ , _however_ , that: (i) there
shall be no reduction if the 2012 Gross Profit Dollars equals or exceeds
$46,900,000 (the " **2012 Gross Profit Dollar Base** "); and (ii) the amount
of any such reduction shall in no event exceed an amount equal to the 2012
Gross Profit Dollar Base less the amount of the 2012 Gross Profit Dollars. In
addition, to the extent that the 2011 Participation Payment was reduced
pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_ above, and the 2012 Gross Profit Dollars exceed
the 2012 Gross Profit Dollar Base, then Sellers shall have the right to
receive back an amount of the reduction to the 2011 Participation Payment up
to a maximum of the difference between (i) the 2012 Gross Profit Dollars,
minus (ii) the 2012 Gross Profit Dollar Base.

 



 

By way of example only:

 



 

(i) If the 2012 Gross Profit Dollars are $46,000,000 and there is a $1,700,000
reduction of 2012 Gross Profit Dollars caused by Lost Sales, then the 2012
Participation Payment shall be reduced by $900,000, from $23,828,000 to
$22,928,000.

 



 

(ii) If the 2012 Gross Profit Dollars are $50,000,000 and there is a
$3,000,000 reduction of 2012 Gross Profit Dollars caused by Lost Sales, then
there would be no reduction of the 2012 Participation Payment and the 2012
Participation Payment would remain at

 



      
 

 



 

$25,900,000. In addition, to the extent that there was a reduction of the 2011
Participation Payment in the amount of $500,000 based upon the example set
forth in clause (ii) of _Section 7.3(a)_ above, then Sellers would have the
right to receive back the entire $500,000.

 



 

(iii) If the 2012 Gross Profit Dollars are $40,000,000 and there is a
$5,000,000 reduction of 2012 Gross Profit Dollars caused by Lost Sales, the
2012 Participation Payment shall be reduced by $5,000,000, from $20,720,000 to
$15,720,000.

 



 

(c) _Definition of Lost Sales_. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary
in this _Section 7.3_, no sale is "lost" and no account shall have a "lost
sale" unless and until an account: (i) failed to meet or exceed Sellers 2011
or 2012 (as the case may be) financial projections for such account; and (ii)
canceled, failed to place a fill in order for, or failed to re-order product
as a result of Sellers use, if any, of any substance that may be set forth in
_Schedule 7.3_. In such event, " **Lost Sales** " shall mean, with respect to
the Business:

 



 

(i) for 2011, orders for products that are canceled and any 2011 fill-in
orders that based on the Sellers financial projections for such product are
not placed, in both cases as a result of Sellers use, if any, of any
substance that may be set forth in _Schedule 7.3_ (collectively, " **Canceled
Orders** "), which Canceled Orders are not replaced by another product, or if
replaced by another product then the deficit, if any, between the Canceled
Order and the replacement order; provided, in no event shall the Lost Sales
amount exceed the difference between 2011 actual total sales for such account
and Sellers 2011 projected sales for such account; and

 



 

(ii) for 2012, orders for products that are not placed in 2012 as a result of
Sellers use, if any, of any substance that may be set forth in _Schedule 7.3_
(" **2012 Non-Placed Order(s)** "), that are not replaced by another product,
or if replaced by another product then the deficit, if any, between the 2012
Non-Placed Order and the replacement order. For purposes of this provision,
the amount of the 2012 Non-Placed Orders shall be calculated by multiplying
the combined amount of the 2011 placed and Canceled Orders times the Sellers
projected growth rate for the account from 2011 to 2012. In no event shall the
Lost Sales amount exceed the difference between 2012 actual total sales for
such account and Sellers 2012 projected sales for such account.

 



 

7.4 **_Sanuk Lease Payments_**. Purchaser shall reimburse Sanuk for the amount
of its lease payment and related expenses in the amount set forth in Section
4.9 of the Disclosure Schedule (the " **Lease Payment** ") with respect to the
condominium in which its offices are located as set forth in Section 4.9 of
the Disclosure Schedule. Purchaser shall reimburse Sanuk for the amount of
such Lease Payment for a period of 18 months following the Closing Date, and
for such length of time (if any) that Purchaser may elect to extend the
Sublease Agreement. The Lease Payment by Purchaser to Sanuk shall be due and
payable on the first day of each calendar month.

advantage of such tax benefit, and shall seek recovery under any insurance
policies of Purchaser and any affiliate or subsidiary as such insurance

time to time may change its address, facsimile number or other information for
the purpose of notices to that party by giving notice specifying such change

9.4 **_Entire Agreement_**. This Agreement (and all Exhibits and Schedules
attached hereto) and the Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement between
the parties dated September 22, 2010 supersedes all prior discussions and
agreements among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
contains the sole and entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect
thereto.

 



 

9.5 **_Waiver_**. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any
time by the party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such waiver
shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly executed by
or on behalf of the party waiving such term or condition. No waiver by any
party hereto of any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one or more
instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or any
other term or condition of this Agreement on any future occasion. All
remedies, either under this Agreement or by law or otherwise afforded, will be
cumulative and not alternative.

 



 

9.6 **_Amendment_**. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified
only by a written instrument duly executed by or on behalf of each party
hereto.

 



 

9.7 **_No Third Party Beneficiary_**. The terms and provisions of this
Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of each party hereto and their
respective successors or permitted assigns, and it is not the intention of the
parties to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other Person other
than any Person entitled to indemnity under _Section 8.2_.

 



 

9.8 **_No Assignment; Binding Effect_**. Neither this Agreement nor any right,
interest or obligation hereunder may be assigned by any party hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto and any attempt to do so
will be void, except that any partys rights to indemnification under _Article
VIII_ may be freely assigned. This Agreement is binding upon, inures to the
benefit of and is enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns.

 



 

9.9 **_Headings_**. The headings used in this Agreement have been inserted for
convenience of reference only and do not define or limit the provisions
hereof.

 



 

9.10 **_Severability_**. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future law, and if the
rights or obligations of any party hereto under this Agreement will not be
materially and adversely affected thereby: (i) such provision will be fully
severable; (ii) this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such
illegal,

 



      
 

 



 

invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof; (iii)
the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and
effect and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision or by its severance herefrom; and (iv) in lieu of such illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision, there will be added automatically as a
part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in
terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible
and mutually acceptable to the parties herein.

 



 

9.11 **_Governing Law_**. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of California applicable to contracts
executed and performed in such State, without giving effect to conflicts of
laws principles.

 



 

9.12 **_Arbitration and Venue_**. Any controversy or claim arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the making, performance or interpretation
thereof (except for disputes regarding the determination of Closing Working
Capital, which shall be decided as provided in _Section 2.11_) shall be
submitted to arbitration in San Diego County, California, pursuant to the
commercial arbitration rules and procedures of the American Arbitration
Association before a panel of three arbitrators, unless the parties are able
to agree on the selection of a single arbitrator. In the absence of such
agreement within ten (10) days after the initiation of an arbitration
proceeding, Sellers shall select one arbitrator and Purchaser shall select one
arbitrator, and those two arbitrators shall then select, within ten (10) days,
a third arbitrator. If those two arbitrators are unable to select a third
arbitrator within such ten (10) day period, a third arbitrator shall be
appointed by the commercial panel of the American Arbitration Association. The
decision in writing of at least two of the three arbitrators shall be final
and binding upon the parties. The arbitrator(s) decision shall provide a
reasoned basis for the resolution of each dispute and for any award. The
ruling of the arbitrator(s) shall be final, and judgment thereon may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction. If any question is submitted to a
court of law for resolution, then the Superior Court of the County of San
Diego or the United States District Court having jurisdiction in the County of
San Diego shall be the exclusive court of competent jurisdiction for the
resolution of such question. Each party will bear one half of the cost of the
arbitration filing and hearing fees, and the cost of the arbitrator. Each
party will bear its own attorneys fees, unless otherwise decided by the
arbitrator. The parties understand and agree that the arbitration shall be
instead of any civil litigation and that the arbitrators decision shall be
final and binding to the fullest extent permitted by law and enforceable by
any court having jurisdiction thereof. Each party shall be entitled to pre-
hearing discovery as provided in California Code of Civil Procedure Section
1283.05.

 



 

9.13 **_Consent to Jurisdiction and Forum Selection_**. The parties hereto
agree that all actions or proceedings arising in connection with this
Agreement shall be initiated and tried exclusively in the State and Federal
courts located in the County of San Diego, State of California. The
aforementioned choice of venue is intended by the parties to be mandatory and
not permissive in nature, thereby precluding the possibility of litigation
between the parties with respect to or arising out of this Agreement in any
jurisdiction other than that specified in this _Section 9.13_. Each party
hereby waives any right it may have to assert the doctrine of forum non
conveniens or similar doctrine or to object to venue with respect to any
proceeding brought in accordance with this paragraph, and stipulates that the
State and Federal courts located in the County of San Diego, State of
California shall have in personam jurisdiction and venue over each of them for
the purposes of litigating any dispute, controversy or proceeding arising out
of

 



      
 

 



 

or related to this Agreement. Each party hereby authorizes and accepts service
of process sufficient for personal jurisdiction in any action against it as
contemplated by this _Section 9.13_ by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested, postage prepaid, to its address for the giving of notices
as set forth in this Agreement, or in the manner set forth in _Section 9.3
_of this Agreement for the giving of notice. Any final judgment rendered
against a party in any action or proceeding shall be conclusive as to the
subject of such final judgment and may be enforced in other jurisdictions in
any manner provided by law.

 



 

9.14 **_Disclosure Schedules_**. The disclosures in any section or subsection
of the Disclosure Schedules shall qualify other sections and subsections of
the representations and warranties contained in _Article III_ and _Article
IV_ to the extent it is clear from a reading of the disclosure that such
disclosure is applicable to such other sections and subsections. Any
disclosure in the Disclosure Schedules also shall be deemed disclosure under
any other section of the Disclosure Schedules that contains an appropriate
cross-reference thereto. Disclosure of any matter in the Disclosure Schedules
shall not constitute an expression of a view that such matter is material or
is required to be disclosed pursuant to this Agreement. To the extent that any
representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement is qualified by the
materiality of the matter(s) to which the representation or warranty relates,
the inclusion of any matter in the Disclosure Schedules does not constitute a
determination by any of the Sellers that any such matter is material. The
disclosure of any information concerning a matter in the Disclosure Schedules
does not imply that any other, undisclosed matter that has a greater
significance or value is material.

 



 

9.15 **_Expenses_**. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the CandC
Sellers, the Sanuk Sellers, Purchaser and Parent shall pay their own expenses
and costs incidental to the preparation of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements and to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby.

 



 

9.16 **_Construction_**. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed in
favor of or against any party on the ground that such party or its counsel
drafted the provision. Any remedies provided for herein are not exclusive of
any other lawful remedies that may be available to either party. This
Agreement shall at all times be construed so as to carry out the purposes
stated herein.

 



 

9.17 **_Counterparts_**. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by facsimile, each of which will be deemed an original, but
all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.

 



 

9.18 **_Parent Guaranty_**. Parent hereby absolutely and unconditionally
guarantees the full and prompt payment and performance of all obligations of
the Purchaser arising under this Agreement. Parent waives: (i) any right to
require any of the Sellers, the Sanuk Sellers or the CandC Sellers to proceed
against Purchaser or any other person or entity; and (ii) presentment, demand,
protest and notice of any kind.
