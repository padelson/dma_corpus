otherwise cause the Subject Shares to be counted as present thereat for
purposes of establishing a quorum.

of, the execution of the Merger Agreement by Navy, Red Lion and Penny, and
that such irrevocable proxy is given to secure the performance of the duties
of such Stockholder under this Agreement. Each Stockholder hereby further
affirms that such proxy is irrevocable and is coupled with an interest
sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power and may under no
circumstances be revoked. Such proxy is executed and intended to be

purposes or as charitable gifts or donations where the transferee or third
party agrees in writing to be bound by the terms hereof), or create or permit
to exist any Liens, proxies, voting trusts or agreements, options, rights,
understandings or arrangements or any other encumbrances whatsoever on title,

with its other obligations under this Agreement, other than any restrictions

contract, option or other agreement, arrangement or understanding inconsistent
with the terms of this Agreement with respect to any transfer of Subject
Shares or any interest therein; (iii) grant or permit the grant of any proxy,
power of attorney or other authorization in or with respect to the Subject
Shares relating to the subject matter hereof; (iv) deposit or permit the
deposit of the Subject Shares into a voting trust or enter into a voting
agreement or arrangement with respect to the Subject Shares; or (v) take or
permit any other action that would in any way restrict, limit or interfere
with the performance of its obligations hereunder or the transactions
contemplated hereby (any of the actions set forth in clauses (i) through (v)
above, and any conversion, exchange or other disposition of the Subject Shares
in a transaction related to an Acquisition Proposal being referred to in this
Agreement as a " _Transfer_ "). Any action taken in violation of the foregoing
sentence shall be null and void _ab initio_. To the extent the a Stockholders

transferee) shall take and hold such Subject Shares subject to all of the
restrictions, liabilities and rights under this Agreement, which shall
continue in full force and effect until the valid termination of this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 1.3 _Non-Solicitation_. Without limitation to Section 6.4 of the
Merger Agreement, each Stockholder agrees not to, and to direct and use
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage (including by way of
furnishing confidential information) any third party to make an Acquisition
Proposal or assist any third party in preparing or soliciting an offer
relating in any way to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that
consistent with the provisions of Section 2.12 below, nothing herein shall
limit or prohibit any Stockholder or any of its Representatives, in his or her
capacity as an officer or director of Penny, from taking any action or failing
to take any action in such capacity. Each Stockholder shall, and shall direct
and use reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with
any person conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

Section 1.4 _Documentation and Information_. Each Stockholder (i) consents to
and authorizes the publication and disclosure by Navy, Red Lion or Penny of
Stockholders identity and holding of Subject Shares, and the nature of its
commitments, arrangements and understandings under this Agreement (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, the disclosure of this Agreement), in any press
release, the Proxy Statement, the Form S-4 and any other disclosure document
required in connection with the Merger Agreement, the Merger and any
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and (ii) agrees to give to
Navy as promptly as practicable any information related to the foregoing that
Navy may reasonably require for the preparation of any such disclosure

as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to refer to and include the Subject

(b) an Injunction, restraining such breach or threatened breach. No party or
any other person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or
similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any
remedy referred to in this Section 2.11, and each party irrevocably waives any
right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such
