 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

  

 ** **

  

 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER** (the " _Agreement_ "), dated as of
September 15, 2009, by and among **Adobe Systems Incorporated** , a
corporation organized under the laws of Delaware (" _Parent_ "), **Snowbird
Acquisition Corporation** , a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent (" _Purchaser_ "), and **Omniture, Inc.**, a corporation
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware (" _Company_ ").

  



  

 **WHEREAS** , the boards of directors of each of Parent, Purchaser and
Company have approved the acquisition of Company by Parent on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement;

  



  

 **WHEREAS** , pursuant to this Agreement, and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, Purchaser shall (and Parent has agreed to cause
Purchaser to) commence a tender offer (the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all of
Companys issued and outstanding common stock, par value $0.001 per share ("
_Company Common Stock_ "), at a price per share of $21.50 net to the Company
Stockholders in cash (such amount or any greater amount per share paid
pursuant to the Offer being hereafter referred to as the " _Offer Price_ ");

  



  

 **WHEREAS** , following consummation of the Offer, upon the terms and
conditions set forth herein, Purchaser will be merged with and into Company,
with Company as the surviving corporation (the " _Merger_ " and, with the
Offer, the " _Transaction_ "), whereby each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock not owned directly or indirectly by Parent, Purchaser or
the Company will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in
cash;

  



  

 **WHEREAS** , the Company Board has unanimously (A) (i) determined that this
Agreement, the Offer and the Merger are advisable and in the best interests
of Company and the Company Stockholders, (ii) approved the Offer and the
Merger and approved and declared advisable this Agreement, each in accordance
with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_
") and (B) resolved and agreed to recommend that the Company
Stockholders accept the Offer, tender their shares of Company Common Stock
into the Offer, and if required by applicable Law, adopt this Agreement;

  



  

 **WHEREAS** , as an inducement and condition to Parent entering into this
Agreement, certain Company Stockholders and the directors of Company are
entering into tender and stockholder support agreements (collectively, the "
_Support Agreements_ ") with Parent and Purchaser simultaneously with the
execution of this Agreement, whereby, among other things, such stockholders
have agreed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein,
to tender the shares of Company Common Stock held by such stockholders (in
their individual capacities) in the Offer and to support the actions
necessary to consummate the Merger;

  



  

 **WHEREAS,** concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
and as a material inducement to Parents willingness to enter into this
Agreement, certain employees of Company are countersigning and delivering to
Parent offer letters previously delivered to such employees by Parent;

  



        
   

  



  

 **WHEREAS,** concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
and as a material inducement to Parents willingness to enter into this
Agreement, certain employees of the Company are executing and delivering to
Parent non-competition agreements; and

  



  

 **WHEREAS** , the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties
and agreements in connection with the Transaction and to prescribe certain
conditions to the Transaction.

  



  

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

  



  

# **ARTICLE I   THE OFFER**

  

# ** **

  

 **1.1 ****_The Offer._**

  

## ** **

  

### (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in
accordance with Article IX hereof, and provided that Company has fulfilled
its obligation to provide information to Parent and Purchaser as contemplated
by Section 1.1(c) and is prepared to file the Schedule 14D-9
contemporaneously with or immediately following filing by Parent and
Purchaser of the Offer Documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the " _SEC_ "), subject to there being no statute, rule, regulation,
legislation of, or order, decree, judgment, injunction or ruling by, a
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction enjoining,
restraining, making illegal, or otherwise prohibiting the commencement of the
Offer, as promptly as reasonably practicable (but in no event later than
seven (7) Business Days) after the date of this Agreement, Purchaser shall
(and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence (within the meaning of Rule
14d-2 of the Exchange Act) an offer to purchase all outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock at the Offer Price. Each of Parent and Purchaser shall
use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Offer, subject to the terms
and conditions hereof. Subject to the applicable terms and conditions of this
Agreement and to the satisfaction or waiver of the Tender Offer Conditions,
Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, promptly after the
expiration of the Offer, accept for payment and pay for (after giving effect
to any required withholding Tax pursuant to _Section 1.1(f)_), all shares of
Company Common Stock validly tendered pursuant to the Offer and not withdrawn
(the time and date of acceptance for payment, the " _Acceptance Date_ ").

  

### 

  

### (b) Purchaser reserves the right to waive, in whole or in part, any
Tender Offer Condition or modify the terms of the Offer; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that without the prior written consent of Company, or except as
contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser shall not, and Parent shall not
permit Purchaser to, other than in accordance with Section 1.1(e), decrease
the Offer Price or change the form of consideration payable in the Offer,
waive or amend the Minimum Condition, decrease the number of shares of
Company Common Stock sought to be purchased in the Offer, extend the Offer
other than in a manner pursuant to, and in accordance with, this _Section
1.1(b)_, impose additional conditions to the Offer, amend any of the Tender
Offers Condition, in a manner that broadens such conditions or amend any
other term of the Offer in any manner adverse to the Company Stockholders.
The Offer shall remain open until 12:00 midnight, New York City, New York
time, on the date that is twenty (20) Business Days

  



        
   

  



  

### after the commencement (determined pursuant to Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the
Exchange Act) of the Offer (the " _Expiration Date_ "), unless Purchaser
shall have extended the period of time for which the Offer is open pursuant
to, and in accordance with, the succeeding sentence, in which event the term
"Expiration Date" shall mean the latest time and date as the Offer, as so
extended, may expire. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, (i) Purchaser shall (and Parent shall
cause Purchaser to) extend the Offer for any period required by any
rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff or the
Nasdaq that is applicable to the Offer and (ii) in the event that any of
Tender Offer Conditions are not satisfied or waived as of any then-
scheduled Expiration Date, Purchaser shall extend the Offer for successive
extension periods of ten (10) Business Days; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) of this sentence, in
no event shall Purchaser be required to extend the Offer beyond the
Outside Date. Purchaser may provide for a subsequent offering period (within
the meaning of Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act), and one or more
consecutive extensions thereof, after the Expiration Date in accordance with
Rule 14d-11 of not more than twenty (20) Business Days in the aggregate.
 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Offer, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) accept for
payment, and promptly pay for, all shares of Company Common Stock validly
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to such subsequent offering period.
Nothing contained in this paragraph shall affect any termination rights of
the parties in Article IX. Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to
any scheduled Expiration Date without the prior written consent of
the Company except in the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 9.1_.

  

### 

  

### (c) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Purchaser shall
(i) file or cause to be filed with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "
_Schedule TO_") with respect to the Offer which shall contain the offer to
purchase and related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement and
other ancillary documents and instruments required thereby pursuant to which
the Offer will be made (collectively with any supplements or amendments
thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "), and (ii) use their respective reasonable
best efforts to cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to the Company
Stockholders as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act.  Parent and
Purchaser shall cause the Offering Documents to comply in all material
respects with the Exchange Act and all other requirements of Law. Company and
its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Offer Documents prior to their filing with the SEC, and Parent and
Purchaser shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments
made by Company and its counsel. Parent and Purchaser agree to provide
Company with (i) any comments or other communications, whether written or
oral, that may be received from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Offer Documents promptly after receipt thereof and prior to responding
thereto, and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to provide comments on that
response (to which reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given)
and to participate in such response, including by participating in any
discussions with the SEC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection
with any action by Parent or Purchaser in response to or as a result of any
action by Company or the Company Board permitted by Section 7.2(e), Parent
and Purchaser shall not be required to provide Company the opportunity to
review or comment on (or include comments proposed by Company in any
provision of) the Offer Documents, or any amendment or supplement thereto,
with respect to such action, the reasons for such actions or any additional
information reasonably related to such actions. If at any time prior to the

  



        
   

  



  

### Effective Time, any information relating to the Offer, the Merger,
Company, Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates, is
discovered by Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Offer Documents, so that the Offer Documents shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Company
Stockholders, as and to the extent required by applicable Law or any
applicable rule or regulation of any stock exchange. Company shall furnish
to Parent and Purchaser all information concerning Company required by
the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents.

  

### 

  

### (d) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser on a timely
basis the funds necessary to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock that
Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer and shall cause
Purchaser to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (e) The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect
of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common
Stock), cash dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to the
Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the
date of acceptance of any particular shares tendered in the Offer or any
subsequent offering period provided for by Parent and the Purchaser pursuant
to Section 1.1(b). In addition, if the aggregate of (without duplication) (i)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding, plus
(ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise
of outstanding derivative securities, including warrants and other
convertible or exchangeable securities or rights to purchase Company Common
Stock, plus (iii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock (x) issuable
upon the exercise of Company Stock Options, (y) subject to Company SARs and
(z) subject to Company RSUs, all as of September 11, 2009, exceeds
91,855,809, then Parent and Purchaser may reduce the Offer Price by an amount
not to exceed the product of (A) the Offer Price immediately before such
reduction, multiplied by (B) the quotient of (i) such excess, divided by
(ii)(A) 91,855,809 plus (B) the amount of such excess (such reduction in the
Offer Price, a " _Capitalization Adjustment_ "). The Company agrees that upon
a Capitalization Adjustment, the Company Board shall reaffirm the Company
Recommendations giving effect to such Capitalization Adjustment, and the
Company Board shall not effect an Adverse Recommendation Change as a result
of such Capitalization Adjustment. Each of Parent, Purchaser and Company
shall amend and supplement the Offer Documents and Schedule 14D-9 as promptly
as practicable to reflect such Capitalization Adjustment.

  

### 

  

### (f) Each of Purchaser and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the Offer Price to any holder of a Certificate or a Book-
Entry Share, as the case may be, such amounts as it reasonably determines

 **1.3 _Directors._**

  

## ** **

  

### (a) Subject to compliance with applicable Laws, promptly upon acceptance
for payment of such number of shares of Company Common Stock as represents at
least a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer and from time to time thereafter, Purchaser shall be
entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole
number, on the Company Board as is equal to the product of (x) the total
number of directors on the Company Board (determined after giving effect to
the election of any additional directors pursuant to this _Section
1.3_) multiplied by (y) the percentage that the

  



        
   

  



  

### aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates bears to the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock then outstanding, and Company shall, upon request of
Purchaser, promptly take all actions necessary to cause Purchasers designees
to be so elected (including, if necessary, seeking the resignations of one or
more existing directors or increasing the size of the Company Board) in
compliance with applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Purchaser
shall be entitled to designate at least a majority of the directors on the
Company Board (as long as Purchaser and its Affiliates beneficially own a
majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock); provided further
that prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall always have at
least two members who are not officers, directors, employees or designees of
Parent or Purchaser or any of their Affiliates (" _Purchaser Insiders_ "). If
the number of directors who are not Purchaser Insiders is reduced below two
prior to the Effective Time, the remaining director who is not a Purchaser
Insider shall be entitled to designate a Person to fill such vacancy who is
not a Purchaser Insider and who shall be a director not deemed to be a
Purchaser Insider for all purposes of this Agreement, and Company shall cause
such designee to be appointed to the Company Board. If,
notwithstanding compliance with the foregoing provisions, the number of
directors who are not Purchaser Insiders is reduced to zero, then the other
directors on the Company Board shall designate and appoint to the Company
Board two directors who are not officers, directors, employees or otherwise
affiliated with Purchaser or Parent (other than as a result of such
designation).

  

### 

  

### (b) Companys obligations to appoint Purchasers designees to the Company
Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
thereunder. Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to such
Section and Rule in order to fulfill its obligations under this _Section
1.3_, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect
to Company and its officers and directors as is required under such Section
and Rule in order to fulfill its obligations under this _Section 1.3_.
Parent will supply to Company any information with respect to itself and its
Affiliates required by such Section and Rule.

  

### 

  

### (c) Following the election or appointment of Purchasers designees
pursuant to this _Section 1.3_ and prior to the Effective Time, any
amendment or termination of this Agreement by Company, any extension by
Company of the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of Parent or Purchaser hereunder, any waiver or enforcement of any of
Companys rights or any of the obligations of Parent or Purchaser hereunder
will require the consent of, or be taken at the direction of, a majority of
the directors of Company then in office who are not Purchaser Insiders (or
the approval or direction of the sole director if there shall only be one
director then in office who is not a Purchaser Insider). Following the
election or appointment of Parents designees pursuant to this _Section 1.3_
and prior to the Effective Time, any actions with respect to the enforcement
of this Agreement by Company shall be effected only by the action of a
majority of the directors of Company then in office who are not Purchaser
Insiders (or the action of the sole director if there shall only be one
director then in office who is not a Purchaser Insider), and such
authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Company Board and no
other action on the part of Company, including any action by any other
director of Company, shall be required to authorize any such action.

  



         
 

  



  

(d) Promptly after the Acceptance Date, Company shall take all action
necessary to elect to be treated as a "controlled company" as defined by

 **1.4** ** ****_Top-Up Option._**

  



  

(a) Company hereby grants to Purchaser an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up
Option_ "), exercisable only on the terms and conditions set forth in this
_Section 1.4_, to purchase at a price per share equal to the Offer Price
paid in the Offer up to that number of newly issued shares of Company Common
Stock (the " _Top-Up Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of shares of
Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company
Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Parent or Purchaser at the time
of exercise of the Top-Up Option, shall constitute one share more than 90% of
the sum of the following: (A) the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Shares plus
(B) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock that are issuable
within the ten (10) Business Days after the issuance of the Top-Up Shares
upon the vesting, conversion or exercise of all derivative securities,
including Company Compensatory Awards, warrants, options, convertible or
exchangeable securities or other rights to acquire Company Common Stock,
regardless of the conversion or exercise price or other terms and conditions
thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , (A) the Top-Up Option shall not be
exercisable for a number of shares of Company Common Stock in excess of the
sum of the shares of Company Common Stock authorized, unissued and not
reserved for Company Compensatory Awards or held by the Company at the time
of exercise of the Top-Up Option; _provided_ , _further_ ,  _however_ , that
the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable unless, immediately after such
exercise and the issuance of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant thereto,
the Short Form Threshold would be reached. Upon Parents request, Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its transfer agent to certify in
writing to Parent the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option and
after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Shares.  The Top-Up Option
shall be exercisable only once at any time following the Acceptance Date and
prior to the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time and (b) the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

  



  

(b) The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance and delivery of
the Top-Up Shares comply with all applicable Law, including compliance with
an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Shares under the
Securities Act.  If Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Purchaser
shall give Company one (1) Business Day prior written notice, specifying (i)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by
Parent or Purchaser at the time of such notice and (ii) a place and a time
for the closing of such purchase. Company shall, as soon as practicable
following receipt of such notice, deliver written notice to Purchaser
specifying, based on the information provided by Purchaser in its notice, the
number of Top-Up Shares.  At the closing of the purchase of Top-Up Shares
(A), the purchase price owed by Purchaser to Company therefor shall be paid
to Company (i) in cash, by wire transfer or cashiers check, (ii) by issuance
by Purchaser to Company of a promissory note, bearing 3.5% per annum simple
interest, due thirty (30) days after the Effective

  



        
   

  



  

Time or (iii) a combination thereof, and with such other terms reasonably
satisfactory to Company and Purchaser, and (B) Company shall cause to be
issued and delivered to Purchaser a certificate or certificates representing
the Top-Up Shares or, if Company does not then have certificated shares of
Company Common Stock, the applicable number of Book-Entry Shares.

  



  

(c) Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that the shares of Company Common Stock
that Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent
and Purchaser represent and warrant to Company that Purchaser is, or will be
upon the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, an "accredited investor", as defined
in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Purchaser agrees that
the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the
Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Purchaser for the purpose of
investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any
distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act).
Any certificates evidencing Top-Up Shares may include any legends required
by applicable securities laws.

 **ARTICLE III  EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF SHARES**

  



  

 **3.1** ** ****_Conversion of Capital Stock. _**

  



  

As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any party hereto or of the holder of any shares of the capital
stock of Company or capital stock of Purchaser:

  



  

(a) Capital Stock of Purchaser. Each share of the common stock, $0.0001
par value per share, of Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Common Stock_ "), issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock,
$0.0001 par value per share of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b) Cancellation of Certain Stock. All shares of Company Common Stock that
are owned by Company or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of Company, and any
shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Purchaser or by any wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent or Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

(c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
(x) shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 3.1(b)_ and (y)
Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive
an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Offer Price per share (the
" _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of
Company Common Stock, when converted as provided in this _Section 3.1(c)_,
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (each, a " _Certificate_ "
and collectively, the " _Certificates_ ") or book-entry share (each, a "
_Book-Entry Share_ " and collectively, the " _Book-Entry Shares_ ")
representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
in accordance with _Section 3.2_.

  



  

(d) The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the
effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common
Stock), cash dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to the
Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time.

  



  

 **3.2** ** ****_Exchange of Certificates._**

  



  

The procedures for exchanging outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for
the Merger Consideration are as follows:

  



  

(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) designate, or
cause to be designated, a bank or trust company that is reasonably acceptable
to Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") and (ii) enter into a paying agent
agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Company, with such
Paying Agent to act as agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration.
Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent funds in an amount sufficient to make the
payments contemplated by _Section 3.1_ in accordance with the procedures
set forth in _Section 3.2(b)_ (such funds, the

  



        
   

  



  

" _Exchange Fund_ "). In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to
make all such payments, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be
deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount that is equal
to the deficiency in the amount of funds required to make such payments.
 The Paying Agent shall make payments of the aggregate Merger
Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement. The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

  



  

(b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Paying Agent to promptly mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were converted
pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates, shall pass
only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof
pursuant to _Section 3.2(h)_ hereof) to the Paying Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent and Company may mutually
agree or the Paying Agent may reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange
for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Share, as applicable, for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with
such letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or
such Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash
equal to the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company
Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate or such Book-Entry
Share, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall
immediately be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of Company,
payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate or such Book-Entry Share is presented to the Paying Agent,
accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such
transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.2_, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or accrue on
any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

  



  

(c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. The Merger
Consideration delivered upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been delivered (and
paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
Common Stock, and from and after the Effective Time the stock transfer books
of Company shall be closed and thereafter, there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Article III.

  



        
   

  



  

(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent,
upon demand, and any holder of a Certificate or a Book-Entry Share who has
not previously complied with this _Section 3.2_ prior to the end of
such six (6) month period shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment
of its claim for the Merger Consideration.

  



  

(e) No Liability. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, none of Parent,
Purchaser, Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent or any of
their respective Affiliates shall be liable to any Person in respect of
Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official pursuant to the
requirements of any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  



  

(f) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by
the U.S. or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full
faith and credit of the U.S., in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or

Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding

no gain or loss thereon or income or loss generated thereby shall affect
the amounts payable by Parent and Purchaser to Company Stockholders pursuant
to this Article III. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income
produced by, such investments, shall be placed in the Exchange Fund and any
amounts in excess of the amounts payable to Company Stockholders shall be
payable to Parent.

  



  

(g) Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
Merger Consideration, or consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of a Certificate, a Book-Entry Share or a Company
Stock Option, as the case may be, such amounts as it reasonably determines
that it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any other applicable provision of Law.  To the
extent that amounts are so withheld and paid to the appropriate Governmental
Authority by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the
case may be, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
Certificate, Book-Entry Share, or Company Stock Option, as applicable, in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

  



  

(h) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent the posting by
such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation
may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  



        
   

  



  

 **3.3** ** ****_Appraisal Rights._**

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares
(the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by
Company Stockholders who, in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the "
_Appraisal Rights Provisions_ "), (i) have not voted in favor of adopting
this Agreement, (ii) shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal for
such shares, (iii) have otherwise complied in all respects with the Appraisal
Rights Provisions, and (iv) have not effectively withdrawn, lost or failed to
perfect their rights to appraisal (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ "), will
not be converted into the Merger Consideration, but at the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and shall represent the
right to receive only those rights provided under the Appraisal Rights
Provisions; _provided_ , _however_ , that all shares of Company Common Stock
held by Company Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who
effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such
shares of Company Common Stock under the Appraisal Rights Provisions shall
thereupon be deemed to have been cancelled and to have been converted, as of
the Effective Time, into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
relating thereto, without interest, in the manner provided in _Sections
3.1_ and _3.2_.

  



  

(b) Company shall give Parent and Purchaser prompt notice of any demands
received by Company for the exercise of appraisal rights with respect to
shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands
subject, prior to the Effective Time, to consultation with Company. Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

  



  

 **3.4** ** ****_Treatment of Options, SARs, Restricted Stock and other
Equity Awards._**

  



  

(a) Except as set forth in this _Section 3.4(a)_ or in _Section 3.4(a)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, on the Acceptance Date and without any
action on the part of the holders thereof, Parent shall cause each Company
Stock Option, Company SAR, Company RSU and other equity-based award granted
under the Company Specified Plans and denominated in shares of Company Common
Stock that is not a Company Restricted Stock Award (each such award, a "
_Company Specified Plan Award")_ that is outstanding as of immediately prior
to the Acceptance Date, whether or not then vested or exercisable, to be
assumed by Parent and converted automatically on the Acceptance Date into an
option, stock appreciation right, restricted stock unit award or other
equity-based award, as the case may be, denominated in shares of Parent
Common Stock and which will have the same terms and conditions as those of
the related Company Specified Plan Award except that (i) the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock subject to each such award shall be determined by
multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Specified Plan Award as of immediately prior to the Acceptance Date
by a fraction (the "Specified _Award Exchange Ratio_ "), the numerator of
which is the Offer Price and the denominator of which is the closing price of
Parent Common Stock on The NASDAQ Global Select Market on the Acceptance Date
(rounded

  



        
   

  



  

down to the nearest whole share) and (ii) if applicable, the exercise or
purchase price per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded upwards to the
nearest whole cent) shall equal (x) the per share exercise or purchase price
for the shares of Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such
Company Specified Plan Award as of immediately prior to the Acceptance Date
divided by (y) the Specified Award Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , _however_
, that in no case shall the exchange of a Company Stock Option be performed
in a manner that is not in compliance with the adjustment requirements of
Section 409A of the Code; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the case of any
assumed Company Stock Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by
reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the per share
exercise price of the option, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
subject to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such
option shall be determined in order to comply with Section 424 of the Code
and satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code and Treasury
Regulation Section 1.424-1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless determined
otherwise by Parent and notice is provided to the Company at least twenty
(20) days prior to the Acceptance Date, each Company Specified Plan Award
that is held by a person who is not an employee of, or a consultant to, the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company as of the Acceptance Date (the "
_Cashed Out Specified Plan Awards_ ") shall not be assumed by Parent pursuant
to this _Section 3.4_ and shall, as of immediately prior to the Acceptance
Date, be cancelled, extinguished and automatically converted into the right
to receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x)
the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable
upon exercise or settlement of such Cashed Out Specified Plan Award
immediately prior to the Acceptance Date and (y) the Offer Price less any per
share exercise price of such Cashed Out Specified Plan Award. In the event
any Cashed Out Specified Plan Award is subject to Section 409A of the
Code, the payment of the amount of cash with respect thereto shall be delayed
to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code.

  



  

(b) Except as otherwise set forth in this _Section 3.4(b)_ or in _Section
3.4(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, at the Effective Time and without
any action on the part of the holders thereof, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause each Company Stock Option, Company SAR, Company RSU and other
equity-based award granted under any Company Stock Option Plan other than the
Company Specified Plans (each, a " _Company Remaining Plan_ ") and
denominated in shares of Company Common Stock that is not a
Company Restricted Stock Award (each such award, a " _Company Remaining Plan
Award,_ " and any such award or any Company Specified Plan Award being
referred to herein as a " _Company Compensatory Award_ ") that is outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or
exercisable, to be assumed by Parent and converted automatically at the
Effective Time into an option, stock appreciation right, restricted stock
unit award or other equity-based award, as the case may be, denominated in
shares of Parent Common Stock and which will have the same terms and
conditions as those of the related Company Remaining Plan Award except that
(i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such award
shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Remaining Plan Award as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time by a fraction (the " _Remaining Plan Award Exchange Ratio_
"), the numerator of which is the per share Merger Consideration and the
denominator of which is the average closing price of Parent Common Stock on
The NASDAQ Global Select Market for the five (5) trading days immediately
preceding the Closing Date (rounded down to the nearest whole share) and (ii)
if applicable, the

  



        
   

  



  

exercise or purchase price per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded upwards
to the nearest whole cent) shall equal (x) the per share exercise or purchase
price for the shares of Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant
to such Company Remaining Plan Award as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time divided by (y) the Remaining Plan Award Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that in no case shall the exchange of a Company Stock Option
be performed in a manner that is not in compliance with the
adjustment requirements of Section 409A of the Code; _provided_ , _further_
, that in the case of any assumed Company Stock Option to which Section
421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422
of the Code, the per share exercise price of the option, the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock subject to such option and the terms and conditions
of exercise of such option shall be determined in order to comply
with Section 424 of the Code and satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a)
of the Code and Treasury Regulation Section 1.424-1. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, unless determined otherwise by Parent and notice is provided to
the Company at least twenty (20) days prior to the Effective Time, each
Company Remaining Plan Award that is held by a person who is not an employee
of, or a consultant to, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company as of
the Effective Time (the " _Cashed Out Remaining Plan Awards_ ," and together
with the Cashed Out Specified Plan Awards, " _Cashed Out Compensatory Awards_
") shall not be assumed by Parent pursuant to this _Section 3.4_ and shall,
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, be cancelled, extinguished and
automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise or settlement of such
Cashed Out Remaining Plan Award immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(y) the per share Merger Consideration less any per share exercise price of
such Cashed Out Remaining Plan Award. In the event any Cashed Out Remaining
Plan Award is subject to Section 409A of the Code, the payment of the amount
of cash with respect thereto shall be delayed to the extent necessary to
comply with Section 409A of the Code.

  



  

(c) At the Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, each Company Restricted Stock Award shall
automatically be cancelled, and each share of Company Common Stock subject to
a Company Restricted Stock Award shall be converted into the right to receive
an amount of cash equal to the per share Merger Consideration (" _Unvested
Cash_ "), which shall be subject to, and payable to the holder of such
Company Restricted Stock Award, in accordance with the vesting schedule
applicable to such Company Restricted Stock Award as in effect immediately
prior to Effective Time.

  



  

(d) Parent shall take such actions as are necessary for the assumption and
conversion of the Company Compensatory Awards pursuant to this _Section 3.4_
including the reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Common Stock as is
necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this _Section 3.4_.
As soon as reasonably practicable after the Acceptance Date (with respect to
any holder of a Company Specified Plan Award) or the Effective Time (with
respect to any holder of a Company Specified Plan Award), Parent shall
deliver to each holder of any such Company Compensatory Award an appropriate
notice setting forth such holders rights pursuant to such Company
Compensatory Award. Parent shall (i) prepare and file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise or vesting of the assumed Company
Specified Plan Awards promptly following the Acceptance Date (and in no event
later than five (5) Business

  



        
   

  



  

Days thereafter) and (ii) prepare and file with the SEC a registration
statement on Form S-8 with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable upon exercise or vesting of the assumed Company Remaining Plan
Awards promptly following the Effective Time (and in no event later than five
(5) Business Days thereafter), and, with respect to each of clause (i) and
(ii), shall maintain the effectiveness of each such registration statement
thereafter for so long as any such Company Compensatory Awards
remain outstanding.

  



  

(e) Prior to the Acceptance Date, the 2006 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
" _ESPP_ ") shall be terminated. The rights of participants in the ESPP
with respect to any offering period then underway under the ESPP shall be
determined by treating a Business Day to be determined by Company that is
prior to the Acceptance Date as the last day of such offering period and by
making such other pro-rata adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the
shortened offering period but otherwise treating such shortened offering
period as a fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes
under such ESPP. Prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company shall take all
actions (including, if appropriate, amending the terms of such the ESPP) that
are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this
_Section 3.4(e)_.

  



  

(f) Subject to Parents compliance with the preceding provisions of this
_Section 3.4_, the parties agree that, (i) following the Acceptance Date no
holder of a Company Specified Plan Award or any participant in any Company
Specified Plan shall have any right hereunder to acquire any Equity Interest
(including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) in the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, and (ii) following the
Effective Time, no holder of a Company Remaining Plan Award or any
participant in any Company Remaining Plan, or other Company Plan or employee
benefit arrangement of the Company or under any employment agreement shall
have any right hereunder to acquire any Equity Interest (including any
"phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) in the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

 **3.5** ** ****_Additional Benefits Matters._**

  



  

Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to effect the
transactions described in _Section 3.4(a)_ and _Section 3.4(c)_ pursuant to
the terms of the applicable Company Stock Option Plans and agreements
evidencing the Company Stock Options, Company SARs, Company RSUs and Company
Restricted Stock Awards. All amounts payable pursuant to _Section 3.4(a)_
shall be paid without interest, and no Unvested Cash or rights to receive any
payments (or any payment) pursuant to  _Section 3.4(a)_ or _Section 3.4(b)_
may be pledged, encumbered, sold, assigned or transferred (including any
transfer by operation of law), by any Person, other than Parent, or be taken
or reached by any legal or equitable process in satisfaction of any liability
of such Person, prior to the distribution to such Person of such payment
pursuant to _Section 3.4(a)_ or  _Section 3.4(b)_ in accordance with this
Agreement. Any payments made pursuant to _Section 3.4(a)_ or  _Section
3.4(b)_ shall be net of all applicable withholding taxes that Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be
required or otherwise permitted by applicable law to deduct and withhold from
the relevant Cashed Out Compensatory Award or Unvested Cash under the Code,
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of
applicable state, local or foreign law. To the extent that amounts

  



        
   

  



  

are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the Cashed Out Compensatory Award or Unvested Cash
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable, including taking all such further action as reasonably may be
necessary to (i) cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act
and the Antitrust Laws as promptly as reasonable practicable after the date
of this Agreement, (ii) to comply as promptly as practicable with any request
for additional information, documents or other materials received by Parent,
Purchaser or the Company, and (iii) to resolve such objections, if any, as
the United States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice, state antitrust enforcement authorities
or competition authorities of any other nation or other jurisdiction or any
other Person may assert under Regulatory Law with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so as to
enable the Closing to occur as soon as expeditiously possible. The parties
agree that the use of "reasonable best efforts" by Parent shall not require
Parent or Purchaser to propose, negotiate, commit to or effect, by consent
decree, hold separate order or otherwise, either of the following (each a "
_Burdensome Action_ ") (x) the sale, license, divestiture or disposition of,
or to hold separate, any product lines, assets or businesses of either party
or its Affiliates or (y) any restrictions or actions that after the Closing
Date would limit Parents or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporations) ownership, operation or freedom of action with respect to, or
its ability to retain, one or more of its or its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporations) businesses, product lines or assets. The parties
agree that the use of "reasonable best efforts" by either Parent or
Purchaser, on the one

### hand, or Company, on the other hand, shall not require Parent, Purchaser
or Company, as the case may be, or their respective Subsidiaries, to pay any
consideration to obtain a consent or suffer any loss, surrender any right or
incur any obligation in connection therewith. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Regulatory Law_ " means the Sherman Act of 1890, the
Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act
of 1914 and all other federal, state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations,
orders, decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines and other Laws,
including any antitrust, competition or trade regulation Laws that are
designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the
purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening
competition through merger or acquisition.

  

### 

  

### (b) Subject to and in furtherance of this  _Section 7.1_ , Parent and
Company shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent
practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, (i) in the case of
Parent, all the information relating to Company and any of its Subsidiaries
which appear in, and (ii) in the case of Company, all the information
relating to Parent and Purchaser and any of their Subsidiaries which is
required to complete, any filing made with, or written materials submitted
to, any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing
right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as
reasonably practicable.  The parties hereto agree that they will consult with
each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated herein.

  

### 

  

### (c) Parent and Company shall (i) promptly advise each other of (and
Parent or Company shall so advise with respect to communications received by
any Affiliate of Parent or Company, as the case may be) any written or oral
communication from any Governmental Authority or third party whose consent or
approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; (ii) to the extent practicable, not participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect
of any filing, investigation, or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it consults with the other
party in advance, and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend; and
(iii) promptly furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence,
filings, and written communications between them and their Subsidiaries
and Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or
its respective staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that materials may be
redacted (x) to remove references concerning the valuation of the businesses
of Company, (y) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (z)
as necessary to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns.
Neither Parent nor Company shall consent to any voluntary extension of any
statutory deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the behest
of any Governmental Authority without the consent of the other party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  



         
 

  

### 

  

### (d) Company agrees and acknowledges that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 7.1_ , in connection with any filing or submission
required, action to be taken or commitment to be made by Company, Parent, or
any of their respective Subsidiaries to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, neither Company nor any of Companys
Subsidiaries shall, without Parents prior written consent agree to any
Burdensome Action with respect to Company or its Subsidiaries; provided that
the foregoing shall not relieve any party of its obligations under this
Agreement.

  

### 

  

 **7.2 _No Solicitation._**

  

 ** **

  

### (a) Upon execution of this Agreement, Company and its Subsidiaries shall,
and Company shall cause its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to, cease
immediately and terminate any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any Person (other than Parent, its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives) conducted heretofore with respect to, or that
would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company
shall promptly after the date of this Agreement request in writing each such
Person which has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement relating to
an Acquisition Proposal with or for the benefit of the Company to promptly
return or destroy (which destruction, if provided for in such
confidentiality agreement, shall be certified in writing by such Person to
the Company) all information, documents, and materials relating to an
Acquisition Proposal (including all information relating to the Company or
its businesses, operations or affairs heretofore furnished by the Company or
any of its Representatives to such Person or any of its Representatives in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal) in each case, to the extent provided
in, and in accordance with the terms of, any confidentiality agreement with
such Person. Company shall not release any Person from, or waive any
provision of, any confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or under which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries has any such rights, and Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to enforce each such agreement at the request of
Parent.

  

### 

  

### (b) Except as permitted in this _Section 7.2_ , Company agrees that
neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall cause its and
their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit, or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate the
submission of any Acquisition Proposal or proposal or offer from any Person
(other than Parent or its Subsidiaries) that Company reasonably expects to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish any non-public information to,
or knowingly cooperate in any way with, any Person with the intent to
facilitate, an Acquisition Proposal or proposal or offer from any Person
(other than Parent or its Subsidiaries) that Company reasonably expects to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into any agreement, contract,
understanding, letter of intent or similar agreement related to an
Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement as contemplated
by _Section 7.2(c)_ ), or (iv) approve or recommend an Acquisition Proposal.

  

### 

  

### (c) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 7.2(b)_ , from
the date hereof and prior to the Acceptance Date, if Company or its
Representatives receive an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, constitutes, or is

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal, and which Acquisition
Proposal did not result from or arise in connection with a breach of this
_Section 7.2_ and was made after the date of this Agreement, Company may: (i)
furnish information to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal (a "
_Qualified Bidder_ ") and its Representatives, and (ii) engage in discussions
or negotiations with the Qualified Bidder and its Representatives with
respect to the Acquisition Proposal; provided that (y) Company first receives
from the Qualified Bidder an executed confidentiality agreement (the
confidentiality terms of which are no less favorable to Company than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement), and (z) concurrently with
furnishing any information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to, or engaging in discussions or negotiations with, such Qualified Bidder,
Company gives Parent written notice of the identity of such Qualified Bidder
and of Companys intention to furnish information to, or engage in
discussions or negotiations with, such Qualified Bidder and Company furnishes
such information to Parent (to the extent not previously furnished by Company
to Parent).

  

### 

  

### (d) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 7.2(e)_ , neither the
Company Board nor any committee of the Company Board may (A) fail to make in
the Schedule 14D-9, withdraw, modify, amend or qualify in any manner adverse
to Parent or Purchaser the Company Recommendations, (B) fail to recommend
against acceptance of any tender or exchange offer other than the Offer for
the Company Common Stock within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement
of such offer, or (C) (x) publicly announce such action or (y)
publicly recommend any Acquisition Proposal, it being understood, for the
avoidance of doubt, that neither the approval nor the delivery of a
Subsequent Determination Notice to Parent or Purchaser or public disclosure
thereof shall be deemed an Adverse Recommendation Change (any of the
foregoing in clauses (A) through (C), an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_
").

  

### 

  

### (e) (i) At any time prior to the Acceptance Date, if (A) there shall
occur or arise after the date of this Agreement a material development that
relates to Company and its Subsidiaries but does not relate to an Acquisition
Proposal and is not a change in the general prospects of Company and its
Subsidiaries (an " _Intervening Event_ ") and (B) Company did not have
knowledge, as of the date of this Agreement, that there was a reasonable
possibility that such Intervening Event would occur or arise after the date
of this Agreement, then the Company Board may take one or more of the actions
prohibited by _Section_ s _7.2(d)(A)_  or _Section 7.2(d)(C)(x)_ if the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with Companys
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would result in a
breach of the Company Boards fiduciary obligations under applicable Law.

  

### 

  

#### (ii) At any time prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company Board may in
response to a Superior Proposal (that has not been withdrawn) that did not
result from a breach by Company or any of its Representatives of this
_Section 7.2_ with respect to the Acquisition Proposal constituting or
resulting in the Superior Proposal, (i) effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change, or (ii) enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal (an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ") and simultaneously
terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.1(g)_  if the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with Companys outside
legal counsel and financial advisors, that failure to do so would result in a
breach of the Company Boards fiduciary obligations under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such action may only be taken at a time
that is (A) after the fourth

  



        
   

  

#### 

  

#### (4th) Business Day following delivery to Parent of a written notice from
Company that the Company Board intends to take such action if such proposal
remains a Superior Proposal (the " _Subsequent Determination Notice_ "),
which notice will specify the material terms of the applicable Superior
Proposal and identifying the Person making such Superior Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that any material amendment to such Superior Proposal,
including the financial terms of such Superior Proposal, shall require the
delivery of a new Subsequent Determination Notice and the commencement of an
additional three (3) day waiting period), and (B) at the end of any such
period referred to in clause (A), the Company Board determines in good faith,
after taking into account all amendments or revisions irrevocably committed
to by Parent and after consultation with the Company Boards outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, that such Superior Proposal remains
a Superior Proposal. During any period referred to in clause (A), Parent
shall be entitled to deliver to Company one or more counterproposals to such
Acquisition Proposal, and Company shall give Parent the opportunity to meet
with the Company and its Representatives, and at Parents request, shall
negotiate in good faith regarding the terms of any possible revisions to the
terms of this Agreement.

  

#### 

  

### (f) From and after the execution of this Agreement, Company shall notify
Parent promptly (but in any event no later than twenty-four (24) hours) of
the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any, proposal or expression of
interest that the Company reasonably expects to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal (including a summary of the material terms and conditions thereof,
including price, and the identity of the Person making any Acquisition
Proposal). Company shall promptly (but in any event no later than twenty-four
(24) hours) inform Parent of (i) any modification or proposed modification of
any such Acquisition Proposal or any such, proposal or expression of interest
and (ii) any meeting of the Company Board at which the Company Board is
reasonably expected to consider any Acquisition Proposal.

  

### 

  

### (g) Subject to compliance with _Section 7.2(e)_ , nothing in this
_Section 7.2_ shall be deemed to prohibit Company from complying with Rule
14e-2, Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal if, in the good faith
judgment of the Company Board or a committee of the Company Board, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, failing to take such action
would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law; provided,
however, that any statement or disclosure made by or on behalf of the Company
Board (other than a "stop, look and listen communication" of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, and within the
time period contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)(3)) shall be deemed to be an
Adverse Recommendation Change unless it is accompanied by a statement of the
Company Board expressly reaffirming the Company Recommendation in connection
with such statement or disclosure.

  

### 

  

### (h) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean
any proposal or offer from any Person (other than Parent or its Subsidiaries)
relating to, any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one
transaction or a series of transactions, of (i)(A) assets or businesses that
constitute 15% or more of the revenues, net income or assets of Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) 15% or more of any class of equity
securities of Company, (ii) any tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any Person or group (as defined under Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder)
beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of equity securities of Company,
or (iii) any

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, binding share exchange or similar
transaction involving Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to which
any Person or group (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder), would own (A) 15% or more of any class
of equity securities of Company or of any resulting parent company of Company
or (B) businesses or assets that constitute 15% or more of the revenues, net
income or assets of Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (i) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean
any _bona fide_  written Acquisition Proposal (with for these purposes (y)
the references to 15% in clauses (i)(A) and (iii)(B) of the definition of
Acquisition Proposal being treated as references to 50.1% and (z) the
references to 15% of any class of equity securities in clauses (i)(B), (ii)
and (iii)(A) being treated as references to 50.1% of the outstanding Company
Common Stock or the outstanding capital stock of any resulting parent company
of Company), which did not result from or arise in connection with a breach
of this _Section 7.2_ , made by a Person (other than Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries) that the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, is
reasonably capable of being consummated, and if consummated would be more
favorable to the Company Stockholders (in their capacity as such) than the
Offer and the Merger from a financial point of view, taking into account (A)
all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such Acquisition
Proposal, including the existence of financing conditions, the need for
financing, the conditionality of any financing commitments and the likelihood
and timing of consummation and (B) any adjustment to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement irrevocably committed to by Parent in response to such
Acquisition Proposal.

 **7.3 _Access to Information._**

  

 ** **

  

### (a) Upon reasonable prior notice and subject to applicable Laws relating
to the exchange of information, Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to use reasonable commercial efforts to (a) afford to the
officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other Representatives of
Parent, reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period
from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, or the date, if
any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_ , to all
of its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records (other than
confidential information contained in personnel files to the extent the
disclosure of such information is prohibited by privacy Laws), and subject to
receipt of their accountants consent, their accountants work papers and
(b) furnish Parent and Purchaser on a timely basis with such financial
and operating data and other information with respect to Company and
its Subsidiaries or with respect to actions relating to compliance with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby as Parent and
Purchaser may from time to time reasonably request.  Upon reasonable prior
notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, Company also shall provide Parent with such access to the
appropriate individuals (including management personnel,
attorneys, accountants and other professionals) for discussion of Companys
business, properties, prospects and personnel as Parent or Purchaser may
reasonably request. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or would
reasonably be expected to violate or result in a loss or impairment of any
attorney-client or work product privilege. The parties hereto will use
commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply. In furtherance of the foregoing, no information identifying
individual employees or consultants of Company or any Subsidiary of Company
or protected personal information regarding such employees or consultants
will be disclosed under this Agreement (including in the Company Disclosure
Schedule) in respect of employees or consultants that are employed (or were
employed and remain domiciled) in any country that has enacted legislation
implementing the EU Personal Data Privacy Directive or similar legislation,
except to the extent permitted by a contractual undertaking entered into by
Company and Parent regarding maintenance of privacy of such data in a form
reasonably necessary to effect compliance with such legislation.

  

### 

  

### (b) With respect to all information furnished by one party to the other
party or its Representatives under this Agreement, the parties shall comply
with, and shall cause their respective Representatives to comply with, all of
their respective obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

### 

  

 **7.4 _Employment and Benefit Matters._**

  

 ** **

  

### (a) Provision of Benefits. As of and for the twelve (12) month
period immediately following the Effective Time, Parent will either (a)
continue certain Company Plans, (b) permit Company Employees and, as
applicable, their eligible dependents, to participate in the employee benefit
plans, programs or policies (including without limitation any plan intended
to qualify within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code and any vacation,
sick, per personal time off plans or programs) of Parent, in each case on
terms substantially similar in the aggregate to those provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent, including with respect to geographical
location, or (c) a combination of clauses (a) and (b). To the extent Parent
elects to have Company Employees and their eligible dependents participate in
its employee benefit plans, program or policies following the Effective Time,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, treat, and cause
the applicable benefit plans in which Company Employees are entitled to
participate to treat, the service of Company Employees with the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company or predecessor employers attributable to any
period before the Effective Time as service rendered to Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting and for other appropriate benefits including
the applicability of minimum waiting periods for participation, but
excluding benefit accrual (including minimum pension amount), equity
incentive plans and eligibility for early retirement under any benefit plan
of Parent or eligibility for retiree welfare benefit plans or as would
otherwise result in a duplication of benefits. Without limiting the
foregoing, with respect to Company Employees who are employed by Parent or a
Subsidiary of Parent in the United States, Parent shall cause any pre-
existing conditions or (actively at work or similar) limitations,
eligibility waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements or
required physical examinations under any health or similar plan of Parent to
be waived with respect to Company Employees and their eligible dependents;
provided, however, that with respect to preexisting conditions, such
conditions shall be waived to the extent waived under the corresponding plan
in

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### which Company Employees participated immediately prior to the date
Company Employees and their eligible dependents are transitioned to Parents
health or similar plans. With respect to Company Employees who are employed
by Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent in the United States, Parent shall also
cause any deductibles paid by Company Employees under any of Companys or its
Subsidiaries health plans in the plan year in which the Acceptance
Date occurs (or the Closing Date occurs, if the Closing Date occurs in a
subsequent plan year and Company Employees and their eligible dependents are
not transitioned to Parents health or similar plans until such subsequent
plan year) to be credited towards deductibles under the health plans of
Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent. Except as otherwise required under
applicable Laws, Company Employees shall be considered to be employed
by Parent "at will" and nothing shall be construed to limit the ability of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation to terminate the employment of any such
Company Employee at any time.

  

### 

  

### (b) Company Plans. Effective as of the day immediately preceding the date
the Company becomes a member of the same Controlled Group of Corporations (as
defined in Section 414(b) of the Code) as Parent, Company shall terminate
each Company Plan that is intended to include a Code Section
401(k) arrangement maintained by Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a
" _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") (unless Parent provides written notice to the
Company at least five (5) Business Days prior to the date the Company will
become a member of the same Controlled Group of Corporations (as defined in
Section 414(b) of the Code) as Parent that a Company 401(k) Plan shall not be
terminated). Unless Parent provides any such written notice to Company,
Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such Company 401(k) Plan(s)
have been terminated (effective no later than the day immediately preceding
the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board. The form and
substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of
Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Company also shall take
such other actions in furtherance of terminating such Company Plan(s) as
Parent may reasonably require.  Company shall also make such amendments to
the Company 401(k) Plan(s) as requested by Parent at least fifteen (15)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Unless prohibited or limited
by applicable Law, if requested by Parent, Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to effect the timely, accurate and efficient
transfer of the Company Employees to Parents employee benefit plans and
programs.

  

### 

  

### (c) Company Employee Compensation. For a period of at least one (1) year
following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, compensate each Company Employee with a base salary or hourly
wage no less favorable than the base salary or hourly wage provided to the
Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided that
Parent may adjust such base salary or hourly wage to reasonably reflect any
change in responsibilities or based upon such Company Employees performance
following the Effective Time.

  

### 

  

### (d) No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Company and Parent acknowledge and agree
that all provisions contained in this _Section 7.4_ with respect to
employees are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties and
shall not create any right in any other Person, including any employees,
former employees, any participant in any Company Plan or any beneficiary
thereof or any right to continued employment with Company, Parent or any
Subsidiary of Company or Parent, shall be construed to establish, amend, or
modify a Company

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### Plan or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement nor
shall require Company or any Subsidiary of Company to continue or amend any
particular benefit plan after the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement for any employee or former employee of Company
or any subsidiary of Company, and any such plan may be amended or terminated
in accordance with its terms and applicable Law.

  

### 

  

 **7.5 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance._**

  

 ** **

  

### (a) Parent and Purchaser agree that any rights to indemnification or
exculpation now existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal
liability of each present and former director, officer, employee, fiduciary
or agent of Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ " and,
each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") provided for in the respective
organizational documents or in any indemnification agreements in effect as of
the date hereof, shall continue in full force and effect (and with respect to
Company and the Surviving Corporation, shall be reflected in the applicable
organizational documents of such entity), for a period of six (6) years after
the Acceptance Date. During such period, Parent shall not, nor shall it
permit the Surviving Corporation to, amend, repeal or otherwise modify such
provisions for indemnification in any manner that would affect the rights
thereunder of any individual who at any time on or prior to the Effective
Time was a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of Company or its
Subsidiaries in respect of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement),
unless such modification is required by Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made either prior to the
Effective Time or within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification
in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until disposition of
any and all such claims.  Any indemnification agreements with Indemnified
Parties in existence on the date of this Agreement shall be assumed by the
Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without any further action, and shall
survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms.

  

### 

  

### (b) Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Laws, indemnify and hold harmless, and, after the
Effective Time, Parent shall and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold
harmless, each present and former director or officer of Company and each
Subsidiary of Company and each such Person who served at the request of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, trustee, partner,
fiduciary, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or
enterprise (collectively, the " _Covered Parties_ ") against all costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts paid in connection with
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before
or after the Effective Time), whether civil, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to any action or omission in their capacities as
officers or directors, in each case occurring before the Effective Time
(including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).  Without
limiting the foregoing, to the extent not inconsistent with
the indemnification or exculpation agreements in place as of the date hereof,
in the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
(i) Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall be
entitled to control the defense of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### investigation, (ii) if Company or the Surviving Corporation does not
elect to control the defense of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, the Covered Party shall be entitled to select counsel for the
Covered Party, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to Company or
to the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, and Company or the
Surviving Corporation shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel
promptly after statements therefor are received (unless Company or the
Surviving Corporation shall elect to defend such action), (iii) the Covered
Party shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter, and (iv) neither
Company nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement
effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).

  

### 

  

### (c) Company shall maintain in effect from the date of this Agreement to
the Effective Time the current directors and officers liability insurance
policies maintained by the Company as of the date of this Agreement (the "
_Policies_ ").  Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to
maintain in effect for six (6) years from the Effective Time the Policies
(provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of
at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions that are no less
favorable) with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend pursuant to this _Section 7.5(c)_ more than
an amount per year equal to 250% of the current annual premiums paid by the
Company for the Policies; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the annual
premiums for the Policies exceed such amount or in the event of an
expiration, termination or cancellation of such Policies, the Surviving
Corporation shall be required to obtain as much coverage as is possible under
substantially similar policies for such maximum annual amount in aggregate
annual premiums. Parent and the Surviving Corporation may satisfy their
obligations under the first sentence of this _Section 7.5(c)_  by obtaining,
at or prior to the Effective Time, a prepaid (or "tail") directors and
officers liability insurance policy, in each case, the material terms of
which, including coverage, terms of coverage, amount and creditworthiness of
the issuer, are in effect and are no less favorable to such directors and
officers than the insurance coverage otherwise required under this _Section
7.5(c)_. In such event, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain
such "tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their
respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation under the second sentence of this _Section
7.5(c)_ for such six-year period; provided that in no event shall the
Surviving Corporation pay a premium for such "tail" policy that in the
aggregate exceeds 250%% of the last annual premium paid by the Company for
coverage for the period of twelve (12) months most recently commenced prior
to the date hereof.

_Section 7.5_ applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it
being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this _Section 7.5_
applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.5_ and shall be
entitled to enforce the covenants contained herein).

  

### 

  

### (e) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets, then, and in each such case,
to the

and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,

with respect to the Company, the notice required by clause (b) shall only be
required if as a result of such breach the conditions set forth in _Sections
(c)_ or _(d)_ of Annex I hereto would not be satisfied; _provided further_ ,
that with respect to Parent, the notice required by this clause (b) shall
only be required if such breach result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect;

to this _Section 7.7_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies

 **7.8 _Publicity._**

  



  

Except with respect to any action taken pursuant to, and in accordance with,

Parent nor Company shall, or shall permit any of its Subsidiaries to, issue
or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement
with respect to, or otherwise make any public statement concerning, the

retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this _Section 7.9_. Promptly

whether any plan, program, agreement or arrangement that Parent would like to
enter into, establish, amend or modify pursuant to which compensation is paid
or payable, or pursuant to which benefits are provided, in each case to any
Company Personnel (each such plan, program, agreement or arrangement, a "
_Post-Signing Arrangement_ "), would constitute an Employment Compensation
Arrangement and provides Company with such information with respect to such
Post-Signing Arrangement as Company may reasonably request, the Company
Compensation Committee will promptly, and in any event prior to the
Expiration Date, consider such Post-Signing Arrangement at a meeting duly
called and held. In the event that, following such consideration, the Company
Compensation Committee determines in good faith that such Post-Signing
Arrangement constitutes an Employment Compensation Arrangement, at such
meeting the Company Compensation Committee shall take all such steps as may
be necessary to (i) approve as an Employment Compensation Arrangement such
plan, program, agreement or arrangement and (ii) satisfy the requirements of
the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act
with respect to such plan, program, agreement, arrangement, understanding,
payment or benefit.

contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever
the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."  The

 **10.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL._**

  

 ** **

  

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of Delaware without regard to its rules of conflict of laws.
Each of Parent and Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of  Delaware Court of
Chancery, or if no such state court has proper jurisdiction, then the Federal
court of the U.S. located in the State of Delaware, and appellate courts
therefrom, (collectively, the " _Delaware Courts_ ") for any litigation
arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any litigation relating
thereto except in such courts), waives any objection to the laying of venue
of any such litigation in the Delaware Courts and agrees not to plead or
claim in any Delaware Court that such litigation brought therein has been
brought in any inconvenient forum.  Each of the parties hereto agrees, (a) to
the extent such party is not otherwise subject to service of process in the

  



        
   

  



  

State of Delaware, to appoint and maintain an agent in the State of Delaware
as such partys agent for acceptance of legal process, and (b) that service
of process may also be made on such party by prepaid certified mail with a
proof of mailing receipt validated by U.S. Postal Service constituting
evidence of valid service. Service made pursuant to (a) or (b) above shall
have the same legal force and effect as if served upon such party personally
with the State of Delaware. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT.

  



  

 **10.8 _Severability._**

  



  

In the event that any one or more provisions of this Agreement shall for any
reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, by any court
of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
shall not affect any other provisions of this Agreement and the parties shall
use their reasonable best efforts to substitute a valid, legal and
enforceable provision which, insofar as practicable, implements the original
purposes and intents of this Agreement.

  



  

 **10.9 _Assignment; Reliance of Other Parties._**

  



  

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto in whole or in part
(whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent

Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer, but subject to the terms
of the Agreement, Parent and Purchaser shall not be required to accept for
payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC,
including Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act, pay for, any
validly tendered shares of Company Common Stock, if (i) there shall not be
validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date for the Offer
that number of shares of Company Common Stock which, when added to any shares
of Company Common Stock already owned by Parent or any of its controlled
Subsidiaries, represents at least a majority of the sum of (A) the total
number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock on the Expiration Date
plus (B) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock that will be
issuable at or prior to the Outside Date upon the vesting (including vesting
solely as a result of the consummation of the Offer), conversion or exercise

acquire Company Common Stock, regardless of the conversion or exercise price
or other terms and conditions thereof) (the " _Minimum Condition_ "), (ii)

with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that is required to

not have expired or been terminated or been obtained without the imposition
of any Burdensome Action prior to the Expiration Date, or (iii) at any time
on or after the date of the Agreement and prior to the time of acceptance for

(collectively, the " _Specified Company Representations_ "), shall not be
true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Expiration Date
with the same force and effect as if made on and as of such date (other than
those representations and warranties which address matters only as of a
particular date, which shall have been true and correct in all material
respects only as of such particular date); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that for
purposes of determining the accuracy of the representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in the Agreement for purposes of this paragraph (c)(i),
any update of or modification to the Company Disclosure Schedule made or
purported to have been made after the date of the Agreement shall be
disregarded.

  

### 

  

### (ii) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the

not be true in all respects on and as of the Expiration Date with the same
force and effect as if made on and as of such date (other than those
representations and warranties which address matters only as of a particular
date, which shall address only such date), except for any failure to be so
true and correct which has not had, individually or in the aggregate,
a Company Material Adverse Effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that for
purposes of determining the accuracy of the representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in the Merger Agreement for purposes of this
paragraph (c)(ii), (y) no effect shall be given to any limitation as to
"Company Material Adverse Effect" set forth in any such representation or
warranty, and (z) any update of or modification to the Company Disclosure

shall be disregarded;

  

####

and, subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, may be waived by
Parent or Purchaser in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in
their sole discretion (except for the Minimum Condition), in each case,

and not in limitation of the rights of Parent and Purchaser to extend,
terminate and/or modify the Offer pursuant to the

  



        
   

  



  

### terms of the Agreement. The failure by Parent or Purchaser at any time to
exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such
right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be
asserted at any time and from time to time.

  

### 

  

The capitalized terms used in this Annex I shall have the meanings set forth
