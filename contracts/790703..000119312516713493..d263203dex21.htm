Indebtedness (" _Estimated Indebtedness_ "), (C) Cash (" _Estimated Cash_ ")
and (D) unpaid Transaction Expenses (" _Estimated Transaction Expenses_ ")
(with each of the Estimated Net Working Capital, Estimated Indebtedness,
Estimated Cash and Estimated Transaction Expenses determined as of 11:59 p.m.
Eastern time on the date immediately prior to 

 



19  the Closing Date, but after giving effect to the Reorganization) and (ii) on
the basis of the foregoing, a calculation of the Estimated Cash Purchase
Price. The Estimated Net Working Capital, Estimated Indebtedness, Estimated
Cash and Estimated Transaction Expenses shall be calculated in accordance with
GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of the Balance Sheet
(except in instances where the Sellers prior accounting practices differ
from GAAP and consistent application thereof, which differences are summarized
on Section 2.4 of the Seller Disclosure Schedules (the " _Applicable
Accounting Principles_ ")) and the Sample Statement. No later than two
Business Days prior to the Closing, the Seller shall prepare, or cause to be
prepared, and deliver to the Buyer an itemized list of Transaction Expenses,
including wiring instructions.

 

Section 2.5 _Cash Purchase Price Adjustments_.

 

(a) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall prepare, or cause
to be prepared, and deliver to the Seller a written statement (the " _Final
Closing Statement_ ") that shall include and set forth a calculation in
reasonable detail of the actual (A) Net Working Capital (the " _Closing Net
Working Capital_ "), (B) Indebtedness (" _Closing Indebtedness_ "), (C) Cash
(" _Closing Cash_ "), and (D) Transaction Expenses (" _Closing Transaction
Expenses_ ") (with each of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Closing Transaction Expenses determined as of
11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the date immediately prior to the Closing Date, but
after giving effect to the Reorganization). The Final Closing Statement (i)
shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the Applicable Accounting
Principles and the Sample Statement and (ii) shall be based exclusively on the
facts and circumstances as they exist prior to the Closing and shall exclude
the effects of any event, act, change in circumstances or similar development
arising or occurring (except with respect to Transaction Expenses) after the
Closing (except, in each case, as necessary to give effect to the
Reorganization). To the extent any actions following the Closing with respect
to the accounting books and records of the Companies on which the Final
Closing Statement and the foregoing calculations are to be based are not
consistent with the Applicable Accounting Principles, such changes shall not
be taken into account in preparing the Final Closing Statement or calculating
amounts reflected thereon.

(b) The Final Closing Statement shall become final and binding on the 30th
day following delivery thereof, unless prior to the end of such period, the
Seller delivers to the Buyer written notice of its disagreement (a " _Notice
of Disagreement_ ") specifying the nature and amount of any dispute as to the
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or Closing
Transaction Expenses, as set forth in the Final Closing Statement. The Seller
shall be deemed to have agreed with all items and amounts of the Closing Net
Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or Closing Transaction
Expenses not specifically referenced in the Notice of Disagreement, and such
items and amounts shall not be subject to review in accordance with
Section 2.5(c).

(c) During the 30-day period following delivery of a Notice of Disagreement by
the Seller to the Buyer, the Parties in good faith shall seek to resolve in
writing any differences that they may have with respect to the calculation of
the Closing Net Working

 



20  Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or Closing Transaction
Expenses as specified therein. Any disputed items resolved in writing between
the Buyer and the Seller within such 30-day period shall be final and binding
with respect to such items, and if the Seller and the Buyer agree in writing
on the resolution of each disputed item specified by the Seller in the Notice
of Disagreement and the amount of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Closing Transaction Expenses, the amounts so
determined shall be final and binding on the Parties for all purposes
hereunder. If the Buyer and the Seller have not resolved all such differences
by the end of such 30-day period, the Buyer and the Seller shall submit, in
writing, to an independent public accounting firm (the " _Independent
Accounting Firm_ "), their briefs detailing their views as to the
correct nature and amount of each item remaining in dispute and the amounts
of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or
Closing Transaction Expenses, and the Independent Accounting Firm shall make a
written determination as to each such disputed item and the amount of the
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or Closing
Transaction Expenses. The Independent Accounting Firm shall be Deloitte or, if
such firm is unable or unwilling to act, such other independent public
accounting firm as shall be agreed in writing by the Seller and the Buyer. The
Buyer and the Seller shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the
Independent Accounting Firm to render a written decision resolving the
matters submitted to it within 30 days following the submission thereof. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall consider only those items and amounts in the
Buyers and the Sellers respective calculations of the Closing Net Working
Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or Closing Transaction
Expenses that are identified as being items and amounts to which the Buyer and
the Seller have been unable to agree. The scope of the disputes to be resolved
by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be limited to correcting
mathematical errors and determining whether the items and amounts in dispute
were determined in accordance with this Agreement, the Applicable Accounting
Principles and the Sample Statement and the Independent Accounting Firm is
not to make any other determination, including any determination as to whether
the Target Net Working Capital or any estimates on the Preliminary Closing
Statement are correct, adequate or sufficient. In resolving any disputed
item, the Independent Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any item
greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either Party or less
than the smallest value for such item claimed by either Party. The
Independent Accounting Firms determination of the Closing Net Working
Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Closing Transaction Expenses
shall be based solely on written materials submitted by the Buyer and the
Seller (i.e., not on independent review). The determination of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon the Parties
hereto and shall not be subject to appeal or further review, absent manifest
error.

 

(d) The costs of any dispute resolution pursuant to this Section 2.5,
including the fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm and of any
enforcement of the determination thereof, shall be borne by the Seller and the
Buyer in inverse proportion as they may prevail on the matters resolved by the
Independent Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocation shall be
calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative dollar values of the
amounts in dispute and shall be determined by the Independent Accounting Firm
at the time the determination of such firm is rendered on the merits of the
matters submitted. The fees and disbursements of the Representatives of each
Party incurred in connection with the preparation or review of the Final
Closing Statement and preparation or review of any Notice of Disagreement, as
applicable, shall be borne by such Party.

 



21 (e) The Buyer and the Seller will, and will cause the Companies (in the case
of the Seller, prior to the Closing and, in the case of the Buyer, during the
period from and after the date of delivery of the Final Closing Statement
through the resolution of any adjustment to the Cash Purchase Price
contemplated by this Section 2.5) to afford the other Party and its
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable prior notice, to the personnel, properties, books and records of
the TS Business and to any other information reasonably requested for
purposes of preparing and reviewing the calculations contemplated by this
Section 2.5. Each Party shall authorize its accountants to disclose work
papers generated by such accountants in connection with preparing and
reviewing the calculations specified in this Section 2.5; _provided_ , that
such accountants shall not be obligated to make any work papers available
except in accordance with such accountants disclosure procedures and then
only after the non-client Party has signed an agreement relating to access to
such work papers in form and substance acceptable to such accountants.

(f) The Cash Purchase Price shall be adjusted, upwards or downwards, as
follows:

(i) For the purposes of this Agreement, the " _Net Adjustment Amount_ " means
an amount, which may be positive or negative, equal to (A) the Closing Net
Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.5 minus the
Estimated Net Working Capital, _plus_ (B) Estimated Indebtedness minus
Closing Indebtedness as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.5,
_plus_ (C) Closing Cash as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.5
minus Estimated Cash, _plus_ (D) Estimated Transaction Expenses minus Closing
Transaction Expenses as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.5;

(ii) If the Net Adjustment Amount is positive, the Cash Purchase Price shall
be adjusted upwards in an amount equal to the Net Adjustment Amount, and the
Buyer shall pay the Net Adjustment Amount to the Seller; and

 

(iii) If the Net Adjustment Amount is negative (in which case the "Net
Adjustment Amount" for purposes of this clause (iii) shall be deemed to be
equal to the absolute value of such amount), the Cash Purchase Price shall be
adjusted downwards in an amount equal to the Net Adjustment Amount, and the
Seller shall pay the Net Adjustment Amount to the Buyer.

 

(g) Payments in respect of Section 2.5(f) shall be made within three Business
Days of final determination of the Net Adjustment Amount pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 2.5 by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to such account as may be designated in writing by the Party entitled to such
payment at least two Business Days prior to such payment date.

 

(h) For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 2.5 is not intended to be used to
permit the introduction of different judgments, accounting methodologies
(including with respect

 



22  to accruals and reserves), policies, principals, practices, procedures or
classifications for purposes of calculating amounts referred to in this
Section 2.5 in a manner that is not consistent with the penultimate sentence
of Section 2.4.

Section 2.6 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The Seller and the Buyer agree
that the Purchase Price will be allocated among the assets of the TS Business
for all Tax purposes in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code and
the regulations promulgated thereunder. No later than 180 days after the
determination of the Cash Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.5 the Seller
shall deliver to the Buyer prepared IRS Forms 8594 and any required exhibits
thereto allocating the Purchase Price for the TS Business among the assets of
the TS Business in a manner consistent with this Section 2.6, which shall be
subject to the approval of the Buyer, not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. No Party hereto or any Affiliate thereof shall take
any position inconsistent with the allocation of the Purchase Price as
determined in accordance with this Section 2.6 except as required by
applicable Law. In the event of a dispute between the Buyer and the Seller
relating to this Section 2.6, the Seller or the Buyer may deliver to the other
a Notice of Disagreement specifying the nature and the amount of the dispute
and such dispute shall be resolved in the manner set forth in Section 2.5(c)
and 2.5(d), except that the term "Independent Accounting Firm" shall mean any
firm of national reputation with expertise in valuation, as mutually agreed
by the Buyer and the Seller.

Section 2.7 _Withholding Taxes_. Each Party shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to
this Agreement as may be required to be deducted or withheld under any
provision of U.S. federal, state, local, or non-U.S. Law, and pay over such
amounts (if any) to the appropriate Governmental Authority. To avoid making
any such deductions or withholdings, each Party shall be entitled to request
any necessary Tax forms, including IRS Form W-9 or the appropriate series of
IRS Form W-8, as applicable, or any similar information, from any other Party.
Upon receipt of such forms or similar information, provided that such forms
are complete and accurate in all material respects, each Party shall withhold
the minimum amount required by Law based on the content of such forms or
information, absent a change in Law or circumstances after the date hereof.
The Party that is the applicable withholding agent shall use reasonable best
efforts to give notice to the applicable payee before deducting, withholding,
or paying any withholding Taxes on behalf of the payee and shall provide the
payee with the opportunity to contest any requirements to deduct and withhold.
To the extent such amounts are properly deducted or withheld and paid over to
the proper Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 2.7, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

set forth in Section 5.5(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules relate to both
the TS Business and the Retained Business. All Enterprise-Wide Contracts shall
be retained by the Seller. Following the date hereof, to the extent requested
by the Buyer, the Seller and the Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts
to negotiate a new Contract for the benefit of the Buyer and its Affiliates
(including the Companies and their Subsidiaries) with respect to the matters
covered by such Enterprise-Wide Contracts. The terms and conditions of any
Contract or arrangement applicable to the TS Business entered into pursuant
to this Section 5.5(b) shall be reasonably acceptable to the Buyer. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Seller shall be under no obligation to obtain
alternative Contracts with an equivalent level of pricing or other terms as
provided in the Enterprise-Wide Contract sought to be obtained for the benefit
of the Buyer. In the event that the Parties are not able to obtain any such
new Contract, then the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Transition Services Agreement to include, as a Service (as defined in the
Transition Services Agreement), for such time as is reasonably necessary for
the TS Business to obtain a new Contract covering such products and services,
which period shall be set forth in the Transition Services Agreement, either

other assets to, the other Party (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that there is no right of offset with respect to
such funds or other assets, whether in connection with a dispute under this
Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements or otherwise) or (b) mail,
courier package, facsimile transmission, purchase order, invoice, service
request or other document intended for or otherwise the property of the other
Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Agreements, the receiving Party shall promptly (i) notify and (ii) forward
such mail, packages, transmission, order, invoice, request or other document
to, the other Party.

 



54 Section 5.6 _Confidentiality_.

confidentiality agreement dated November 11, 2015, between the Buyer and
the Seller (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which shall continue in
full force and effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that the confidentiality
obligations of the Buyer with respect to Confidential Information (as defined
in the Confidentiality Agreement) under the Confidentiality Agreement shall
terminate as of the Closing Date, but only in respect of that portion of the
Confidential Information relating to the TS Business. If for any reason this
Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing Date, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect in accordance

(b) From and after the Closing, the Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates and Representatives to, keep confidential any and all non-public

extent such disclosure is required by any applicable Law or Order,
including applicable rules of any securities exchange. In the event that the

applicable Law or Order to disclose any such non-public information, the
Seller shall, (i) to the extent permissible by such applicable Law or Order,
provide the Buyer with prompt written notice of such requirement, (ii)
disclose only that information that the Seller reasonably determines (with the
advice of counsel) is required by such applicable Law or Order to be
disclosed and (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to preserve the
confidentiality of such non-public information, including by, at the Buyers
request and at the Buyers sole cost, reasonably cooperating with the Buyer
to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded such non-public information.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, such non-public information shall not include
information that (A) is or becomes available to the public after the Closing
other than as a result of a disclosure by the Seller or its Affiliates or
Representatives in breach of this Section 5.6 or (B) becomes available to the
Seller or its Affiliates or Representatives after the Closing from a source
other than the Buyer or its Affiliates or Representatives if the source of

Representatives to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or
other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, the
Buyer or its Affiliates with respect to such information.

pay all filing fees and other charges for the filing under any applicable
Antitrust Law by the Parties hereto.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in
this Agreement shall require, or be construed to require the Buyer or any of
its Affiliates to (and the Seller shall not and shall cause the Companies and
each of their Subsidiaries not to, without the prior written consent of the
Buyer, which consent may be withheld for any reason), in connection with
obtaining any Consent under any Antitrust Law (i) litigate with or otherwise
participate in any Action with any Governmental Authority in connection with
obtaining any Consent pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) effect or agree to
(A) any sale, license, divestiture or other disposition or holding separate
(through establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any capital stock,
businesses, assets (tangible or intangible), properties or other interests of
the Buyer, the TS Business, the Companies or any of their respective
Affiliates, (B) the imposition of any limitation, restriction or condition on
the ability of the Buyer, the TS Business, the Companies or any of their
respective Affiliates to conduct their respective businesses or own, acquire,
hold or exercise full rights of ownership of any capital stock, businesses,

the TS Business, the Companies or any of their respective Affiliates, or (C)
any material modification or waiver of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement (clauses (A), (B) and (C) collectively, " _Antitrust Actions_ ");
unless such Antitrust Action (x) is conditioned upon and becomes effective
only from and after the Closing and (y) would result in, individually and in
the aggregate with all other Antitrust Actions, a reduction in expected gross
revenues of the Buyer and its Subsidiaries (post-Closing) not in excess of
$350,000,000 (any such Antitrust Action that the Buyer is not required to
effect or agree to pursuant to this sentence, a " _Burdensome Condition_ ").
Buyer shall only be required to take or permit any Antitrust Action that is
conditioned upon and becomes effective only from and after the Closing.
Without limiting the foregoing, in no event will the Seller (and the Seller
will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to) propose, negotiate, effect or
agree to any such actions without the prior written consent of the Buyer.

(c) Except as prohibited by applicable Law or Order and subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Parties will use reasonable best efforts to
coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information
and providing such assistance as the other Party may reasonably request
in connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any
applicable waiting periods under any applicable Antitrust Law, including under
the HSR Act. Each of the Buyer and the Seller shall use its reasonable best
efforts to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the
foregoing or pursuant to any applicable Antitrust Law. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Parties will provide each other with copies of
all correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of their
Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of
its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



56 (d) Each Party shall notify the other Party on a reasonably timely basis of
any communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental
Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and
shall to the extent reasonably practicable permit the other Party to review in
advance any proposed communication by such Party to any Governmental
Authority. To the extent reasonably practicable, no Party shall agree to
participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the other
Party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority,
gives the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate at such
meeting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Buyer shall
control and lead the communications and strategy relating to obtaining all
approvals, consents, waivers, registrations, permits, authorizations and other
confirmations from any Governmental Authority or other third-party necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or to
any litigation arising therefrom; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer
shall consult in advance with the Seller and in good faith take the Sellers
views into account regarding the overall strategic direction of any such
approval process, as applicable, and consult with the Seller prior to making,
and provide the Seller with the opportunity to make comments on (which
comments will be considered by the Buyer in good faith), any filings, motions
or other material communications or entering into any negotiations concerning
such approvals, as applicable.

(e) Each of the Buyer and the Seller shall, and the Seller shall cause the
Companies and their Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to give all
notices to, and obtain all Consents from, all Persons required pursuant to any
TS Contract (including any Material Contract) and any Permit of the Companies
or any of their Subsidiaries, and the Buyer shall bear any reasonable costs
and expenses payable to any Person (other than the Seller or any of its
Affiliates) in connection with obtaining any such Consents. Certain Consents
and waivers with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
may be required from parties to Contracts to which the Seller, the Companies
or any of the Companies Subsidiaries is a party that have not been and may
not be obtained. Assuming the Seller complies with its obligations pursuant to
this Section 5.7, the Seller shall not have any liability to the Buyer arising
out of or relating to the failure to obtain any Consents or waivers that may
be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or because of the termination of any Contract as a result thereof, and no such
failure or termination shall result in the failure of any condition set forth
in Article VI.

(f) The Seller shall, with respect to each Subsidiary of the Seller with a
facility security clearance, use reasonable best efforts to provide such
notices to, or procure such Consents from, the Defense Security Service as is
required under applicable Law. The Buyer shall cooperate with the Seller in
connection with the Sellers obligations under this Section 5.7(f).

Section 5.8 _Public Announcements_ _and Employee Communications_. On and after
the date hereof and through the Closing Date, and except for the press
release or releases to be issued by the Parties on the date hereof, each in
the form previously agreed, the Seller and the Buyer shall consult with each
other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other public statement or any
communications with NewCo Employees with respect to this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements or the

 



57  transactions contemplated thereby, and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement or any such employee communication
prior to obtaining the other Partys prior written approval, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except that no
such approval shall be necessary to the extent disclosure may be required by
applicable Law or any listing agreement of any Party hereto. 

Section 5.9 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Indemnification_.

 

(a) For a period of six years after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall, and
shall cause the Companies and their Subsidiaries to, ensure that all rights
to indemnification and exculpation existing immediately prior to the date
hereof in favor of any Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the
date hereof or who becomes prior to the Closing Date, an officer, director,
employee or agent of the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries as provided
in the indemnification agreements to which any of the Companies or any of
their Subsidiaries is a party, which indemnification and exculpation
provisions are on substantially the same terms as those included in the form
of indemnification agreement provided to the Buyer prior to the date hereof,
are fulfilled and honored in all respects.

 

(b) For a period of six years from the Closing Date, the Buyer shall cause the
Companies and their Subsidiaries to maintain, if available, officers and
directors liability insurance covering the Persons who are presently covered
by their officers and directors liability insurance policies with respect to
actions and omissions occurring prior to the Closing Date, providing coverage
not less favorable than provided by such insurance in effect on the date
hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Companies or their
Subsidiaries be obligated to pay annual premiums greater than 200% of such
premiums paid or payable as of the date hereof; _provided_ _further_ , that if
the annual premium for such coverage and amount of insurance would exceed 200%
of such current annual rate, the Companies and their Subsidiaries
shall provide the maximum coverage that shall then be available at an annual
premium equal to 200% of such rate. The Buyer shall cause the Companies and
their Subsidiaries to pay such premiums.

 

(c) In the event the Buyer, the Companies or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then and in either such case, the Buyer shall make proper
provisions so that the successors and assigns of the Buyer or the Companies,
as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section
5.9.

 

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.9 shall survive the consummation of the
Closing and continue for the periods specified herein. This Section 5.9 is
intended to benefit the directors, officers, employees and agents of the
Companies and their Subsidiaries and any other Person or entity (and their
respective heirs, successors and assigns) referenced in this Section 5.9
or indemnified hereunder, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this
Section 5.9 (whether or not parties to this Agreement). Each of the Persons
referenced in the immediately preceding sentence are intended to be third-
party beneficiaries of this Section 5.9.

 



58 Section 5.10 _Use of Names, Marks and Intellectual Property Matters_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein and in the Ancillary
Agreements, the Seller is not conveying ownership rights or granting the
Buyer, any Affiliate of the Buyer or the Companies or any of their
Subsidiaries a license to use the Marks of the Seller or any Affiliate of the
Seller (including the name "Avnet" or any Mark incorporating the name
"Avnet") and, after the Closing, the Buyer shall not permit the Companies or
any Affiliate of the Companies to use in any manner such Marks of the Seller
or any Affiliate of the Seller or any word that is likely to cause confusion
therewith (such Marks, collectively, the " _Retained Marks_").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller hereby consents to the use of the
Retained Marks by the Companies and their Subsidiaries in connection with
copies of the TS Businesss existing marketing, promotional and sales
materials, stationary, letterhead, business cards, signs, billboards,
advertisements, vehicle and equipment markings, invoices, purchase orders,
forms, remaining inventory and other media including respective online
material and substantially similar reproductions thereof made in the ordinary
course of business; _provided_ , that the Companies and their Subsidiaries
shall only use such materials during the first 180 days following the Closing
and that, upon the Buyers reasonable request, the Seller will provide
assistance (at the Buyers cost) to the Buyer in its efforts to discontinue
such use. As promptly as practicable, and in any event no later than 180
days after the Closing, the Buyer shall take all necessary corporate action
to cause the corporate names of the Companies and their applicable
Subsidiaries to be changed to a name that does not include the word "Avnet."

 

(b) Effective upon the Closing, the Seller hereby grants, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to grant, the Buyer and its Affiliates a perpetual, irrevocable,
royalty-free, worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable and sublicensable license
under any Intellectual Property owned or Sublicensable by the Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Marks and third-
party Software that is not Sublicensable) used in the TS Business that is not
owned by the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries as of the Closing to make,
have made, use, offer for sale, sell, import and otherwise exploit any
product, process or service, including any Intellectual Property that is
related to the Shared Assets (as defined in the Reorganization Agreement). For
purposes of this Section 5.10(b), " _Sublicensable_ " means that the Seller or
one of its Subsidiaries has the right to grant licenses or sublicenses to the
Buyer within the scope granted herein without requiring any third party
consent or resulting in the payment of royalties or other consideration by the
Seller or its Subsidiaries to third parties. Without limiting the
representations and warranties set forth in Article III hereof, the
Intellectual Property licensed pursuant to this Section 5.10(b) is furnished
"as is", with all faults and without warranty of any kind, express, implied,
statutory or otherwise.

Section 5.11 _Employee Matters_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
matters relating to employees of the TS Business are as set forth in the
Employee Matters Agreement.

Section 5.12 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Any sales, use, value added, transfer, stamp, registration, documentary,
excise, real property transfer, mortgage, recordation or similar Taxes
(including all interest and penalties and additions imposed with respect to
such amounts) incurred as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne 50% by the Buyer and 50%
by the Seller (other than any Transfer Taxes incurred as a result of the
Reorganization, which shall be borne 100% by the Seller).

 



59 (b) None of the Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Companies and their
Subsidiaries) shall (except, in each case, as required by applicable Law) (i)
carry back any net operating loss or other Tax attribute or item from a
taxable year or taxable period commencing after the Closing Date to a taxable
year or taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date or (ii) amend any
Return filed with respect to a taxable year or taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date (including any Pre-Closing Straddle Period), or (iii)
make or change any accounting method or any Tax election with respect to the
Companies or any of their Subsidiaries relating to a taxable year or taxable
period ending on or before the Closing Date (including any Pre-Closing
Straddle Period), in each case, without the prior consent of the
Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, unless required by applicable Law.

(c) The Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared all U.S. federal, state,
local and non-U.S. Returns required to be filed under applicable Law by the
Companies and their Subsidiaries, or with respect to the TS Business, after
the Closing for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods other than for Pre-Closing
Straddle Periods, and shall deliver such Returns to the Buyer for review and
comment no less than 20 days prior to the applicable filing deadline (taking
into account applicable extensions or, if the filing deadline is within 20
days after the end of the relevant taxable period, as soon as practicable
before the filing deadline), and the Buyer shall have the right to review and
provide comments, at the Buyers cost and expense, on such draft Returns to
the Seller within 15 days prior to the filing deadline (or if the filing
deadline is within 15 days after the Buyer receives the Returns, as soon as
practicable before the filing deadline). The Seller shall consider in good
faith any comment or revision reasonably requested by the Buyer on such
Returns prior to filing. Such Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent
with those prepared for prior taxable periods unless a different treatment of
any item is required by Law. The party responsible for filing such Returns
under applicable Law (whether the Buyer, the Seller, the Companies, or the
Companies Subsidiaries) shall timely file such Returns (taking into account
any extensions received from the relevant taxing authorities). If a Return
described in this Section 5.12(c) is filed by the Buyer or the Companies or
one of the Companies Subsidiaries, the Seller shall pay (or caused to be paid
to) the filing party the amount of Taxes shown as due on such Return on the
applicable due date, except to the extent such Taxes are taken into account in
the determination of Closing Indebtedness or Closing Net Working Capital.

 

(d) The Buyer shall prepare or shall cause to be prepared all Returns, other
than Returns for Pre-Closing Tax Periods to be filed by the Seller pursuant
to Section 5.12(c), required by applicable Law to be filed by the Companies or
their Subsidiaries or with respect to the TS Business after the Closing Date,
including Returns with respect to a Straddle Period, it being understood
that, except as provided in the following sentence, all Taxes indicated as due
and payable on such Returns (whether or not prepared by the Buyer) shall be
the responsibility of the Seller to the extent they constitute Pre-Closing
Taxes. In the case of Returns prepared by the Buyer that include any Pre-
Closing Taxes or any amounts attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, the
Buyer shall deliver to the Seller such Returns, together with the calculation
of Pre-Closing Taxes (including Pre-Closing Straddle Period Taxes), the Buyer
determines to be due from the Seller, no less than 20 days prior to the
applicable filing deadline (taking into account

 



60  applicable extensions or, if the filing deadline is within 20 days after the
end of the relevant taxable period, as soon as practicable before the filing
deadline), and the Seller shall have the right to review and provide comments
on such Returns, at the Sellers cost and expense, within 15 days prior to the
applicable filing deadline (or if the applicable filing deadline is within 15
days after the Seller receives the Returns, as soon as practicable before the
filing deadline). The Buyer shall incorporate all of the Sellers reasonable
comments or revisions on such Returns unless such comments have an adverse
effect on the Buyer that is material to the Buyer. To the extent such
comments or revisions provided by the Seller have an adverse effect on the
Buyer, the Buyer shall consider in good faith such comments or revisions and
any disputes shall be resolved in the manner set forth in Section 2.5(c) and
Section 2.5(d), except that (a) the term "Independent Accounting Firm" shall
mean any firm of national reputation with expertise in taxation and (b) the
Independent Accounting Firm shall render a written decision resolving
the matters submitted to it within 10 days following the submission thereof
(or if the filing deadline is within 10 days of the submission of the dispute
to the Independent Accounting Firm, as soon as practicable before the filing
deadline). Such Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with those
prepared for prior taxable periods unless a different treatment of any item is
required by applicable Law. The Seller shall pay (or cause to be paid) the
amount of Pre-Closing Taxes shown on such Returns to the Buyer on the
applicable due date. The Buyer shall pay all other Taxes shown or required by
be shown on any other Returns to the appropriate Governmental Authority.

 

(e) Any transactions involving the Companies or their Subsidiaries that are
not in the ordinary course of business occurring on the Closing Date but
after the Closing shall be reported on the Buyers Returns to the extent
permitted by applicable Law or, after the Closing, on the separate Returns of
the Companies (if the Companies do not file a Return with the Buyer), and
shall be similarly reported on all other Returns of the Buyer or its
Affiliates. In all events, the Buyer shall be responsible for, and shall
indemnify and hold the Seller and its Affiliates harmless from, all Taxes
related to transactions described in this Section 5.12(e); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this Section 5.12(e) shall not apply with respect to any
transactions effected pursuant to or in connection with the Reorganization.

 

(f) The Seller and the Buyer shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and
Representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Returns,
including maintaining and making available to each other all records necessary
in connection with Taxes. The Buyer shall or shall cause the Companies to
execute such documents as reasonably requested by the Seller with respect to
any Return for Pre-Closing Tax Periods or audit thereof.

 

(g) The Buyer and the Seller and their respective Affiliates shall cooperate
in good faith to effect a Tax election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code
(and any comparable applicable provisions of state, local, or non-U.S. Law)
with respect to the stock or other ownership interests of the two U.S.
companies that are expected to own directly the equity interests of Avnet
Partner Solutions, S. de R.L. de C.V., Enlaces Computacionales, S. de R.L. de
C.V. and Instituto de Educacion Avanzada, S. de R.L. de C.V.

(h) For U.S. federal income Tax purposes and for all applicable state income
Tax purposes, the Buyer shall not make, and shall not cause the Companies or
any of their

 



61  Subsidiaries to make, any retroactive election that would change the entity
classification of the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries under the Code or
under any corresponding state income Tax provision in the Pre-Closing Tax
Period.

(i) The Buyer shall be permitted to assign to any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates the right to acquire all (but not less than all) of the equity
interests of the Subsidiaries of the Seller domiciled in Canada in a separate
purchase, the closing of which will occur simultaneously with the Closing. In
the event the Buyer elects to make such an assignment, the Seller shall
cooperate in good faith with the Buyer to negotiate and agree to a separate
written contract documenting such separate purchase (including determining an
appropriate arms-length purchase price for such equity interests, which
price will be paid pursuant to such agreement and deducted from the Cash
Purchase Price).

(j) If, subsequent to the Closing, the Companies, any of the Companies
Subsidiaries, the Seller or the Buyer or any of the Buyers Affiliates
receives notice of a Tax Contest with respect to any Return of the Companies
or any of their Subsidiaries or with respect to the TS Business for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period or with respect to any Pre-Closing Taxes, then within 15
days after receipt of such notice, such party shall provide written notice
thereof to the other parties, such written notice to specify in reasonable
detail the basis for and other factual information with respect to such Tax
Contest and to include a copy of the relevant portion of any correspondence or
document received from the relevant taxing authority. Failure to provide
such written notice to the other parties shall not release such other parties
from any of their obligations, including indemnification obligations, under
this Agreement, except to the extent any such other party is materially
prejudiced by such failure. To the extent such Tax Contest relates to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period or any Pre-Closing Taxes, then the Seller shall have the
right to control the conduct of such Tax Contest (provided that the Seller has
first acknowledged its obligation to indemnify the Buyer with respect to the
outcome of such Tax Contest). The Seller shall have the right to settle or
dispose of any such Tax Contest; provided, however, that if such Tax Contest
could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Tax position or
liability of the Buyer, the Companies, any of the Companies Subsidiaries or
with respect to the TS Business with respect to any taxable period beginning
after the Closing Date, including the portion of any Straddle Period beginning
after the Closing Date, then the Seller shall consult with the Buyer
regarding any such Tax Contest, shall allow the Buyer to participate in any
such proceeding (at its own cost and expense), and shall not settle or
otherwise dispose of such Tax Contest without the Buyers prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

(k) Subject in all respects to Section 5.12(j), the Buyer shall have the
right to control the conduct and resolution of Tax Contests; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that with respect to any Tax Contest relating to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period or any Pre-Closing Taxes (which could either result in an
indemnification obligation by the Seller pursuant to this Agreement or could
otherwise affect the income derived by the Companies or any of their
Subsidiaries in a Pre-Closing Tax Period), the Buyer shall keep the Seller
reasonably informed of the progress of such Tax Contest and shall not settle,
dispose of or compromise the resolution of such Tax Contest without obtaining
the Sellers prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 



62 (l) The Buyer shall timely pay to the Seller the amount of any Tax refund or
amount credited against any Tax attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period,
unless any such refund or credit arose from the carryback of losses, credits
or other Tax attributes from a taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning
after the Closing Date, provided that the Buyer provide prompt notice to the
Seller stating (i) the amount of any Tax refund or credit attributable to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period and (ii) an explanation of the determination by the
Buyer that such amount is not payable to the Seller.

 

(m) The Buyer shall not be prohibited from making a Tax election under Section
338(g) (and any comparable applicable provisions of state, local, or non-U.S.
Tax Law) with respect to the stock or other ownership interests of the
Companies or their Subsidiaries that are treated as non-U.S. corporations for
U.S. federal income Tax purposes.

 

Section 5.13 _Registration Rights_.

 

(a) The Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to file a registration
statement on Form S-3 or such other form under the Securities Act then
available to the Buyer (" _Form S-3_") with respect to the resale of the
Share Consideration within 90 days after the Closing Date (but after the
Seller has had an opportunity to review and comment on such
registration statement). The Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
the Form S-3 to be declared effective under the Securities Act as soon as
practicable thereafter, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain
the effectiveness of the registration statement for the resale of the Share
Consideration for so long as the Seller holds any of the Share Consideration,
or, if earlier, until the Seller is permitted to freely sell all the Share
Consideration without registration or restrictions under the Securities Act.
The Seller shall assist the Buyer and its auditors in their preparation of any
audited and pro forma financial statements, and the Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts to provide to the Buyer such financial data and other
information regarding the TS Business that shall be sufficient in form and
content to allow the Buyer to comply with the requirements of Regulation S-X
and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and the requirements of the rules
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, as is required to be
included in the Form S-3 pursuant to the Securities Act and regulations
promulgated thereunder. To the extent that any delay or omission of the Seller
information to be provided pursuant to the preceding sentence results in the
delay or omission of the Sellers performance hereunder, such delay or
omission shall not constitute a breach hereof by the Buyer.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the filing, initial
effectiveness or continued use of the Form S-3 at any time (A) would require
the Buyer to make a public disclosure of material non-public information,
which disclosure in the good faith judgment of the Buyer after consultation
with counsel to the Buyer (i) would be required to be made so that such Form
S-3 would not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, (ii) would not be required to be made at
such time but for the filing or continued use of such Form S-3 and (iii) the
Buyer has a bona fide business purpose for not disclosing such information
publicly, or (B) would require the inclusion in the Form S-3 of financial
statements that are unavailable to the Buyer for reasons beyond the Buyers
control or that are not possible for the Buyer to obtain through reasonable
best efforts, the Buyer may, upon giving prompt

 



63  written notice of such action to the Seller, delay the filing or initial
effectiveness of, or suspend use of, the Form S-3 for the shortest period of
time determined in good faith by the Buyer to be necessary such that the
conditions described in clause (A) or (B) above, as the case may be, are no
longer applicable, but in no event shall the Buyer avail itself of the right
to suspend the filing or use of the Form S-3 for more than 120 days, in the
aggregate, in any period of 365 consecutive days. In the event the Buyer
exercises its rights under the preceding sentence, the Seller agrees to
suspend, immediately upon its receipt of such notice, its use of the
prospectus included in the Form S-3 (the " _Prospectus_ ") and agrees not to
disclose to any other Person the fact that the Buyer has exercised such rights
or any related facts regarding the Buyer. The Buyer shall immediately notify
the Seller upon the expiration of any period during which it exercised its
rights under this Section 5.13(b) but need not specify the related facts and
circumstances.

 

(c) In connection with the Form S-3, the Buyer shall (i) pay any filing fees
or other costs and expenses in connection with such registration (other than
underwriting discounts and commissions), and reimburse the Seller for any of
its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in
connection with such registration (including the reasonable costs and expenses
of counsel for the Seller) not to exceed $50,000 in the aggregate, (ii) use
reasonable best efforts to prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and
supplements to such Form S-3 and the Prospectus as may be necessary to comply
with the provisions of the Securities Act in connection with resales of the
Share Consideration, (iii) furnish to the Seller such numbers of copies of the
Form S-3 or Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements thereto and in
connection therewith as the Seller may reasonably request in order to
facilitate the disposition of the Share Consideration, (iv) notify the Seller
(A) of any request by the SEC that the Buyer amend or supplement such Form S-3
or Prospectus, or (B) to cease distribution of the Prospectus if the
Prospectus, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact
or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, and use reasonable best efforts
to, as soon as reasonably practicable, file with the SEC and furnish to the
Seller, a supplement or amendment to such Prospectus such that such Prospectus
will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, and (v) indemnify and hold harmless
the Seller and its Affiliates from and against any and all Losses and
expenses (including reasonable expenses of investigation and reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) caused by or relating to any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact, or any omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, contained in the Form S-3 or
Prospectus, except insofar as any such Losses or expenses are caused by or
related to an untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or
omission so made in conformity with information furnished in writing to the
Buyer by the Seller expressly for use therein; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Buyer will not be liable to any indemnified party under this Section
5.13(c) in any case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability
or expense arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any final,
preliminary or summary Prospectus if such untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission is corrected in an amendment
or supplement to such Prospectus which has been made available to the Seller
and the Seller or its Affiliate fails to deliver such Prospectus as so amended
or

 



64  supplemented, if such delivery is required under applicable Law or the
applicable rules of any securities exchange, prior to or concurrently with the
sales of the Share Consideration to the Person asserting such loss, claim,
damage, liability or expense.

(d) The Seller agrees that upon receipt of any notice from the Buyer pursuant
to Section 5.13(c)(iv), the Seller will discontinue disposition of the Share
Consideration pursuant to the Form S-3 until the Sellers receipt of the
copies of a supplemented or amended Prospectus, or until Seller has been
advised in writing by the Buyer that the use of the Prospectus may be
resumed, and has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings
that are incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, and if so directed by
the Buyer, the Seller will deliver to the Buyer (at the Buyers expense) all
copies, other than permanent file copies then in the Sellers possession, of
the Prospectus covering such Share Consideration which were current at the
time immediately prior to such notice.

 

(e) In connection with the Form S-3, the Seller shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Buyer and its Affiliates from and against any and all Losses and
expenses (including reasonable expenses of investigation and reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) caused by or relating to any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact, or any omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, contained in the Form S-3 or
Prospectus, to the extent that such Losses or expenses are caused by or
related to any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement
or omission made based upon written information furnished to the Buyer by the
Seller expressly for use therein.

 

(f) The Seller shall provide all information reasonably requested by the Buyer
for the purpose of preparing selling shareholder disclosure in the Form S-3
(including completing a notice and questionnaire in customary form provided by
the Seller). In connection with any offer or sale pursuant to the Form S-3,
the Seller shall provide the Prospectus to purchasers as and to the
extent required under the Securities Act.

Section 5.14 _Black-Out Periods_. In the event of a registration by the Buyer
involving the offering and sale by the Buyer of equity securities or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for its equity securities, the
Seller agrees, if requested by the Buyer (or, in the case of a registration in
which the securities of the Buyer are sold to an underwriter or underwriters
on a firm commitment basis for reoffering to the public, by the managing
underwriter or underwriters), not to effect any public sale or distribution
(including any sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act) of any of
the Share Consideration (except, in each case, as part of the applicable
registration, if permitted), during the period beginning seven days before,
and ending 90 days (or such lesser period as may be permitted by the Buyer or
such managing underwriter or underwriters) after the effective date of the
registration statement filed in connection with such registration, to the
extent the Seller is provided at least five Business Days prior notice in
writing by the Buyer or the managing underwriter or underwriters.

 



65 Section 5.15 _Lock-Up_. __

 

(a) The Seller shall not, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates and
Representatives, to the extent such Representatives are acting on behalf of
such Seller or its controlled Affiliates, not to, without the written consent
of the Buyer, directly or indirectly, transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of
(other than in derivative transactions that are not physically settled) (i)
any of the Share Consideration prior to the date that is 180 days following
the Closing Date and (ii) more than 50% of the Share Consideration, in the
aggregate, following the date that is 180 days following the Closing Date and
prior to the date that is one year following the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
that, the Seller shall be permitted at any time to transfer some or all of the
Share Consideration (x) by way of acceptance of an issuer or third-party
tender or exchange offer made available to all holders of issued and
outstanding shares of Buyer Common Stock, (y) to an Affiliate that agrees to
be bound by this Section 5.15 and Section 5.13, Section 5.14 and Section 5.16
as if it were the Seller hereunder, or (z) to the Buyer in accordance with
Section 8.4(n).

(b) Except as expressly permitted in the proviso to Section 5.15(a), the
Seller shall not, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates and
Representatives, to the extent such Representatives are acting on behalf of
such Seller or its controlled Affiliates, not to, without the written consent
of the Buyer, directly or indirectly, transfer, sell or otherwise dispose
(other than in derivative transactions that are not physically settled) of any
of the Share Consideration at any time other than: (i) through underwritten

evidence the sale and transfer to the Buyer of the Interests and the TS
Business and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Reorganization Agreement. The Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
execute and deliver such further instruments of assumption and take such
additional action as the Seller may reasonably request to effect, consummate,
confirm or evidence the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if at any time following
the Closing it becomes apparent that any asset (including any Contract) that
should have been transferred to the Buyer, either directly or indirectly
(through the acquisition of the Interests) pursuant to this Agreement or to
the Companies and their Subsidiaries pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement
was not so transferred, or any asset (including any Contract) unrelated to the
TS Business was inadvertently transferred to the Buyer or the Companies or any
of the Companies Subsidiaries, the Seller shall, and shall cause its

required by the Financing Sources for the syndication of credit facilities
similar to those described in the Debt Commitment Letter;

_provided_ , that the effectiveness of any definitive documentation (other
than authorization letters) executed by the Seller, the Companies or any
Subsidiary of the Companies shall be subject to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) The Seller hereby consents to the use of all of its and its Subsidiaries
logos in connection with the Financing, provided that such logos are used
solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or
disparage the Seller or its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the
Seller or its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding any other provision set
forth herein or in any other agreement between the Seller and the Buyer (or
their respective Affiliates), the Seller agrees that the Buyer and its
Affiliates may share customary projections with respect to the Companies and
the TS Business with the Financing Sources identified in the Debt Commitment
Letter, and that the Buyer, its Affiliates and such Financing Sources may
share such information with potential Financing Sources in connection with any
marketing efforts in connection with the Financing, provided that the
recipients of such information agree to customary confidentiality
arrangements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none
of the Seller, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective

5.22 (1) to take any action or provide any assistance that unreasonably

Companies and their Subsidiaries). The Buyer shall

 



70  (1) promptly upon request by the Seller, reimburse the Seller for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys and accountants fees) incurred by the Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries in connection with providing the assistance contemplated by
this Section 5.22 and (2) indemnify and hold harmless the Seller and its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers, personnel and
advisors from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred in
connection with the Financing or any assistance or activities in connection
therewith (other than such Liabilities, Losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses, interest, awards, judgments or penalties that arose out of (x) the
bad faith or willful misconduct of, or willful and intentional breach of this
Agreement by, the Seller or any of its Affiliates or (y) written
historical information of the type prepared by the Seller, the Companies or
any of their Affiliates in the ordinary course of business that is provided by
the Seller, the Companies or any of their Affiliates expressly in connection
with the Financing).

 

(c) If at any time the Seller shall in good faith believe that it has provided
the Required Information, it may deliver to the Buyer a written notice to
that effect (stating when it believes it completed such delivery), in which
case the Seller shall be deemed to have delivered the Required Information on
the date of such notice unless the Buyer in good faith reasonably believes the
Seller has not completed delivery of the Required Information and within 5
Business Days after delivery of such notice by the Seller, the Buyer delivers
a written notice to the Seller to that effect (stating with reasonable
specificity which Required Information the Seller has not delivered).

Section 5.23 _Buyer_ __ _s Financing Obligation_.

 

(a) The Buyer shall take, or use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be
taken, all actions and do, or use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be
done, all things necessary to obtain the Financing on or prior to the Closing
Date on the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter,
including: (a) maintaining in effect and enforcing the Debt Commitment
Letter and complying with its obligations thereunder; _provided_ , that the
Debt Commitment Letter may be amended, supplemented, modified and replaced as
permitted pursuant to this Section 5.23; (b) satisfying on a timely basis all
conditions to the Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter that are
within the Buyers control; (c) negotiating, executing and delivering Debt
Financing Documents that reflect the terms contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter (including any "market flex" provisions related thereto); and (d)
subject to Section 2.3, drawing a sufficient amount of the Financing to enable
the Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in
the event that the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.3, and
the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing
Documents, as applicable, have been satisfied or upon funding would be
satisfied.

 

(b) Without limiting the Buyers other obligations under this Section 5.23, if
(x) for any reason, all or any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable
and such portion is required to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, or (y) there is a breach or repudiation by any party to the
Debt Commitment Letter, in each case, other than as contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter, the Buyer shall (i) reasonably promptly notify the Seller
and the reasons therefor, (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
alternative financing from alternative Financing Sources on terms (including
conditionality, structure, covenants and

 



71  pricing) not materially less favorable to the Buyer (as determined in the
reasonable judgment of the Buyer), with lenders reasonably satisfactory to the
Buyer, in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence
of such event, and (iii) obtain, and when obtained provide the Seller with a
copy of, a new financing commitment that provides for such alternative
financing. The Buyer will not agree to any amendment or modification to, or
grant any waiver of, any provision under the Debt Commitment Letter without
the prior written consent of the Seller if such amendment, modification or
waiver would (i) impose additional conditions, or otherwise amend or modify
any of the conditions in a manner that is adverse in any material respect to
the Buyer or the Companies, to the receipt of the Financing on the Closing
Date, (ii) materially delay the timing of the funding of the Financing or
prevent or make less likely to occur, the funding of the commitments
thereunder, on the Closing Date, (iii) reduce the aggregate cash amount of the
funding commitments thereunder, or (iv) adversely impact the ability of the
Buyer to enforce its rights against any other party to any Debt Commitment
Letter or the definitive documentation with respect thereto; _provided_ ,
that, without the consent of the Seller, the Buyer may (x) replace or amend
the Debt Commitment Letter solely to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date hereof or (y) implement or implement
or exercise the "flex" provisions contained in one or more fee letters
related to the Financing. The Buyer shall keep the Seller reasonably informed
on a reasonably timely basis of the status of its efforts to obtain the
Financing.

 

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the Buyer shall
have the right to substitute the proceeds of consummated equity or equity-
linked offerings or debt offerings or other incurrences of debt (including
unsecured notes) for all or any portion of the Financing by reducing
commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter; _provided_ , that to the extent
any such debt has a scheduled special or mandatory redemption right, such
right is not exercisable prior to the earliest of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the Closing Date, the
termination of this Agreement and the Termination Date (for the avoidance of
doubt as the Termination Date may be extended pursuant to this Agreement).
Further, the Buyer shall have the right to substitute commitments in respect
of other debt financing for all or any portion of the Financing from the same
and/or alternative bona fide third-party financing sources so long as (i) all
conditions precedent to effectiveness of definitive documentation for such
debt financing have been satisfied and the conditions precedent to funding of
such debt financing are in the aggregate, in respect of certainty of funding,
substantially equivalent to (or more favorable to the Seller than) the
conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter, and (ii) prior to funding
of any loans thereunder, the commitments in respect of such debt financing
are subject to restrictions on assignment which are in the aggregate
substantially equivalent to or more favorable to the Seller than the
corresponding restrictions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (any such
debt or equity financing which satisfies the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii),
the " _Replacement Financing_ " and the definitive documentation for any such
Replacement Financing, the " _Replacement Financing Documents_ "). The
representations, warranties, covenants and other restrictions of the Buyer
contained in this Agreement with respect to the Financing and the Debt
Commitment Letter shall apply equally to any Replacement Financing and
Replacement Financing Documents.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer acknowledges and agrees that in no
event shall the receipt or availability of funds or financing (including the
Financing, any Replacement Financing or any other financing transaction)
itself be a condition to the Buyers obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and to the extent the conditions set forth in Sections
6.1 and 6.3 have been satisfied, the Buyer will be obligated to effectuate the
Closing in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Nothing in this
Section 5.23(d) shall be construed to limit any of the Sellers obligations
hereunder or the condition set forth in Section 6.3(b) with respect thereto,
including obligations pursuant to Section 5.22.

 



72 Section 5.24 _Non-competition;_ _Non-solicitation_.

 

(a) From the Closing Date until the date that is two years after the Closing

the prior written consent of the Buyer (which consent may be withheld for any
reason), directly or indirectly, (i) hire or solicit for employment any NewCo
Employee or (ii) induce or encourage any such employee to no longer
be employed by the Buyer, the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 5.24(a) shall prohibit

solicitations to the public or general advertising not targeted at employees
of the Buyer, the Companies or any of the Companies Subsidiaries, (B) hiring
any employee whose employment has been terminated by the Buyer, the Companies
or any of their Subsidiaries following the Closing or (C) hiring any employee
whose employment with the Buyer, the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries
has been terminated by the employee following the Closing (but only after at
least 180 days have passed since the date of termination of employment).

(b) From the Closing Date until the date that is two years after the Closing
Date, the Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, without
the prior written consent of the Seller (which consent may be withheld for any
reason), directly or indirectly, (i) hire or solicit for employment any
employee of the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) induce or encourage
any such employee to no longer be employed by the Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 5.24(b)
shall prohibit the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries from (A) engaging in
general solicitations to the public or general advertising not targeted at
employees of the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) hiring any employee
whose employment has been terminated by the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
following the Closing or (C) hiring any employee whose employment with the
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries has been terminated by the employee
following the Closing (but only after at least 180 days have passed since the
date of termination of employment).

(c) From the Closing Date until the date that is two years after the Closing
Date, the Seller shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, without
the prior written consent of the Buyer (which consent may be withheld for any
reason), directly or indirectly, (i) engage in the Buyer Competing Business
anywhere or (ii) own any equity interest, or operate, control or participate
(including as a joint venture partner, agent, representative, consultant or
lender) in any Person that engages directly or indirectly in the Buyer
Competing Business anywhere. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Buyer
Competing Business_ " means (i) the resale of products from the vendors set
forth in Section 5.24(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules (" _Vendors_ ") to
value added resellers

 



73  (VAR), direct market resellers (DMR), independent software vendors (ISV) or
managed service providers (MSP), but shall not include the resale of products
from the Vendors (A) purchased by the Seller and its Subsidiaries pursuant to
an OEM channel program offered by such Vendor and (B) to any ISV or MSP (so
long as such ISV or MSP is not, and has not been in the past 12 months,
treated as a VAR or DMR customer of the TS Business) and (ii) the entry by
the Seller or one of its Subsidiaries into a branded product distribution
agreement with any Vendor, unless (A) such Vendor does not offer an OEM
channel program and (B) such branded product distribution agreement is entered

IT vendor. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall limit or restrict
the Seller or its Subsidiaries from conducting the Retained Business as
currently conducted. 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the prohibition in
Section 5.24(c) shall not apply to the ownership by the Seller and its
Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, of less than 5%, in the aggregate, of
any class of the securities of any Person traded on a national or
international securities exchange.

 

(e) The Buyer and the Seller acknowledge the (i) the covenants set forth in
this Section 5.24 are an essential element of this Agreement and that, but
for these covenants, the Parties would not have entered into this Agreement,
and (ii) this Section 5.24 constitutes an independent covenant and shall not
be affected by performance or nonperformance of any other provision of
this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any other document contemplated by
this Agreement.

(f) It is the intention of the Parties that if any restriction or covenant
contained in this Section 5.24 is held to cover a geographic area or to be for
a length of time which is not permitted by applicable Law, or in any way
construed to be too broad or to any extent invalid, such restriction or
covenant shall not be construed to be null, void and of no effect, but to the
extent such restriction or covenant would be valid or enforceable under
applicable Law, a court of competent jurisdiction shall construe and interpret
or reform this Section 5.24 to provide for a covenant having the maximum
enforceable geographic area, time period and other provisions (not greater
than those contained in this Section 5.24) that would be valid and enforceable
under such applicable Law.

 

Section 5.25 _Indebtedness_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall use
reasonable best efforts to arrange for customary payoff letters and release

delivered at the Closing providing for the full payoff, discharge and
termination at the Closing Date of all Indebtedness of the Companies and
their Subsidiaries specified in Section 2.2(b) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules and any and all Encumbrances related thereto. At least 10 days prior
to the Closing Date, the Seller shall provide to the Buyer drafts of payoff
and release letters, lien terminations and instruments of discharge for the
Indebtedness specified in Section 2.2(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules.

 

Section 5.26 _Resignations_. The Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to
deliver to the Buyer at or prior to the Closing written resignation letters,

least 10 Business Days prior to the Closing, effectuating his or
her resignation from such position as a member of the board of directors (or
equivalent governing body) or as officer.

 



74 Section 5.27 _Audited Financial Statements_. As soon as reasonably practicable
and, in any event, prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall deliver the
Audited Financial Statements to the Buyer. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, if the amounts of the line item "operating income" _plus_ the
absolute value of the amount of the line items (1) "Depreciation expense"
(not to exceed $27,563,000), (2) "Stock compensation expense" and (3)
"Restructuring, amortization, integration and other expenses" for the fiscal
year ended July 2, 2016 reflected in the Audited Financial Statements is less
than the amount set forth in Section 5.27 of the Seller Disclosure Schedules,
the Buyer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement within 15 Business
Days of the delivery of the Audited Financial Statements to the Buyer.

Section 5.28 _Transition Services Agreement_. As soon as practicable

Agreement exceeds $100,000 (the " _Per Claim Threshold_ "), _provided_ ,
that, subject to Section 8.4(a)(i), once the Per Claim Threshold has been
exceeded with respect to any such particular breach, the Seller shall be
required to indemnify, defend, hold harmless, pay and reimburse the Buyer
Indemnitees for all such Losses with respect to such particular breach from
the first dollar, including any such Losses that were taken into account in
determining whether the Per Claim Threshold had been satisfied.

 

(b) Subject to Section 8.6(b), and other than with respect to any Claims or
Losses based upon, resulting from, arising out of or relating to any breach
of any Specified Seller Representation, the Seller shall not be required to
indemnify, defend, hold harmless, pay or reimburse the Buyer Indemnitees under
Section 8.2(a) from and after such time when the aggregate amount of all

80  Threshold has been exceeded, the Buyer shall only be required to indemnify,

(e) Subject to Section 8.6(b), in no event shall the Buyer or the Seller be

this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby, for any Losses that
constitute punitive, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary or
indirect damages, damages for lost profits or other multiplier-based damages;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (x) except for punitive damages (and special or
exemplary damages to the extent they are punitive in nature), the foregoing
limitations set forth in this Section 8.4(e) shall not apply to Losses to the
extent such Losses were reasonably foreseeable in connection with the relevant
breach and (y) none of the foregoing limitations set forth in this Section
8.4(e) shall apply to any such Losses if any Indemnified Party is held liable

(f) For the purposes of determining whether a representation or warranty is
inaccurate or has been breached for the purposes of Section 8.2(a) or Section
8.3(a) and calculating the amount of Losses related thereto, any qualification
as to materiality, "Material Adverse Effect" or any other similar
qualification or standard contained in Article III or Article IV of this
Agreement or in any certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant to
this Agreement shall be disregarded (it being understood that the word
"Material" in the defined term "Material Contract(s)" and the qualification as
to "Material Adverse Effect" contained in Section 3.8(b) shall not be
disregarded for such purpose).

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the rights and remedies
of the Indemnified Parties shall not be limited by the fact that any
Indemnified Party (i) had actual or constructive knowledge (regardless of
whether such knowledge was obtained through such Indemnified Partys own
investigation or through disclosure by the other Party, its Representatives or
any other Person) of any breach, event or circumstance, whether before or
after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing or (ii)
waived any condition to the Closing set forth in Article VI.

 



81 (h) The amount of any Losses payable under Article VIII by the Indemnifying
Party shall be net of any amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party under
applicable insurance policies or from any other Person alleged to be
responsible therefor. If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under
applicable insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be
responsible for any Losses, subsequent to an indemnification payment by the
Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the
Indemnifying Party for any payment made or expense incurred by
the Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification
payment up to the amount actually received by the Indemnified Party (less any
reasonable cost or expense actually incurred by the Indemnified Party in
obtaining such recovery). The Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to collect any amounts available under insurance coverage, or from any
other Person alleged to be responsible, for any Losses payable under Article
VIII.

 

(i) If the Indemnifying Partys indemnification obligation under Article VIII
arises in respect of the payment of any Losses which makes allowable to the
Indemnified Party, any of its Affiliates or, in the case of Buyer, effective
upon the Closing, the Companies, any deduction, amortization, exclusion from
income or other allowance which would not, but for the payment of such
Losses, be allowable, and such allowance is actually utilized by the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates to reduce cash Tax liability prior
to the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date, then the Indemnified Party
shall pay to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the Tax benefit
resulting therefrom if, as and when such Tax benefit is actually realized in
cash or a reduction in Taxes otherwise due.

 

(j) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to indemnification for any amounts taken into account
in determining or as an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to the terms
of Section 2.5.

(k) No Party shall be entitled to reimbursement under any provision of this
Agreement for any amount to the extent such Party has previously been actually
reimbursed for the same amount under any other provision of this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement.

 

(l) The maximum aggregate liability of the Seller shall not exceed an amount
equal to the Purchase Price actually received by the Seller pursuant to this
Agreement.

(m) Any payment under this Article VIII shall be treated by the Parties for
U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income Tax purposes as a purchase
price adjustment unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

(n) Any amounts paid by the Seller pursuant to Section 8.2(a) shall be paid
in cash or, at the Sellers election, in Buyer Common Stock issued to the
Seller at Closing valued per share for this purpose at the higher of (i)
$71.80 and (ii) the volume weighted average price per share of Buyer Common
Stock on NASDAQ for the 15 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day
immediately preceding the payment of such amount by the Seller to Buyer. The
Seller acknowledges that the Buyer may be in possession of material nonpublic
information regarding itself and its financial results at the time of any such
election and that the Buyer would be under no obligation to disclose any such
information to the Seller.

 



82 Section 8.5 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) All claims for indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII shall be made
in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 8.5. A Person
entitled to assert a claim for indemnification (a " _Claim_ ") pursuant to
this Article VIII (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall give the Indemnifying
Party written notice of any such Claim (a " _Claim Notice_ "), which notice
shall include a description in reasonable detail of (i) the basis for, and
nature of, such Claim, including the facts constituting the basis for such
Claim, and (ii) the estimated amount of the Losses that have been or may be
sustained by the Indemnified Party in connection with such Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such Claim Notice need only specify such information to
the knowledge of the Indemnified Party as of the date of such Claim Notice
and shall not limit or prejudice any of the rights or remedies of any
Indemnified Party on the basis of any limitations on the information included
in such Claim Notice, including any such limitations made in good faith to
preserve the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other
privilege. Any Claim Notice shall be given by the Indemnified Party to the
Indemnifying Party, (A) in the case of a Claim in connection with any Action
made or brought by any Person (other than a Buyer Indemnitee or a Seller
Indemnitee in connection with this Agreement) against such Indemnified Party
(a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), reasonably promptly following receipt of notice
of the assertion or commencement of such Action, and (B) in the case of a
Claim other than a Third-Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ "), reasonably
promptly after the Indemnified Party learns of the facts which may result in a
claim for indemnification; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no failure to give
such prompt written notice shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of any of its
indemnification obligations hereunder except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure. For the purposes
of this Agreement, " _Indemnifying Party_ " means the Buyer (in the case of a
Claim by a Seller Indemnitee) or the Seller (in the case of a Claim by a Buyer
Indemnitee).

 

(b) With respect to any Third-Party Claim (other than a Claim relating to a
Tax Contest, which shall be governed by Section 5.12(j) and Section 5.12(k)),
the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, by giving written notice to the
Indemnified Party within 30 days after delivery of the Claim Notice with
respect to such Third-Party Claim, to assume control of the defense of
such Third-Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys expense with counsel of
its choosing that is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in such defense; _provided_
,  _however_ , that such Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to
control the defense of any Third-Party Claim that (i) seeks any potentially
material injunctive or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or
(ii) seeks monetary damages the amount of which would reasonably be expected
to materially exceed any limitation on the amount of Losses for which the
Indemnifying Party is responsible hereunder. The Indemnified Party or
Indemnifying Party, as the case may be, that is not controlling such defense
shall have the right, at its own cost and expense, to participate in the
defense of any Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by it; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified
Party, (A) there are legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party that
are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party
and (B) there exists a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of one separate counsel

 



83  (including advancement thereof) to the Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnifying Party elects not to control the defense of such Third-Party Claim
(including by failing to promptly notify the Indemnified Party in writing of
its election to control such defense in accordance with this Section 8.5(b))
or fails to diligently prosecute such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party
may control the defense of such Third-Party Claim with counsel of its
choosing, and the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the fees and expenses
of counsel (including advancement thereof) to the Indemnified Party in each
jurisdiction in which the Indemnified Party reasonably determines counsel
is required. Each of the Buyer and the Seller shall reasonably cooperate with
each other in connection with the defense of any Third-Party Claim, including
by retaining and providing to the party controlling such defense records and
information that are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim and making
available employees on a mutually convenient basis for providing additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The
Indemnified Party or Indemnifying Party, as the case may be, that is
controlling such defense shall keep the other party reasonably advised of the
status of such Action and the defense thereof and shall consider in good faith
any recommendations made by the other party with respect thereto.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and other than
with respect to Tax Contests, which shall be governed by Section 5.12(j) and
Section 5.12(k), (i) an Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement
of any Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,
unless such settlement would (A) include a complete and unconditional release
of each Indemnified Party from all Liabilities and obligations with respect
thereto, (B) not impose any Liability or obligation (including any equitable
remedies) on the Indemnified Party and (C) not involve a finding or admission
of any wrongdoing on the part of the Indemnified Party, and (ii) an
Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of a Third-Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Section 8.6 _Exclusive Remedy; Exceptions_.

(a) Subject to Section 8.6(b), from and after the Closing, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that this Article VIII shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Indemnified Parties, including the Buyer and the Seller, with
respect to any claims for Losses for which indemnification is provided
hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 8.6(a) shall
limit the rights or remedies of, or constitute a waiver of any rights or
remedies by, any Person pursuant to (or shall otherwise operate to interfere
with the operation of) Section 2.5, Section 5.24 and Section 9.13, or
the express provisions of the Reorganization Agreement or any other Ancillary
Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in
this Agreement (including Section 8.4 and Section 8.6(a)) shall limit the
Sellers or the Buyers right to bring claims based on Fraud with respect to
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement at any time following the Closing
Date (which such right shall survive indefinitely or until the latest time
permitted by applicable Law).

89 Section 9.19 _Legal Representation_.

 

(a) The Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Companies) acknowledges and agrees that Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher
LLP (" _Gibson Dunn_ ") has acted as counsel for the Seller in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Acquisition
Engagement_ "), and in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, Gibson Dunn has not acted as counsel for any other
Person, including the Buyer.

(b) Only the Seller, the Companies and their respective Affiliates shall be
considered clients of Gibson Dunn in the Acquisition Engagement. The Buyer, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the
Companies) acknowledges and agrees that, including in any dispute or
proceeding arising under or in connection with this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement, all confidential communications between the Seller, the Companies
and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and Gibson Dunn, on the
other hand, in the course of the Acquisition Engagement, and any attendant
attorney-client privilege, attorney work product protection, and expectation
of client confidentiality applicable thereto, shall be deemed to
belong solely to the Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Companies),
and not the Companies, and shall not pass to or be claimed, held, or used by
the Buyer or the Companies upon or after the Closing. Accordingly, the Buyer
shall not have access to any such communications, or to the files of Gibson
Dunn relating to the Acquisition Engagement, whether or not the Closing
occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a dispute arises between
the Buyer, the Companies or any Subsidiary of the Companies, on the one hand,
and a third-party (other than the Seller or any of its Affiliates), on the
other hand, after the Closing, the Companies or any Subsidiary of the
Companies may assert attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of
confidential communications by Gibson Dunn to such third-party.

(c) The Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including after the
Closing, the Companies) acknowledges and agrees that Gibson Dunn has acted as
counsel for the Seller and its Affiliates for several years and that the
Seller reasonably anticipates that Gibson Dunn will continue to represent
it and/or its Affiliates in future matters. Accordingly, the Buyer, on behalf
of itself and its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Companies)
expressly (i) consents to Gibson Dunns representation of the Seller and/or
its Affiliates and/or any of their respective agents (if any of the foregoing
Persons so desire) in any matter, including, without limitation, any post-
Closing matter in which the interests of the Buyer and the Companies, on the
one hand, and the Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are
adverse, including any matter relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and whether or not such matter is one in which Gibson Dunn may
have previously advised the Seller, the Companies or their respective
Affiliates and (ii) consents to the disclosure by Gibson Dunn to the Seller or
its Affiliates of any information learned by Gibson Dunn in the course of its
representation of the Seller, the Companies or their respective Affiliates,
whether or not such information is subject to attorney-client privilege,
attorney work product protection, or Gibson Dunns duty of confidentiality.

 

(d) From and after the Closing, the Companies shall cease to have any
attorney-client relationship with Gibson Dunn, unless and to the
extent Gibson Dunn is expressly

 



90  engaged in writing by the Companies to represent the Companies after the
Closing and either (i) such engagement involves no conflict of interest with
respect to the Seller and/or any of its Affiliates or (ii) the Seller and/or
any such Affiliate, as applicable, consent in writing to such engagement. Any
such representation of the Companies by Gibson Dunn after the Closing shall
not affect the foregoing provisions hereof. Furthermore, Gibson Dunn, in its
sole discretion, shall be permitted to withdraw from representing the
Companies in order to represent or continue so representing the Seller.

 

(e) The Seller and the Buyer consent to the arrangements in this Section 9.19.

 

Section 9.20 _No Presumption_ _Against_ _Drafting Party_. Each of the Buyer
and the Seller acknowledges that each Party to this Agreement has been
represented by legal counsel in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of law or
any legal decision that would require interpretation of any
claimed ambiguities in this Agreement against the drafting Party has no
application and is expressly waived.

Section 9.21 _Liability of Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, none of the Financing Sources shall have any
liability to the Seller or its Affiliates (for the avoidance of doubt, except,
after the Closing, any Person directly or indirectly sold by the Seller to
the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement) relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Financing or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and neither the
Seller nor any of its Affiliates (for the avoidance of doubt, except, after
the Closing, any Person directly or indirectly sold by the Seller to the Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement) will have any rights or claims against
any Financing Sources under this Agreement and any other agreement
contemplated by, or entered into in connection with, the Financing, including
any commitments by the Financing Sources in respect of the Financing.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the Seller
or its Affiliates be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of
this Agreement against any of the Financing Sources.
