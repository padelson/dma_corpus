<U>Assertion of Environmental Defects</U>. If Buyer discovers any Environmental Defects prior to the expiration of the Examination Period, Buyer shall notify the Company as soon as possible and no later than the expiration of the Examination Period
of such alleged Environmental Defect. To be effective, such notice (&#147;<B>Defect Notice</B>&#148;) must (i)&nbsp;be in writing, (ii)&nbsp;be received by the Company prior to the expiration of the Examination Period, (iii)&nbsp;describe the
Environmental Defect in reasonable detail including the basis therefor (including any reports, summaries and other information created or delivered in conjunction with Buyer&#146;s Environmental Review and any supporting documents, in each case, in
the possession of Buyer), (iv)&nbsp;identify the specific property to which such Environmental Defect relates, and (v)&nbsp;include the Environmental Defect Amount as determined by Buyer in good faith. Any matters that may otherwise constitute
Environmental Defects, but of which the Company has not been specifically notified by Buyer in accordance with the foregoing, shall be deemed to have been waived by Buyer for all purposes. Except to the extent of its remedies with respect to a
breach of representations and warranties, Buyer&#146;s sole and exclusive rights and remedies with respect to any matter that constitutes an Environmental Defect shall be those set forth in this <U>ARTICLE VIII</U> and
<U>Section&nbsp;11.1(b)(iv)</U>, and Buyer shall not be entitled to indemnification or any other right or remedy with respect to any Environmental Defect. Upon the receipt of such effective Defect Notice from Buyer, the Company shall have the
option, in addition to the rights set forth in this <U>ARTICLE VIII</U>, but not the obligation, to attempt to cure such Environmental Defect at any time prior to the Closing. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT

a liability under Environmental Law or (B)&nbsp;have concentrations of Hazardous Materials in any environmental medium that exceed cleanup standards established under applicable Environmental Law. With respect to each Environmental Defect that is
not cured on or before the Closing, the Base Purchase Price shall be reduced, subject to <U>Section&nbsp;8.4</U>, by the Environmental Defect Amount to the extent that such Environmental Defect Amount exceeds One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000),
it being expressly understood that if any single Environmental Defect Amount exceeds One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), the entire amount of such Environmental Defect Amount shall be included in the calculation of any applicable adjustment to
the Base Purchase Price pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;8.4</U>. The &#147;<B>Environmental Defect Amount</B>&#148; shall mean the reasonable cost, as agreed upon by Seller and Buyer or otherwise determined pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;8.4(b)</U>, to
investigate and remediate the property or operations (or applicable portion thereof) to cure the Environmental Defect in accordance with applicable Environmental Laws in a manner that is reasonably timely and cost effective. For purposes of
determining the Environmental Defect Amount, Buyer and Seller agree that with respect to any such cost relating to the properties of any of the Joint Ventures or any of their respective subsidiaries, the Environmental Defect Amount shall only
include Seller&#146;s pro rata portion of such costs, based upon Seller&#146;s direct or indirect equity ownership in such Joint Venture or Subsidiary, as the case may be. </FONT></P>

Environmental Defect Notice. The Environmental Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Environmental Defects and Environmental Defect Amounts submitted by either Buyer or the Company and may not
award damages, interest or penalties to any party with respect to any matter. The parties shall each bear their own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Each of Buyer, on one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall bear one-half of
