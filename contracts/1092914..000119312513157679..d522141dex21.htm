(b) Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement and to the extent not
already reflected in other adjustments set forth in _Section 3.4_ and

and all documented reimbursements by the Company and the 

 



11  Subsidiaries (to the extent directly or indirectly allocable to the Company)

estimate of the Net Working Capital derived from the Estimated Balance Sheet
(based upon, and subject to the adjustments set forth in, the definitions of
Current Assets and Current Liabilities) (the "Estimated Net Working Capital")
and (iii) Sellers estimate of the Purchase Price as adjusted pursuant to
_Section 3.4_ (the "Estimated Purchase Price"). The Estimated Balance Sheet,

reasonably necessary for Buyer to verify such balance sheet, the "Final
Balance Sheet"), (ii) worksheets showing Sellers calculation of the Net
Working Capital derived from the Final Balance Sheet (based upon, and subject
to the adjustments set forth in, the definitions of Current Assets and
Current Liabilities) (the "Final Net Working Capital") and (iii) Sellers
calculation of the Purchase Price as adjusted pursuant to _Section 3.4_ (the
"Final Purchase Price"), in each case, together with a worksheet showing the
difference, if any, between any Estimated Closing Item and the corresponding
Final Closing Item (as defined below). The Final Balance Sheet, the Final Net
Working Capital and the Final Purchase Price (together, the "Final Closing
Items") shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past practice of the TEAK
Companies and consistent with the principles and assumptions used in
preparation of the Estimated Closing Items. If Seller does not deliver the
Final Closing Items in accordance with this _Section 3.6_ on or before the
sixtieth (60th) calendar day after the Closing Date (or such later date as
mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller), Buyer shall have the right to prepare
such Final Closing Items on or before the ninetieth (90th) day after the
Closing Date (or such later date as mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller), in
which case the relative obligations of Buyer and Seller in the remainder of
this _Section 3.6_ shall be switched. Buyer and Seller shall promptly
provide to each other all documents reasonably requested by the other to
verify any of the items set forth in the Final Closing Item calculations.
Buyer shall have the right for thirty (30) days following receipt of the
Final Closing Items to object to the Final Balance Sheet, the proposed
calculation of the Final Net Working Capital and the proposed calculation of
the Final Purchase Price (other than with respect to an Environmental Defect
or an Environmental Defect Amount, which shall be determined exclusively in
accordance with _ARTICLE VIII_ ). Buyer and its representatives shall be
entitled to reasonable access during normal 

 



12  business hours to all books and records of Seller as may be reasonably
requested by Buyer for the purpose of this _Section 3.6(b)_. Any objection
made by Buyer shall be made in writing and shall set forth such objection in
reasonable detail. Buyer shall be deemed to have waived any rights to object
under this _Section 3.6(b)_ unless Buyer furnishes its written objections to
Seller within such thirty (30) day period. If Buyer delivers an objection
within such thirty (30) day period, then Buyer and Seller shall endeavor in
good faith to resolve the objections. If, at the end of a fifteen (15) day
period from the date of delivery of any objection by Buyer or such longer
period as may be mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller, there are any objections
that remain in dispute, then the remaining objections in dispute shall be
submitted for resolution to the accounting firm of Ernst and Young LLP (the
"Closing Item Arbitrator"). The Closing Item Arbitrator shall determine the
Final Purchase Price as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
objections that remain in dispute are submitted to it, but in any event
within thirty (30) days after such objections that remain in dispute are
submitted to it. If any objections are submitted to the Closing Item
Arbitrator for resolution, (i) each of Buyer and Seller shall furnish to the
Closing Item Arbitrator such workpapers and other documents and information
relating to such objections as the Closing Item Arbitrator may request and are
reasonably available to that party (or its independent public accountants) and
will be afforded the opportunity to present to the Closing Item Arbitrator
any material relating to the determination of the matters in dispute and to
discuss such determination with the Closing Item Arbitrator; (ii) the Closing
Item Arbitrator must not adopt an amount of the Final Purchase Price that is
greater than the amount submitted by Seller or less than the amount submitted
by Buyer; and (iii) the determination by the Closing Item Arbitrator of the
Final Purchase Price, as set forth in a written notice delivered to both
Buyer and Seller by the Closing Item Arbitrator, shall be made in accordance
with this Agreement and shall be binding and conclusive on the parties and,
absent manifest error, shall constitute an arbitral award that is
final, binding and unappealable and upon which a judgment may be entered by a
court having jurisdiction thereof. Buyer and Seller shall each bear their own
legal fees and other costs in connection with any such objection; _provided_
that Buyer, on one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall bear one-half
of the costs and expenses of the Closing Item Arbitrator. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but subject to _Section 3.6(c)_
and _ARTICLE VIII_ , the Closing Item Arbitrator and procedures set forth
herein shall be the sole method for resolving any disputes regarding the Final
Purchase Price (other than with respect to an Environmental Defect or an
Environmental Defect Amount, which shall be determined exclusively in
accordance with _ARTICLE VIII_ ) or the provisions of this _Section 3.6_.
Following the final determination of the Final Purchase Price pursuant to this
_Section 3.6_, if the reconciliation of the Final Purchase Price with the
Estimated Purchase Price results in a cumulative amount payable to either
Buyer or Seller ("Final Payment Amount") of more than Fifty Thousand Dollars
($50,000), the amount of the Final Payment Amount shall be promptly (but in
any event within five (5) Business Days of the determination of the Final
Payment Amount) paid by Buyer or Seller, as applicable, by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to Seller or Buyer, as applicable, to an account
designated by such payee.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 3.6_ to the contrary, any
dispute regarding an Environmental Defect or an Environmental Defect Amount
shall be determined exclusively in accordance with _ARTICLE VIII_.

 



13 3.7 _Tax Treatment; Purchase Price Allocation_.

 

(a) Buyer and Seller acknowledge that the transactions under this Agreement
will be treated for federal income Tax purposes as a purchase and sale of the
assets of the Company and that such purchase and sale constitutes an
applicable asset acquisition pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code.

 

(b) Seller shall engage a firm experienced in such matters and reasonably
acceptable to Buyer to conduct an appraisal and determine the fair market
value of the assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries and an allocation (the
"Allocation") of the Base Purchase Price, as adjusted hereunder, among the
assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries for Tax purposes in a manner
consistent with Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder (the "Treasury Regulations"), based upon the fair market values of
such assets. Buyer and Seller agree that, in general, the amounts allocated
to the assets that constitute tangible personal property of the Company or the
Subsidiaries shall approximate the replacement cost of such assets, as
determined by the appraiser. The cost of such appraisal shall be borne one-
half by Seller and one-half by Buyer. The parties shall instruct the appraiser
that the Allocation should be final within 90 days after the Closing, and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the appraiser and
each other to achieve such goal. Seller and Buyer agree to allocate the
Purchase Price among such assets and report the transactions contemplated
hereby on all Tax Returns (including, but not limited to Form 8594 and the
reporting under Sections 751 and 755 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder) in a manner consistent with the values of such assets as so
appraised. Neither Seller nor Buyer shall take, or shall permit any of their
respective Affiliates to take, any position inconsistent with the Allocation
on any Tax Return or otherwise, unless required to do so by applicable Law or
a "determination," within the meaning of Section 1313(a)(1) of the Code.

payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due from the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Employee, and no amounts payable to

acceleration to be triggered.

tanks currently owned or operated by the Company and each Subsidiary, and all
such underground storage tanks are registered, monitored, used and operated in
compliance with Environmental Laws; and

Company has carried insurance during the past three (3) years. Other than as
described on _Schedule 4.21(b)_, no further payments of premiums will be due
following the Closing by the Company or any Subsidiary with respect to
insurance coverages prior to the Closing. Neither this Agreement nor any of

will adversely affect the Companys or any Subsidiarys coverage under the
terms of the insurance policies with respect to periods prior to the Closing.

4.22 _Books and Records_. The Company, the other TEAK Companies and, to the
Companys Knowledge, each other Subsidiary (i) makes and keeps books, records

transactions are executed in accordance with managements general or specific
authorization; (B) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain

reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to
any differences.

4.25 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except for liabilities reflected or
reserved in the most recent balance sheet (including the notes thereto)
included in the Most Recent Financial Statements, the Company and its
Subsidiaries have no liabilities or obligations (whether absolute,
accrued, contingent or otherwise as of the date hereof) that would be
required to be disclosed on a balance sheet (including the footnotes thereto)
prepared in accordance with GAAP, except liabilities and obligations that (a)
were incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (b) have been incurred by the Company or a Subsidiary since the
date of such balance sheet in the ordinary course of business. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company and the Subsidiaries have no Company Debt
as of the date hereof, other than as set forth on _Schedule 4.25_ or pursuant
to the Credit Agreement.

4.26 _Absence of Certain Changes_. From December 31, 2012 through the date
hereof, and except as set forth on _Schedule 4.26_ , the Company and the
Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practices in all material respects.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as set forth on
_Schedule 4.26_ , since December 31, 2012 through the date hereof:

(a) there has not been any damage, destruction or loss, whether or not covered
by insurance, with respect to the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
having a replacement cost of more than $1,000,000 for any single loss or
$5,000,000 for all such losses; and

 

(b) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has taken any action, or agreed or
committed to take any action, that would violate _Section 7.2_ (other than
actions described in _Section 7.2(j)_) if taken prior to the Closing Date.

4.27 _Intellectual Property_. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
received any written notice asserting that, and to the Companys Knowledge,
there is no reason to believe that, the conduct of the business of the
Company or any Subsidiary infringes upon or violates any Intellectual Property
of any Person. _Schedule 4.27_ lists all software licenses and patents used in
the conduct of the Companys and the Subsidiaries business, other than

Subsidiary, back office accounting software or otherwise generally available

use the software listed on _Schedule 4.27_.

4.28 _Title to Personal Property; Maintenance and Sufficiency_.

(a) _Schedule 4.28_ lists all of the material pipelines, equipment and other

and its Subsidiaries. The Company or a Subsidiary owns good title to the
property included on

Encumbrances. The property set forth on _Schedule 4.28_ has been owned,
constructed, maintained and operated in a good and workmanlike manner and
have been in continuous operation since they were placed into service, except
for temporary cessations for the performance of maintenance, repair,
replacement, modification, improvement or expansion. The equipment set forth
on _Schedule 4.28_ has been maintained in a state of repair so as to be
reasonably suitable, in accordance with customary practices in the oil and gas
industry, for normal operations consistent with the Companys past
practices. 

(b) The tangible personal property listed on _Schedule 4.28_ , together with
the Intellectual Property set forth on _Schedule 4.27_ , the Real Property,
the Real Property Leases and the Rights-of-Way, is sufficient for the Company
and its Subsidiaries to conduct their respective businesses in substantially
the same manner as they currently are conducted.

4.29 _Gas Regulatory Matters_. None of the Company or its Affiliates is a
"natural-gas company" under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 ("NGA"), and neither
the Real Property nor the pipelines, equipment and other tangible personal
property set forth on _Schedule 4.28_ has ever been constructed or used in a
manner that would require a certificate of public convenience and necessity
under the NGA or subject such property to the jurisdiction of the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission pursuant to the NGA. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 4.29_ , neither the Company nor any Affiliate provides
transportation or storage services pursuant to Section 311(a) of the Natural
Gas Policy Act of 1978.

4.30 _Gas Imbalances_. Except for the gas imbalances reflected on _Schedule
4.30_ and for immaterial gathering imbalances occurring after the date hereof,
there do not exist any gas imbalances (a) under any Contracts with third
parties providing for the gathering of gas owned or controlled by such third
parties, or (b) for which the Company or any of its Affiliates has received a
quantity of gas prior to the date of this Agreement for which the Company or
any of its Affiliates will have a duty to deliver an equivalent quantity of
gas after the Closing.

4.31 _Preferential Rights_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.31_, no Person
has a preferential right to purchase any of the assets owned by or equity
interests of the Company or its Subsidiaries as a result of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

4.32 _Capital Commitments_. Except for the obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries under the Material Contracts, the Company and its Subsidiaries do
not have any obligation for capital commitments. _Schedule 4.32_ sets forth

time after the Closing Date, with or without cause, with or without

Companys discretion, shall be accompanied by a representative of the Company.
Upon the written request of Seller or the Company, Buyer shall furnish, free

confidential basis. The Confidentiality Agreement shall apply with respect to
the information furnished thereunder and hereunder and any other activities
contemplated thereby. Buyer

 



35  shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company, Seller, Sellers

by Buyer or its representatives pursuant to this _Section 7.4_; _provided,
however_ , that Buyer shall not have any liability arising out of the
discovery of any existing environmental contamination or condition during any
such examinations or inspections except in respect of its ownership of the
Company. THE FOREGOING INDEMNIFICATION AND HOLD HARMLESS SHALL APPLY WHETHER
OR NOT SUCH CLAIMS, ACTIONS, CAUSES OF ACTION, LIABILITIES, DAMAGES, LOSSES,

by the terms of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements. The obligation
shall continue indefinitely from the Closing Date and shall not apply to any
information that (i) is in the public domain, (ii) is published or otherwise
becomes part of the public domain through no fault of Seller or any of its
Affiliates or (iii) becomes available to Seller or any of its Affiliates on a
non-confidential basis from a source that did not acquire such information
(directly or indirectly) from Seller or Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates on a confidential basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller may
make disclosures required by Law and in connection with disputes hereunder;
_provided, however_ , that Seller, to the extent practicable, shall provide
Buyer with prompt notice thereof so that Buyer, at its sole cost and expense,
may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive compliance
with the provisions of this _Section 7.4(c)_. In the event that such
protective order or other remedy is not obtained or Buyer waives compliance
with the provisions of this _Section 7.4(c)_, Seller shall or shall cause the
Person required to disclose such Restricted Information to furnish only that
portion of the information that such Person is legally required, and, to the
extent practicable, Seller shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment is accorded the
Restricted Information so furnished.

 

(d) From and after the Closing, any restrictions contained herein or in the
Confidentiality Agreement relating to Buyers use or disclosure of the
Restricted Information shall be null and void.

(e) No later than May 20, 2013, Seller shall deliver to Buyer, the unaudited
consolidated balance sheet and the related statement of income and retained
earnings and

 



36  of cash flows of the Company and the Subsidiaries as of and for the month
ended March 31, 2013, prepared on a basis consistent with the Most Recent
Financial Statements; provided that if the Closing Date shall occur prior to
May 20, 2013, Seller will reasonably cooperate with Buyer and the Company in
conjunction with the Companys preparation of such financial statements.

 

(f) Prior to and after the Closing, Seller shall provide Buyer access to the
personnel, books and records of Seller, the Company and their respective
Affiliates to the extent reasonably necessary to enable Buyer to prepare
financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries in such form and
covering such periods as may be required by any applicable securities Laws to
be filed with the SEC. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver or cause to be
delivered or made available to Buyer on or before the 45th day after the
Closing Date, the unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company
for the three month period ended March 31, 2013 and the related footnotes,
which in each case shall have been reviewed by the independent public
accountants of the Company, as shall be reasonably necessary for inclusion in
Buyers current report on Form 8-K under the Exchange Act. Seller will use
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered or made
available to Buyer on or before the 65th day after the Closing Date, the
report of the independent public accounts of the Company with respect to
those portions of the financial statements to be delivered or made available
under this _Section 7.4(e)_ for which such report is required by Form 8-K.
Furthermore, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the independent public accountants of the Company to provide any consent
necessary to the filing of such financial statements with the SEC and to
provide such customary representation letters as are necessary in connection
therewith. All of the financial statements, reports, opinions and related
activities to be prepared, provided, delivered, made available or undertaken
pursuant to this _Section 7.4(e)_ shall be prepared, provided,
delivered, made available and undertaken at the sole cost and expense of
Buyer.

(g) After the Closing, Buyer shall provide, and will cause the Company and
the Subsidiaries to provide, Seller reasonable access during the Companys
regular business hours to personnel, books and records of the Company and the
Subsidiaries in connection with, among other things, any insurance claims by,
preparation of Tax returns by, Legal Proceedings against or investigations by
a Governmental Authority of, Seller, Sellers direct or indirect equity
holders or any of their respective Affiliates or in order to enable Seller to
comply with its obligations under this Agreement and each Ancillary Document.
Seller shall be entitled, at its sole cost and expense, to make copies of the
books and records to which it is entitled to access pursuant to this _Section
7.4(e)_. In the event that Buyer desires to destroy (or permit to be
destroyed) books and records of the Company or the Subsidiaries in respect of
time periods ending or events that began on or prior to the Closing, Buyer
shall give Seller 90 days prior written notice of such desire, and Seller
shall have the right at its option and expense to, upon written notice to
Buyer during such time period, take possession of such books and records
within 180 days after the date of Buyers notice.

 



37 7.5 _Books and Records_. On or within two (2) Business Days after the
Closing Date, Seller shall as permitted by applicable Law deliver to Buyer
all records of the Company and the Subsidiaries in Sellers possession,
including original minute books and other corporate books and records and
accounts. Seller will deliver to Buyer, at Buyers expense, all of the rights
of way easements, rights of way option agreements, files, assignments,
operating records and agreements, engineering records, financial and
accounting records (but not including general financial accounting or tax
accounting records), and other similar files and records of the Company and
the Subsidiaries which directly relate to the assets and properties of the
Company and the Subsidiaries. Buyer agrees that Seller may retain copies of
all files transferred to Buyer pursuant to this _Section 7.5_.

7.6 _Regulatory Approvals_.

 

(a) Each party hereto shall cooperate and use its commercially reasonable
efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation to effect
all necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings and other documents,
and use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (and will cooperate with
each other in obtaining) any consent, acquiescence, authorization, order or
approval of, and any exemption or nonopposition by, any Governmental Authority
required to be obtained or made by the Company, Seller or Buyer or any of
their respective Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby or the taking of any action contemplated thereby or by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, _Section 7.1_), in no event shall Buyer or any of its
Affiliates be required to (i) propose, negotiate, commit to or effect by
consent decree, hold separate order, trust or otherwise, the sale, divestiture
or disposition of any assets or business of Buyer or any of its Affiliates
or (ii) otherwise take or commit to take actions that after the Closing Date
would limit the freedom of Buyer, any of its Affiliates, or the Company or any
of the Subsidiaries with respect to one or more of their respective
businesses, properties or assets.

(b) As promptly as practicable and in any event not more than 14 days
following the date on which the parties hereto have fully executed and
delivered this Agreement, Seller and Buyer will file with the Federal Trade
Commission and the Department of Justice, as applicable, the required
notification and report forms pursuant to the HSR Act and will as promptly as
practicable furnish any supplemental information that may be requested in
connection therewith. Seller and Buyer will request expedited treatment (
_i.e._ , early termination) of such filing. Seller and Buyer shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to make or modify all other filings and
submissions on a prompt and timely basis in connection with the filings
required by this Section. Subject to _Section 3.3(a)(iv)_, each of Seller and
Buyer will bear their own costs and expenses relating to the compliance with
this Section.

7.7 _Other Actions_. Except as contemplated by this Agreement, neither the
Company, Seller nor Buyer shall, nor permit any of their respective Affiliates
to, take or agree or commit to take any action that is reasonably likely to
result in any of its respective representations or warranties hereunder being
untrue in any material respect or in any of the conditions to the transactions
contemplated hereby set forth in _ARTICLE IX_ not being satisfied. Each of the
parties agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy the
conditions to the Closing set forth in this Agreement.

 



38 7.8 _LIMITATION AND DISCLAIMER OF IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF
THE COMPANY_. THE EXPRESS REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER AND THE
COMPANY CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE EXCLUSIVE AND ARE IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE. AT
OR PRIOR TO THE CLOSING, BUYER SHALL HAVE CONDUCTED SUCH INSPECTIONS OF THE
COMPANY AND ITS ASSETS AS BUYER DEEMS NECESSARY AND SHALL HAVE SATISFIED
ITSELF AS TO THE CONDITION OF THE COMPANY AND ITS ASSETS. EXCEPT AS
SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED IN THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS
AGREEMENT, SELLER AND THE COMPANY MAKE NO WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION, EXPRESS,
IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY
DATA, REPORTS, RECORDS, PROJECTIONS, INFORMATION OR MATERIALS NOW, HERETOFORE
OR HEREAFTER FURNISHED OR MADE AVAILABLE TO BUYER OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES BY
THE COMPANY OR BY THE COMPANYS AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES; ANY AND ALL SUCH
DATA, RECORDS, REPORTS, PROJECTIONS, INFORMATION AND OTHER MATERIALS FURNISHED
BY SELLER, THE COMPANY OR BY THE COMPANYS AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES OR
OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO BUYER OR BUYERS REPRESENTATIVES ARE PROVIDED TO
OR FOR THE BENEFIT OF BUYER AS A CONVENIENCE, AND SHALL NOT CREATE OR GIVE
RISE TO ANY LIABILITY OF OR AGAINST THE COMPANY, SELLER OR THE AGENTS OR
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE COMPANY OR SELLER AND SHALL NOT GIVE BUYER ANY RIGHT TO
CLAIM INDEMNIFICATION UNDER _ARTICLE XII_ OR THAT THE CLOSING CONDITIONS IN
_SECTION 9.1(d)_ OR  _SECTION 9.1(e)_ HAVE NOT BEEN SATISFIED; AND ANY
RELIANCE ON OR USE OF THE SAME SHALL BE AT BUYERS SOLE RISK. THE PROVISIONS
OF THIS _SECTION 7.8_, TOGETHER WITH THE LIMITED REMEDIES PROVIDED HEREIN
WERE SPECIFICALLY BARGAINED FOR AMONG BUYER, THE COMPANY AND SELLER AND WERE
TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT BY BUYER, THE COMPANY AND SELLER IN ARRIVING AT THE
PURCHASE PRICE. BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES TO THE FOREGOING AND AGREES,
REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMER IS "CONSPICUOUS" AND
THE RESULT OF ARMS-LENGTH NEGOTIATION, THAT BUYER IS SOPHISTICATED AND
KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT BUSINESS MATTERS AND WAS REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL, THAT THIS
DISCLAIMER IS NOT BOILERPLATE AND THAT THIS DISCLAIMER IS TO BE A CLEAR,
UNEQUIVOCAL AND EFFECTIVE DISCLAIMER OF RELIANCE UNDER TEXAS LAW.

7.9 _Change of Company Name_. Buyer agrees that it shall have no right to use
the name of "TEAK Midstream" or any service marks, trademarks, trade names,
identifying symbols, logos, emblems, signs or insignia related thereto or
containing or compromising the foregoing, including any name or mark
confusingly similar thereto or a derivative thereof (collectively, the
"Subject Marks"), and will not at any time hold itself out as having any
affiliation with Seller or any of its Affiliates. In furtherance thereof, as
promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 90 days following the
Closing Date, Buyer shall remove, strike over or

 



39  otherwise obliterate all Subject Marks from all materials, including,
without limitation, any vehicles, business cards, schedules, stationary,
packaging materials, displays, signs, promotional materials, manuals, forms,
computer software and other materials. From and after the Closing: (a) neither
Buyer nor the Company shall object to (i) the formation by one or more of the
executive officers of the Company of an entity with the word "TEAK" in its
name or (ii) the use by one or more of such executive officers of the logo of
the Company as the logo for the new entity, and (b) each of Buyer and the
Company shall provide such consents as may be required in connection with the
formation of such a new entity.

7.10 _Consents Under Credit Agreement_. The Company and Buyer shall work
together in order to obtain any and all consents, approvals or waivers
required by the terms of the Credit Agreement as may be required to avoid a
breach or default or any right of acceleration or cancellation thereunder as a
result of the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , failure of the Company to obtain any such consent,
approval or waiver shall not constitute a failure of a condition to Sellers
or Buyers obligation to proceed to close as long as the amounts due under
the Credit Agreement (a) are paid off in full at the Closing (it being agreed
that none of Seller, Sellers direct or indirect equity holders or any of
their respective Affiliates have any obligation to cause such payments to be
made), or (b) in a form deemed satisfactory by Seller, continued in place
without any continuing liabilities or obligations with respect thereto or
arising therefrom of Seller, Sellers direct or indirect equity holders or
any of their respective Affiliates, including, without limitation, any
obligation to contribute capital to the Company, the Senior Lender or
otherwise in conjunction with the Credit Agreement.

 

7.11 _Waiver from TexStar_. Prior to the Closing and at the request of Buyer,
the Company shall, in good faith, try to facilitate discussions between the
Buyer and TexStar, regarding TexStars willingness to waive the applicability
of the provisions of Section 6.6 of the T2 Eagle Ford LLC Agreement, Section
6.5 of the T2 LaSalle LLC Agreement and Section 6.5 of the T2 EF Cogeneration
Holdings LLC Agreement, to, and TexStars rights arising thereunder in
connection with, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that any failure of TexStar to waive the applicability of any such
provision or the exercise by TexStar of any of its rights with respect thereto
shall (a) not be deemed to be a violation by the Company or Seller of their
respective duties and obligations under this Agreement, including this
_Section 7.11_, and (b) not constitute the failure to be fulfilled of any
condition to Buyers obligation to complete the Closing under _Section 9.1_
other than the condition set forth in  _Section 9.1(a)_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Buyer nor its Affiliates
nor any Person on their behalf shall, without the prior written consent of the
Company, contact or otherwise engage in discussions with TexStar (or any of
its Affiliates) regarding the terms of the Joint Venture LLC Agreements or
otherwise relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Ancillary Documents.

 

7.12 _No Solicitation; No Competition_.

(a) Except for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, until the
Closing Date or the earlier termination of this Agreement, the Company and
Seller shall refrain, and each shall cause its Affiliates and direct its and
their officers, managers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys
or other representatives to refrain from, directly or indirectly, (i)
soliciting or initiating discussions, inquiries, offers or 

 



40  proposals, or participate in any discussions or negotiations or (ii)
furnishing or causing to be furnished, to any Person or entity, any
information concerning the business, operations, properties or assets of the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries, in each case, for the purpose or with the
intention of leading to any proposal or offer from any Person that would
reasonably be expected to lead to any bona fide proposal made by a third
party to effect an acquisition of the Member Interests or other equity
interests of the Company or any Subsidiary (including pursuant to a merger,
consolidation or other business combination) or any other similar transaction
involving the Company (including the purchase or disposition of any material
amount of the assets of the Company or any Subsidiary other than sales of
Hydrocarbons). Seller shall notify Buyer of any unsolicited offers it receives
to acquire the Company. 

(b) From the Closing until two (2) years after the Closing Date, Seller will
not directly or indirectly through any subsidiary, agent, representative or
other Person other than a Person that Controls Seller (and that was not formed
for the purpose of circumventing Sellers obligations under this _Section
7.12_) (i) engage in any business, or assist any Person or other business
concern (other than Buyer or its Affiliates) to engage in any business, with
respect to any gas gathering, transmission, treating, processing, compression,
marketing or price risk management services in any of the counties set forth
on _Schedule 7.12(b)_ or any other counties to which the Eagle Ford or
Pearsall shale formations extend, (ii) take any preparatory steps for the
purpose of engaging in any such business or (iii) solicit or knowingly
encourage any Person, who was during the prior one-year period, or is at such
time, a customer, supplier, contractor, employee or consultant (including the
individuals set forth on Exhibit E) of the Company or the Subsidiaries to
terminate or diminish its relationship with, or negotiate new or different
contracts or terms of business with, the Company, the Subsidiaries or Buyer;
provided that for the avoidance of any doubt and notwithstanding anything else
in this Agreement, the provisions of this _Section 7.12(b)_ shall not apply
to NGP Energy Capital Management, L.L.C., its current and future investment
funds or any of their respective Affiliates or portfolio companies (other than
Seller or its subsidiaries (other than the Company or any Subsidiary)).

(c) Although Seller agrees and acknowledges that (a) the covenants set forth
in this _Section 7.12_ are reasonably limited in time and in all other
respects, (b) the covenants set forth in this _Section 7.12_ are reasonably
necessary for the protection of Buyer, (c) Buyer would not have entered into
this Agreement but for the covenants of Seller contained in this _Section
7.12_ and (d) the covenants contained herein have been made in order to induce
Buyer to enter into this Agreement, if this is determined not to be the case
by a judge or court of competent jurisdiction, Buyer and Seller specifically
request that the limitations contained in this _Section 7.12_ be reformed to
the extent necessary to make this  _Section 7.12_ enforceable.

(d) Seller acknowledges that Sellers violation or threatened attempted
violation of the covenants contained in this _Section 7.12_ may cause
irreparable harm to Buyer and its Affiliates and that money damages may not be
a sufficient remedy for any breach of these sections. Seller agrees that
Buyer and its Affiliates shall be entitled as a matter of right to request
equitable relief, including entry of a temporary restraining order

 



41  in state or federal court, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief
against the activities in violation of this _Section 7.12_ or both, or other
appropriate judicial remedy, writ or order, in any court of competent
jurisdiction, restraining any violation or further violation of such covenants
by Seller or others acting on Sellers behalf. Such remedies will be in
addition to all other remedies available to Buyer and its Affiliates, in
accordance with this Agreement.

7.13 _Managers , Directors And Officers Indemnification_. From and after
the Closing Date, the Company shall, to the maximum extent permissible under
then applicable Law in effect at the time, not modify the provisions in the
Companys (or any successors) Certificate of Formation and the LLC Agreement
in existence on the date hereof so as to affect adversely the rights with
respect to (i) the elimination of liability of past and present members or
managers, (ii) indemnification of past and present officers, managers,
directors and employees of the Company (in all of their capacities), as such
provisions apply to any officers, managers, directors and employees of the
Company prior to the Closing (the "Covered Parties") and (iii) advancement of
expenses contained in the operating agreement of the Company. The obligations
of Buyer under this _Section 7.13_ shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect any Covered Party without the consent of
such affected Covered Party (it being expressly agreed that the Covered
Parties shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.13_). In the
event any claim or claims are asserted or made pursuant to
the indemnification rights set forth in this _Section 7.13_, all rights to
indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until
the disposition of any and all such claims. Any determination required to be
made with respect to whether a Covered Partys conduct complies with the
applicable standard of conduct which governs the availability of such
indemnification shall be made by independent legal counsel selected by the
Covered Party and reasonably acceptable to Buyer.

ARTICLE VIII

BUYERS ENVIRONMENTAL DUE DILIGENCE EXAMINATION

8.1 _Environmental Due Diligence Examination_. From the date hereof until
5:00 p.m. (local time in Dallas, Texas) on the twentieth (20th) day after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by all parties (the "Examination
Period"), the Company shall afford Buyer and its authorized representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours to the records of the Company
at the offices of Seller for the purposes of determining whether Environmental
Defects (as defined below) exist ("Buyers Environmental Review"); _provided_
that such investigation shall be upon reasonable notice and shall not
unreasonably disrupt the personnel and operations of Seller or the Company or
impede the efforts of Seller or the Company to comply with their other
obligations under this Agreement. Such books and records shall include files,
assignments, operating records and agreements, financial and accounting
records, engineering records, in each case insofar as same may now be in
existence and in the possession of the Company, excluding, however, any
information that the Company is prohibited from disclosing by bona fide, third
party confidentiality restrictions; _provided_ that: (i) any information
withheld on such basis shall be identified with as much specificity and detail
as reasonably possible without breaching such obligation, and (ii) if
requested by Buyer, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts (without incurring any expense) to obtain a waiver of any such
restrictions in favor of Buyer. The cost and expense of Buyers Environmental
Review, if any, shall be borne solely by

 



42  Buyer. Buyer shall not contact any of the customers or suppliers of Seller
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in person or
by telephone, mail or other means of communication, without the specific
prior authorization of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

8.2  _Assertion of Environmental Defects_. If Buyer discovers any
Environmental Defects prior to the expiration of the Examination Period, Buyer
shall notify the Company as soon as possible and no later than the expiration
of the Examination Period of such alleged Environmental Defect. To be
effective, such notice ("Defect Notice") must (i) be in writing, (ii) be
received by the Company prior to the expiration of the Examination Period,
(iii) describe the Environmental Defect in reasonable detail including the
basis therefor (including any reports, summaries and other information created
or delivered in conjunction with Buyers Environmental Review and any
supporting documents, in each case, in the possession of Buyer), (iv)
identify the specific property to which such Environmental Defect relates, and
(v) include the Environmental Defect Amount as determined by Buyer in good
faith. Any matters that may otherwise constitute Environmental Defects, but
of which the Company has not been specifically notified by Buyer in accordance
with the foregoing, shall be deemed to have been waived by Buyer for all
purposes. Except to the extent of its remedies with respect to a breach of
representations and warranties, Buyers sole and exclusive rights and remedies
with respect to any matter that constitutes an Environmental Defect shall be
those set forth in this _ARTICLE VIII_ and  _Section 11.1(b)(iv)_, and Buyer
shall not be entitled to indemnification or any other right or remedy with
respect to any Environmental Defect. Upon the receipt of such effective Defect
Notice from Buyer, the Company shall have the option, in addition to the
rights set forth in this _ARTICLE VIII_ , but not the obligation, to attempt
to cure such Environmental Defect at any time prior to the Closing.

8.3 _Environmental Defects_. The term "Environmental Defect" means a condition
that exists with respect to any of the property or operations of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries on the property that (i) is identified by the Site
Assessment conducted by or on behalf of Buyer and (ii) causes such property
(or the Company or any Subsidiary with respect to such property) to (A) not be
in compliance with or create a liability under Environmental Law or (B) have
concentrations of Hazardous Materials in any environmental medium that exceed
cleanup standards established under applicable Environmental Law. With respect
to each Environmental Defect that is not cured on or before the Closing, the
Base Purchase Price shall be reduced, subject to _Section 8.4_, by the
Environmental Defect Amount to the extent that such Environmental Defect
Amount exceeds One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), it being expressly
understood that if any single Environmental Defect Amount exceeds One Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($100,000), the entire amount of such Environmental Defect
Amount shall be included in the calculation of any applicable adjustment
to the Base Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 8.4_. The "Environmental
Defect Amount" shall mean the reasonable cost, as agreed upon by Seller and
Buyer or otherwise determined pursuant to _Section 8.4(b)_, to investigate
and remediate the property or operations (or applicable portion thereof) to
cure the Environmental Defect in accordance with applicable Environmental Laws
in a manner that is reasonably timely and cost effective. For purposes
of determining the Environmental Defect Amount, Buyer and Seller agree that
with respect to any such cost relating to the properties of any of the Joint
Ventures or any of their respective subsidiaries, the Environmental Defect
Amount shall only include Sellers pro rata portion of such costs, based upon
Sellers direct or indirect equity ownership in such Joint Venture or
Subsidiary, as the case may be.

 



43 8.4 _Base Purchase Price Adjustments for Environmental Defects_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
the Base Purchase Price adjustment, as applied to all Environmental Defects
for which an adjustment is to be made, does not exceed one and one-half
percent (1.5%) of the Base Purchase Price, then no adjustment of the Base
Purchase Price shall occur. If the Base Purchase Price adjustment which would
result from _Section 8.3_ as applied to all Environmental Defects for which
an adjustment is to be made exceeds one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the
Base Purchase Price, the Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted by the amount
of such adjustment that exceeds one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the Base
Purchase Price; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will the Base
Purchase Price be reduced by any amount greater than five percent (5%) of the
Base Purchase Price.

(b) Buyer and the Company shall attempt to agree on all Environmental Defects
and Environmental Defect Amounts prior to the Closing. If such Parties are
unable to agree by the Closing, Buyer or the Company shall notify the other
party in writing of such disagreement, including the basis therefor and any
supporting documents, and the Environmental Defects and the Environmental
Defect Amounts in dispute shall be exclusively and finally resolved pursuant
to this _Section 8.4(b)_. Buyer and the Company agree to pursue any such
arbitration in good faith and with reasonable diligence, with the goal of
concluding the arbitration as soon as practicable. There shall be a single
arbitrator. The arbitrator shall be an environmental consultant with at least
ten (10) years experience in the oil and gas industry involving properties in
the relevant jurisdiction in which the properties alleged to have an
Environmental Defect are located, as selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and
the Company within ten days after either Buyer or the Company has provided
the other with a notice of dispute invoking this _Section 8.4(b)_, and absent
such agreement, by the Dallas office of the American Arbitration Association
(the "Environmental Arbitrator"). The arbitration proceeding shall be held in
Dallas, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such
rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section. The
Environmental Arbitrators determination of the Environmental Defects and, if
necessary, the Environmental Defects Amount shall be made within twenty (20)
days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding
upon all parties, without right of appeal. In making its determination, the
Environmental Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in this
_ARTICLE VIII_ and, subject to the foregoing, may consider such other matters
as in the opinion of the Environmental Arbitrator are necessary to make a
proper determination. The Environmental Arbitrator, however, may not award
Buyer a greater Environmental Defect Amount than the Environmental Defect
Amount claimed by Buyer in its applicable Environmental Defect Notice. The
Environmental Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the specific disputed Environmental Defects and Environmental
Defect Amounts submitted by either Buyer or the Company and may not award
damages, interest or penalties to any party with respect to any matter. The
parties shall each bear their own legal fees and other costs of presenting its
case. Each of Buyer, on one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall bear
one-half of the costs

 



44  and expenses of the Environmental Arbitrator. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Closing shall be delayed until no earlier
than the delivery of a determination of the disputed matters by the
Environmental Arbitrator. The Base Purchase Price shall be reduced by any
Environmental Defect Amount awarded by the Environmental Arbitrator, subject
to the limitations set forth in _Section 8.3_ without duplication under
_Section 3.4_.

(b) by Seller or Buyer, upon delivery of written notice to the other party:

(i) if there shall have been any breach by the other party (which, in the case
of the right of termination by Buyer, shall also include any breach by Seller
or the Company) of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set
forth in this Agreement, which breach (A) would give rise to the failure of a

employees and agents thereof, harmless from and against any and all claims,
judgments, causes of action, liabilities, obligations, guarantees, damages,
losses, deficiencies, costs, penalties, interest and expenses, including
without limitation, cost of investigation and defense, and reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses, net of any collected insurance proceeds

this Agreement, (b) the Credit Agreement Indebtedness Amount, any Company Debt
of the type referred to in clause (a) of the definition thereof, or any

Date (except to the extent already taken into account in the determination of
the Final Purchase Price and, in each instance, without duplication) and (c)
any Taxes allocated to Seller pursuant to  _Section 13.1_ (except to the
extent already taken into account in the determination of the Final Purchase
Price). THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OF SELLER PURSUANT TO THIS _SECTION
12.1_ SHALL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT SUCH CLAIMS, JUDGMENTS, CAUSES OF ACTION,
LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS, GUARANTEES, DAMAGES, LOSSES, DEFICIENCIES, COSTS,
PENALTIES, INTEREST OR EXPENSES ARISE OUT OF (x) NEGLIGENCE (INCLUDING SOLE
NEGLIGENCE, SIMPLE NEGLIGENCE, CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE
NEGLIGENCE, BUT EXPRESSLY NOT INCLUDING GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT) OF ANY INDEMNITEE, (y) STRICT LIABILITY OR (z) ANY VIOLATION OF
ANY LAW, RULE, REGULATION OR ORDER RELATED TO THE OWNERSHIP OR OPERATION OF
THE COMPANYS ASSETS, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL LAW.

12.2 _Buyer Indemnification_. Subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section 12.4_, Buyer hereby agrees to defend, indemnify and hold Seller and
the Company harmless from and against any and all Losses arising out of, based
upon, attributable to or resulting from (a) any breach of any representation,

the Company or any of the Subsidiaries prior to, on and after the date
hereof; or (c) the condition of the assets of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries before, on or after the date hereof, regardless of whether

 



50  such condition or the events giving rise to such condition arose or occurred
before, on or after the date hereof. THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OF BUYER
PURSUANT TO THIS  _SECTION 12.2_ SHALL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT SUCH CLAIMS,
JUDGMENTS, CAUSES OF ACTION, LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS, GUARANTEES, DAMAGES,
LOSSES, DEFICIENCIES, COSTS, PENALTIES, INTEREST OR EXPENSES ARISE OUT OF (x)
NEGLIGENCE (INCLUDING SOLE NEGLIGENCE, SIMPLE NEGLIGENCE, CONCURRENT
NEGLIGENCE, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE NEGLIGENCE, BUT EXPRESSLY NOT INCLUDING GROSS
NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT) OF ANY INDEMNITEE, (y) STRICT LIABILITY OR
(z) ANY VIOLATION OF ANY LAW, RULE, REGULATION OR ORDER RELATED TO THE
OWNERSHIP OR OPERATION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL LAW.

12.3  _Indemnification Procedures_.

(a) If any third party asserts any claim against a party to this
Agreement which would entitle the party to indemnification under this
_ARTICLE XII_ (the "Indemnified Party"), it shall give notice of such claim to
the party from whom it intends to seek indemnification (the
"Indemnifying Party") and the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
assume the defense and, subject to _Section 12.3(b)_, settlement of such
claim at its expense by representatives of its own choosing acceptable to the
Indemnified Party (which acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld). The
failure of the Indemnified Party to notify the Indemnifying Party of such
claim shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability that the
Indemnifying Party may have with respect to such claim, except to the extent
that the defense is materially prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnified
Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of such claim at its
expense (which expense shall not be deemed to be a Loss), in which case the
Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in providing information to and consulting
with the Indemnified Party about the claim. The Indemnified Party shall have
the right to employ separate counsel to represent the Indemnified Party if
it is advised by counsel that an actual or likely conflict of interest makes
it advisable for the Indemnified Party to be represented by separate counsel
and reasonable expenses and fees of such separate counsel shall be paid by the
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party fails or does not assume the
defense of any such claim within 15 days after written notice of such claim
has been given by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party may defend against or, subject to _Section 12.3(b)_,
settle such claim with counsel of its own choosing at the expense (to the
extent reasonable under the circumstances) of the Indemnifying Party.

 

(b) If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of a claim involving
the asserted liability of the Indemnified Party under this _ARTICLE XII_ , no
settlement of, or admission of guilt with respect to such claim shall be made
by the Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such a claim, (i) no settlement
thereof may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified
Partys consent unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation
of Law or any violation of the rights of any Person and no effect on any other
claim that may be made against the Indemnified Party, (B) the

 



51  sole relief provided is monetary damages that have been paid in full by the
Indemnifying Party, and (C) the settlement includes, as an unconditional term
thereof, the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to the Indemnified Party
of a release in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party, from all liability in respect of such claim, and (ii) the Indemnified
Party shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement
thereof effected without its consent.

12.4 _Limits on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement:

(a) The maximum aggregate amount for which Seller may be liable under this
_ARTICLE XII_ shall be limited to an amount equal to the portion of the
Purchase Price actually received by Seller at the Closing pursuant to _Section
3.3(a)(i)_, as adjusted pursuant to _Section 3.4_;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the maximum aggregate amount for which Seller may be liable pursuant to
_Section 12.1_ for any breaches of representations or warranties (other than
the Fundamental Representations or the Companys representations and
warranties in _Section 4.17_ (Taxes)) shall be limited to the Escrow Amount;
provided further that Buyers sole and exclusive remedy for any such breach
shall be payment from the Escrow Account, to the extent any Escrow Funds
remain in the Escrow Account.

(b) Except for (i) the representations and warranties of (A) Seller contained
in _Section 5.1_ (Organization and Good Standing), _Section 5.2_
(Authorization of Agreement), _Section 5.3_ (Noncontravention) (other than
with respect to the Credit Agreement),  _Section 5.4_ (Brokers), _Section
5.6_ (Ownership of Member Interests) and _Section 5.7_ (Title), (B) the
Company contained in _Section 4.1_ (Corporate Organization), _Section
4.2_ (Qualification), _Section 4.3_ (Capitalization of the Company),
_Section 4.4_ (Authority Relative to This Agreement) and _Section 4.5
_(Noncontravention) (other than with respect to the Credit Agreement),
(collectively, such representations and warranties in (A) and (B), the
"Fundamental Representations") and (C) Buyer contained in _Section 6.1_
(Organization and Good Standing), _Section 6.2_ (Authorization
of Agreement), _Section 6.3_ (Noncontravention) and _Section 6.9_
(Brokers), each of which representations and warranties shall survive the
Closing indefinitely and (ii) the representations and warranties of the
Company contained in _Section 4.17_ (Taxes), which shall survive the Closing
for the statute of limitations applicable to such Taxes plus 60 days, all
other representations and warranties of Seller, the Company and Buyer shall
survive the Closing for a period of six (6) months after the Closing Date
(each period of survival set forth in this _Section 12.4(b)_, a "Survival
Period").

 

(c) None of the Company, Seller, Buyer, or any officer, director, employee,
Affiliate or Related Party of the Company, Seller or Buyer shall have any
liability whatsoever (whether pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise) with
respect to any representation or warranty and any claims arising therefrom or
related thereto after the expiration of the Survival Period for such
representation or warranty; _provided_ , that if a claim for indemnification
is given in writing by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party before
expiration of the applicable Survival Period, such claim shall survive until
it is satisfied.

 



52 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Seller shall not
have any obligation to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer (or its
Affiliates, and the officers, managers, directors, employees and agents
thereof) with respect to any claims asserted by Buyer pursuant to _Section
12.1_ for a breach of a representation or warranty unless the aggregate of
Losses (determined without regard to any qualifications of knowledge,
materiality or Material Adverse Effect contained therein) with respect to such
claims exceed the Deductible, and in the event the value of Losses pursuant
to such claims exceed the Deductible, only the value of Losses in excess of
the Deductible shall be considered in applying _Section 12.1_ to such claims;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Deductible shall not apply with respect to
any claims asserted by Buyer for a breach of the Fundamental Representations
or the representations and warranties of the Company contained in _Section
4.17_ (Taxes). __

 

(e) Any payments made to Seller, the Company or Buyer pursuant to this
_ARTICLE XII_ shall constitute an adjustment of the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes and shall be treated as such by Buyer and Seller on their Tax
Returns.

12.5 _Manner of Payment and Release of Escrow Account_.

(a) Any indemnification with respect to any claim pursuant to  _Sections
12.1_ or _12.2_ shall be effected by wire transfer of immediately available
funds from the Indemnifying Party (or, in the case of an amount payable by
Seller, the Escrow Account, as applicable) to an account designated in
writing by the applicable indemnitee within ten (10) Business Days after a
final determination thereof;

(b) In the event any amount is owed by Seller pursuant to _Section 12.1_,
such amount (i) with respect to any claim relating to the breach of a
representation or warranty other than a Fundamental Representation or of the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in _Section 4.17_
(Taxes), shall be satisfied solely by funds from the Escrow Account (to the
extent that Escrow Funds are in the Escrow Account) and (ii) with respect to
any other claim other than as contemplated in the immediately preceding (i),
shall first be satisfied from the Escrow Account (to the extent that Escrow
Funds are in the Escrow Account), and Buyer and Seller shall execute the
necessary documents instructing the Escrow Agent to make the applicable
payments; and

(c) In the event that any Escrow Funds remain in the Escrow Account as of the
six (6) month anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall execute
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
release such funds to Seller; _provided_ , that, if there are any claims
for indemnification by Buyer that were timely and properly asserted pursuant
to this _ARTICLE XII_ but are unresolved on such date, the applicable portion
of the Escrow Funds that are subject to such claims shall not be released
until such applicable claims are finally resolved.

(d) For federal and state income Tax purposes, Buyer and Seller agree to
treat the Escrow Funds in accordance with Proposed Treasury Regulation Section
1.468B-8 (February 1, 1999). Accordingly, prior to the date of the final
release of funds to Seller under _Section 12.5(c)_, Buyer shall be treated
as the owner of the Escrow Funds and thus

 



53  shall take into account in filing its income Tax Returns all items of
income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to the Escrow Funds in
accordance with Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.468B-8(c). From and
after such date, Buyer and Seller shall (i) be treated for Tax purposes as the
owners of their respective shares of the Escrow Funds distributable to each
under _Section 12.5_, (ii) provide notice of such amounts to the Escrow
Agent in accordance with Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.468B-8(f) (or
by such substitute method as may be required by the Escrow Agent), and (iii)
take into account in filing its income Tax Returns its share of the items of
income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to the Escrow Funds in
accordance with Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.468B-8(e). Any amount
distributed from the Escrow Account to Seller shall be treated as a payment
pursuant to Buyers obligation to Seller arising from Sellers sale of
property, eligible to be reported under the installment sale provisions of
Section 453 of the Code, if applicable. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall
take any position for federal or state income Tax purposes that is
inconsistent with the provisions of this _Section 12.5(d)_.

ARTICLE XIII

TAXES

 

13.1 _Tax Returns and Payments_.

(a) Seller will (i) cause to be prepared and filed all Tax Returns for the
TEAK Companies that are required to be filed on or prior to the Closing Date
and (ii) coordinate with TexStar to cause to be prepared and filed the final
federal income Tax Return of each Joint Venture and their respective
subsidiaries, if any, for the tax period ending on the Closing Date.

 

(b) Except as provided in _Section 13.1(a)_, Buyer will cause to be prepared
and filed all Tax Returns for the Company and the Subsidiaries that are
required to be filed after the Closing Date.

(c) Ad valorem, personal property and similar Taxes assessed with respect to
any period that begins before and ends after the Effective Time shall be
allocated between Seller and Buyer as of the Effective Time. The amount
allocated to Seller shall be equal to the amount of such Taxes for such
period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
in such period prior to the Effective Time and the denominator of which is the
number of days in such period. The amount allocated to Buyer shall be equal
to the amount of such Taxes for such period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in such period on and after the
Effective Time and the denominator of which is the number of days in such
period. If the actual amount of such Taxes for such period is not known as of
the Closing Date, then the amount of such Taxes for such period shall be
deemed to be equal to the amount of such Taxes assessed for the preceding tax
period. Any other Taxes with respect to any such period will be allocated
based on a closing of the books method.

 



54 13.2 _Cooperation_. Each party shall provide the other party with such
cooperation and information as it reasonably may request with respect to the
Company in filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund,
determining a liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes or
participating in or conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of
Taxes. Each party shall bear its own expenses in complying with the foregoing
provisions.

13.3  _Sales and Use Taxes_. Buyer and Seller will each bear 50% of the
payment of any sales or use, transfer or other similar Taxes due as a result
of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement regardless of which party
is required to file and initially pay such amounts, and shall indemnify each
other accordingly. The parties will cooperate in obtaining any exemptions from
any such sales, use or other transfer Taxes that may be due as a result of the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

ARTICLE XIV

CASUALTY LOSSES

In the event of damage by fire or other casualty to the pipeline, facilities
and other tangible real property of the Company or its Subsidiaries after the
date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing ("Casualty Loss"), then
subject to _Section 11.1(b)(v)_: (a) this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect; (b) Buyer shall take title to the Member Interests without
reduction of the Base Purchase Price; and (c) Seller shall, at Sellers sole
election, either (i) assign to Buyer any insurance claims related to such
damage and pay any deductibles, or (ii) repair or replace such damaged
property to a condition similar to the condition of the affected property
immediately prior to the Casualty Loss and retain all insurance claims and
payments with respect thereto. Until the Closing Date, the Company shall
maintain its existing insurance coverage, and in the event of a Casualty Loss
that is not covered by such insurance, except as provided in this Section,
Seller shall have no obligation to Buyer with respect thereto; _provided_
that, following the Closing, if Buyer so requests in writing, and if Seller
has not repaired the damage or replaced the affected property, Seller will
assign any rights it may have against third parties with respect to such
damage.

ARTICLE XV

enforce such term and against which such waiver is to be asserted. Unless
otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, no delay or omission on the
part of any party in exercising any right or privilege under this Agreement
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any
party of any right or privilege under this Agreement operate as a waiver of
any other right or privilege under this Agreement nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right or privilege preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or privilege under this
Agreement.

15.4 _Successor and Assigns, Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and shall inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns.
Neither this Agreement nor any rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned
without the written consent of the other parties; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that Seller and the Company acknowledge and agree that following the Closing,
Buyer shall be entitled to assign, in whole or in part, its rights under this
Agreement to any Affiliate of Buyer without any consent of Seller or
the Company, and upon any such assignment, (a) the assignee thereof shall
become a direct beneficiary of such rights as if it was a Party and (b) Buyer

express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person, other than
the parties hereto and their respective successors, legal representatives and
permitted assigns, any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this Agreement, and no Person shall be deemed a third

15.5 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the application of
any such provision to any Person or circumstance, shall be declared
judicially to be invalid, unenforceable or void, such decision shall not have
the effect of invalidating or voiding the remainder of this Agreement, it
being the intent and agreement of the parties that this Agreement shall be
deemed amended to modify such provision to the extent necessary to render it
valid, legal and enforceable while preserving its intent or, if such
modification is not possible, by substituting therefor another provision that
is valid, legal and enforceable and that achieves the same objective.

15.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, and the Ancillary Documents)
constitutes the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements and
understandings, whether written or oral, among the parties or any of them with
respect to the subject matter hereof, and there are no representations,
understandings or agreements relating to the subject matter hereof that are
not fully expressed in this Agreement and the documents and instruments
executed and delivered in connection herewith. All Exhibits and Schedules
attached to this Agreement are expressly made a part of, and incorporated by
reference into, this Agreement.

15.7 _Schedules_. The representations and warranties contained in _ARTICLE IV_
and _ARTICLE V_  are qualified by the Schedules. Nothing in the Schedules is
intended to broaden the scope of any representation or warranty contained in
the Agreement or to create any covenant unless clearly specified to the

to be a disclosure of such item on any other Schedule to which such
disclosures

 



57  applicability to such other Schedule is reasonably apparent on the face of
such disclosure, (b) does not represent a determination that such item is
material nor shall it be deemed to establish a standard of materiality, (c)
does not represent a determination that such item did not arise in the
ordinary course of business (d) does not represent a determination that the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement require the consent of third
parties and (e) shall not constitute, or be deemed to be, an admission to any
third party concerning such item. The Schedules include descriptions of
instruments or brief summaries of certain aspects of the Company and
its Affiliates and business and their respective operations. The descriptions
and brief summaries are not necessarily complete and are provided in the
Schedules to identify documents or other materials previously delivered or
made available.

 

15.8 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without giving
effect to any choice-of-law rules that may require the application of the laws
of another jurisdiction. Each of the parties submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in Houston, Texas (in
each case, including any applicable courts of appeal thereto), in any action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and agrees that all
claims in respect of the action or proceeding may be heard and determined in
any such court;  _provided, however,_ that in any such action or proceeding
to which any Financing Source is a party, each of the parties hereto shall
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in
New York County, New York (in each case, including any applicable courts of
appeal thereto) and agrees that all claims in respect of such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court. Each party also
agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement in any other court. Each of the parties waives any defense of
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of the
Financing Sources shall have any liability to any party to this Agreement or
any of their respective controlling Persons, directors, officers, employees,
agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners,
stockholders, and shall not be obligated to any of them, or anyone claiming
by or through them, to pay consequential, special, multiple, punitive or
exemplary damages including, but not limited to, damages arising from loss of
profits, business opportunities or goodwill in respect of any breach or
failure to comply with this Agreement or in respect of any of the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Financing Sources shall be express third-party
beneficiaries of this _Section 15.8_.

 

15.9 _Remedies_. The parties acknowledge and agree that, except in the case of
fraud or willful misconduct, the sole and exclusive remedies for any breach
or failure to be true and correct, or alleged breach or failure to be true and
correct, of any representation or warranty or any covenant or agreement in
this Agreement, shall be termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_ARTICLE XI_ and indemnification in accordance with _ARTICLE XII_ ; _provided_
that this _Section 15.9_ shall not limit the rights of the parties, if any,
to seek specific performance or injunctive relief. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING
HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, NO PARTY SHALL HAVE ANY OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO
THIS AGREEMENT, OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, FOR ANY INDIRECT,
SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT
THAT SUCH DAMAGES ARE AN ELEMENT OF A THIRD PARTY CLAIM AGAINST AN INDEMNIFIED
PARTY WHICH IS THE OBJECT OF INDEMNIFICATION HEREUNDER.

 



58 15.10 _Expenses_. Except as provided in _ARTICLE III_ , Seller and the
Company, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall each bear their
own expenses (including, without limitation, fees and disbursements of
counsel, accountants and other experts) incurred by it in connection with the
preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement, each of the other documents and instruments executed in connection
with or contemplated by this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

 

15.11 _Release of Information; Confidentiality_. Unless consultation is
prohibited by applicable Law, Buyer and Seller shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall
not issue any such press releases or make any such public statement prior
to such consultation (but no approval thereof shall be required).

15.12 _Certain Construction Rules_. The article and section headings and the
table of contents contained in this Agreement are for convenience of reference
only and shall in no way define, limit, extend or describe the scope or intent
of any provisions of this Agreement. Whenever the context may require, any
pronoun used in this Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine,
feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns, pronouns and verbs
shall include the plural and vice versa. In addition, as used in this
Agreement, unless otherwise provided to the contrary, (a) all references to
days, months or years shall be deemed references to calendar days, months or
years and (b) any reference to a "Section," "Article," or "Schedule" shall be
deemed to refer to a section or article of this Agreement or an Exhibit or
Schedule attached to this Agreement. The words "hereof", "herein", and
"hereunder" and words of similar import referring to this Agreement refer to
this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. Unless otherwise specifically provided for herein, the term "or"
shall not be deemed to be exclusive. The words "made available to Buyer" or
"made available by or on behalf of Seller" shall to mean made available
through the electronic data room established and maintained by (or on behalf
of) Seller in connection with this transaction, to the extent Buyer and its
representatives have had access thereto, prior to the date hereof.

15.13 _Waiver of Conflicts; Attorney Client Privilege_.

(a) Buyer waives and will not assert, and Buyer agrees to cause its
Affiliates (including the Company) to waive and not to assert, any conflict
of interest arising out of or relating to the representation, after the
Closing (the "Post-Closing Representation"), of Seller, Sellers direct or
indirect equity holders or any of their respective Affiliates or any present
or former member, officer, employee, manager or director of the Company,
Seller, Sellers direct or indirect equity holders or any of their respective
Affiliates (the "Designated Persons") in any matter involving this Agreement,
the Ancillary Agreements or any other agreements or transactions contemplated
hereby, by any legal counsel currently representing Seller, the Company or any
of their respective Affiliates in connection with this Agreement or any other
agreements or transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Current
Representation").

 

(b) Buyer waives and will not assert, and Buyer agrees to cause its Affiliates
(including the Company) to waive and not assert, any attorney client
privilege with

 



59  respect to any communication between any legal counsel and any Designated
Person occurring during the Current Representation in connection with any
Post-Closing Representation, including in connection with a dispute with
Buyer or any of its Affiliates, it being the intention of the parties to this
Agreement that all such rights to such attorney client privilege and to
control such attorney client privilege shall be retained by Seller; 
_provided_ that the foregoing waiver and acknowledgement of retention shall
not extend to any communication not involving this Agreement or any other
agreements or transactions contemplated thereby, or to communications with any
Person other than the Designated Persons.

15.14 _Confidentiality Agreement_. The Confidentiality Agreement is hereby
incorporated herein by reference and shall constitute a part of this
Agreement for all purposes and shall remain in full force and effect following
the execution of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing or
termination of the Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with its terms.
Any and all information received by Purchaser pursuant to the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall be governed by the applicable terms and
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

15.15 _Guaranty of Performance_. Parent joins in the execution of this
Agreement for the limited purpose of providing an irrevocable guaranty to and
in favor of Seller and the Company of the due performance by Buyer of all of
Buyers obligations to be performed prior to or upon the Closing pursuant to
this Agreement. Parents guaranty hereunder is a primary obligation of Parent
and shall be construed as unconditional and absolute, until the Closing Date
and payment by Seller to Buyer of the Purchase Price. Seller and the Company,
as applicable, may, prior to the Closing and payment by Seller to Buyer of
the Purchase Price, resort to Parent for the payment or performance of any of
Buyers obligations to be performed prior to or upon the Closing and payment
by Seller to Buyer of the Purchase Price whether or not Seller or the Company
shall have attempted to collect or exhaust remedies against Buyer or any
other party prior to seeking payment hereunder. This guaranty pursuant to this
_Section 15.15_ is a continuing guaranty and is binding as a continuing
obligation of Parent until the Closing Date and cannot be assigned without
the prior written consent of Seller, such consent to be at Sellers sole and
absolute discretion.

15.16 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed (including by facsimile
transmission) in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original and all of which taken together shall constitute one instrument
binding on all the parties, notwithstanding that all the parties are not
signatories to the original or the same counterpart.
