MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

 

Section 2.01 _Merger Consideration_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Buyer, Buyer Bank, Company Bank, Company or
any stockholder of Company:

(a) Each share of Buyer Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding following the
Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the Merger.

 



3 (b) Each share of Company Common Stock owned directly by Buyer, Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries (other than shares in trust accounts,
managed accounts and the like for the benefit of customers or shares held as
collateral for outstanding debt previously contracted) immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired at the Effective Time
without any conversion thereof, and no payment shall be made with respect
thereto.

(c) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares, treasury stock and
shares described in _Section 2.01(b)_ above) shall automatically and without
any further action on the part of the Holder thereof be converted into the
right to receive the per share Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock.

 

(d) Each share of Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, the Holder of which has not voted in favor of nor
consented in writing to the approval of the Merger and who has properly
perfected such Holders dissenters rights of appraisal by following the exact
procedure required by Section 262 of the DGCL is referred to herein as a "
_Dissenting Share_." Each Dissenting Share shall not be converted into or
represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this
Article II and shall be entitled only to such rights as are available to
such Holder pursuant to the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Each Holder of
Dissenting Shares (hereinafter called a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") shall be
entitled to receive the value of such Dissenting Shares held by
the Dissenting Stockholder in accordance with the applicable provisions of
the DGCL; _provided_ , such Holder complies with the procedures contemplated
by and set forth in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. If any Dissenting
Stockholder shall effectively withdraw or lose such Holders dissenters
rights under the applicable provisions of the DGCL, each such Dissenting Share
shall be deemed to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable
for, the right to receive the per share Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon, in accordance with the applicable provisions of this
Agreement.

_Section 2.01(c)_ above, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share previously evidencing such shares shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive for each such share of Company
Common Stock, the per share Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock in accordance with this ARTICLE II.
At the Effective Time, holders of Company Common Stock shall cease to be, and
shall have no rights as, stockholders of Company, other than the right to
receive the per share Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Buyer Common Stock as provided under this ARTICLE II. After the
Effective Time, there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of Company of shares of Company Common Stock.

 

Section 2.04 _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof,
no fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock and no certificates or scrip
therefor, or other evidence

 



4  of ownership thereof, will be issued in the Merger. In lieu thereof, Buyer
shall pay or cause to be paid to each holder of a fractional share of Buyer
Common Stock, rounded to the nearest one hundredth of a share, an amount of
cash (without interest and rounded to the nearest whole cent) determined by
multiplying the fractional share interest in Buyer Common Stock to which such
holder would otherwise be entitled by the Buyer Average Stock Price.

Section 2.05 _Plan of Reorganization_. It is intended that the Merger shall
constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and that this
Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" as that term is used in
Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. The business purpose of the Merger and the
Bank Merger is to combine two financial institutions to create a strong
community-based commercial banking franchise.

 

Section 2.06 _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time but in no event later than one (1) Business Day after the
Closing Date, and provided that Company has delivered, or caused to be
delivered, to the Exchange Agent all information that is necessary for the
Exchange Agent to perform its obligations as specified herein, the Exchange
Agent shall mail or otherwise cause to be delivered to each Holder appropriate
and customary transmittal materials, which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares to the Exchange Agent, as well as instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration as provided for in this Agreement (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ").

Section 2.07 _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall (i) deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent stock certificates representing the number
of shares of Buyer Common Stock sufficient to deliver the Merger Consideration
(together with, to the extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.04,_ and if applicable, cash in an
aggregate amount sufficient to make the appropriate payment to the holders of
Dissenting Shares) (collectively, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), and (ii) instruct
the Exchange Agent to promptly pay such Merger Consideration and cash in lieu
of fractional shares within two (2) Business Days, or as promptly as
practicable thereafter, upon receipt of a properly completed Letter of
Transmittal in accordance with this Agreement.

 

(b) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of Company for one (1) year after the Effective Time (as well as
any interest or proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by
the Exchange Agent to Buyer. Any stockholders of Company who have not
theretofore complied with this _Section 2.07_ and _Section 2.08(a)_
shall thereafter look only to Buyer for the Merger Consideration deliverable
in respect of each share of Company Common Stock such stockholder held as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, as determined pursuant to this
Agreement, in each case without any interest thereon. If outstanding
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for shares of Company Common Stock are not
surrendered or the payment for them is not claimed prior to the date on which
such shares of Buyer Common Stock or cash would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed items
shall, to the extent permitted by the law of

 



5  abandoned property and any other applicable Law, become the property of
Buyer (and to the extent not in its possession shall be delivered to it), free
and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled to such
property. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be
liable to any Holder represented by any Certificate or Book-Entry Share for
any Merger Consideration (or any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws. Buyer and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
rely upon the stock transfer books of Company to establish the identity of
those Persons entitled to receive the Merger Consideration specified in this
Agreement, which books shall be conclusive with respect thereto. In the event
of a dispute with respect to ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock
represented by any Certificate or Book-Entry Share, Buyer and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to tender to the custody of any court of competent
jurisdiction any Merger Consideration represented by such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share and file legal proceedings interpleading all parties to such
dispute, and will thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims thereto.

Section 2.08  _Delivery of Merger Consideration_.

(a) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate(s) or Book-Entry
Share(s), accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal timely
delivered to the Exchange Agent, a Holder will be entitled to receive such
Holders pro rata portion of the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor (with such cash rounded to the nearest whole cent) in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Holders Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares. The Exchange Agent and Buyer, as the case may be, shall
not be obligated to deliver cash and/or shares of Buyer Common Stock to a
Holder to which such Holder would otherwise be entitled as a result of the
Merger until such Holder surrenders the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
representing the shares of Company Common Stock for exchange as provided in
this ARTICLE II, or, an appropriate affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement
and/or a bond in such amount as may be required in each case by Buyer or
the Exchange Agent.

(b) All shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger,
including shares issued with respect to Company Stock Options, Company RSUs,
Company DSUs and Company Warrants in accordance with _Section 5.21,_ shall be
deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and if ever a dividend
or other distribution is declared by Buyer in respect of the Buyer Common
Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that
declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all
shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No
dividends or other distributions in respect of the Buyer Common Stock shall
be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share
until such Certificate or Book-Entry Share is surrendered for exchange in
accordance with this ARTICLE II. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, there shall
be issued and/or paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole
shares of Buyer Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest,
(i) at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such
whole shares of Buyer Common Stock and not paid and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to
such whole shares of Buyer Common Stock with a record date after the Effective
Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.

 



6 (c) Buyer (through the Exchange Agent, if applicable) shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Holder such amounts as Buyer is required to deduct and
withhold under applicable Law. Any amounts so deducted and withheld shall be
remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority and upon such remittance
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Buyer or
the Exchange Agent, as applicable.

 

Section 2.09 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. In the event that on or after the
first trading day used in determining the Buyer Average Stock Price and
before the Effective Time Buyer changes (or establishes a record date for
changing) the number of, or provides for the exchange of, shares of Buyer
Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of
a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization,
reclassification, or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding Buyer
Common Stock, the Exchange Ratio (and correspondingly the Option Payment, the
Warrant Payment, the DSU Payment and the RSU Payment) shall be equitably
adjusted; _provided that_ , for the avoidance of doubt, no such adjustment
shall be made with regard to the Buyer Common Stock if (i) Buyer issues
additional shares of Buyer Common Stock and receives consideration for such
shares in a bona fide third party transaction, or (ii) Buyer issues employee
or director stock options, restricted stock awards, grants or similar equity
awards or Buyer issues Buyer Common Stock upon exercise or vesting of any
such options, grants or awards.

otherwise) in any such Subsidiary or any other entity. Except for the
Stockholder Agreement and the Voting Agreements, there are no agreements,
arrangements or other understandings with respect to the voting of Companys
capital stock. Except for the Registration Rights Agreement dated as of

consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2014
and 2015 (the " _Unaudited Financial Statements_ ;" and collectively with the

Statements (including any related notes and schedules thereto) are accurate
and complete in all material respects and fairly present in all material
respects the financial condition and the results of operations, changes in
stockholders equity, and cash flows of Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the respective dates of and for the periods referred to in
such financial statements, all in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied,
subject, in the case of the Unaudited Financial Statements, to normal,
recurring year-end adjustments (the effect of which has not had, and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect) and the absence of notes and schedules (that, if

Financial Statements). No financial statements of any entity or enterprise

that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of Company or its
Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
system of internal account controls described in the following sentence.
Company and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
in accordance with GAAP. Company has disclosed based on its most recent
evaluations, to its outside auditors and the audit committee of the Company
Board (A) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect Companys ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data and (B) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Companys internal control over financial reporting.

(c) Since January 1, 2010, neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor,
to Companys Knowledge, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant
or representative of Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received or
otherwise had or obtained Knowledge of any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Company or any of

requirements of applicable Laws and regulations. Except as set forth in
_Company Disclosure Schedule 3.09_ , other than normal examinations conducted
by a Governmental Authority in the Ordinary Course of Business of Company and
its Subsidiaries, no Governmental Authority has notified Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that it has initiated any proceeding or, to Companys Knowledge,
threatened an investigation into the business or operations of Company or any
of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2010. There is no unresolved violation,
criticism, or exception by any Governmental Authority with respect to any
report or statement relating to any examinations or inspections of Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in _Company Disclosure Schedule
3.09_ , there have been no formal or informal inquiries by, or disagreements
or disputes with, any Governmental Authority with respect to the business,
operations, policies or procedures of Company or any of its Subsidiaries since

principles or practices, other than changes required by applicable Law or GAAP
or regulatory accounting as concurred by Companys independent accountants;
(c) any entry by Company or any of its Subsidiaries into any contract
or commitment of (i) more than $100,000 or (ii) $50,000 per annum with a term
of more than one year, other than purchases or sales of Company Investment
Securities, and loans and loan commitments, all in the Ordinary Course of

business or that in any manner relates to their capital adequacy, credit or
risk management policies, dividend policies, management, business or
operations, nor has Company or any of its Subsidiaries been advised by any
Governmental Authority that it is considering issuing or requesting (or is

contracts, policies or arrangements in (i)-(iii) hereof, with the exception
of plans, contracts, policies or arrangements sponsored or maintained by an
ERISA Affiliate, are collectively referred to as the " _Company Benefit Plans_
"), are identified and described in _Company Disclosure Schedule 3.16(a)_.
Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates has any stated
plan, intention or commitment to establish any new company benefit plan or has
made any specific commitment to modify any Company Benefit Plan (except to
the extent required by Law).

(b) Company has made available to Buyer true and complete copies of all
Company Benefit Plans including, but not limited to, any trust instruments
and insurance contracts forming a part of any Company Benefit Plans and all
amendments thereto, summary plan descriptions and summary of material

all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code in all material respects.
Each Company Benefit Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code (" _Company 401(a) Plan_"), has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS, or is maintained under a prototype or
volume submitter document and is entitled to rely on a favorable opinion or
advisory letter from the IRS, and neither Company nor Company Bank is
aware of any circumstance that could reasonably be expected to result in
revocation of any such favorable determination, opinion, or advisory letter or
the loss of the qualification of such Company 401(a) Plan under Section 401(a)
of the Code, and nothing has occurred that would reasonably be expected to
result in the Company 401(a) Plan ceasing to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of

 



18  the Code. All Company Benefit Plans have been administered in accordance
with their terms in all material respects. There is no pending or, to
Companys Knowledge, threatened litigation or regulatory action relating to
the Company Benefit Plans. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
engaged in a transaction with respect to any Company Benefit Plan, including a
Company 401(a) Plan that could reasonably be expected to subject Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to a material tax or material penalty under any Law
including, but not limited to, Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of
ERISA. No Company 401(a) Plan has been submitted under or been the subject of
an IRS voluntary compliance program submission that is still outstanding or
that has not been fully corrected in accordance with a compliance statement
issued by the IRS with respect to any applicable failures. There are no
audits, investigations, inquiries or proceedings pending or, to Companys
knowledge, threatened by the IRS or the Department of Labor with respect to
any Company Benefit Plan.

expected to be incurred by Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliates with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single employer
plan," within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or
formerly maintained by Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
ERISA Affiliates. Neither Company, Company Bank nor any ERISA Affiliate has
ever maintained a plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the
Code. None of Company, Company Bank, or any ERISA Affiliate has contributed to
(or been obligated to contribute to) a "multiemployer plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA at any time and neither Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates have incurred, and do not expect to incur,
any withdrawal liability with respect to a multiemployer plan under Subtitle
E of Title IV of ERISA (regardless of whether based on contributions of an
ERISA Affiliate). No notice of a "reportable event," within the meaning of
Section 4043 of ERISA has been required to be filed for any Company Benefit
Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate or will be required to be filed in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(e) All contributions required to be made with respect to all Company Benefit
Plans have been timely made or have been reflected on the consolidated
financial statements of Company.

Benefit Plan provides and Company has not proposed or promised any
arrangement that provides for any liability to provide life insurance, medical
or other employee welfare benefits to any Company Employee, or any of their
affiliates, upon his or her retirement or termination of employment for any
reason, except as may be required by Law.

(g) Except as set forth in _Company Disclosure Schedule 3.16(g)_ or otherwise
provided for in this Agreement, neither the execution of this Agreement,
stockholder approval of this Agreement or consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will (i) entitle any Company
Employee to severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any
termination of employment, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting
(except as required by Law) or trigger any payment or funding (through
a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the
amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any of
the Company Benefit Plans, (iii) result in any breach or violation of, or a
default under, any of the Company Benefit Plans, (iv) result in any payment
that would be an excess "parachute

 



19  payment" to a "disqualified individual" as those terms are defined in
Section 280G of the Code, or (v) limit or restrict the right of Company or
Company Bank or, after the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, to merge, amend or terminate any of
the Company Benefit Plans.

 

(h) Each Company Benefit Plan that is a non-qualified deferred compensation
plan or arrangement within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, and any
underlying award, is in compliance in all material respects with Section 409A
of the Code. No payment or award that has been made to any participant under a
Company Benefit Plan is subject to the interest and penalties specified in
Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
(i) has agreed to reimburse or indemnify any participant in a Company Benefit
Plan for any of the interest and the penalties specified in Section
409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code that may be currently due or triggered in the
future, or (ii) has been required to report to any Government Authority any
correction or taxes due as a result of a failure to comply with Section
409A of the Code.

(i) _Company Disclosure Schedule 3.16(i)_ contains a schedule showing the
monetary amounts payable as of the date specified in such schedule, whether
individually or in the aggregate (including good faith estimates of all
amounts not subject to precise quantification as of the date of this
Agreement, such as change-in-control payments based, in part, upon incentive
payments earned in 2015 but payable in January 2016), under any employment,
change-in-control, severance or similar contract, plan or arrangement with or
which covers any present or former director, officer, employee or consultant
of Company or any of its Subsidiaries who may be entitled to any such amount
and identifying the types and estimated amounts of the in-kind benefits due
under any Company Benefit Plans (other than a plan qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code) for each such person, specifying the assumptions in such
schedule and providing estimates of other required contributions to any trusts
for any related fees or expenses.

 

(j) Company and its Subsidiaries have correctly classified all individuals who
directly or indirectly perform services for Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for purposes of each Company Benefit Plan, ERISA, and the Code.

Section 3.17 _Labor Matters_. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
a party to or bound by any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other
agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization, nor is
there any proceeding pending or, to Companys Knowledge threatened, asserting
that Company or any of its Subsidiaries has committed an unfair labor practice
(within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act) or seeking to compel
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to bargain with any labor organization as
to wages or conditions of employment, nor is there any strike or other labor
dispute involving it pending or, to Companys Knowledge, threatened, nor is
Company or Company Bank aware of any activity involving Company
Employees seeking to certify a collective bargaining unit or engaging in
other organizational activity. Company and its Subsidiaries have correctly
classified all individuals who directly or indirectly perform services for
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for purposes of federal and state
unemployment compensation Laws, workers compensation Laws and the rules and
regulations of the U.S. Department of Labor.

or assessed by any taxing authority against Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(d) Company has made available to Buyer true and complete copies of the United
States federal, state, local, and foreign consolidated income Tax Returns
filed with respect to Company for taxable periods ended December 31, 2014,
2013, 2012 and 2011. Company has delivered to Buyer correct and complete

or foreign Law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise.

(g) The unpaid Taxes of Company (i) do not exceed the reserve for Tax
liability (which reserve is distinct and different from any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) set forth on the face of the Financial Statements delivered to Buyer
(rather than in any notes thereto), and (ii) do not exceed that reserve as
adjusted for the passage of time in accordance with the past custom and
practice of Company in filing its Tax Returns. Since December 31, 2014,

gains or losses, as that term is used in GAAP, outside the Ordinary Course of

cooperate and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts (i) to
prepare all documentation (including the Proxy Statement-Prospectus), to
effect all filings, to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Regulatory
Approvals and all other consents and approvals of a Governmental Authority
required to consummate the Merger in the manner contemplated herein,
including, without limitation, the final consent of the FDIC to the
assignment, assumption and transfer of all purchase and assumption and related
loss-share agreements, that have not been terminated, between Company Bank and
the FDIC, as receiver and acting in its corporate capacity (collectively, the
" _FDIC Agreements_"), to Buyer and Buyer Bank, (ii) to comply with the terms
and conditions of such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations and
(iii) to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated as expeditiously as practicable; _provided, however_ , that in no
event shall Buyer be required to agree to any prohibition, limitation, or
other requirement which would prohibit or materially limit the ownership or
operation by Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or by Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries, of all or any material portion of the business or assets of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Buyer or its Subsidiaries, or
compel Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of all or any material
portion of the business or assets of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or continue any portion of any Company
Regulatory Agreement against Buyer after the Merger except as set forth on
_Company Disclosure Schedule 5.06(a)_ (together, the " _Burdensome Conditions_
"). Buyer and Company will furnish each other and each others counsel with
all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors,
trustees, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be necessary
or advisable in connection with any application, petition or any other
statement or application made by or on behalf of Buyer or Company to any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Each party hereto shall have the right to review and approve
in advance all characterizations of the information relating to such party
and any of its Subsidiaries that appear in any filing made in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any Governmental
Authority. In addition, Buyer and Company shall each furnish to the other for
review a copy of each such filing made in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement with any Governmental Authority prior to its
filing.

 



43 (b) Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts, and Buyer shall
reasonably cooperate with Company at Companys request, to obtain all
consents, approvals, authorizations, waivers or similar affirmations described
on _Company Disclosure Schedule 3.13(c)_. Each party will notify the other
party promptly and shall promptly furnish the other party with copies of
notices or other communications received by such party or any of its
Subsidiaries of any communication from any Person alleging that the consent of
such Person (or another Person) is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the response thereto from
such party, its Subsidiaries or its representatives). Company will consult
with Buyer and its representatives as often as practicable under the
circumstances so as to permit Company and Buyer and their respective
representatives to cooperate to take appropriate measures to obtain such
consents and avoid or mitigate any adverse consequences that may result from
the foregoing.

 

Section 5.07 _Publicity_. Buyer and Company shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statement without the prior consent of the other party,
which shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld; _provided, however_ ,
that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party (but after such
consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances), issue such
press release or make such public statements as may upon the advice of counsel
be required by Law or the rules and regulations of any stock exchanges. It is
understood that Buyer shall assume primary responsibility for the preparation
of joint press releases relating to this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.08 _Access; Current Information_.

 

(a) For the purposes of verifying the representations and warranties of the
other and preparing for the Merger and the other matters contemplated by this
Agreement, upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to
the exchange of information, Company agrees to afford Buyer and its officers,
employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized representatives
such access during normal business hours at any time and from time to time
throughout the period prior to the Effective Time to Companys and Companys
Subsidiaries books, records (including, without limitation, Tax Returns and
work papers of independent auditors), information technology systems,
properties and personnel and to such other information relating to them as
Buyer may reasonably request and Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide any appropriate notices to employees and/or customers in
accordance with applicable Law and Companys privacy policy and, during such
period, Company shall furnish to Buyer, upon Buyers reasonable request, all
such other information concerning the business, properties and personnel of
Company and its Subsidiaries that is substantially similar in scope to the
information provided to Buyer in connection with its diligence review prior to
the date of this Agreement.

 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after they become available, Company
will furnish to Buyer copies of the board packages distributed to the Company
Board or board of

 



44  directors of Company Bank, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, and
minutes from the meetings thereof, copies of any internal management financial
control reports showing actual financial performance against plan and
previous period, and copies of any reports provided to the Company Board or
any committee thereof relating to the financial performance and risk
management of Company.

 

(c) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
each of Company and Buyer will cause one or more of its designated
representatives to confer on a regular basis with representatives of the other
party and to report the general status of the ongoing operations of Company
and its Subsidiaries and Buyer and its Subsidiaries, respectively. Without
limiting the foregoing, Company agrees to provide to Buyer (i) a copy of each
report filed by Company or any of its Subsidiaries with a Governmental
Authority within one (1) Business Day following the filing thereof, (ii) a
copy of Companys monthly loan trial balance within one (1) Business Day of
the end of the month, and (iii) a copy of Companys monthly statement of
condition and profit and loss statement within five (5) Business Days of the
end of the month and, if requested by Buyer, a copy of Companys daily
statement of condition and daily profit and loss statement, which shall be
provided within two (2) Business Days of such request.

 

(d) Not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Company
shall obtain and cause to be delivered simultaneously to Company and Buyer
for their respective review and approval a current valuation, as of a date not
more than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, of all securities
in the investment portfolio of Company and its Subsidiaries. Such valuation
shall initially be prepared by Interactive Data Corporation (" _IDC_ "), and
shall follow the methodology, procedures and approach consistent with those
employed in the September 30, 2015 investment portfolio valuation prepared by
IDC for Company and its Subsidiaries. Neither party will discuss the valuation
with IDC or attempt to influence IDCs valuation in any way. Each party shall
have one (1) Business Day after receipt to evaluate the IDC report, including
the Closing Date Mark-to-Market Valuation, and either accept it or request a
second valuation. If either party requests a second valuation then both Buyer
and Company will jointly present a request for a second Closing Date Mark-to-
Market Valuation (the " _Second Valuation_ ") to Standard and Poors Securities
Evaluations, Inc. (" _S andP_"). To the extent any of the securities in Company
and its Subsidiaries investment portfolio are not valued by SandP, a third
nationally recognized valuation service to be selected by mutual agreement of
the parties shall value those specific securities, such valuation to comprise
part of the Second Valuation. If the resulting Closing Date Mark-to-Market
Valuation arrived at using the Second Valuation differs from the resulting
Closing Date Mark-to-Market Valuation determined using the IDC valuation by
one percent (1%) or less, the resulting Closing Date Mark-to-Market valuation
provided by IDC will be used by the parties in connection with the Closing of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If the resulting Closing Date
Mark-to-Market Valuation arrived at using the Second Valuation differs from
the resulting Closing Date Mark-to-Market Valuation using the IDC valuation by
more than one percent (1%), the mean average of the Closing Date Mark-to-
Market Valuations in the IDC valuation and the Second Valuation will be used
by the parties in connection with the Closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The (i) IDC Closing Date Mark-to-Market
Valuation or (ii) mean average of such valuation and the Closing Date Mark-to-
Market Valuation contained as part of the Second Valuation, whichever is
applicable, is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Securities
Valuation_."

 



45 (e) No investigation by Buyer or its representatives shall be deemed to modify
or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Company or
Company Bank set forth in this Agreement, or the conditions to the respective
obligations of Buyer and Company to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

(f) Company shall not be required to copy Buyer on any documents that disclose
confidential discussions of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or any other matter that Companys or Company Banks board of directors
has been advised by counsel that such distribution to Buyer may violate a
confidentiality obligation or fiduciary duty or any Law or regulation, or may
result in a waiver of Companys attorney-client privilege. In the event any of
the restrictions in this _Section 5.08(f)_ shall apply, Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to provide appropriate consents, waivers, decrees and
approvals necessary to satisfy any confidentiality issues relating to
documents prepared or held by third parties (including work papers), the
parties will make appropriate alternate disclosure arrangements, including
adopting additional specific procedures to protect the confidentiality of
sensitive material and to ensure compliance with applicable Laws.

Section 5.09  _No Solicitation by Company; Superior Proposals_.

(a) Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and each of
their respective officers, directors and employees not to, and will not
authorize any investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants,
consultants, affiliates or other agents of Company or any of Companys
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Company Representatives_ ") to, directly
or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, induce or knowingly encourage, or take
any action to facilitate the making of, any inquiry, offer or proposal which
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal; (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any
Acquisition Proposal or furnish, or otherwise afford access, to any Person
(other than Buyer) any information or data with respect to Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal; (iii)
release any Person from, waive any provisions of, or fail to enforce any
confidentiality agreement or standstill agreement to which Company is a
party; or (iv) enter into any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of
intent with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or approve or resolve to
approve any Acquisition Proposal or any agreement, agreement in principle
or letter of intent relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Any violation of the
foregoing restrictions by any of the Company Representatives, whether or not
such Company Representative is so authorized and whether or not such Company
Representative is purporting to act on behalf of Company or otherwise, shall
be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by Company. Company and its
Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause each of the Company Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all existing
discussions, negotiations, and communications with any Persons with respect to
any existing or potential Acquisition Proposal.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any
inquiry, offer or proposal (other than an inquiry, offer or proposal from
Buyer), whether or not in writing, contemplating, relating to, or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Transaction.

 



46 For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Transaction_ " shall mean (A)
any transaction or series of transactions involving any merger, consolidation,
recapitalization, share exchange, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (B) any transaction
pursuant to which any third party or group acquires or would acquire (whether
through sale, lease or other disposition), directly or indirectly, a
significant portion of the assets of Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (C)
any issuance, sale or other disposition of (including by way of merger,
consolidation, share exchange or any similar transaction) securities (or
options, rights or warrants to purchase or securities convertible into, such
securities) representing 20% or more of the votes attached to the outstanding
securities of Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (D) any tender offer or
exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any third party or group
beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity securities of Company
or any of its Subsidiaries; or (E) any transaction which is similar in form,
substance or purpose to any of the foregoing transactions, or any combination
of the foregoing.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide,
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal (i) that if consummated would result in a
third party (or in the case of a direct merger between such third party and
Company or Company Bank, the stockholders of such third party) acquiring,
directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the outstanding Company Common Stock
or more than 50% of the assets of Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities and (ii) that
Company Board reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel, (A) is reasonably
capable of being completed, taking into account all financial, legal,
regulatory and other aspects of such proposal, including all conditions
contained therein and the person making such Acquisition Proposal, and (B)
taking into account any changes to this Agreement proposed by Buyer in
response to such Acquisition Proposal, as contemplated by paragraph (c) of
this _Section 5.09_, and all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects
of such takeover proposal, including all conditions contained therein and the
person making such proposal, is more favorable to the stockholders of Company
from a financial point of view than the Merger.

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 5.09(a)_ or any other provision of this
Agreement, prior to the date of the Company Meeting, Company may take any of
the actions described in _Section 5.09(a)_ if, but only if, (i) Company has
received a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that did not
result from a breach of this  _Section 5.09_; (ii) the Company Board
reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with and having
considered the advice of its outside financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that (A) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably
likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) it is reasonably necessary to
take such actions to comply with its fiduciary duties to Companys
stockholders under applicable Law; (iii) Company has provided Buyer with at
least three (3) Business Days prior notice of such determination; and (iv)
prior to furnishing or affording access to any information or data with
respect to Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an
Acquisition Proposal, Company receives from such Person a confidentiality
agreement with terms no less favorable to Company than those contained in the
confidentiality agreement with Buyer. Company shall promptly provide to Buyer
any non-public information regarding Company or its Subsidiaries provided to
any other Person which was not previously provided to Buyer, such additional
information to be provided no later than the date of provision of such
information to such other party.

 



47 (c) Company shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) notify Buyer in
writing if any proposals or offers are received by, any information is
requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated
or continued with, Company or the Company Representatives, in each case in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal, and such notice shall indicate the
name of the Person initiating such discussions or negotiations or making such
proposal, offer or information request and the material terms and conditions
of any proposals or offers (and, in the case of written materials relating to
such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or discussion,
providing copies of such materials (including e-mails or other electronic
communications) except to the extent that such materials
constitute confidential information of the party making such offer or
proposal under an effective confidentiality agreement). Company agrees that it
shall keep Buyer informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status and
terms of any such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or
discussions (including any amendments or modifications to such proposal, offer
or request).

(d) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw,
qualify, amend or modify, or propose to withdraw, qualify, amend or modify, in
a manner adverse to Buyer in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the Merger), the Company Recommendation, fail to
reaffirm the Company Recommendation within five (5) Business Days following a
request by Buyer, or make any statement, filing or release, in connection with
the Company Meeting or otherwise, inconsistent with the Company
Recommendation (it being understood that taking a neutral position or no
position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal shall be considered an
adverse modification of the Company Recommendation); (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal; or
(iii) enter into (or cause Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into)
any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other
agreement (A) related to any Acquisition Transaction (other than a
confidentiality agreement entered into in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 5.09(b)_) or (B) requiring Company to abandon, terminate or fail
to consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement.

(e) Notwithstanding _Section 5.09(d)_, prior to the date of the Company
Meeting, the Company Board may withdraw, qualify, amend or modify the Company
Recommendation (a " _Company Subsequent Determination_ ") after the
fifth (5th) Business Day following Buyers receipt of a notice (the " _Notice
of Superior Proposal_ ") from Company advising Buyer that the Company Board
has decided that a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that it
received (that did not result from a breach of this _Section 5.09_)
constitutes a Superior Proposal if, but only if, (i) the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with and having considered the
advice of outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that it is
reasonably necessary to take such actions to comply with its fiduciary duties
to Companys stockholders under applicable Law, (ii) during the five (5)
Business Day period after receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal by Buyer
(the " _Notice Period_ "), Company and the Company Board shall have cooperated
and negotiated in good faith with Buyer to make such adjustments,
modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as
would enable Company to proceed with the Company Recommendation without a
Company Subsequent Determination; _provided, however_ , that Buyer shall not
have any obligation to propose any adjustments, modifications or amendments to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and

 



48  (iii) at the end of the Notice Period, after taking into account any such
adjusted, modified or amended terms as may have been proposed by Buyer since
its receipt of such Notice of Superior Proposal, the Company Board has again
in good faith made the determination (A) in clause (i) of this _Section
5.09(e)_ and (B) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal. In the event of any material revisions to the Superior Proposal,
Company shall be required to deliver a new Notice of Superior Proposal to
Buyer and again comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.09(e)_,
except that the Notice Period shall be reduced to three (3) Business Days.

(f) Notwithstanding any Company Subsequent Determination, this Agreement shall
be submitted to Companys stockholders at the Company Meeting for the purpose
of voting on the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Merger) and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
relieve Company of such obligation;  _provided, however_ , that if the
Company Board shall have made a Company Subsequent Determination with respect
to a Superior Proposal, then the Company Board may recommend approval of such
Superior Proposal by the stockholders of Company and may submit this
Agreement to Companys stockholders without recommendation, in which event the
Company Board shall communicate the basis for its recommendation of such
Superior Proposal and the basis for its lack of a recommendation with respect
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to Companys
stockholders in the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or an appropriate amendment or
supplement thereto.

 

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.09_ shall prohibit Company or the
Company Board from complying with Companys obligations required under Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided, however_ , that any
such disclosure relating to an Acquisition Proposal (other than a "stop, look
and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed a change in the Company
Recommendation unless the Company Board reaffirms the Company Recommendation
in such disclosure.

 

Section 5.10 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, and in
any event subject to the provisions of  _Section 5.10(b)(iv)_ , Buyer shall
indemnify and hold harmless the present and former directors and officers of
Company and Company Bank (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against all costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative arising out of actions or omissions of such persons in the
course of performing their duties for Company or Company Bank occurring at or
before the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) (each a " _Claim_ "), to the same extent as such persons have the
right to be indemnified pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws of Company or Company Bank in effect on the date of this Agreement, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this _Section
5.10_ shall promptly notify Buyer upon learning of any Claim, _provided that_
, failure to so notify shall not affect the obligation of Buyer under this
_Section 5.10_, unless, and only to the extent that,

 



49  Buyer is materially prejudiced in the defense of such Claim as a
consequence. In the event of any such Claim (whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time), (i) Buyer shall have the right to assume
the defense thereof and Buyer shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties
for any legal expenses or other counsel or any other expenses subsequently
incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof,
(ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter,
(iii) Buyer shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior
written consent and (iv) Buyer shall have no obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party if such indemnification would be in violation of any
applicable federal or state banking Laws or regulations, or in the event that
a federal or state banking agency or a court of competent jurisdiction
shall determine that indemnification of an Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Laws and regulations, whether
or not related to banking Laws.

 

(c) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Buyer will use
its commercially reasonable efforts to provide directors and officers
liability insurance (herein, " _D andO Insurance_") that serves to reimburse the
present and former officers and directors of Company or its Subsidiaries
(determined as of the Effective Time) with respect to claims against such
directors and officers arising from facts or events occurring before the
Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated hereby), which
insurance will contain at least the same coverage and amounts, and contain
terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Party, as that
coverage currently provided by Company; _provided that_ , if Buyer is unable
to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this _Section 5.10_, Buyer
will provide as much comparable insurance as is reasonably available (subject
to the limitations described below in this _Section 5.10(c)_); and _provided,
further,_ that officers and directors of Company or its Subsidiaries may be
required to make application and provide customary representations and
warranties to the carrier of the DandO Insurance for the purpose of obtaining
such insurance. In no event shall Buyer be required to expend for such tail
insurance a premium amount in excess of an amount equal to 200% of the annual
premiums paid by Company for DandO Insurance in effect as of the date of this
Agreement (the " _Maximum D andO Tail Premium_"). If the cost of such tail
insurance exceeds the Maximum DandO Tail Premium, Buyer shall obtain tail
insurance coverage or a separate tail insurance policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum DandO Tail Premium.

 

(d) If Buyer or any of its successors and assigns (i) shall consolidate with
or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
shall transfer all or substantially all of its property and assets to any
individual, corporation or other entity, then, in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer
and its Subsidiaries shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section
5.10_.

 

Section 5.11 _Employees; Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) Employees of Company and Company Bank shall be retained as "at will"
employees after the Effective Time as employees of Buyer or Buyer Bank;
_provided_ , that continued retention by Buyer Bank of such employees
subsequent to the Effective Time shall be subject to Buyer Banks normal and
customary employment procedures and practices, including customary
background screening and evaluation procedures, and satisfactory employment

 



50  performance. In addition, Company and Company Bank agree, upon Buyers
reasonable request, to facilitate discussions between Buyer and Company
Employees a reasonable time in advance of the Closing Date regarding
employment, consulting or other arrangements to be effective prior to or
following the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, any interaction
between Buyer and Company Employees shall be coordinated by Company or
Company Bank.

(b) Company Employees (other than those listed in _Company Disclosure Schedule
5.11(b)_ who are parties to an employment, change-of-control or other type of
agreement which provides for severance) as of the date of the Agreement who
remain employed by Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective
Time, who become employees of Buyer Bank at the Effective Time and whose
employment is terminated by Buyer or Buyer Bank (absent termination for cause
as determined by the employer) within one hundred eighty (180) days after the
Effective Time shall receive severance pay in accordance with
Buyers standard practices (which may include a severance agreement and
general release of claims to be provided by the terminated employee) equal to
one (1) week of base weekly pay for each completed year of employment service
commencing with any such employees most recent hire date with Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (including service with any predecessor companies or banks
as set forth in Companys records) and ending with such employees termination
date with Buyer, with a minimum payment equal to two (2) weeks of base pay
and a maximum payment equal to twelve (12) weeks of base pay (unless otherwise
agreed in a separate written agreement between such employee and Buyer Bank).
Subject to the terms and execution of the severance agreement and general
release of claims by such employee, such severance payment will be made in
accordance with the terms stated in the severance document and such severance
payments will be in lieu of any severance pay plans that may be in effect at
Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. No officer or
employee of Company or any of its Subsidiaries is, or shall be, entitled to
receive duplicative severance payments and benefits under (i) an employment
or severance agreement; (ii) a severance or change-of-control plan; (iii) this
_Section 5.11_; or (iv) any other program or arrangement.

 

(c) Effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Effective
Time, Company shall provide Buyer with a copy of the appropriate board
resolutions and plan amendments, if applicable, evidencing that all Company
Benefit Plans intended to qualify under Section 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code
are in the process of being terminated effective as of no later than the
day immediately preceding the Effective Time. The form and substance of such
resolutions or plan amendment shall be subject to the review and reasonable
and timely approval of Buyer. Company shall take such additional actions that
may be necessary or appropriate, including but not limited to any necessary
amendments and notices, to terminate the Company Stock Plans, the Community and
Southern Bank Annual Incentive Compensation Plan and the Community and Southern
Bank Severance Plan as of the Effective Time and shall take any additional
actions necessary to terminate the remaining Company Benefit Plans as Buyer
may reasonably request.

 

(d) Company Employees who are retained by Buyer or Buyer Bank shall be
entitled to participate in Buyer Benefit Plans to the same extent
as similarly-situated employees of Buyer or Buyer Bank (it being understood
that inclusion of Company Employees in the Buyer Benefit Plans may occur at
different times with respect to different plans due to reasonable
administrative requirements to enroll such Company Employees in such Buyer
Benefit Plans).

 



51  To the extent allowable under any of such plans, Company Employees shall be
given credit for prior service or employment with Company or Company Bank,
including service with any predecessor companies or banks, and eligible for
any increased benefits under such plans that would apply to such employees as
if they had been eligible for such benefits as of the Effective Time, based on
the length of service or employment with Company or Company Bank, including
service with any predecessor companies or banks. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer may amend or terminate any Buyer Benefit Plan at any time in
its sole discretion.

 

(e) If employees of Company or any of its Subsidiaries become eligible to
participate in a medical, dental or health plan of Buyer or Buyer Bank upon
termination of such plan of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Buyer shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such plan to (i) waive any
pre-existing condition limitations to the extent such conditions are
covered under the applicable medical, health, or dental plans of Buyer or
Buyer Bank, (ii) subject to approval from Buyers insurance carrier, provide
full credit under such plans for any deductible or out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the employees and their beneficiaries during the portion of the
calendar year prior to such participation, and (iii) waive any waiting period
limitation or evidence of insurability requirement which would otherwise be
applicable to such employee on or after the Effective Time, in each case to
the extent such employee had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement
under an analogous plan prior to the Effective Time for the plan year in which
the Effective Time occurs.

 

(f) Except to the extent otherwise expressly provided in this _Section 5.11_,
Buyer shall assume and honor, and Buyer shall be obligated to perform, all
employment, severance, deferred compensation, retirement or "change-in-
control" agreements, plans or policies of Company or Company Bank, but only if
such obligations, rights, agreements, plans or policies are set forth in
_Company Disclosure Schedule 5.11(f)_. Buyer acknowledges that the
consummation of the Merger and Bank Merger will constitute a "change-in-
control" of Company and Company Bank for purposes of any benefit plans,
agreements and arrangements of Company and Company Bank. Nothing herein shall
limit the ability of Buyer or Buyer Bank to amend or terminate any of the
Company Benefit Plans or Buyer Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms
at any time, subject to vested rights of employees and directors that may not
be terminated pursuant to the terms of such Company Benefit Plans.

 

(g) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Company and/or Company Bank, as
applicable, will terminate the employment agreements set forth in  _Company
Disclosure Schedule 5.11(g)_ and pay to each of the parties thereto the
amounts set forth in _Company Disclosure Schedule 5.11(g)_.

 

(h) Buyer will establish a stay bonus pool in an amount to be developed in
consultation with Company, the precise amount to be determined in the sole
discretion of Buyer, in order to encourage and reward Company Employees to
remain with Buyer after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Participants in such pool shall be determined in Buyers
sole discretion after consultation with Company.

(i) Nothing in this _Section 5.11_, expressed or implied, is intended to
confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this _Section 5.11_. Without limiting the foregoing, no

indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of Buyer or its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of

Section 5.15 _Environmental Assessments_.

 

(a) No later than forty-five (45) Business Days after the date hereof, Company

Disclosure Schedule 3.31(a)_ , for the purpose of conducting an ASTM Phase I
and an asbestos and lead base paint survey, as it relates to providing an
environmental site assessment to determine whether any such property may
be impacted by a "recognized environmental condition," as that term is
defined by ASTM. Each Phase I (including the asbestos and lead base paint
surveys) shall be delivered in counterpart copies to Buyer and Company, and
will include customary language allowing both Buyer and Company to rely upon
its findings and conclusions. The Environmental Consultant will provide a
draft of any Phase I to Company and Buyer for review and comment prior to the
finalization of such report.

 

(b) To the extent the final version of any Phase I identifies any "recognized
environmental condition," Company shall cooperate with and grant access to
the Environmental Consultant, during normal business hours (or at such other
times as may be agreed by Company), to the property covered by such Phase I
for the purpose of conducting a Phase II limited site assessment,
including subsurface investigation of soil, soil vapor, and groundwater,
designed to further investigate and evaluate any "recognized environmental
condition" identified in the Phase I, the cost of which shall be shared
equally between Buyer and Company.

(c) Where any Phase I, asbestos or lead base paint survey identifies the
presence or potential presence of radon, asbestos containing materials, mold,
microbial matter, or polychlorinated biphenyls (" _Non-scope Issues_ "),
Company shall cooperate with and grant access to the Environmental Consultant,
during normal business hours (or at such other times as may be agreed by
Company) to the property covered by such Phase I, for the purpose of
conducting surveys and sampling of indoor air and building materials designed
to investigate such identified Non-scope Issue, paid for by Company.

scope of work prepared by the Environmental Consultant and reasonably
acceptable to Company and Buyer. The reports of any Additional Environmental
Assessment will be given directly to Buyer and to Company by the
Environmental Consultant.

(e) To the extent that Buyer identified any past or present events, conditions
or circumstances that would require further investigation, remedial or
cleanup action under

 



54  Environmental Laws, Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
take and complete any such reporting, remediation or other response actions
prior to Closing; _provided, however_ , that, to the extent any such response
actions have not been completed prior to Closing (" _Unresolved Response
Action_ "), Company shall include the amount of the costs expected to be
incurred by the Surviving Entity on or after the Closing Date, as determined
by an independent third party with recognized expertise in environmental
clean-up matters, to fully complete all Unresolved Response Actions in
determining its Closing Consolidated Net Book Value.

 

Section 5.16 _Certain Litigation_. Each party shall promptly advise the other
party orally and in writing of any actual or threatened stockholder
litigation against such party and/or the members of the Company Board or

stockholder litigation and shall not settle any such litigation prior to such
consultation and consideration; _provided, however_ , that Company shall not
settle any such stockholder litigation if such settlement requires the
payment of money damages, without the written consent of Buyer (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld) unless the payment of any such damages by
Company is reasonably expected by Company, following consultation with
outside counsel, to be fully covered (disregarding any deductible to be paid
by Company) under Companys existing director and officer insurance policies,
including any tail policy.

Company Bank, or any of its Subsidiaries, to sell or otherwise divest itself
of such Company Investment Securities and loans as are identified by Buyer and
agreed to in writing between Company and Buyer from time to time prior to
the Closing Date, such identification to include a statement as to Buyers
business reasons for such divestitures, if requested. The economic impact of
such divestitures to Companys earning shall be quantified and included in the
calculation of Closing Consolidated Net Book Value. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no such modifications, changes or divestitures of the type
described in this _Section 5.18(b)_ need be made prior to the satisfaction of

however_ , that no such adjustments need be made prior to the satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in _Section 6.01(b)_.

 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, Company and its Subsidiaries shall take any
actions Buyer may reasonably request in connection with negotiating any
amendments, modifications or terminations of any Leases or Company Material
Contracts that Buyer may request, including but not limited to, actions
necessary to cause any such amendments, modifications or terminations to
become effective prior to, or immediately upon, the Closing, and shall
cooperate with Buyer and use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate
specific provisions that may be requested by Buyer in connection with any such
amendment, modification or termination.

(e) Subject to _Section 5.18(b)_, Buyer and Company shall cooperate (i) to
minimize any potential adverse impact to Buyer under Financial Accounting

shall, upon Buyers reasonable request, introduce Buyer and its

Disclosure Schedule 3.36_ a reasonable good faith estimate of costs and fees
that Company and its Subsidiaries expect to pay to retained representatives in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively,

efforts to cause the aggregate amount of all Company Expenses to not exceed

Section 5.21 _Company Stock Options; Company RSUs; Company DSUs; and Company
Warrants_.

 

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each option to acquire shares of
Company Common Stock (a " _Company Stock Option_ ") granted under the Company
Stock Plans that is outstanding and unexercised, shall become fully vested and
exercisable to the extent unvested. Pursuant to election forms received by
Company at least thirty (30) days prior to the Effective Time, holders of
Company Stock Options shall be given the opportunity to exercise their Company
Stock Options, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, and thereby
to become stockholders of the Company, entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock at the same time and in
the same manner as the other Company stockholders pursuant to _Article II_.
Company may provide for cashless exercise of the Company Stock Options; 
_provided that_ any adjustment to allow for cashless exercise of any Company
Stock Options which are "incentive stock options" under Section 422 of the
Code shall be and is intended to be effected in a manner which is
consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code. Notwithstanding the terms of the
Company Stock Plans or the applicable award agreement, Company shall not
reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock deliverable upon exercise
of Company Stock Options by applicable Taxes required to be withheld, it
being understand that any such amount required to be withheld shall be paid to
Company by the holder thereof with cash. At the Effective Time, all Company
Stock Options not 

 



57  exercised pursuant to the foregoing shall be cancelled and converted into
only the right to receive, within two (2) Business Days after the Closing
Date, or as promptly as practicable thereafter, a number of shares of Buyer
Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the product of (x)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option and (y) the excess, if any, of the Fully Diluted Company Stock Price
over the per share exercise price, as set forth in such holders award
agreement with respect to such Company Stock Option by (2) the Buyer Average
Stock Price (the " _Option Payment_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
holder of any such Company Stock Option shall be entitled to receive a cash
payment (without interest and rounded to the nearest cent) in lieu of any
fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock that become issuable to the holder
pursuant to this _Section 5.21_, which payment shall be determined by
multiplying (1) the Buyer Average Stock Price by (2) the fractional share of
Buyer Common Stock (rounded to the nearest one hundredth of a share) which
such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive, less applicable Taxes
required to be withheld (" _Fractional Share Payment_ ").

 

(b) As of the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award (each a "
_Company RSU_ ") granted under the Company Stock Plans, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested, shall vest in
full and be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such Company RSU to
receive, within two (2) Business Days after the Closing Date, or as promptly
as practicable thereafter, a number of shares of Buyer Common Stock equal to
the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying
such Company RSU, multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio (the " _RSU Payment_
"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holder of any such Company RSU shall be
entitled to receive a Fractional Share Payment in lieu of any fractional
shares of Buyer Common Stock that become issuable to the holder pursuant to
this _Section 5.21_.

(c) As of the Effective Time, each deferred stock unit award (each a "
_Company DSU_ ") granted under the Company Stock Plans, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled and shall only
entitle the holder of such Company DSU to receive, within two (2) Business
Days after the Closing Date, or as promptly as practicable thereafter, a
number of shares of Buyer Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company DSU, multiplied by
(ii) the Exchange Ratio (the " _DSU Payment_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the holder of any such Company DSU shall be entitled to receive a
Fractional Share Payment in lieu of any fractional shares of Buyer
Common Stock that become issuable to the holder pursuant to this _Section
5.21_.

(d) As of the Effective Time, each warrant to acquire shares of Company
Common Stock (a " _Company Warrant_ ") that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall vest as of the Effective Time
to the extent unvested and shall be cancelled and converted into only the
right to receive, within two (2) Business Days after the Closing Date, or as
promptly as practicable thereafter, a number of shares of Buyer Common Stock
equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the product of (x) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Warrant and (y) the
excess, if any, of the Fully Diluted Company Stock Price over the per share
exercise price, as set forth in such holders award agreement with respect to
such Company Warrant, by (2) the Buyer Average Stock Price (the " _Warrant
Payment_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holder of any such Company
Warrants shall be entitled to receive a Fractional Share Payment in lieu of
any fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock that become issuable to the holder
pursuant to this _Section 5.21_.

 



58 (e) If so elected by the holder of a Company Stock Option, Company RSU or
Company DSU, as applicable, pursuant to election forms received by Company at
least thirty (30) days prior to the Effective Time, the Option Payment, the
RSU Payment and the DSU Payment and any Fractional Share Payments otherwise
deliverable pursuant to  _Section 5.21(a), (b) and (c)_ to the holder of any
such awards, shall be reduced by applicable Taxes required to be withheld. For
purposes of the satisfaction of any Tax withholding that is satisfied at the
Effective Time through a reduction in the number of shares of Buyer Common
Stock otherwise deliverable to the holder of Company Stock Options, Company
RSUs and Company DSUs under this _Section 5.21(a), (b) and (c)_, (i) the
value of the shares of Buyer Common Stock so withheld shall be based on the
Buyer Average Stock Price, and (ii) cash equal to the amount required to be
withheld shall be remitted by Buyer (through the Exchange Agent, if
applicable) to the applicable Governmental Authority and for all purposes of
this Agreement such amount shall be treated as having been paid to the holder
of Company Stock Options, Company RSUs and Company DSUs in respect of which
such Tax withholding was made.

 

(f) Company shall take all requisite action so that, as of the Effective Time,
all Company Stock Options, Company RSUs, Company DSUs, Company Warrants and
any other Rights, contingent or accrued, to acquire or receive Company Common
Stock or benefits measured by the value of such shares, and each award of any
kind consisting of Company Common Stock that may be held, awarded,
outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under the Company Stock Plans,
or otherwise, immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then
vested or exercisable, shall be, terminated and cancelled as of the Effective
Time.

 

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such
resolutions or take such other actions, including obtaining any necessary
consents or amendments to the applicable award agreements and equity plans, as
may be required to effectuate the provisions of this _Section 5.21_.
Prior to the receipt of shares of Buyer Common Stock pursuant to this
_Section 5.21_, each holder of a Company Stock Option, Company RSU, Company
DSU and Company Warrant, shall execute and deliver such consents, documents or
other acknowledgements as Buyer may reasonably request, in such forms
reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Company.

Section 5.22 _Tax Matters_. The parties intend that the Merger qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that this
Agreement constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Section
1.368-2(g) of the Regulations. Except as expressly contemplated or permitted
by this Agreement, from and after the date of this Agreement and until the
Effective Time, each of Buyer and Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code, and will not knowingly take any action, cause
any action to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to
be taken which action or failure to act is intended or is reasonably likely
to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 



59 Section 5.23 _Notice of Non-Renewal_. To avoid the costs and expenses
associated with terminating certain Company Material Contracts, Company shall
have provided written notice to the vendors set forth in _Company Disclosure
Schedule 5.23_ , notifying such vendors, by the date specified, of the
Companys intent not to renew the applicable agreement as set forth in such
schedule and shall negotiate with such vendor, in coordination with Buyer, any
necessary continued use agreements needed until conversion. In the event that
(w) Company has provided the written notices required under this _Section
5.23_ in a timely manner as set forth in _Company Disclosure Schedule 5.23_ ,
(x) the Merger has not been consummated by the Expiration Date (provided that
the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall not be due to any
material breach of this Agreement by Company or Company Bank), (y) Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, in coordination with Buyer, have negotiated and
entered into extensions or amendments to the agreements identified in
_Company Disclosure Schedule 5.23_ necessary in order to continue to receive
the services of the applicable vendor until conversion, and (z) such
extensions, amendments or continued use agreements increase Companys
or Company Banks current monthly cost, as set forth on _Company Disclosure
Schedule 5.23_ as of the date hereof, then to the extent that such increased
monthly costs are directly related to the continued use of such agreements
after their respective expiration date, Buyer agrees to reimburse Company, up
to a maximum amount of $250,000 in the aggregate, for the additional cost
incurred by Company during the period beginning after the Expiration Date
through the Closing Date or the date this Agreement is terminated, whichever
is earlier. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall have no obligation to
make any payments or reimbursements to Company or Company Bank under this
_Section 5.23_ if Company or Company Bank terminates this Agreement for any
reason.

Section 5.24 _Termination of Stockholders  Agreement_. The Company agrees to
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from each stockholder who
is a party to the Stockholders Agreement dated January 20, 2010 (the "
_Stockholder Agreement_ ") with respect to shares of Company Common Stock,
and deliver to Buyer as soon as practicable, but in no event later than ten
(10) days prior to the Closing, an executed counterpart to a termination
agreement that provides for the termination of the Stockholder Agreement. Such
termination agreement shall be in form and substance satisfactory to Buyer
and shall provide that if this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective
Time, the Stockholder Agreement will again be in effect.

party seeking to terminate this Agreement.

 

(g) _Failure to Recommend; Etc_. In addition to and not in limitation of
Buyers termination rights under  _Section 7.01(e)_, by Buyer if (i) there

Section 7.02 _Termination Fee; Liquidated Damages_.

 

(a) In recognition of the efforts, expenses and other opportunities foregone
by Buyer while structuring and pursuing the Merger, Company shall pay to
Buyer a termination fee equal to $23.9 million (" _Termination Fee_ "), by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified by Buyer
in the event of any of the following: (i) in the event Buyer terminates this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(g)_, Company shall pay Buyer the
Termination Fee within two (2) Business Days after receipt of Buyers
notification of such termination; and (ii) in the event that after the date
of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement, an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to senior management of
Company or has been made directly to its stockholders generally or any Person
shall have publicly announced (and not withdrawn) an Acquisition Proposal
with respect to Company and (A) thereafter this Agreement is terminated (x) by
either Buyer or Company pursuant to _Section 7.01(c)_ because the Requisite
Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained or (y) by Buyer
pursuant to _Section 7.01(d)_ or _Section 7.01(e)_ and (B) prior to the date
that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, Company enters
into any agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that
referred to above), then Company shall, on the earlier of the date it enters
into such agreement and the date of consummation of such transaction, pay
Buyer the Termination Fee, _provided_ , that for purposes of this _Section
7.02(a)(ii)_, all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to

65 (b) The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that if a party terminates this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(d)_ or _Section 7.01(e)_ by reason of
the other partys material breach of the provisions of this Agreement
contemplated by _Section 7.01(d)_ or _Section 7.01(e)_ that is not timely
cured as provided in such sections, the actual damages sustained by the
terminating party, including the expenses incurred by the terminating party
preparatory to entering into this Agreement and in connection with the
performance of its obligations under this Agreement, would be significant and
difficult to ascertain, gauged by the circumstances existing at the time this
Agreement is executed, and that in lieu of the terminating party being
required to pursue its damage claims in costly litigation proceedings in such
event, the parties agree that the non-terminating party shall pay a reasonable
estimate of the amount of such damages, which the parties agree is the sum of
$2,000,000 (the " _Liquidated Damages Payment_ "), as liquidated damages to
the terminating party, which payment is not intended as a penalty, within two
(2) Business Days after the terminating partys notification of such
termination.

 

(c) Company and Buyer each agree that the agreements contained in this
_Section 7.02_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Buyer would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if Company fails promptly to pay any amounts due under
this _Section 7.02_, Company shall pay interest on such amounts from the
date payment of such amounts were due to the date of actual payment at the
rate of interest equal to the sum of (i) the rate of interest published from
time to time in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition (or any
successor publication thereto), designated therein as the prime rate on the
date such payment was due, plus (ii) 200 basis points, together with the costs
and expenses of Buyer (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit. 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
parties agree that if Company pays or causes to be paid to Buyer or to Buyer
Bank the Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 7.02(a)_, or, if
applicable, the Liquidated Damages Payment in accordance with _Section
7.02(b)_, Company (or any successor in interest of Company) will not have any
further obligations or liabilities to Buyer or Buyer Bank with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 7.03 _Effect of Termination_. Except as set forth in _Section
7.02(d)_, termination of this Agreement will not relieve a breaching party
from liability for any breach of any covenant, agreement, representation or
warranty of this Agreement giving rise to such termination.

that it will be impossible to measure in money the damage to Buyer if
Stockholder fails to comply with the obligations imposed by this Agreement
and that, in the event of any such failure, Buyer will not have an adequate
remedy at law. Accordingly, Stockholder agrees that injunctive relief or other
equitable remedy is the appropriate remedy for any such failure and will not
oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that Buyer has an adequate
remedy at law. Stockholder further agrees that Stockholder will not seek, and
agrees to waive any requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond in
connection with Buyers seeking or obtaining such equitable relief. In
addition, after discussing the matter with Stockholder, Buyer shall have the
right to inform any third party that Buyer reasonably believes to be, or to be
contemplating, participating with Stockholder or receiving from Stockholder
assistance in violation of this Agreement, of the terms of this Agreement and
of the rights of Buyer hereunder, and that participation by any such persons
with Stockholder in activities in violation of Stockholders agreement with
Buyer set forth in this Agreement may give rise to claims by Buyer against
such third party.

shall commence on the date hereof. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement by the mutual written agreement of the parties hereto, and shall be

shall have any further obligations or liabilities hereunder; _provided,
however_ , that such termination shall not relieve any party from liability
for any breach of this Agreement prior to such termination.

_Section 8_. _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement supersedes all
prior agreements, written or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to
the subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended,
supplemented or modified, and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived,
except by an instrument in writing signed by each party hereto. No waiver of
any provisions hereof by either party shall be deemed a waiver of any other
provision hereof by any such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a
continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party.

_Section 9_.  _Severability_. In the event that any one or more provisions
of this Agreement shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, by any court of competent jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provisions of this Agreement and the parties shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to substitute a valid, legal and enforceable provision
which, insofar as practical, implements the purposes and intents of this
Agreement.

 



A1-4 _Section 10_. _Capacity as Stockholder_. This Agreement shall apply to
Stockholder solely in his or her capacity as a stockholder of Company and it
shall not apply in any manner to Stockholder in his or her capacity as a
director of Company. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to
apply to, or limit in any manner, the obligations of Stockholder to comply
with his or her fiduciary duties as a director of Company, if applicable.

THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 12_.

 

 _Section 13_. _Waiver of Appraisal Rights; Further Assurances_. Provided
that the Merger is consummated in compliance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement, that the consideration offered pursuant to the Merger is not less
than that specified in the Merger Agreement executed on or about the date
hereof, and that this Agreement has not been terminated in accordance with
its terms, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Stockholder hereby
waives any rights of appraisal or rights to dissent from the Merger or demand
fair value for his or her Shares in connection with the Merger, in each case,
that Stockholder may have under applicable law. From time to time prior to
