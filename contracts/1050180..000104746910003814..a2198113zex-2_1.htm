ARTICLE 2 

THE MERGER 

  

 Section 2.01. _ The Closing._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m., Pacific time, as soon as practicable (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days) after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger set forth in _Article 7_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of such conditions), unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to its terms or unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The Closing shall be held at the offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP, 1600 El Camino Real, Menlo Park, California 94025, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. 

  

 Section 2.02. _ The Merger._ 

   

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, as soon as practicable after the Closing, the Company shall file with the Delaware Secretary of State a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") in connection with the Merger in such form as is required by, and executed and acknowledged in accordance with, Delaware Law. 

  

 (b) The Merger shall become effective on such date and at such time (the "Effective Time") as the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such later time as may be agreed by the parties that is specified in the Certificate of Merger). 

   

 (c) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance with Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law. 

        

 Section 2.03. _ Conversion of Shares._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof: 

  

 (a) except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.03(b)_, _Section 2.03(c)_, _Section 2.05_ or _Section 2.06(c)_, each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive $17.00 in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"); 

  

 (b) each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent or Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto; 

  

 (c) each share of Company Common Stock held by any Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent (other than Merger Subsidiary) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into such number of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation such that each such Subsidiary owns the same percentage of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time; and 

  

 (d) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and, together with the shares described in _Section 2.03(c)_, shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 Section 2.04. _ Surrender and Payment._ 

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an exchange agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") and (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (the "Uncertificated Shares"). As of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares that are not Company Restricted Stock Awards (the "Payment Fund"). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each record holder of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange. 

  

 (b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the Exchange Agent, or (ii) receipt of an "agent\'s message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender or transfer of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share. 

   

 (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Tax 

        
  

required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

  

 (d) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or transfer of Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares and from and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this _Article 2_. 

  

 (e) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section 2.04_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock two (2) years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.05_ in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent, upon demand. 

  

 Section 2.05. _ Dissenting Shares._ Notwithstanding _Section 2.03_, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock canceled in accordance with _Section 2.03(b))_ and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has properly exercised appraisal rights of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law (such shares being referred to collectively as the "Dissenting Shares" until such time as such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holder\'s appraisal rights under Delaware Law with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead shall be entitled to payment of the appraised value of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law; provided that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such holder\'s right to appraisal, pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware Law or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of Delaware Law, such shares of Company Common Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.03(a)_, without interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly representing such share or transfer of such Uncertificated Share, as the case may be. The Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice, instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Delaware Law that relate to such demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands. 

        

 Section 2.06. _ Company Stock Options and Restricted Stock Awards; ESPP._ 

  

 (a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, the vested and/or exercisable portion (including any that pursuant to its terms becomes vested and exercisable solely as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) of each Company Stock Option, Company RSU, and other equity-based award denominated in shares of Company Common Stock (each such award, a "Vested Cashed Out Company Compensatory Award") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall automatically be converted into the right to receive from Parent or the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise or settlement of such Vested Cashed Out Compensatory Award immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Merger Consideration, less any per share exercise price of such Vested Cashed Out Compensatory Award. No less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver a schedule to Parent setting forth for each such Vested Cashed Out Company Compensatory Award, the name of the holder thereof, the portion of the award that is or will become vested at the Effective Time and, if applicable, the exercise price of such award. 

   

 (b) At the Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, the unvested portion of each Company Stock Option, Company RSU, and other equity-based award denominated in shares of Company Common Stock (each such award, an "Unvested Company Compensatory Award") that is held by a person who is an employee of, or a consultant to, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed by Parent and converted automatically at the Effective Time into an option, restricted stock unit award or other equity-based award, as the case may be, denominated in shares of Parent Stock and which has other terms and conditions substantially identical to those of the related Unvested Company Compensatory Award (including any accelerated vesting provisions therein) except that (i) the number of shares of Parent Stock subject to each such award shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested Company Compensatory Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by a fraction (the "Award Exchange Ratio"), the numerator of which is the per share Merger Consideration and the denominator of which is the average closing price of Parent Stock on Nasdaq over the five (5) trading days immediately preceding (but not including) the date on which the Effective Time occurs (rounded down to the nearest whole share) and (ii) if applicable, the exercise or purchase price per share of Parent Stock (rounded upwards to the nearest whole cent) shall equal (x) the per share exercise or purchase price for the shares of Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Unvested Company Compensatory Award immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (y) the Award Exchange Ratio; _provided, however_ , that in no case shall the exchange of a Company Stock Option be performed in a manner that is not in compliance with the adjustment requirements of or that would be deemed a modification under Section 409A of the Code. 

  

 (c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each Company Restricted Stock Award shall automatically be cancelled, and each share of Company Common Stock subject to a Company Restricted Stock Award shall be converted into the right to receive restricted stock units with respect to Parent Stock in accordance with the terms of this _Section 2.06(c)_ and the vesting schedule for such Company Restricted Stock Award. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, upon receipt from the Company of a list of holders of Restricted Stock Awards (including the number of shares that were unvested immediately before the Effective Time), Parent shall send or cause the Surviving Corporation to send to each holder of a Restricted Stock Award a letter of transmittal and, upon confirmation to Parent\'s satisfaction that such list does not duplicate the shares held by stockholders of record provided to the Exchange Agent for payment under _Section 2.04_, shall grant each such holder a restricted stock unit with respect to that 

        

number of shares of Parent Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share)
calculated by multiplying (i) the number of unvested shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (ii) the Award Exchange Ratio. Such restricted stock units
shall vest in accordance with the applicable vesting schedule for such
Company Restricted Stock Award. In no event shall this Section and _Section
2.04_ result in a duplication of benefits with respect to any
Company Restricted Stock Awards. The restricted stock units shall be
substantially identical to the Company Restricted Stock Awards except to the
extent necessary to reflect the fact that the restricted stock units are not
actual shares of Parent Stock. The Company agrees that the conversion of
Company Restricted Stock Awards into restricted stock units in accordance with
this _Section 2.06(c)_ shall act as the assumption of such Company
Restricted Stock Awards.

  

 (d) Parent shall take such actions as are necessary for the assumption and conversion of the Unvested Company Compensatory Awards pursuant to this _Section 2.06_, including the reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Stock as is necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this _Section 2.06_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to each holder of any Unvested Company Compensatory Award an appropriate notice setting forth such holder\'s rights pursuant to such Unvested Company Compensatory Award. Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to the shares of Parent Stock issuable upon exercise of the assumed Company Compensatory Awards promptly following the Effective Time (and in no event later than 15 Business Days after the Effective Time) and Parent shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as such assumed Unvested Company Compensatory Awards remain outstanding. The Company shall reasonably cooperate with and assist Parent in the preparation of such registration statement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Form S-8 registration statement shall not cover any Vested Cashed Out Compensatory Awards. 

   

 (e) The Company shall take such action as may be necessary to establish a New Exercise Date (as defined under the Company\'s Amended and Restated 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP")) on the last day of the payroll period ending immediately prior to the Effective Time (but in all events at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Effective Time) with respect to the Offering Period (as defined in the ESPP) otherwise then in effect (the "Final Exercise Date"); (i) provide that no further Offering Periods shall commence under the ESPP on or following the Final Exercise Date; and (ii) terminate the ESPP as of the Final Exercise Date. Each outstanding option under the ESPP on the Final Exercise Date shall be exercised on such date for the purchase of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP. The Company shall provide timely notice of the setting of the Final Exercise Date and termination of the ESPP in accordance with Section 18(c) of the ESPP. 

  

 (f) Subject to Parent\'s compliance with the preceding provisions of this _Section 2.06_, the parties agree that, following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Compensatory Award or a Company Restricted Stock Award or any participant in any Company Stock Plan, or other Company Employee Plan or employee benefit arrangement of the Company or under any employment agreement shall have any right hereunder to acquire any Equity Interest (including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) in the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (g) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions that are necessary for the treatment of the Company Compensatory Awards and Company Restricted Stock Awards pursuant to this _Section 2.06_. 

  

 Section 2.07. _ Adjustments._ If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split) or 

        
  

combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend, the
Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement
shall be appropriately adjusted.

  

 Section 2.08. _ Withholding Rights._ Each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of any applicable Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding. 

  

 Section 2.09. _ Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated under this _Article 2_. 

  

    
ARTICLE 3 

THE SURVIVING CORPORATION 

   

 Section 3.01. _ Certificate of Incorporation._ The certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended at the Effective Time to read in its entirety as set forth in _Exhibit B_ hereto and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with Applicable Law. 

  

 Section 3.02. _ Bylaws._ The bylaws of the Company shall be amended at the Effective Time to read in their entirety as the bylaws of Merger Subsidiary in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and as so amended shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with Applicable Law. 

  

 Section 3.03. _ Directors and Officers._ From and after the Effective Time, until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with Applicable Law, (i) the directors of Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) the officers of the Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

    
ARTICLE 4 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Each Company Employee Plan has been maintained in material compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, orders, rules and regulations, including ERISA and the Code, which are applicable to such Company Employee Plan. No events have occurred with respect to any Company Employee Plan that could result in a material payment or assessment by or against the Company of any excise taxes under Sections 4972, 4975, 4976, 4977, 4979, 4980B, 4980D, 4980E or 5000 of the Code.

(i) Each Company Employee Plan which is a "non-qualified deferred
compensation plan" (as such term is defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code)
has, at all times, been administered in material compliance with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code and applicable guidance issued

According to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used for the purpose of funding each International Plan (or, if the same has no assumptions and valuations or is unfunded, according to actuarial assumptions and valuations in use by the PBGC on the date hereof), as of the Effective Time, the total amount or value of the funds available under such International Plan to pay benefits accrued thereunder or segregated in respect of such accrued benefits, together with any reserve or accrual with respect thereto, exceeds the present value of all benefits (actual or contingent) accrued as of such date of all participants and past participants therein in respect of which Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries has or would have after the Effective Time any obligation.

Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the foregoing restrictions by any Subsidiary of the Company or Representatives of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 6.03_ by the Company. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall instruct the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' respective Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated, and shall not authorize or knowingly permit any of its or their Representatives to continue, any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any such Third Party (or its agents or advisors) in possession of non-public information in respect of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries to return or destroy (and confirm destruction of) all such information. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of _Section 6.03(a)_, prior to the Stockholder Approval, the Company Board, directly or indirectly through any Representative, may (i) engage in negotiations or discussions with any Third Party that has made (and not withdrawn) a bona fide unsolicited Acquisition Proposal in writing after the date of this Agreement, that did not result from or arise out of a breach of this _Section 6.03_, and that the Company Board believes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, and (ii) thereafter furnish 

        
  

to such Third Party non-public information relating to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries pursuant to an executed confidentiality agreement with terms
no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement and containing additional provisions that expressly permit the
Company to comply with the terms of this _Section 6.03_ (a copy of
which confidentiality agreement shall be promptly and in any event with 24
hours provided for informational purposes only to Parent), but in each case
under the preceding clauses (i) and (ii), only if the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel to the Company
Board, that the failure to take such action would be a breach of its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law.

  

 (c) The Company Board shall not take any of the actions referred to in clauses (i) or (ii) of _Section 6.03(b)_, unless the Company shall have notified Parent in writing at least three (3) Business Days before taking such action that it intends to take such action. The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after it obtains knowledge of the receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry, offer or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or any request for non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party. In such notice, the Company shall identify the Third Party making, and the terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal, indication, offer, proposal or request. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, offer, proposal or request, including any material amendments or proposed amendments as to price and other material terms thereof. The Company shall provide Parent with at least 48 hours prior notice of any meeting of the Company Board at which the Company Board is reasonably expected to consider any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly provide Parent with any non-public information concerning the Company\'s business, present or future performance, financial condition or results of operations, provided to any Third Party that was not previously provided to Parent. 

   

 (d) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) fail to make, withdraw, amend or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Subsidiary, the Board Recommendation, (ii) approve, endorse, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse, adopt or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal, (iii) fail to recommend against acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer for the Company Common Stock within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such offer, (iv) make any public statement inconsistent with the Board Recommendation or (v) resolve or agree to take any of the foregoing actions (any of the foregoing, an "Adverse Recommendation Change"). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, at any time prior to the Stockholder Approval, 

  

  

 (i) the Company Board, following receipt of and on account of a Superior Proposal, may make an Adverse Recommendation Change, but only if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel to the Company Board, that the failure to take such action would be a breach of its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that the Company Board shall not make an Adverse Recommendation Change, unless (A) the Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing at least five (5) Business Days before making an Adverse Recommendation Change (the "Notice Period"), of its intention to take such action with respect to a Superior Proposal, (B) the Company attaches to such notice the most current version of the proposed agreement or a reasonably detailed summary of all material terms of any such Superior Proposal (which version or summary shall be updated on a prompt basis) and the identity of the Third Party making the Superior Proposal, (C) the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, if Parent, in its discretion, proposes to make such adjustments; it being agreed that in the event that, after commencement of the Notice Period, 

  

      

  

there is any material revision to the terms of a Superior Proposal,
including, any revision in price, the Notice Period shall be extended, if
applicable, to ensure that at least three (3) Business Days remains in the
Notice Period subsequent to the time the Company notifies Parent of any such
material revision (it being understood that there may be multiple extensions);
and (D) Parent does not make, within the Notice Period, an offer that is
determined by the Company Board in good faith, after consulting with its
outside counsel and financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, to
be at least as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as such Superior
Proposal; and

  

 (ii) the Company Board may, in response to a material fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances (other than an Acquisition Proposal occurring or arising after the date of this Agreement) that was not known to the Company Board nor reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of or prior to the date of this Agreement (and not relating in any way to any Acquisition Proposal) (such material fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances, an "Intervening Event"), fail to make, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Subsidiary, the Board Recommendation (which shall be deemed to be an "Adverse Recommendation Change") if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel to the Company Board, that, in light of such Intervening Event, the failure of the Company Board to effect such an Adverse Recommendation Change would be a breach of its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; provided that no fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances shall constitute an Intervening Event if such fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances resulted from or arose out of the announcement, pendency or consummation of the Merger; and, provided, further, that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this clause (ii) unless the Company has (A) provided to Parent at least four (4) Business Days\' prior written notice advising Parent that the Company Board intends to take such action and specifying the facts underlying the Company Board\'s determination that an Intervening Event has occurred, and the reasons for the Adverse Recommendation Change, in reasonable detail, and (B) during such four (4) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for an Adverse Recommendation Change as a result of the Intervening Event. 

  

  

 (e) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.03_ shall prevent the Company Board from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms its Board Recommendation (x) in such communication or (y) within two (2) Business Days after requested to do so by Parent. 

  

 Section 6.04. _ Access to Information._ From the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) give to Parent and its Representatives reasonable access to the offices, properties, books, records, Contracts, Governmental Authorizations, documents, directors, officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries during normal business hours, (ii) furnish to Parent and its Representatives such financial, Tax and operating data and other information as such Persons may reasonably request (including the work papers of Ernst and Young LLP upon receipt of any required consent from Ernst and Young LLP), and (iii) instruct its Representatives to cooperate with Parent and its Representatives in its investigation; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that (A) any Applicable Law (including, for the avoidance of doubt, laws relating to the protection and preservation of the privacy rights of employees) requires the Company to restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or information or (B) such disclosure would, based on the advice of such party\'s counsel, result in a waiver of attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or 

        
  

any other applicable privilege applicable to such information. Any
investigation pursuant to this _Section 6.04_ shall be conducted in such
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of
the Company.

  

 Section 6.05. _ Notice of Certain Events._ 

  

 (a) In connection with the continuing operation of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the date this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article 8_ hereof, subject to Applicable Law and _Section 6.12(d)_, the executive officers of the Company, including but not limited to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, shall consult in good faith on a regular basis with Parent to report material (individually or in the aggregate) operational developments, the status of relationships with customers, resellers, partners, suppliers, licensors, licensees, distributors and others having material business relationships with the Company, the status of ongoing operations and other matters reasonably requested by Parent pursuant to procedures reasonably requested by Parent; provided that no such consultation shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement. 

  

 (b) The Company shall promptly notify Parent of: 

  

  

 (i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

  

 (ii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

  

 (iii) any Proceeding commenced or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to _Sections 4.12_, _4.13_ , _4.15_ or _4.16_ , as the case may be, or that relate to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

  

 (iv) any notice or other communication from any Major Customer or Major Supplier that such Major Customer or Major Supplier is terminating its relationship with Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and 

   

 (v) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty or breach of covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement at any time during the term hereof that could reasonably be expected to cause the conditions set forth in _Section 7.02_ not to be satisfied. 

  

  

 Section 6.06. _ 401(k) Plans._ Effective as of the day immediately preceding the Effective Time, unless otherwise directed in writing by Parent at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to effect the termination of any and all 401(k) plans sponsored or maintained by the Company and shall provide Parent evidence that each of Company\'s 401(k) plans has been terminated pursuant to an action by the Company Board. 

  

 Section 6.07. _ Employee Benefit Plan Matters_ 

  

 (a) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time who continue employment with the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees"), Parent shall cause the service of each such Continuing Employee with the Company and its ERISA Affiliates prior to the Closing Date to be recognized for purposes of eligibility to participate, levels of benefits (but not for benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan) and vesting under each compensation, vacation, fringe or other welfare benefit plan, program or arrangement of 

        
  

Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their ERISA Affiliates, but not
including any sabbatical or equity compensation plans, programs, agreements or
arrangements (collectively, the "Parent Benefit Plans") in which any
Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to participate, but solely to the
extent service was credited to such employee for such purposes under a
comparable Company Employee Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date and to
the extent such credit would not result in a duplication of benefits.

  

 (b) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to each Parent Benefit Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to participate, Parent shall use reasonable efforts to cause each such Parent Benefit Plan to (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, waiting periods, required physical examinations and exclusions with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable under such Parent Benefit Plan for such Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents to the same extent that such pre-existing conditions, waiting periods, required physical examinations and exclusions would not have applied or would have been waived under the corresponding Company Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee was a participant immediately prior to his commencement of participation in such Parent Benefit Plan but, with respect to long-term disability and life insurance benefits and coverage, solely to the extent permitted under the terms and conditions of Parent\'s applicable insurance contracts in effect as of the Closing Date; _provided_ that for purposes of clarity, to the extent such benefit coverage includes eligibility conditions based on periods of employment _Section 6.07(a)_ shall control; and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee and their eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid in the calendar year that, and prior to the date that, such Continuing Employee commences participation in such Parent Benefit Plan in satisfying any applicable co-payment or deductible requirements under such Parent Benefit Plan for the applicable calendar year, to the extent that such expenses were recognized for such purposes under the comparable Company Employee Plan. 

  

 (c) Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this _Section 6.07_ are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and shall not create any right in any other Person, including any employees, former employees, any participant in any Company Employee Plan or any beneficiary thereof or any right to continued employment with Parent, Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates. Nothing in this _Section 6.07_ shall be deemed to amend any Parent Benefit Plan or to require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to continue or amend any particular benefit plan before or after the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, and any such plan may be amended or terminated in accordance with its terms and Applicable Law. 

   

 Section 6.08. _ State Takeover Laws._ If any "control share acquisition," "fair price," "moratorium" or other anti-takeover Applicable Law becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Merger, the Voting Agreements or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then each of the Company, Parent, Merger Subsidiary, and their respective Board of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to render such anti-takeover Applicable Law inapplicable to the foregoing.

 Section 6.10. _ Voting of Shares._ Parent shall vote any shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries in favor of adoption of this Agreement at the Stockholder Meeting, and will vote or cause to be voted the shares of Merger Subsidiary held by it or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, in favor of adoption of this Agreement. 

       

                                    

    

  Section 6.11. _ Director and Officer Liability._ 

  

 (a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain officers\' and directors\' liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such person currently covered by the Company\'s officers\' and directors\' liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ that in satisfying its obligation under this _Section 6.11(a)_, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 225% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Current Premium"), which amount is set forth in _Section 6.11(a) _ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed 225% of the Current Premium, then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance that, in the Surviving Corporation\'s judgment, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to 225% of the Current Premium. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid "tail" or "runoff" policies have been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, which policies provide such directors and officers with coverage for an aggregate period of six (6) years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including, in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, _provided_ that the amount paid for such prepaid policies does not exceed 225% of the Current Premium. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such policies in full force and effect for their full term, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder. 

   

 (b) From and after the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to: (i) each indemnification agreement in effect between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties"); and (ii) any indemnification provision and any exculpation provision set forth in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that such obligations shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under Applicable Law. If, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Party delivers to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as applicable, a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification under any of the provisions set forth in clauses (i) or (ii) above, then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. 

  

 (c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.11_. 

  

 Section 6.12. _ Reasonable Best Efforts._ 

  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Authorities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings 

        
  

with Governmental Authorities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps
as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an
action or proceeding by, any Governmental Authorities, (ii) the delivery of
required notices to, and the obtaining of required consents or waivers from,
third parties and (iii) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and to fully carry
out the purposes of this Agreement.

  

 (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the undertakings pursuant to this _Section 6.12_, each of Parent and the Company shall (i) provide or cause to be provided as promptly as practicable to Governmental Authorities with regulatory jurisdiction over enforcement of any Antitrust Laws (each such Governmental Authority, a "Governmental Antitrust Authority") information and documents requested by any Governmental Antitrust Authority or necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including preparing and filing any notification and report form and related material required under the HSR Act and any additional consents and filings under any Antitrust Laws as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement (but in no event more than fifteen (15) Business Days from the date hereof except by mutual consent confirmed in writing) and thereafter to respond as promptly as practicable to any request for additional information or documentary material that may be made under the HSR Act and any additional consents and filings under any Antitrust Laws; and (ii) use their reasonable best efforts to take such actions as are necessary or advisable to obtain prompt approval of consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any Governmental Authority. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in connection with the receipt of any necessary governmental approvals or clearances (including under any Antitrust Law), nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of Parent agree or proffer to, divest, hold separate, or enter into any license or similar agreement with respect to, or agree to restrict the ownership or operation of, or agree to conduct or operate in a specified manner, any portion of the business or assets of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall Parent or any of its Subsidiaries be obligated to litigate or participate in the litigation of any Proceeding, whether judicial or administrative, brought by any Governmental Authority or appeal any Order (i) challenging or seeking to make illegal, delay materially or otherwise directly or indirectly restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or seeking to obtain from Parent or any of its Subsidiaries any damages in connection therewith, or (ii) seeking to prohibit or limit in any respect, or place any conditions on, the ownership or operation by the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates of all or any portion of the business, assets or any product of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or to require any such Person to dispose of, license (whether pursuant to an exclusive or nonexclusive license) or enter into a consent decree or hold separate all or any portion of the business, assets or any product of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case as a result of or in connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense of any Proceeding against the Company and/or its directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will obtain the prior written consent of Parent prior to settling or satisfying any such Proceeding. 

  

 (d) Subject to Applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, the Company and Parent and their respective counsel shall (i) have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each shall consult the other on, any filing made with, or written materials to be submitted to, any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) promptly inform each other of any communication (or other correspondence or memoranda) received from, or given to, the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or any other Governmental Antitrust Authority and (iii) promptly furnish each other with copies of all 

        
  

correspondence, filings and written communications between them or their
subsidiaries or affiliates, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or
its respective staff, on the other hand, with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall, to the extent
practicable, provide the other party and its counsel with advance notice of
and the opportunity to participate in any discussion, telephone call or
meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filing,
investigation or other inquiry in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to participate in the preparation for such
discussion, telephone call or meeting. Neither Parent nor the Company shall
commit to or agree with any Governmental Authority to stay, toll or extend
any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or applicable Foreign
Competition Laws, without the prior written consent of the other. The Company
and Parent may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate
any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this _Section
6.12_ as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material". Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 6.12_, materials provided to the other party or
its counsel may be redacted to remove references concerning the valuation of
the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  

 (e) Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary agrees that, between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall not, and shall ensure that none of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates shall, take any action or propose, announce an intention or agree, in writing or otherwise, to take any action that would reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 Section 6.13. _ Certain Filings._ The Company and Parent shall cooperate with one another (i) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required, or any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any material contracts, in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) in taking such reasonable actions or making any such filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith or with the Proxy Statement and seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers. 

   

 Section 6.14. _ Public Announcements._ Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or making any other public statement, or scheduling a press conference or conference call with investors or analysts, with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any such other public statement without the consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, except (i) as such release or announcement may be required by Applicable Law or any listing agreement with or rule of any national securities exchange or association upon which the securities of the Company or Parent, as applicable, are listed or (ii) as such release or announcement may be made with respect to an Adverse Recommendation effected in accordance with Section 6.03, which in each case the party making the release or announcement shall consult with the other party about, and allow the other party reasonable time (taking into account the circumstances) to comment on, such release or announcement in advance of such issuance, and the party will consider such comments in good faith.

resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
officer or director of the Company who is subject to Section 16 of the
Exchange Act with respect to equity securities of the Company.

 Section 9.04. _ Expenses._ 

  

 (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense.

Upon such a determination, the parties agree to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner, in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.
