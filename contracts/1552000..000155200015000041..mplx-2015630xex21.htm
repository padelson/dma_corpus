Texas Avenue, Suite 3300, Houston, Texas 77002 at 10:00 A.M., Central time, on

State of Delaware or at such later date or time as may be agreed by the
Partnership and Parent in writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger
(the effective time of the Merger being hereinafter referred to as the "
Effective Time ").

Section 1.4 Effects of the Merger. The Merger will have the effects set forth
in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DRULPA and DLLCA.

Section 1.5 Organizational Documents of the Surviving Entity.

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of limited partnership of the
Partnership as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time will remain
unchanged and will be the certificate of limited partnership of the Surviving
Entity from and after the Effective Time, and thereafter may be amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law, in each case consistent with the
obligations set forth in Section 5.8 .

(b) At the Effective Time, the Partnership Agreement as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time will remain unchanged (except for any amendments
which may be required to effect this Agreement) and will be the Partnership
Agreement of the Surviving Entity.

Section 1.6 Admission of Partner. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the

and (c) the Partnership will continue without dissolution. 











ARTICLE II

EFFECT ON UNITS

Section 2.1 Effect of Merger. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the Partnership, Parent GP, Parent,
Merger Sub or the holder of any securities of the Partnership or Merger Sub:

(a) Merger Consideration. Subject to Section 2.1(d), Section 2.2(h) and
Section 2.3, (i) each Common Unit issued and outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive 1.09
(the " Common Unit Equity Consideration" and such ratio the " Exchange Ratio
") Parent Units and cash in an amount obtained by dividing (A) $675,000,000 by
(B) the number of Common Units (including all Canceled Awards) plus the number
of Class B Units, in each case outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (the " Cash Consideration ", and together with the Common Unit Equity
Consideration, the " Common Merger Consideration "), (ii) each Class A Unit
issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
converted into the right to receive (x) 1.09 Parent Class A Units plus (y) the
number of Parent Class A Units equal to a fraction, the numerator of which is
the Fully Diluted Cash Consideration and the denominator of which is the
closing trading price of Parent Units on the trading day immediately preceding
the Closing Date (the " Class A Consideration " and such ratio the " Class A
Exchange Ratio ") and (iii) each Class B Unit issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the right to
receive 1 Parent Class B Unit (the " Class B Consideration " and such ratio,
the " Class B Exchange Ratio "). As used in this Agreement, " Fully Diluted
Cash Consideration " means a fraction, the numerator of which is $675,000,000
and the denominator of which is the number of Common Units (including all
Canceled Awards) plus the number of Class A Units plus the number of Class B
Units, in each case outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) Equity of Merger Sub; Issuance of Class A Unit. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the
membership interests in Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time will be converted into 99 Common Units of the Partnership
(as the Surviving Entity) and, together with the Class A Unit to be issued to
and owned by a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent at the Effective Time, will
constitute all of the Partnership Securities after the Effective Time.
Immediately following the Effective Time, the Partnership will issue one Class
A Unit to a to-be-formed, wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (the " New General
Partner "), which will be the general partner of the Partnership and sole
holder of Class A Units immediately after the Effective Time. 











At the Effective Time, the books and records of the Partnership will be
revised to reflect (i) the admission of Parent as the sole limited partner of
the Partnership and the simultaneous withdrawal of all other limited partners
of the Partnership, (ii) the admission of the New General Partner as the
general partner of the Partnership and the simultaneous withdrawal of the
General Partner, and (iii) Parent will continue the existence of the
Partnership (as the Surviving Entity) without dissolution.

(c) Distribution of Class A Units. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
all Class A Units owned by the General Partner will be distributed to its sole
shareholder, MarkWest Hydrocarbon, Inc.

(d) Cancellation of Parent Owned Units and General Partner Interest. Any
Partnership Securities owned immediately prior to the Effective Time by Parent
or any Subsidiary of Parent (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Partnership Securities deemed to be beneficially owned by Parent due to its
rights under the Support Agreement or Lock-Up Agreement), will be
automatically canceled and will cease to exist and no consideration will be
delivered in exchange for such canceled Partnership Securities, and any
Partnership Securities owned by any Subsidiary of the Partnership will be
exchanged for the Class A Consideration. Upon the issuance of the Class A Unit
to the New General Partner pursuant to Section 2.1(b) , the general
partnership interest of the Partnership owned by the General Partner will be
automatically canceled and will cease to exist and no consideration will be
delivered in exchange for such canceled general partnership interest.

(e) Treatment of Phantom Units and DERs. (i) Prior to the Effective Time, the
Partnership and the General Partner shall take such actions as are necessary
(including obtaining any resolutions of the board of directors of the General
Partner or, if appropriate, any committee administering the applicable
Partnership Equity Plan) to ensure that each Phantom Unit that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will, contingent upon the Closing and
effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, become fully vested and
converted into an equivalent number of Common Units, and such Common Units
will be canceled and converted into the right to receive the Common Merger
Consideration (each Phantom Unit, as so converted, a " Canceled Award "). As
of the Effective Time, each DER award will be canceled and the holder of such
canceled DER will cease to have any rights with respect to such canceled DER
except the right to receive any payment in respect of any distributions,
including Regular Distributions as expressly provided in Section 2.1(f) ,
with a record date occurring prior to the Effective Time that may have been
declared or made by the Partnership with respect to such DERs in accordance
with the terms of the Partnership Equity Plan but not yet paid as of the
Effective Time. As of the Effective Time, each holder of a Canceled Award will
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Common Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, and, if applicable, the right to receive any Regular
Distributions as expressly provided in Section 2.1(f) . 











(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
each holder of a Canceled Award entitled to receive a fraction of a Parent
Unit (after taking into account all Canceled Awards held by such holder) will
be entitled to receive, otherwise in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 2.1(e) , a cash payment, without interest, in lieu of such fractional
units, in accordance with Section 2.2(h) .

(iii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Partnership shall be permitted to
deliver to each holder of Phantom Units a notice, in a form reasonably
acceptable to Parent, explaining the calculation of the Common Merger
Consideration and otherwise setting forth such holders' rights pursuant to the
applicable Partnership Equity Plan and equity award agreements and the
holders' rights and obligations under this Agreement.

(iv) The Surviving Entity or a Subsidiary thereof shall pay all amounts
payable pursuant to this Section 2.1(e) as soon as reasonably practicable (but
in any event no later than 10 Business Days) after the Effective Time;
provided that, Parent shall pay the aggregate Common Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to this Section 2.1(e) to the Surviving Entity or applicable
Subsidiary thereof immediately prior to the Effective Time for purposes of
making the payments required pursuant to this Section 2.1(e)(iv) , and Parent
shall direct the Exchange Agent to pay the aggregate cash amounts payable
pursuant to fractional units in respect of such Canceled Awards to the
Surviving Entity or applicable Subsidiary thereof in accordance with Section
2.2(h) . From and after the Effective Time, Parent and its Affiliates
(including the Surviving Entity) shall cooperate in good faith to the extent
necessary to give effect to this Section 2.1(e)(iv) , including in the event
payment is appropriately made through a payroll provider to an entity other
than the Surviving Entity.

(f) Certificates. As of the Effective Time, all Common Units (including the
Phantom Units converted into Common Units) converted into the right to receive
the Common Merger Consideration, all Class A Units converted into the right to
receive the Class A Consideration and all Class B Units converted into the
right to receive the Class B Consideration, in each case, pursuant to this
Article II will no longer be outstanding, will automatically be canceled and
will cease to exist, and each holder of (x) a certificate that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented any such Common Unit, Class A Unit or
Class B Unit, as applicable (a " Certificate "), and (y) a non-certificated
unit represented by book-entry that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such Common Unit (but not including any Canceled Award or
Phantom Units), Class A Unit or Class B Unit, as applicable (the " Book-Entry
Units ") will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Common Merger Consideration, Class A Consideration or Class B
Consideration, as applicable, any distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(g) and cash in lieu of any fractional Parent
Units to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(h) , in each
case to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2(c) , without interest, and the
right to be admitted as a Parent Limited Partner. In addition, holders as of
the relevant record date of Common Units, Class A Units, Class B Units or DERs
will have the continued rights to any distribution, without interest, with
respect to such Common Units, Class A Units, Class B Units or DERs, as
applicable, with a record date occurring prior to the Effective Time 











that may have been declared or made by the Partnership with respect to such
units or DERs in accordance with the terms of the Partnership Agreement or the
Partnership Equity Plan, as applicable, and this Agreement and which remains
unpaid as of the Effective Time (a " Regular Distribution "). Regular
Distributions by the Partnership are not part of the Common Merger
Consideration, Class A Consideration or Class B Consideration, and will be
paid on the payment date set therefor to such holders of Common Units, Class A
Units, Class B Units or DERs, as applicable, whether or not they exchange such
units pursuant to Section 2.2 , if applicable. Parent GP will perform all
actions reasonably required to admit (as a Parent Limited Partner) each
Unitholder who is issued Parent Units, Parent Class A Units or Parent Class B
Units, in exchange for such Unitholder's Common Units, Class A Units or Class
B Units in accordance with this Article II , upon the proper surrender of the
Certificate representing such Common Units, Class A Units or Class B Units (or
as promptly as practicable following the Closing in the case of the Book-Entry
Units). Upon such surrender of the Certificate (or upon a waiver of the
requirement to surrender a Certificate granted by Parent GP in its sole
discretion or as promptly as practicable following the Closing in the case of
the Book-Entry Units) and the recording of the name of such Person as a
limited partner of Parent on the books and records of Parent, such Person will
automatically and effective as of the Effective Time be admitted as a Parent
Limited Partner and be bound by the Parent Partnership Agreement as such. By
its surrender of a Certificate, or by its acceptance of Parent Units, Parent
Class A Units or Parent Class B Units, a Unitholder confirms its agreement to
be bound by all of the terms and conditions of the Parent Partnership
Agreement.

Section 2.2 Exchange of Certificates; Payment of Common Merger Consideration,
Class A Consideration and Class B Consideration .

(a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent will appoint an exchange
agent reasonably acceptable to the Partnership (the " Exchange Agent ") for
the purpose of exchanging Certificates for Common Merger Consideration, Class
A Consideration and Class B Consideration, as applicable, and paying Common
Merger Consideration, Class A Consideration and Class B Consideration, as
applicable, in respect of Book-Entry Units. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, but in no event more than three Business Days
following the Effective Time, Parent will send, or will cause the Exchange
Agent to send, to each holder of Certificates as of the Effective Time, whose
Common Units, Class A Units or Class B Units were converted into the right to
receive the Common Merger Consideration, Class A Consideration, or Class B
Consideration, as applicable, a letter of transmittal (which will specify that
the delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title will pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) to the Exchange Agent) in such forms as the Partnership and Parent
may reasonably agree, including, as applicable, instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent in exchange for the Common Merger
Consideration, Class A Consideration or Class B Consideration, as applicable,
and cash in lieu of any fractional Common Units or Class A Units payable
pursuant to Section 2.2(h) . 











(b) Deposit. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will cause to be deposited
with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of Common
Units, Class A Units and Class B Units, Parent Units, Parent Class A Units and
Parent Class B Units (which will be in non-certificated book-entry form) and
an amount of cash in U.S. dollars, in each case, sufficient to be issued and
paid to the Unitholders as Common Merger Consideration, Class A Consideration
and Class B Consideration, as applicable, in accordance with this Article II
, payable (i) in the case of Unitholders that hold Certificates, upon due
surrender of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) pursuant to the provisions of this Article II and (ii) in the case
of holders of Book-Entry Units, as promptly as practicable following the
Closing; provided that the amount of cash so deposited shall be limited to
the amount of cash payable to holders of Common Units (but not including any
Canceled Awards). Following the Effective Time, Parent agrees to make
available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash in U.S.
dollars sufficient to pay any distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(g) and
any Parent Units, Parent Class A Units or any Parent Class B Units sufficient
to pay any Common Merger Consideration, Class A Consideration or Class B
Consideration, as applicable, in each case, that may be payable from time to
time following the Effective Time, other than any Common Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to Section 2.1(e) (other than any fractional units which
shall be deposited with the Exchange Agent and paid to the holders of Canceled
Awards in accordance with Section 2.1(e) and Section 2.2(h) ). All cash and
book-entry units representing Parent Units, Parent Class A Units and Parent
Class B Units deposited with the Exchange Agent or representing Unit Proceeds
obtained pursuant to Section 2.2(h) will be referred to in this Agreement as
the " Exchange Fund. " The Exchange Agent will, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the Common Merger Consideration, Class A Consideration
or Class B Consideration, as applicable, contemplated to be issued or paid
pursuant to this Article II , other than pursuant to Section 2.1(e) , out of
the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund will not be used for any other purpose.
The Exchange Agent will invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent; provided that (x) no such investment or losses thereon
will affect the Common Merger Consideration, Class A Consideration or Class B
Consideration or other amounts payable to holders of Common Units or Class A
Units entitled to receive such Common Merger Consideration or Class A
Consideration, other amounts or cash in lieu of fractional Parent Units and
Parent will promptly cause to be provided additional funds to the Exchange
Agent for the benefit of holders of Common Units or Class A Units entitled to
receive such consideration in the amount of any such losses; and (y) such
investments will be in short term obligations of the United States of America
with maturities of no more than 30 days.

(c) Exchange; Payment. Each holder of (i) Common Units (but not including any
Canceled Awards or Phantom Units), Class A Units and Class B Units that have
been converted into the right to receive the Common Merger Consideration,
Class A Consideration or Class B Consideration, as applicable, upon surrender
to the Exchange Agent of a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly
executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, a
Certificate (as applicable) and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, and (ii) Book-Entry Units, in each case, will
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) the 











number of Parent Units, Parent Class A Units or Parent Class B Units
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of Parent Units, Parent Class
A Units or Parent Class B Units that such holder has the right to receive in
accordance with the provisions of this Article II and (y) a check denominated
in U.S. dollars in the amount of cash that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to this Article II , if any, including the cash portion of
the Common Merger Consideration. The Common Merger Consideration, Class A
Consideration and Class B Consideration will be paid (I) as promptly as
practicable by mail after receipt by the Exchange Agent of the Certificate and
letter of transmittal in accordance with the foregoing, in the case of
Unitholders that hold Certificates, (II) in accordance with Section 2.2(b) ,
in the case of holders of Book-Entry Units, and (III) in accordance with
Section 2.1(e) , in the case of holders of Canceled Awards. No interest will
be paid or accrued on any Common Merger Consideration, Class A Consideration,
Class B Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional Parent Units or on any
unpaid distributions payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Units.
Until so surrendered, each such Certificate will, after the Effective Time,
represent for all purposes only the right to receive such Common Merger
Consideration, Class A Consideration or Class B Consideration, as applicable.
The Common Merger Consideration, Class A Consideration or Class B
Consideration, as applicable, paid upon surrender of Certificates will be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Common Units, Class A Units or Class B Units, as the case may be, formerly
represented by such Certificates. The Common Merger Consideration, Class A
Consideration or Class B Consideration paid in respect of Book-Entry Units and
Canceled Awards will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Book-Entry Units and Canceled Awards, as the case may
be. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
holder of Book-Entry Units will be required to deliver an executed letter of
transmittal to the Exchange Agent to receive the Common Merger Consideration,
Class A Consideration or Class B Consideration, as applicable, that such
holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article II .

(d) Other Payees. If any cash payment is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it
will be a condition of such payment that the Person requesting such payment
will pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the making
of such cash payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the
surrendered Certificate or will establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. If any portion of the
Common Merger Consideration is to be registered in the name of a Person other
than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is
registered, it will be a condition to the registration thereof that the
surrendered Certificate will be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery of the Common
Merger Consideration will pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other
similar Taxes required as a result of such registration in the name of a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable. 











(e) No Further Transfers. From and after the Effective Time, there will be no
further registration on the books of the Partnership of transfers of any
Partnership Securities. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates representing Common Units, Class A Units or Class B Units
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will cease to have any
rights with respect to such Common Units, Class A Units or Class B Units,
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Exchange Agent or
Parent, they will be canceled and exchanged for the consideration provided
for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article II .

(f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Common Units, Class A Units and Class B
Units 12 months after the Effective Time will be returned to Parent, upon
demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged his, her or its Common
Units, Class A Units or Class B Units for the Common Merger Consideration,
Class A Consideration or Class B Consideration, as applicable, in accordance
with this Section 2.2 prior to that time will thereafter look only to Parent
for delivery of the Common Merger Consideration, Class A Consideration or
Class B Consideration, as applicable, plus any cash in lieu of fractional
Parent Units or any distributions with respect to Parent Units, to which he,
she or it is entitled pursuant to this Article II in respect of such holder's
Common Units, Class A Units or Class B Units. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent, Merger Sub and the Partnership will not be liable to any holder of
Common Units, Class A Units or Class B Units for any Common Merger
Consideration, Class A Consideration or Class B Consideration, as applicable,
duly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property
Laws. Any Common Merger Consideration, Class A Consideration or Class B
Consideration remaining unclaimed by holders of Common Units, Class A Units or
Class B Units immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority will, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(g) Distributions. No distributions with respect to Parent Units or Parent
Class A Units issued in the Merger will be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificates until such Certificates are surrendered as provided
in this Section 2.2 . Following such surrender (or immediately in the case of
the Book-Entry Units and Canceled Awards), subject to the effect of escheat,
Tax or other applicable Law, there will be paid, without interest, to the
record holder of the Parent Units or Parent Class A Units, if any, issued in
exchange therefor (i) at the time of such surrender (or immediately in the
case of the Book-Entry Units and Canceled Awards), all distributions payable
in respect of any such Parent Units or Parent Class A Units with a record date
after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of such
surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the distributions payable with respect to such Parent Units or Parent Class A
Units with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date
subsequent to such surrender (in the case of Partnership Securities evidenced
by Certificates). For purposes of distributions in respect of Parent Units or
Parent Class A Units, all Parent Units and Parent Class A Units to be issued
pursuant to the Merger will be entitled to distributions, if any, pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence as if issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time. 











(h) No Fractional Units. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
Parent Units or Parent Class A Units or book entry credit of the same will be
issued upon the surrender of any Common Units or Class A Units, as applicable.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Common
Units (including Canceled Awards) converted pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a Parent Unit (after
taking into account all Common Units exchanged by such holder) will be
entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Entity, as
applicable, in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.2(h) (and
Section 2.1(e) , if applicable), a cash payment, without interest, in lieu of
such fractional units representing such holder's proportionate interest, if
any, in the proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent (reduced by
reasonable and customary fees of the Exchange Agent attributable to such sale)
(as so reduced, the " Unit Proceeds ") in one or more transactions of a number
of Parent Units, such number equal to the excess of (i) the sum of (A) the
aggregate number of Parent Units to be delivered to the Exchange Agent by
Parent pursuant to Section 2.2(b) and (B) the aggregate number of Parent Units
to be delivered to the Surviving Entity pursuant to Section 2.1(e)(iv) over
(ii) the sum of (A) the aggregate number of whole Parent Units to be
distributed to the holders of Certificates and the holders of Book-Entry Units
pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and (B) the aggregate number of whole Parent Units
to be distributed to the holders of Canceled Awards pursuant to Section
2.1(e) (such excess being, the " Excess Units "). The parties acknowledge that
payment of the Unit Proceeds in cash in lieu of issuing certificates or scrip
for fractional units was not separately bargained-for consideration but merely
represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and
inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of
fractional units. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of Common Units (including, in
respect of fractional units, Canceled Awards) that would otherwise receive
fractional units, will sell the Excess Units at then-prevailing prices on the
NYSE in the manner provided in this Section 2.2(h) and will be executed in
round lots to the extent practicable. Until the Unit Proceeds of such sale or
sales have been distributed to the holders of such Common Units, or the
Exchange Fund is terminated, the Exchange Agent will hold such Unit Proceeds
in trust for the benefit of the holders of such Common Units (the " Fractional
Unit Proceeds "). The Exchange Agent will determine the portion of the
Fractional Unit Proceeds to which each holder of such Common Units (including
holders of Canceled Awards) will be entitled, if any, by multiplying the
amount of the aggregate Unit Proceeds comprising the Fractional Unit Proceeds
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional unit
interest to which such holder of such Common Units would otherwise be entitled
and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional unit
interests to which all holders of such Common Units would otherwise be
entitled. To the extent applicable, each holder of Common Units will be deemed
to have consented for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and to the extent
applicable, state or local income tax purposes) to report the cash received
for fractional Parent Units in the Merger as proceeds for a sale of a portion
of the holder's Common Units to Parent. The Exchange Agent shall promptly pay
any Fractional Unit Proceeds 











in respect of Canceled Awards to the Surviving Entity for payment pursuant to
Section 2.1(e). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no
holder of Class A Units converted pursuant to the Merger will receive any
fractional Parent Class A Units.

(i) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate will have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Common Merger
Consideration, Class A Consideration or Class B Consideration, as applicable,
to be paid in respect of the Common Units, Class A Units or Class B Units
represented by such Certificate as contemplated by this Article II .

(j) Withholding Taxes. Parent, the Partnership, any of the Partnership's
Affiliates (including the Surviving Entity) or the Exchange Agent, as
applicable, will deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to a holder of Common Units, Class A Units, Class B
Units or Canceled Awards such amounts as are required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment (or the conversion of
Phantom Units into Canceled Awards) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " Code
"), or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law (and to the
extent deduction and withholding is required, such deduction and withholding
will be taken to the maximum extent possible in Parent Units). To the extent
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing authority,
such withheld amounts will be treated for the purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the former holder of the Common Units, Class A Units,
Class B Units and Canceled Awards, as applicable, in respect of whom such
withholding was made. If withholding is taken in Parent Units, Parent, the
Partnership, any of the Partnership's Affiliates (including the Surviving
Entity) or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, will be treated as having sold
such consideration for an amount of cash equal to the fair market value of
such consideration at the time of such deemed sale and paid such cash proceeds
to the appropriate Taxing authority.

Section 2.3 Adjustments. Notwithstanding any provision of this Article II to
the contrary (but without in any way limiting the covenants in Section 5.2 ),
if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the number of
outstanding Common Units, Class A Units, Class B Units, Phantom Units or
Parent Units will have been changed into a different number of units or a
different class by reason of the occurrence or record date of any unit
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, split-up,
unit distribution, combination, exchange of units or similar transaction, the
Exchange Ratio, the Class A Exchange Ratio and the Class B Exchange Ratio will
be appropriately adjusted to reflect fully the effect of such unit dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, split-up, unit
distribution, combination, exchange of units or similar transaction and to
provide the holders of Common Units, Class A Units, Class B Units and Phantom
Units the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event. 











Section 2.4 Tax Characterization of Merger and Cash Received. The Partnership
and Parent agree for federal (and applicable state and local) income tax
purposes (a) to treat the transactions consummated pursuant to this Agreement
as a partnership merger within the meaning of Section 708(b)(2)(A) of the
Code, and in particular a merger of the "assets-over" type under Treasury
Regulations Sections 1.708-1(c)(1) and 1.708-1(c)(3)(i); (b) to treat the
Partnership as the continuing or resulting partnership in such merger and
Parent as a terminating partnership; (c) to treat the Cash Consideration
received under this Agreement (other than in respect of the Canceled Awards)
as proceeds for the sale of a portion of the recipient's units. Each party to
this Agreement agrees to prepare and file all U.S. income Tax Returns in
accordance with the foregoing and will not take any position inconsistent
therewith on any such Tax Return, or in the course of any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to such income Taxes, except as otherwise
required by applicable Laws following a final determination by a court of
competent jurisdiction or other final administrative decision by an applicable
Governmental Authority.

Section 2.5 No Dissenters' Rights. No dissenters' or appraisal rights will be
available with respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

Section 3.5 Partnership SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities.

(a) The Partnership and its Subsidiaries have filed and furnished all reports,
schedules, forms, certifications, prospectuses, and registration, proxy and
other statements required to be filed by them with the SEC since December 31,
2013 (collectively and together with all documents filed on a voluntary basis
on Form 8-K, and in each case including all exhibits and schedules thereto and
documents incorporated by reference therein, the " Partnership SEC Documents
"). The Partnership SEC Documents, as of their respective effective dates (in
the case of Partnership SEC Documents that are registration statements filed
pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act) and as of their respective
SEC filing dates (in the case of all other Partnership SEC Documents), or, if
amended, as finally amended prior to the date of this Agreement, complied in
all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the
Securities Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, applicable to
such Partnership SEC Documents, and none of the Partnership SEC Documents as
of such respective dates contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there
are no outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC staff with
respect to the Partnership SEC Documents. To the Knowledge of the Partnership,
none of the Partnership SEC Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review or
investigation.

(b) The consolidated financial statements of the Partnership included in the
Partnership SEC Documents as of their respective dates (if amended, as of the
date of the last such amendment) comply as to form in all material respects
with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance
with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated
in the notes 











thereto) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as
may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of the Partnership and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the
case of unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments).

(c) The Partnership has established and maintains internal control over
financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are
defined in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act); such
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material
information relating to the Partnership, including its consolidated
Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by the Partnership in the reports that
it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to
the Partnership's principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure; and such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the Partnership in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported

report financial data and have identified for the Partnership's auditors any
material weaknesses in internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Partnership's internal controls. The principal executive officer

Knowledge of the Partnership, as of the date of this Agreement there are no
facts or circumstances that would prevent its chief executive officer and
chief financial officer from giving the certifications and attestations
required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404
of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

Parent to the Partnership (the " Parent Disclosure Schedule ") prior to the

Section 4.1 Organization, Standing and Power.

(a) Each of Parent, Parent GP, their Subsidiaries and MPC is a legal entity
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is incorporated, formed or organized, as applicable,
and has all requisite partnership, corporate, limited liability company or
other applicable power and authority necessary to own or lease all of its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except where the failure to have such power or authority would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent ("
Parent Material Adverse Effect ") or prevent or materially impair the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. 











(b) Each of Parent, Parent GP and their Subsidiaries is duly licensed or
qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed, qualified
or in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

(c) All the outstanding partnership interests, limited liability company
interests, shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each
material Subsidiary of Parent that are owned directly or indirectly by Parent
have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and

of its certificate of limited partnership and the Parent Partnership Agreement
(the " Parent Charter Documents "), correct and complete copies of the
certificates of limited partnership and partnership agreements (or comparable
organizational documents) of each of its material Subsidiaries (collectively,
the " Parent Subsidiary Documents ") and the certificate of incorporation and

date of this Agreement. All such Parent Charter Documents, Parent Subsidiary
Documents and MPC Charter Documents are in full force and effect and no Parent
Entity is in violation of any of its respective organizational documents'
provisions.

Section 4.2 Capitalization.

(a) The authorized equity interests of Parent consist of Parent Units
representing limited partner interests in Parent, subordinated units
representing limited partner interests in Parent (the " Parent Sub-Units "),
and the general partner interest in Parent (which includes the right to

business on July 9, 2015, the issued and outstanding limited partner interests
and general partner interests of Parent consisted of (i) 43,385,196 Parent
Units, (ii) 36,951,515 Parent Sub-Units, and (iii) the Parent GP Interest.

interests of Parent issued and outstanding or any subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, convertible or exchangeable securities, rights, commitments
or agreements of any character providing for the issuance of any limited
partnership interests, voting securities or equity interests of Parent,
including any representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any of
the foregoing.

(b) Other than in connection with any equity or equity-based awards
outstanding as of the date of this Agreement and that certain distribution
agreement 











dated May 18, 2015, by and among Parent, Parent GP and certain sales agents
for the administration of the at-the-market equity offering of Parent Units
having an aggregate offering price not to exceed $500,000,000, none of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries has issued or is bound by any outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, convertible or exchangeable
securities, rights, commitments or agreements of any character providing for
the issuance or disposition of any partnership interests, limited liability
company interests, shares of capital stock, voting securities or equity
interests of any Subsidiary of Parent. Except in connection with the exercise
of any option to acquire Parent Units or the vesting, settlement or forfeiture
of, or Tax withholding with respect to, any equity or equity-based awards
outstanding as of the date of this Agreement and the conversion of any Parent
Units outstanding as of the date of this Agreement in accordance with the
Parent Charter Documents, there are no outstanding obligations of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any limited
partnership interests, shares of capital stock, voting securities or equity
interests (or any options, warrants or other rights to acquire any limited
partnership interests, shares of capital stock, voting securities or equity
interests) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

(c) Parent GP is the sole general partner of Parent. Parent GP is the sole
record and beneficial owner of the Parent GP Interest, and such Parent GP
Interest has been duly authorized and validly issued in accordance with
applicable laws and the Parent Partnership Agreement. Parent GP owns such
general partner interest free and clear of any Liens.

(d) All of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of
Merger Sub are owned, beneficially and of record, by Parent. Merger Sub was

transactions contemplated hereby. Except for obligations and liabilities

arrangements with any Person.

Consideration (including with respect to the Canceled Awards) will be received
by Parent from MPC, and no new equity interests (or subscriptions, options,
warrants, or other rights to acquire any such equity interests, or any
securities or rights convertible into, exchangeable or exercisable for, or
evidencing the right to subscribe for, any such equity interests) in Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries will be paid to or received by MPC in exchange
therefor; provided , however , that for the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing shall not impose any limitations on existing incentive distribution
rights, such Cash Consideration being contributed with respect to MPC's
existing interests in Parent (including incentive distribution rights) and not
in consideration of new Common Units.

Parent, as its sole member, by Parent GP, for itself and on behalf of Parent,

cancellations, accelerations or Liens as, individually or in the aggregate,
would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially
impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

vote or consent of the members of Merger Sub necessary to adopt this Agreement

the transactions contemplated hereby or (B) result in a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

Section 4.5 Parent SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities.

(a) Parent and its Subsidiaries have filed and furnished all reports,
schedules, forms, certifications, prospectuses, and registration, proxy and
other statements required to be filed by them with the SEC since December 31,
2013 (collectively and together with all documents filed on a voluntary basis
on Form 8-K, and in each case including all exhibits and schedules thereto and
documents incorporated by reference therein, the " Parent SEC Documents ").
The Parent SEC Documents, as of their respective effective dates (in the case
of the Parent SEC Documents that are registration statements filed pursuant to
the requirements of the Securities Act) and as of their respective SEC filing
dates (in the case of all other Parent SEC Documents), or, if amended, as
finally amended prior to the date of this Agreement, complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, applicable to such Parent SEC
Documents, and none of the Parent SEC Documents as of such respective dates
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or
unresolved comments received from the SEC staff with respect to the Parent SEC
Documents. To the Knowledge of Parent, none of the Parent SEC Documents is the
subject of ongoing SEC review or investigation.

(b) The consolidated financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC
Documents as of their respective dates (if amended, as of the date of the last
such amendment) comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with 











respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the
case of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated in the notes thereto)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of
unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments).

(c) Parent has established and maintains internal control over financial
reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined in
Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to
Parent, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by
Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to Parent's principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure; and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that
it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms.
Parent's principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have
disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to Parent's auditors and the
audit committee of Parent GP (x) all significant deficiencies in the design or
operation of internal controls which could adversely affect Parent's ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial data and have identified
for Parent's auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and (y) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in Parent's internal controls. The principal
executive officer and the principal financial officer of Parent have made all
certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act and any
related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect to the
Parent SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications were
complete and correct when made. The management of Parent has completed its
assessment of the effectiveness of Parent's internal control over financial
reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes
Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2014, and such assessment concluded
that such controls were effective. To the Knowledge of Parent, as of the date
of this Agreement, there are no facts or circumstances that would prevent its
chief executive officer and chief financial officer from giving the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

(d) Except (i) as reflected or otherwise reserved against on the balance sheet

publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii) for liabilities
and obligations incurred since the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course
of business and (iii) for liabilities and obligations incurred under or in
accordance with this Agreement or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether or not accrued or
contingent), that 











would be required to be reflected or reserved against on a consolidated
balance sheet of Parent prepared in accordance with GAAP or the notes thereto,
other than as have not and would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(e) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Parent and any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person,
on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where the purpose of such Contract is
to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, Parent in Parent's published financial statements or any
Parent SEC Documents.

Section 4.6 Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

(a) Since the Balance Sheet Date there has not been a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

(b) Since the Balance Sheet Date to the date of this Agreement, (i) except for
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent and its
Subsidiaries have carried on and operated their respective businesses in all
material respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice and (ii) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any
action described in Sections 5.2(b) (other than clauses (i), (ii), (vii) and
(viii) and, to the extent related to the foregoing, clause (xiv)) that if
taken after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time without
the prior written consent of the Partnership would violate such provision.

Section 4.7 Legal Proceedings. There are no investigations or proceedings
pending (or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened) by any Governmental
Authority with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or actions, suits
or proceedings pending (or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened) against
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties at law
or in equity before any Governmental Authority, and there are no orders,
judgments or decrees of any Governmental Authority against Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, in each case except for those that would not have,

and their respective dates of incorporation, formation or organization have
been, in compliance with and are not in default under or in violation of any
applicable Laws, except where such non-compliance, default or violation would
not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 











(b) Parent and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all franchises, tariffs,
grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions,
consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental Authority
necessary for Parent and its Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their
properties and assets or to carry on their businesses as they are now being
conducted (the " Parent Permits "), except where the failure to have any of
the Parent Permits would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. All Parent Permits are in full force and effect,
except where the failure to be in full force and effect would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No
suspension or cancellation of any of Parent Permits is pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened, except where such suspension or cancellation
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Parent and its Subsidiaries are not, and since December 31, 2013 have
not been, in violation or breach of, or default under, any Parent Permit,
except where such violation, breach or default would not have, individually or
in the aggregate a Parent Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this
Agreement, to the Knowledge of Parent, no event or condition has occurred or
exists which would result in a violation of, breach, default or loss of a
benefit under, or acceleration of an obligation of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries under, any Parent Permit or has caused (or would cause) an
applicable Governmental Authority to fail or refuse to issue, renew or extend
any Parent Permit (in each case, with or without notice or lapse of time or
both), except for violations, breaches, defaults, losses, accelerations or
failures that would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Without limiting the generality of Section 4.8(a), Parent, each of its
Subsidiaries, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each joint venture partner,
joint interest owner, consultant, agent, or representative of any of the

investigated by any Governmental Authority except, in each case of the
foregoing clauses (i) through (iii), as would not have, individually or in the

representations and warranties of the Partnership set forth in Section 3.9 ,
none of the information supplied (or to be supplied) in writing by or on
behalf of Parent specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in

efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing 











and keep the Registration Statement effective for so long as necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The Partnership will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Unitholders as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is
declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall also use reasonable
best efforts to take any action required to be taken under any applicable
state securities law in connection with the issuance and reservation of the

reasonably requested in connection with any such action. No filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, the Registration Statement will be made by Parent,

made by the Partnership without providing the other party a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon provided , that the Partnership, in
connection with an Adverse Recommendation Change, may amend or supplement the
Proxy Statement to effect such change if and to the extent such amendment or
supplement is required by applicable Law. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time any information relating to the Partnership or Parent, or any
of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, is discovered by the
Partnership or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to either the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement, so that either
such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information will promptly notify the other parties hereto and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information will be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated
to the Unitholders. The parties will notify each other promptly of the receipt
of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the
SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement or the Registration Statement or for additional information and will
supply each other with copies of (i) all correspondence between it or any of

obtaining the Partnership Unitholder Approval. Subject to Section 5.3 , the

purpose of obtaining the Partnership Unitholder Approval, (ii) for the absence
of a quorum, (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and/or
mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that the Partnership has
determined after consultation with outside legal counsel is necessary under

Unitholders Meeting, (iv) if the Partnership has delivered any notice
contemplated by Section 5.3(d) and the time periods contemplated by Section
5.3(d) have not expired, and (v) with the written consent of Parent, which may

conditions to, or the consummation of, the transactions set forth in this
Agreement.

Section 5.3 No Solicitation by the Partnership; Etc.

(a) The Partnership will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and will direct its
and their respective directors, officers, employees, investment bankers,
financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, agents and other representatives
(collectively, " Representatives ") to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted
heretofore with respect to an Alternative Proposal, request the return or
destruction of all confidential information previously provided to such
parties by or on behalf of the Partnership or its Subsidiaries and immediately
prohibit any access by any Person (other than Parent and its Representatives)
to any physical or electronic data room relating to a possible Alternative
Proposal. Except as permitted by this Section 5.3 , (x) the Partnership will
not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and will direct its and their respective
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate,
knowingly facilitate, knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing
confidential information) or knowingly induce any inquiries or any proposals
that constitute the submission of an Alternative Proposal, (ii) except for a
confidentiality agreement permitted pursuant to Section 5.3(b) , enter into
any confidentiality agreement, merger agreement, letter of intent, agreement
in principle, unit purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement or unit
exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement relating to an
Alternative Proposal (an " Acquisition Agreement "), or (iii) withdraw, modify
or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner
adverse to Parent, the General Partner Recommendation or publicly recommend
the approval or adoption of, or publicly approve or adopt, or propose to
publicly recommend, approve or adopt, any Alternative Proposal and (y) within
five Business Days of receipt of a written request from Parent following the
receipt by the Partnership of any Alternative Proposal that has been publicly
disclosed or otherwise been made public, the Partnership will publicly 











reconfirm the General Partner Recommendation; provided, that, in the event
that Parent requests such public reconfirmation of the General Partner
Recommendation, then the Partnership may not unreasonably withhold, delay
(beyond the five Business Day period) or condition the public reconfirmation
of the General Partner Recommendation and provided , further that Parent
will not be permitted to make such request on more than one occasion in
respect of each Alternative Proposal and each material modification to an
Alternative Proposal, if any (the taking of any action described in clause
(x)(iii) or the failure to take the action described in clause (y) being
referred to as an " Adverse Recommendation Change "). Without limiting the
foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the foregoing restrictions
by the Partnership's Subsidiaries or Representatives acting by or on behalf of
the Partnership will be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.3 by the
Partnership.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.3(a), if
at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the
Partnership Unitholder Approval, (i) the Partnership has received a written
Alternative Proposal that the General Partner determines is bona fide , (ii)
the General Partner, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that such Alternative Proposal
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to or result in a Superior
Proposal and (iii) such Alternative Proposal did not result from a breach of
this Section 5.3 , then the Partnership or the General Partner, as applicable
may, subject to clauses (x) and (y) below, (A) furnish information, including
confidential information, with respect to the Partnership and its Subsidiaries
to the Person making such Alternative Proposal and (B) participate in
discussions or negotiations regarding such Alternative Proposal; provided
that (x) the Partnership and its Subsidiaries will not, and will direct their
respective Representatives not to, disclose any non-public information to such
Person unless the Partnership has, or first enters into, a confidentiality
agreement with such Person with confidentiality provisions that are not
materially less restrictive taken as a whole to such Person than the
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement are to Parent and (y) the
Partnership will provide to Parent non-public information about the
Partnership or its Subsidiaries that was not previously provided or made
available to Parent substantially concurrently with providing or making
available such non-public information to such other Person.

(c) In addition to the other obligations of the Partnership set forth in this
Section 5.3, the Partnership will promptly advise Parent, orally and in
writing, and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt, if any proposal,
offer, inquiry or other contact is received by, any information is requested
from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or
continued with, the Partnership in respect of any Alternative Proposal, and
will, in any such notice to Parent, indicate the identity of the Person making
such proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact and the terms and conditions of
any proposals or offers or the nature of any inquiries or contacts (and will
include with such notice copies of any substantive written materials received
from or on behalf of such Person relating to such proposal, offer, inquiry or
request), and thereafter will promptly keep Parent reasonably informed of all
material developments affecting the status and terms of any such proposals,
offers, inquiries or requests (and the Partnership will promptly provide
Parent with copies of any additional substantive 











written materials received by the Partnership or that the Partnership has
delivered to any third party making an Alternative Proposal that relate to
such proposals, offers, inquiries or requests) and of the status of any such
discussions or negotiations.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Partnership receives a bona fide
written Alternative Proposal and such Alternative Proposal (i) constitutes a
Superior Proposal and (ii) did not result from a breach of this Section 5.3 ,
then the General Partner may, at any time prior to obtaining the Partnership
Unitholder Approval, effect an Adverse Recommendation Change; provided ,
however , that the General Partner may not effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to the foregoing unless:

(i) the Partnership has provided prior written notice to Parent specifying in
reasonable detail the reasons for such action (including a description of the
material terms of such Superior Proposal and delivering to Parent a copy of
(1) the Acquisition Agreement for such Superior Proposal in the form to be
entered into and (2) any other relevant proposed transaction agreements), at
least five Business Days in advance of its intention to take any such action,
unless at the time such notice is otherwise required to be given there are
less than five Business Days prior to the Partnership Unitholders Meeting, in
which case the Partnership will provide as much notice as is reasonably
practicable (the period inclusive of all such days, the " Notice Period ") (it
being understood and agreed that any material amendment to the terms of a
Superior Proposal will require a new notice pursuant to this Section 5.3(d)
and a new Notice Period, except that such new Notice Period in connection with
any material amendment will be for three Business Day from the time Parent
receives such notice (as opposed to five Business Days)); and

(ii) during the Notice Period the Partnership has negotiated, and has used
reasonable best efforts to cause its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel to negotiate, with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires
to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal.

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) "Alternative Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), other
than Parent and its Subsidiaries, relating to any (A) direct or indirect
acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions), outside of the ordinary course of business, of assets of the
Partnership and its Subsidiaries (including securities of Subsidiaries) equal
to 25% or more of the Partnership's consolidated assets or to which 25% or
more of the Partnership's revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are
attributable, (B) direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a single
transaction or a series of related transactions) of beneficial ownership
(within the meaning of Section 13 under the Exchange Act) of 25% or more of
the voting power of the securities of the Partnership, (C) tender offer or 











exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person or "group" (as
defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) beneficially owning 25% or more
of the voting power of the securities of the Partnership or (D) merger,
consolidation, unit exchange, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
the Partnership which is structured to permit such Person or group to acquire
beneficial ownership of at least 25% of the Partnership's consolidated assets
or voting securities; in each case, other than the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(ii) "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide written offer, obtained after the
date of this Agreement to acquire, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of
the outstanding equity securities of the Partnership or assets of the
Partnership and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, made by a third
party, which is on terms and conditions which the General Partner determines
in its good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its financial
advisors, to be more favorable to the Unitholders from a financial point of
view than the transactions contemplated hereby, taking into account at the
time of determination any changes to the terms of this Agreement that as of
that time had been committed to by Parent in writing.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.3 to the contrary, the General
Partner may, at any time prior to obtaining the Partnership Unitholder
Approval, effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an
Intervening Event if the General Partner or its Board of Directors concludes
in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its financial
advisors, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
obligations and the exercise of its duties under applicable Law or the
Partnership Agreement. An " Intervening Event " means, with respect to the
Partnership, a material event, circumstance, state of facts, occurrence,
development or change that arises or occurs after the date of this Agreement
and was not, prior to the date of this Agreement, known or reasonably
foreseeable (or, if known, the consequences of which were not reasonably
foreseeable as of the date of this Agreement); provided , however , that in
no event will the receipt, existence or terms of an Alternative Proposal or
any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof constitute an Intervening
Event.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement will prevent the Partnership or the
General Partner from issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Alternative Proposal or from
making any legally required disclosure; provided that any Adverse
Recommendation Change may only be made in accordance with Section 5.3(d) .
For the avoidance of doubt, a public statement that describes the
Partnership's receipt of an Alternative Proposal and the operation of this
Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed an Adverse Recommendation
Change.

(h) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time,
neither the Partnership nor any of its Subsidiaries shall release any Person
from, or 











modify or waive any provision of, any standstill, confidentiality or similar
agreement (other than modifications or waivers required to comply with
applicable Law), in each case, related to a sale of the Partnership or any of
its material Subsidiaries.

Section 5.4 Reasonable Best Efforts.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including Section
5.4(c)), each of Parent, Merger Sub and Parent GP, on the one hand, and the
Partnership, on the other hand, will cooperate with the other and use (and
will cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to use) its reasonable best
efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be
done, all things, necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to
the Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable (and in any event no
later than the Outside Date) and to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated hereby,
including preparing and filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect
all necessary filings, notifications, notices, petitions, statements,
registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents
(including any required or recommended filings under applicable Antitrust
Laws), (ii) obtain promptly (and in any event no later than the Outside Date)
all approvals, consents, clearances, expirations or terminations of waiting
periods, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations from
any Governmental Authority or third party necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) defend any lawsuits or
other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (iv)
obtain all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties,
provided , however , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, none of Parent, Merger Sub, Parent GP or the Partnership shall be
required to sell, divest, dispose of, license, lease, operate, conduct in a
specified manner, hold separate or discontinue or restrict or limit, before or
after the Closing Date, any assets, liabilities, businesses, licenses,
operations, or interest in any assets or businesses, that would, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the business of Parent
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, respectively. For purposes of this Agreement,
" Antitrust Laws " means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all
other applicable Laws issued by a Governmental Authority that are designed or
intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each of Parent,
Merger Sub and Parent GP, on the one hand, and the Partnership, on the other
hand (including by their respective Subsidiaries) agrees to make an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as
practicable and in any event within 15 Business Days after the date of this
Agreement (unless a later date is mutually agreed to by the parties hereto)
and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested by any Governmental Authority
pursuant 











to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law and use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken (including by their respective Subsidiaries),
all other actions consistent with this Section 5.4 necessary to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
as soon as practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date); and
(ii) the Partnership and Parent will each use its reasonable best efforts to
(x) take all action necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or
similar Law is or becomes applicable to any of the transactions contemplated
hereby and (y) if any state takeover statute or similar Law becomes applicable
to any of the transactions contemplated hereby, take all action necessary to
ensure that such transaction may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise minimize the effect of
such Law on the transaction.

(c) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and Parent GP, on the one hand, and the
Partnership, on the other hand, will use (and will cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to use) its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate
in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission
with a Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before
a Governmental Authority relating to the transactions contemplated hereby,
including any proceeding initiated by a private Person, (ii) promptly inform
the other party of (and supply to the other party, subject to applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of any such information) any communication received
by such party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission,
the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, or any other Governmental
Authority and any material communication received or given in connection with
any proceeding by a private Person, in each case regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) subject to applicable Laws relating to
the exchange of any such information, permit the other party to review in
advance and incorporate the other party's reasonable comments in any
substantive communication to be given by it to any Governmental Authority with
respect to obtaining any clearances required under any Antitrust Law in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) consult with the
other party in advance of any substantive meeting or teleconference with any
Governmental Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private
Person, with any other Person, and, to the extent not prohibited by the
Governmental Authority or other Person, give the other party the opportunity
to attend and participate in such meetings and teleconferences. Parent and the
Partnership will cooperate to develop and implement the strategy for obtaining
any clearances required under any Antitrust Law in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and will cooperate in all meetings and
communications with any Governmental Authority in connection with obtaining
such clearances. Subject to Section 5.6(b) , each of Parent, Merger Sub and
Parent GP, on the one hand, and the Partnership, on the other hand, will take
reasonable efforts to share information protected from disclosure under the
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or
any other privilege pursuant to this Section 5.4 in a manner so as to
preserve the applicable privilege.

Section 5.5 Public Announcements. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement will be a joint press release to be reasonably
agreed 











upon by Parent and the Partnership. Thereafter, except (x) in connection with
the receipt and existence of a bona fide Alternative Proposal and matters
related thereto or (y) following an Adverse Recommendation Change and, in each
case, solely to the extent related to such Alternative Proposal or Adverse
Recommendation Change, neither the Partnership nor Parent will issue or cause
the publication of any press release or other public announcement (including
to the extent previously issued or made in accordance with this Agreement)
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without
the prior consent of the other party (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), except as may be required by Law or by any applicable
listing agreement with the NYSE or other national securities exchange as
determined in the good faith judgment of the party proposing to make such
release (in which case such party will not issue or cause the publication of
such press release or other public announcement without prior consultation
with the other party); provided , however , that each party and their
respective controlled Affiliates may make statements that are consistent with
statements made in previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made by Parent or the Partnership in compliance with this Section
5.5 .

Section 5.6 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each party will, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries to afford to the other party and its Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours (and, with respect to books and records,
the right to copy) to all of its and its Subsidiaries' properties,
commitments, books, Contracts, records and correspondence (in each case,
whether in physical or electronic form), officers, employees, and, to the
extent within such party's control, its accountants, counsel, financial
advisors and other Representatives; provided , however , that such access
does not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of such party. Except for
disclosures permitted by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as
of April 1, 2015, between Parent and the Partnership (as it may be amended
from time to time, the " Confidentiality Agreement "), each party and its
Representatives will hold information received from the other party pursuant
to this Section 5.6 in confidence in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

(b) This Section 5.6 will not require either party to permit any access, or to
disclose any information, that in the reasonable, good faith judgment (after
consultation with counsel) of such party would reasonably be expected to
result in (i) any violation of any Contract or Law to which such party or its
Subsidiaries is a party or is subject or cause any privilege (including
attorney-client privilege) that such party or any of its Subsidiaries would be
entitled to assert to be undermined with respect to such information and such
undermining of such privilege could in such party's good faith judgment (after
consultation with counsel) adversely affect in any material respect such
party's position in any pending or, what such party believes in good faith
(after consultation with counsel) could be, future litigation or (ii) if such
party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the other party or any
of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, are adverse parties in a litigation,
such information being reasonably 











pertinent thereto; provided that, in the case of clause (i), the parties
hereto will cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such
information (including by entering into a joint-defense or similar agreement)
to the extent doing so (1) would not (in the good faith belief of the party
being requested to disclose the information (after consultation with counsel))
reasonably be likely to result in the violation of any such Contract or Law or
reasonably be likely to cause such privilege to be undermined with respect to
such information or (2) could reasonably (in the good faith belief of the
party being requested to disclose the information (after consultation with
counsel)) be managed through the use of customary "clean-room" arrangements
pursuant to which appropriately designated Representatives of the other party
will be provided access to such information; provided , further , that the
party being requested to disclose the information will (x) notify the other
party that such disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or its
Subsidiaries' obligations under any such Contract or Law or are reasonably
likely to cause such privilege to be undermined, (y) communicate to the other
party in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to such notification and the
subject matter of such information (to the extent it is able to do so in
accordance with the first proviso in this Section 5.6(b) ) and (z) in the case
where such disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or its
Subsidiaries' obligations under any Contract, use reasonable commercial
efforts to seek consent from the applicable third party to any such contract
with respect to the disclosures prohibited thereby (to the extent not
otherwise expressly prohibited by the terms of such contract).

(c) No investigation, or information received, pursuant to this Section 5.6
will modify any of the representations and warranties of the parties hereto.

Section 5.7 Notification of Certain Matters. The Partnership will give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent will give prompt notice to the Partnership, of
(i) any notice or other communication received by such party from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, if the
subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain
such consent is reasonably likely to be material to the Partnership or Parent,
(ii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or,
to such party's knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries and that relate to
the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) the discovery of any fact or
circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would result in the failure to be
satisfied of any of the conditions to the Closing in Article VI and (iv) any
material failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereby which would result in
the failure to be satisfied of any of the conditions to the Closing in
Article VI ; provided that, in the case of clauses (iii) and (iv), the
failure to comply with this Section 5.7 will not result in the failure to be
satisfied of any of the conditions to the Closing in Article VI , or give
rise to any right to terminate this Agreement under Article VII , if the
underlying fact, circumstance, event or failure would not in and of itself
give rise to such failure or right. 











Section 5.8 Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) For purposes of this Section 5.8, (i) "Indemnified Person" will mean any
person who is now, or has been or becomes at any time prior to the Effective
Time, an officer, director or employee of the Partnership or any of its
Subsidiaries and also with respect to any such Person, in their capacity as a
director, officer, employee, member, trustee or fiduciary of another
corporation, foundation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other
employee benefit plan or enterprise (whether or not such other entity or
enterprise is affiliated with the Partnership) serving at the request of or on
behalf of the Partnership or any Subsidiary of the Partnership and together
with such Person's heirs, executors or administrators and (ii) " Proceeding "
will mean any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or
otherwise and whether or not such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation results in a formal civil or criminal litigation or regulatory
action.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Entity jointly
and severally agree to (i) indemnify and hold harmless against any cost or
expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
Proceeding, and provide advancement of expenses to, all Indemnified Persons to
the same extent such Indemnified Persons are indemnified and held harmless
pursuant to the terms of the Partnership Charter Documents and (ii) honor the
provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of
officers, directors and employees and advancement of expenses contained in the
Partnership Charter Documents and the Partnership Subsidiary Documents
immediately prior to the Effective Time and ensure that the certificate of
limited partnership and partnership agreement of the Surviving Entity will,
for a period of six years following the Effective Time, contain provisions no
less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of present and former directors, officers, employees and agents of
the Partnership and its Subsidiaries than are presently set forth in the
Partnership Charter Documents. Any right of indemnification of an Indemnified
Person pursuant to this Section 5.8(b) will not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified at any time in a manner that would adversely affect the
rights of such Indemnified Person as provided herein.

(c) Parent will cause the Surviving Entity to, and the Surviving Entity will,
maintain in effect for six years from the Effective Time the Partnership's
current directors' and officers' liability insurance policies covering acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to
Indemnified Persons ( provided that the Surviving Entity may substitute
therefor policies with reputable carriers of at least the same coverage
containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the Indemnified
Persons); provided , however , that in no event will the Surviving Entity be
required to expend pursuant to this Section 5.8(c) more than an amount per
year equal to 300% of current annual premiums paid by the Partnership for such
insurance (the " Maximum Amount "). In the event that, but for the proviso to
the immediately preceding sentence, the Surviving Entity would be required to
expend more than the Maximum 











Amount, the Surviving Entity will obtain the maximum amount of such insurance
as is available for the Maximum Amount. If the Partnership in its sole
discretion elects, then, in lieu of the obligations of Parent under this
Section 5.8(c) , the Partnership may, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a
"tail policy" with respect to acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have
occurred prior to the Effective Time that were committed or alleged to have
been committed by such Indemnified Persons in their capacity as such;
provided that in no event will the cost of such policy exceed twice the
Maximum Amount.

(d) The rights of any Indemnified Person under this Section 5.8 will be in
addition to any other rights such Indemnified Person may have under the
organizational documents of the Partnership, the Surviving Entity or any
Subsidiary of the Partnership, indemnification or employment agreements with
the Partnership or any Subsidiary of the Partnership or under the DRULPA or
other applicable Law. The provisions of this Section 5.8 will survive the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby for a period of six years
and are expressly intended to benefit, and be enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Persons and their respective heirs and representatives; provided
, however , that in the event that any claim or claims for indemnification
set forth in this Section 5.8 are asserted or made within such six-year
period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims
will continue until disposition of all such claims. If Parent and/or the
Surviving Entity, or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person, or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of their businesses or assets to any other
Person, then, in each such case, to the extent necessary, a proper provision
will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent and/or the Surviving
Entity, as the case may be, will assume the obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Entity set forth in this Section 5.8 .

Section 5.9 Securityholder Litigation. Other than any Proceeding where Parent
is adverse to the Partnership, the Partnership will give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any securityholder
litigation against the Partnership and/or its General Partner relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, provided that the Partnership will not be
required to provide information if doing so would be reasonably expected to
threaten the loss of any attorney-client privilege or other applicable legal
privilege. The Partnership may not settle any such securityholder litigation
without the written consent of Parent, which may not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

Section 5.10 Fees and Expenses. All fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby including all legal, accounting,
financial advisory, consulting and all other fees and expenses of third
parties incurred by a party in connection with the negotiation and
effectuation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, will be the obligation of the respective
party incurring such fees and expenses, except Parent and the Partnership will
each bear and pay one-half of the expenses incurred in connection with the
filing, printing and mailing of the Registration Statement and Proxy
Statement. 











Section 5.11 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Partnership will take all such steps as may be required (to the extent
permitted under applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Common Units or
acquisitions of Parent Units resulting from the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Partnership, or will
become subject to such reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.12 Employee Benefits.

(a) At the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause one of its Affiliates
(including the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries) to, continue the
employment of (either automatically or through an offer of employment, as
necessary) each employee of the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " Partnership Employee "). A
Partnership Employee who is offered employment pursuant to this Section
5.12(a) and who performs work at his or her principal place of work on the
first Business Day following the Closing Date will be deemed for all purposes
of this Agreement to have accepted such offer of employment. For a period of
one year following the Effective Time, Parent or its applicable Affiliate
(including the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries) will cause to be
provided to each Partnership Employee, for so long as such Partnership
Employee remains an employee of Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their
respective Affiliates (i) a base salary or regular hourly wage which is
comparable to those base salaries or regular hourly wages of similarly
situated employees of the applicable Parent, Surviving Entity or other
Affiliate employer and, in any event, the same as or no less favorable than
that provided to such Partnership Employee immediately before the Effective
Time and (ii) eligibility to participate in employee benefit plans sponsored
or maintained by the applicable Parent, Surviving Entity or other Affiliate
employer that are at least comparable in the aggregate to those Partnership
Benefit Plans (including incentive-based compensation plans) in which such
employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and benefit
entitlement (but excluding benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension
arrangements) under the employee benefit plans of the Parent Entities and
their Affiliates (including the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries)
providing benefits to any Partnership Employees after the Effective Time as
required pursuant to Section 5.12(a)(ii) (the " New Plans "), each
Partnership Employee will be credited with his or her years of service with
the Partnership and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors, and
his or her years of service with any third parties prior to employment with
the Partnership and its Subsidiaries to the extent that he or she received
such credit with the Partnership or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, before
the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Partnership Employee was
entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any
similar Partnership Benefit Plan in which such Partnership Employee
participated or was eligible to participate prior to the Effective Time,
except to the extent such credit would result in a duplication of benefits. In
addition, to the extent such Partnership Employee is eligible to participate
in a New Plan 











pursuant to Section 5.12(a)(ii), and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (i) Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts (including by
directing its third party insurance providers or third party administrators)
to waive or cause to be waived any waiting time in any and all New Plans of
the same type as any Partnership Benefit Plans in which such Partnership
Employee participated before the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby (such plans, collectively, the " Old Plans "), and (ii) for purposes of
each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits
to any Partnership Employee, Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her
covered dependents, unless such waiting times or conditions would not have
been waived under the comparable plans of the Partnership or its Subsidiaries
in which such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Partnership
Employee to be given credit, under the applicable New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits, for amounts paid prior to the
Effective Time during the year in which the Effective Time occurs under a
corresponding Old Plan during the same period for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents as though such amounts had
been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the New Plan.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Partnership will take all actions
necessary to terminate (i) all of the Partnership Equity Plans effective at
the Effective Time so that, after the Effective Time, no Phantom Units or
other rights with respect to Common Units or other Partnership Securities will
be granted thereunder and (ii) the MarkWest Hydrocarbon 401(k) Savings and
Profit Sharing Plan (the " Partnership 401(k) Plan ") effective at the
Effective Time, in each case contingent upon the Closing. Effective as of or
as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, Parent or its
applicable Affiliate shall establish or designate a Benefit Plan sponsored by
Parent or its applicable Affiliate qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
and containing a Section 401(k) cash arrangements (the " Parent 401(k) Plan ")
that shall accept the direct rollover of distributions from the Partnership
401(k) Plan to participants in the Partnership 401(k) Plan, including in-kind
distributions of loan notes. Parent and its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Entity) shall take all actions necessary to ensure that (A) the
Parent 401(k) Plan accepts the in-kind rollover of participant loans from the
Partnership 401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan, as described in the
preceding sentence, and (B) such employees have the opportunity to continue to
make scheduled loan payments pending the rollover of the notes evidencing such
loans.

(d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and its Affiliates (including
the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries) shall honor each Partnership
Benefit Plan listed in Section 3.11(g) of the Partnership Disclosure Schedule
that is identified as an "Employment Agreement" in accordance with its terms
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of
doubt, all parties hereto hereby acknowledge that the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby constitute (i) a "change of control" for
purposes of any Partnership Benefit Plan listed on Section 3.11(g) of the
Partnership Disclosure Schedule that is identified as an "Employment 











Agreement" and (ii) a "corporate transaction" as defined in Section 2.10 of
the Partnership 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan for purposes of such plan and
any outstanding awards granted thereunder.

(e) Parent or its applicable Affiliate (including the Surviving Entity and its
Subsidiaries) shall provide to each Partnership Employee who remains employed
through the applicable payment or grant date, as applicable, with payment or
awards with respect to such employee's annual cash bonus and long-term Phantom
Unit award in respect of the Partnership's 2015 calendar year in accordance
with the terms set forth in Section 5.12(e) of the Partnership Disclosure
Schedule.

(f) Nothing in this Section 5.12, expressed or implied, will (i) subject to
Parent's or its applicable Affiliate's (including the Surviving Entity and its
Subsidiaries) obligations under Section 5.12(a)(ii) with respect to
severance, confer upon any Partnership Employee or any other Person any right
to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving Entity or any
Affiliate of Parent, or will interfere with or restrict in any way the rights
of Parent, the Surviving Entity or any Affiliate of Parent, which rights are
hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any
Partnership Employee or any Person at any time for any reason whatsoever, with
or without cause, (ii) constitute an amendment to any Partnership Benefit Plan
or any employee benefit or compensation plan of Parent or any of its
Affiliates, or (iii) subject to Parent's or its applicable Affiliate's
(including the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries) obligations under
Section 5.12 , including paragraphs (a), (d) and (e), obligate Parent, the
Surviving Entity or any Affiliate of Parent to maintain any particular
compensation or benefit plan, program arrangement, policy or contract.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in
this Section 5.12 will create any third party rights in any current or former
service provider of the Partnership or its affiliates (or any beneficiaries or
dependents thereof).

Section 5.13 Listing. Parent will cause the Parent Units to be issued pursuant
to and in accordance with this Agreement to be approved for listing (subject,
if applicable, to notice of issuance) for trading on the NYSE prior to the
Closing. 











Section 5.14 Distributions. After the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, each of Parent and the Partnership will coordinate with the
other regarding the declaration of any distributions in respect of Parent
Units, Common Units, Class A Units and Class B Units and the record dates and
payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties that
holders of Common Units, Class A Units or Class B Units will not receive, for
any quarter, distributions both in respect of Common Units, Class A Units or
Class B Units and also distributions in respect of Parent Units that they
receive in exchange therefor in the Merger (or fail to receive a distribution
in respect of both the Common Units, Class A Units or Class B Units, on the
one hand, and the Parent Units, on the other hand), but that they will receive
for any such quarter either: (i) only distributions in respect of Common
Units, Class A Units or Class B Units or (ii) only distributions in respect of
Parent Units that they receive in exchange therefor in the Merger.

Section 5.15 Certain Organizational Matters.

(a) Prior to the Closing, MPC and Parent shall take all actions as are
necessary and appropriate to effect the matters set forth on Exhibit A
hereto.

(b) MPC shall contribute the cash to be utilized by Parent for purposes of
paying the Cash Consideration and no new equity interests (or subscriptions,
options, warrants, or other rights to acquire any such equity interests, or
any securities or rights convertible into, exchangeable or exercisable for, or
evidencing the right to subscribe for, any such equity interests) in Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries will be paid to or received by MPC in exchange
therefor; provided , however , that for the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing shall not impose any limitations on existing incentive distribution
rights, such Cash Consideration being contributed with respect to MPC's
existing interests in Parent (including incentive distribution rights) and not
in consideration of new units or other equity interests in Parent.

(c) Prior to the Closing, MPC and Parent shall take all actions as are
necessary and appropriate to amend the Parent Charter Documents to allow for
the creation and issuance of the Parent Class A Units and the Parent Class B
Units.

this clause (iii), where the failure of such representations and warranties to
be so true and correct (without giving effect to any limitation as to

of the Parent Entities may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in
Section 6.1 , 6.2 or 6.3 , as the case may be, to be satisfied if such

best efforts to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, or other breach of or noncompliance with this Agreement.

ARTICLE VII

TERMINATION

Section 7.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions
contemplated hereby abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time as

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Partnership and Parent;

(b) by either of the Partnership or Parent:

(i) if the Closing has not been consummated on or before December 31, 2015
(the "Outside Date"); provided , however , that the right to terminate this 











Agreement under this Section 7.1(b)(i) will not be available to Parent, on the
one hand, or the Partnership, on the other hand, if the Closing has not been
consummated on or before the Outside Date due, in whole or in part, to the
failure of a Parent Entity, on the one hand, or the Partnership, on the other
hand, to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement;

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in Section 6.1(c) is in
effect and will have become final and nonappealable; provided , however ,
that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b)(ii) will
not be available to Parent, on the one hand, or the Partnership, on the other
hand, if such Restraint was due, in whole or in part, to the failure of a
Parent Entity, on the one hand, or the Partnership, on the other hand, to
perform any of its obligations under this Agreement; or

(iii) if the Partnership Unitholder Approval has not been obtained at the
Partnership Unitholders Meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment
or postponement thereof.

(c) by Parent:

terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c)(ii) if Parent is
then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement; or

(iii) if the Partnership has breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement (or if any of the representations or warranties of the Partnership
set forth in this Agreement will fail to be true), which breach or failure (A)
would (if it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or (b) and (B) is
incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by the Partnership within 30 days
following receipt of written notice from Parent of such breach or failure;
provided that Parent will not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.1(c)(iii) if Parent is then in material breach of
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in

warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement (or if any of
the representations or warranties of Parent set forth in this Agreement will
fail to be true), which breach or failure (A) would (if it occurred or 











was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to the failure of a condition
set forth in Section 6.3(a) or (b) and (B) is incapable of being cured, or is
not cured, by Parent within 30 days following receipt of written notice from
the Partnership of such breach or failure; provided that the Partnership will

Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, written notice thereof must be given to
the other party or parties, specifying the provision of this Agreement

7.3 , in the first sentence of Sections 3.19 and 4.15 , in the last sentence
of Section 5.6(a) , and the provisions in Article VIII , all of which will
survive termination of this Agreement), and there will be no liability on the
part of any Parent Entity or the Partnership or their respective directors,
officers and Affiliates, except (a) as liability may exist pursuant to the
Sections specified in the immediately preceding parenthetical that survive
such termination and (b) nothing shall relieve any party from liability for
fraud or any Willful Breach of this Agreement.

Section 7.3 Fees and Expenses.

(a) In the event that (A) an Alternative Proposal will have been publicly
proposed or publicly disclosed prior to, and not withdrawn at the time of, the

Section 7.1(b)(iii) , and (C) the Partnership enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to, or consummates, an Alternative Proposal within 12
months after the date this Agreement is terminated, then the Partnership will
pay to Parent a termination fee equal to $625,000,000 (the " Termination Fee
"), upon the earlier of the public announcement that the Partnership has
entered into such definitive agreement or the consummation of any such
transaction; provided , that for purposes of clauses (A) and (C) of this
Section 7.3(a) , the references to "25%" in the definition of Alternative
Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%".

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent pursuant to
Section 7.1(c)(i) or Section 7.1(c)(ii), or (B) by the Partnership pursuant to
Section 7.1(b)(iii) in a case where an Adverse Recommendation Change has
occurred, then, in the case of both clauses (A) and (B), the Partnership will
pay to Parent the Termination Fee within two Business Days after the date of
termination.

(c) Any payment of the Termination Fee will be made in cash by wire transfer
of same day funds to an account designated in writing by Parent. 











(d) In the event that the Partnership fails to pay the Termination Fee
required pursuant to this Section 7.3 when due, such fee will accrue interest
for the period commencing on the date such fee became past due, at a rate
equal to the legal rate of interest provided for in Section 2301 of Title 6 of
the Delaware Code. In addition, if the Partnership fails to pay the
Termination Fee when due, the Partnership will also pay all of Parent's
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) in
connection with efforts to collect such fee. The Partnership acknowledges that
the provisions of this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated hereby and that, without these agreements, the Parent Entities
would not enter into this Agreement. The parties agree that in the event that
the Partnership pays the Termination Fee to Parent, the Partnership will have
no further liability to any Parent Entity of any kind in respect of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and that in no event will
the Partnership be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one
occasion.

ARTICLE VIII

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 8.1 No Survival, Etc. The representations, warranties and agreements
in this Agreement will terminate at the Effective Time or, except as otherwise
provided in Section 7.2 , upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1 , as the case may be, except that the agreements set forth in
Article II and Sections 5.8 , 5.10 and 5.12 and any other agreement in this
Agreement that contemplates performance after the Effective Time will survive
the Effective Time and those set forth in Sections 5.10 , 7.2 and 7.3 , in

Section 8.2 Amendment or Supplement. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects, whether
before or after receipt of the Partnership Unitholder Approval, by written
agreement of the parties hereto; provided , however , that following
approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereunder by
the Unitholders, there will be no amendment or change to the provisions of
this Agreement which by Law would require further approval by the Unitholders
without such approval.

Section 8.3 Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc. At any time prior to the Effective

other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party.

Section 8.4 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties, except that Merger Sub may assign, in its sole
discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement to any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment
will relieve Parent, Parent GP or Merger Sub of any of its obligations
hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment
not permitted under this Section will be null and void.

Section 8.5 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (each
of which will be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together will
constitute one and the same agreement) and will become effective when one or
more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other parties.

Section 8.6 Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement,
the Partnership Disclosure Schedule, the Support Agreement, the Lock-Up
Agreement, the Parent Disclosure Schedule, and the Confidentiality Agreement
(a) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement and thereof and (b) will not confer upon
any Person other than the parties hereto any rights (including third-party
beneficiary rights or otherwise) or remedies hereunder, except for, in the

(ii) the right of the Partnership's Unitholders and holders of Canceled Awards
to receive the Common Merger Consideration, Class A Consideration or Class B

until the Closing will have occurred). Except for the representations and
warranties set forth (A) in Article III , neither the Partnership nor any
other Person makes or has made any express or implied representation or
warranty with respect to the Partnership or with respect to any other
information provided to Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereby and (B) in Article IV , neither
Parent nor any other Person makes or has made any express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to the Parent Entities or with respect
to any other information provided to the Partnership in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (x) neither the Partnership nor any other Person will have or be
subject to any liability or other obligation to the Parent Entities or any
other Person, nor shall any Parent Entity have any other rights with respect
to this Agreement resulting from the distribution to the Parent Entities
(including their respective Representatives), or the Parent Entities' (or such
Representatives') use of, any such information and (y) neither Parent nor any 











other Person will have or be subject to any liability or other obligation to
the Partnership or any other Person, nor shall the Partnership have any other
rights with respect to this Agreement resulting from the distribution to the
Partnership (including its Representatives), or the Partnership's (or such
Representatives') use of, any such information, including, in the case of each
of clauses (x) and (y), any information, documents, projections, forecasts or
other materials made available to the Partnership or the Parent Entities, as
applicable, in any "data rooms" or management presentations in expectation of
the Merger.

laws of the State of Delaware, applicable to contracts executed in and to be

brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any
state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the
Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or
proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and

proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any
reason, (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from the
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law,
any claim that (x) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in
an inconvenient forum, (y) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper or (z) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be

would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in

sitting in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy

Section 8.12 Interpretation.

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, a Section,
Exhibit or Schedule, such reference will be to an Article of, a Section of, or
an Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The
table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and will not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they will be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words
of similar import when used in this Agreement will refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. All terms
defined in this Agreement will have the defined meanings when used in any
certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless
otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are
applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to
the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any
agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any
agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement,
instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and
(in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and
references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein.
References to a Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns. All
accounting terms not specifically defined herein will be construed in
accordance with GAAP. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means
the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase does not
mean simply "if." Reference to "dollars" or "$" shall be deemed reference to
the lawful money of the United States of America.

(b) The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement with the assistance of counsel and other advisors
and, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises,
this Agreement will be construed as jointly drafted by the parties hereto and
no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any party
by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement or interim
drafts of this Agreement. 











Section 8.13 Non-Recourse. No past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, agent, attorney,
representative or Affiliate of any party hereto or any of their respective
Affiliates (unless such Affiliate is expressly a party to this Agreement) will
have any liability (whether in contract or in tort) for any obligations or
liabilities of such party arising under, in connection with or related to this
Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
transactions contemplated hereby; provided , however , that nothing in this
Section 8.13 will limit any liability of the parties to this Agreement for
breaches of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

[signature page follows] 











IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly
executed and delivered as of the date first above written.
