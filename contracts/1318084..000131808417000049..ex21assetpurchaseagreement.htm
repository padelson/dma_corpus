(n) all Liabilities arising under Contracts related to the acquisition, merger
or similar agreements relating to the acquisition of a business, material
assets or the capital stock of any other Person;

(o) all Liabilities arising from pending insurance premium audits or future
premium audits under insurance policies of any Seller, in each case with
respect to any period prior to the Closing;

(p) all Liabilities related to any action or investigation by a Governmental
Body in respect of the operation of the Business on or prior to the Closing
Date;

(q) all Liabilities in respect of the operation of the Business on or prior to
the Closing Date arising under any Laws establishing, controlling or
regulating permissible sales practices and/or minimum, maximum, or selling
prices of products;

(r) all transactions or other arrangements with Related Persons; and

(s) all Liabilities relating to or arising from any of the Excluded Assets.

2.5 Further Conveyances and Assumptions; Consent of Third Parties.

(a) At any time and from time to time following the Closing and except as
prohibited by Law, each Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, make
available to Purchaser such data in personnel records of the Transferred
Employees as is reasonably necessary for Purchaser to transition such
Employees into Purchaser's records.

(b) At any time and from time to time following the Closing, each of the
Sellers and Purchaser shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to,
execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further conveyances, notices,
assumptions, releases and acquittances and such other instruments, and shall
take such further actions, as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to
assure fully to Purchaser and its respective successors or assigns all of the
properties, rights, titles, interests, estates, remedies, powers and
privileges intended to be conveyed to Purchaser under this Agreement and the
Seller Documents and to assure fully to each Seller, its Affiliates and their
respective successors and assigns, the assumption of the liabilities and
obligations intended to be assumed by Purchaser under this Agreement and the
Seller Documents, and to otherwise make effective the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

(c) Nothing in this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be construed as an attempt or agreement to assign
any Purchased Asset, including any Contract, Permit, certificate, approval,
authorization or other right, which by its terms or by Law is nonassignable
without the consent of a third-party or a Governmental Body or is cancelable
by a third-party in the event of an assignment ("Nonassignable Assets") unless
and until such consent shall have been obtained. Each Seller shall, and shall
cause each of its Affiliates to, cooperate with Purchaser at its request to
obtain such consents promptly. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, in
the event consents to the assignment thereof cannot be obtained (and, with
respect to any Restricted Material Contract that has not been assigned, if
Purchaser has elected to waive such assignment as a condition precedent to
Purchaser's obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby),
such Nonassignable Assets shall be held, as of and from the Closing Date, by
the applicable Seller or applicable Affiliate of



EXHIBIT HAS BEEN REDACTED AND IS THE SUBJECT OF A CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
REQUEST. CONFIDENTIAL PORTIONS OF EXHIBIT ARE MARKED WITH [***] AND HAVE BEEN
FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.

such Seller in trust for Purchaser, and the covenants and obligations
thereunder shall be performed by Purchaser in such applicable Seller's or
Affiliate's name, and all benefits and obligations existing thereunder shall
be for Purchaser's account. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each
Seller shall take or cause to be taken at such Seller's expense such actions
in its name or otherwise as Purchaser may reasonably request so as to provide
Purchaser with the benefits of the Nonassignable Assets and to effect
collection of money or other consideration that becomes due and payable under
the Nonassignable Assets, and such Seller or applicable Affiliate of such
Seller shall promptly pay over to Purchaser all money or other consideration
received by it in respect of all Nonassignable Assets. As of and from the
Closing Date, each Seller, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, authorizes
Purchaser, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the
Nonassignable Assets, to perform all of the obligations and receive all of the
benefits of such Seller or its Affiliates under the Nonassignable Assets and
appoints Purchaser as its attorney-in-fact to act in its name on its behalf or
in the name of such Seller or Affiliate of such Seller and on such Seller's or
Affiliate's behalf with respect thereto. Subject to the foregoing, [***].



2.6 Proration of Certain Expenses. Subject to Section 11.1 with respect to
Taxes, and except as may otherwise be set forth in a Facility Lease Agreement,
all rents and other payments (including any prepaid amounts) due under the
Real Property Leases and any other leases constituting part of the Purchased
Assets shall be prorated between Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on
the other hand, as of the Closing Date. Sellers shall be jointly and severally
responsible for all rents (including any percentage rent, additional rent and
any accrued tax and operating expense reimbursements and escalations), charges
and other payments of any kind accruing during any period under the Real
Property Leases or any such other leases up to and including the Closing Date.
Purchaser shall be responsible for all such rents, charges and other payments
accruing during any period under the Real Property Leases or any such other
leases (in each case that are Purchased Assets) after the Closing Date. In
addition, all payments due to utility services, telephone services, postage
and other monthly service and similar agreements shall be prorated between
Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, as of the Closing
Date. Sellers shall be jointly and severally responsible for amounts due for
utility and other services provided up to and including the Closing Date and
Purchaser shall be responsible for amounts due for utility and other services
provided after the Closing Date. Purchaser or any Seller (as applicable) shall
pay the full amount of any valid invoices under such utility or other services
or leases received by it and shall be promptly reimbursed by the other party
for such party's share of such expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Sellers shall be jointly and severally responsible for all liabilities
relating to any pending insurance premium or any other audits, including any
future audits, due on insurance policies of any Seller.

2.7 Receivables. Each Seller shall provide reasonable assistance to Purchaser
in the collection of accounts receivable. If any Seller shall be credited
with, receive the benefit of or receive payment with respect to accounts
receivable or other amounts that are included in the Purchased Assets, then
such Seller shall promptly forward such payment or value of such credit or
benefit to Purchaser. If Purchaser shall receive payment of any Retained
Receivable, Purchaser shall promptly forward such payment to the Sellers'
Representative. In order to minimize the need

REQUEST. CONFIDENTIAL PORTIONS OF EXHIBIT ARE MARKED WITH [***] AND HAVE BEEN
FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.

for such corrective activity in the future, either party may request the other
to join in one or more joint notices to specified third parties, directing
such parties to make all or specified future payments directly to the Sellers'
Representative or Purchaser, as applicable. [***].

2.8 Purchase Price Allocation. Not later than ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Sellers'
Representative a copy of Form 8594 and any required exhibits thereto (the
"Asset Acquisition Statement") allocating the Total Consideration among the
Purchased Assets, as determined in accordance with the statement attached
hereto as Exhibit B (the "Purchase Price Allocation Statement") and Section
1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (and any
similar provisions of state or local Law, as appropriate). Each Seller shall
cooperate with Purchaser as requested in the preparation of the Asset
Acquisition Statement. Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Sellers'
Representative revised copies of the Asset Acquisition Statement (the "Revised
Statements") so as to report any matters on the Asset Acquisition Statement
that need updating (including purchase price adjustments, if any). The Total
Consideration paid by Purchaser for the Purchased Assets shall be allocated in
accordance with the Asset Acquisition Statement or, if applicable, the last of
the Revised Statements provided by Purchaser to the Sellers' Representative.
For purposes of this Section 2.7, the Purchased Assets to be treated as
intangible assets as provided in Section 197 of the Code shall not include the
covenant not to compete as set forth in Section 7.7 and the non-
competition/non-solicitation agreements of the holders of capital stock or
other equity or voting securities of each of the Sellers contemplated by
Section 9.1(s), as the same are not intended to be compensatory in nature but
rather sought to protect Purchaser's investment in the acquired goodwill as
evidenced by the Purchase Premium, and as no separate consideration being paid
therefor.

2.9 Withholding. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement,
Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted or
withheld, from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
are required to be deducted and withheld under the Code or other applicable
Laws. Any such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

ARTICLE III 

CONSIDERATION

3.1 Consideration. The aggregate consideration for the Purchased Assets shall
be (a) an amount in cash equal to the Final Purchase Price (subject to the
withholding of the Holdback Amount), and (b) the assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities (the "Total Consideration").

3.2 Payment of Purchase Price. On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay, or
cause to be paid, the Estimated Closing Purchase Price (less the Holdback
Amount) by:







(a) transferring to the parties entitled thereto amounts sufficient to pay in
full all obligations secured by liens on any of the Purchased Assets unless
such liens have been terminated at the Closing without requiring such payment;
and



(b) transferring to the Sellers' Representative the balance of the Estimated
Closing Purchase Price (as reduced for any payments made pursuant to Section
3.2(a)), less the Holdback Amount, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds into an account to be designated by Sellers in writing not fewer than
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

3.3 Estimated Closing Book Value Amounts.

(a) On or prior to 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the Friday prior to the Closing,
Sellers will have delivered to Purchaser a statement in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit C (the "Seller Estimated Statement") setting forth Sellers'
good faith estimate of (i) the Closing Amount, (ii) the PTO Amount, (iii) the
Customer Rebate Amount and (iv) the Closing Purchase Price based on the
foregoing items.

(b) Following the receipt of the Seller Estimated Statement and prior to the
Closing, Purchaser and Sellers shall (x) conduct a physical inventory
satisfactory to Purchaser and Sellers and a review of Sellers' financial and
accounting records, in each case conducted as close to the Closing Date as
reasonably practicable, and (y) agree in good faith on an estimate of (1) the
Closing Amount (the "Estimated Closing Amount"), (2) the PTO Amount (the
"Estimated PTO Amount"), (3) the Customer Rebate Amount (the "Estimated
Customer Rebate Amount"), and (4) the Closing Purchase Price based on the
foregoing items (the "Estimated Closing Purchase Price"). Such estimates shall
be jointly developed by Purchaser and Sellers, and the Estimated Closing
Purchase Price shall not be final until Purchaser and Sellers have agreed as
to such calculations. In computing the Estimated Closing Purchase Price, and
the items included in such calculation, no value shall be given to any
Excluded Assets. When agreed, the Estimated Closing Amount, the Estimated PTO
Amount, the Estimated Customer Rebate Amount and the Estimated Closing
Purchase Price shall be embodied in a Purchase Price Certificate substantially
in the form of Exhibit D (the "Purchase Price Certificate") to be executed by
Purchaser and Sellers. The Estimated Closing Amount shall be comprised of
Purchaser and Sellers' agreed upon, good faith estimates of:

(i) the book value (to be determined in accordance with GAAP, consistently
applied) at the Closing of Sellers' fixed assets required to operate the
Business (which shall be listed on a fixed asset schedule delivered to
Purchaser at the Closing and exclusive of any fixed assets that are Excluded
Assets) (the "Closing Fixed Assets");

(ii) the book value (as determined using FIFO methodology consistent with
Seller\'s historical practices and GAAP, before the application of any LIFO
reserves made by Sellers) at the Closing of Sellers' inventory (the "Closing
Inventory"), net of manufacturers



EXHIBIT HAS BEEN REDACTED AND IS THE SUBJECT OF A CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
REQUEST. CONFIDENTIAL PORTIONS OF EXHIBIT ARE MARKED WITH [***] AND HAVE BEEN
FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.

incentive allowances and rebates for all items, net of cash discounts for all
cigarette items, net of [***] of all cash discounts and/or stamping allowances
on all cigarette tax stamp items, and net of an allowance equal to [***] of
all non-cigarette and non-cigarette stamp items (to reflect cash discounts not
reflected in Sellers' item unit costs), as reflected in Sellers' acquisition
cost field in Sellers' inventory system; provided, however, that there shall
be a reserve not to exceed [***] against the book value of Sellers' inventory
to account for Unsaleable Inventory and inventory of any Inactive Customer;

(iii) the amount of Sellers' deposits on inventories (to be determined prior
to the Closing) at the Closing for goods in transit or prepaid, subject to
adjustment for the inventory being delivered to Purchaser in good and
marketable condition, to the extent not included the Closing Inventory or the
Closing Other Assets, respectively (the "Closing Deposits");

(iv) the book value as of the Closing of Sellers' Adjusted Eligible
Receivables, determined in accordance with GAAP as calculated in accordance
with Schedule 3.3(b)(iv) (the "Closing Adjusted Eligible Receivables"); and

(v) the book value as of the Closing of Sellers' Other Financial Assets (which
shall be listed on a schedule of Other Financial Assets agreed to by Purchaser
at the Closing), determined in accordance with GAAP consistent with past
practice (the "Closing Other Assets").

3.4 Post-Closing Price Adjustment.

(a) As promptly as practicable, but no later than one hundred twenty (120)
days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause to be prepared and
delivered to the Sellers' Representative a closing statement (the "Closing
Statement") setting forth Purchaser's calculation of the Closing Amount, the
PTO Amount and the Customer Rebate Amount as of 12:01 A.M. Eastern Time on the
Closing Date.

(b) If the Sellers' Representative disagrees with Purchaser's calculation of
the Closing Amount, the PTO Amount and the Customer Rebate Amount delivered
pursuant to Section 3.4(a), the Sellers' Representative may, within thirty
(30) days after delivery of the Closing Statement, deliver a notice to
Purchaser disagreeing with such calculation and setting forth the Sellers'
Representative's calculation of such amount. Any such notice of disagreement
shall specify those items or amounts as to which the Sellers' Representative
disagrees and the reason for such disagreement, and the Sellers'
Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts
contained in the Closing Statement and the calculation of the Closing Amount,
the PTO Amount and the Customer Rebate Amount delivered pursuant to Section
3.4(a). If the Sellers' Representative fails to deliver a notice of
disagreement within the specified period, the Sellers' Representative shall be
deemed to have agreed with all items and amounts contained in the Closing
Statement and the calculation of the Closing Amount, the PTO Amount and the
Customer Rebate Amount delivered pursuant to Section 3.4(a).

(c) If a notice of disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to Section
3.4(b), Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall, during the thirty
(30) days following such delivery, use their commercially reasonable efforts
to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine, as
may be required, the amount of the Closing Amount, the PTO Amount and the
Customer Rebate Amount, which amounts shall not be less than the amounts
thereof shown in Purchaser's calculation delivered pursuant to Section 3.4(a)
nor more than the amounts thereof shown in the Sellers'



Representative's calculation delivered pursuant to Section 3.4(b). If the
parties so resolve all disputes, the computation of the Closing Amount, the
PTO Amount and the Customer Rebate Amount, as amended to the extent necessary
to reflect the resolution of the dispute, shall be conclusive and binding on
the parties. If during such period Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative
are unable to reach an agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause Grant
Thornton LLP (or if unable or unwilling to accept its mandate, an independent
accountant to be mutually agreed upon by Purchaser and the Sellers'
Representative) (Grant Thornton LLP or such other independent accounting firm,
as the case may be, the "Independent Accountant"), to review this Agreement
and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating the Closing
Amount, the PTO Amount and the Customer Rebate Amount (it being understood
that in making such calculation, the Independent Accountant shall be
functioning as an expert and not as an arbitrator). In making such
calculation, the Independent Accountant shall consider only those items or
amounts in the Closing Statement and Purchaser's calculation of the Closing
Amount, the PTO Amount and the Customer Rebate Amount as to which the Sellers'
Representative has disagreed. The Independent Accountant shall deliver to
Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative, as promptly as practicable (but in
any case no later than thirty (30) days from the date of engagement of the
Independent Accountant), a report setting forth such calculation. Such report
shall be final and binding upon Purchaser, the Sellers' Representative and
Sellers, absent manifest error. The fees, costs and expenses of the
Independent Accountant's review and report shall be borne by Purchaser and the
Sellers' Representative in the same proportion that the dollar amount of the
disputed items and amounts which are not resolved in favor of Purchaser or the
Sellers' Representative, as applicable, bears to the total dollar amount of
disputed items and amounts resolved by the Independent Accountant. For
illustration purposes only, (i) if the total disputed amount by the Sellers'
Representative is $1,000, and the Sellers' Representative is awarded $500 by
the Independent Accountant, Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall
bear the Independent Accountant's fees, costs and expenses equally or (ii) if
the total disputed amount by the Sellers' Representative is $1,000, and the
Sellers' Representative is awarded $250 by the Independent Accountant, the
Sellers' Representative shall bear seventy-five percent (75%) and Purchaser
shall bear twenty-five percent (25%) of the Independent Accountant's fees,
costs and expenses. Each of Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall
bear the fees, costs and expenses of its own accountants and all of its other
expenses incurred in connection with matters contemplated by this Section
3.4(c). The Closing Amount, the PTO Amount and the Customer Rebate Amount, as
finally determined by agreement by the parties and/or by the Independent
Accountant as provided in this Section 3.4, shall be referred to herein as the
"Actual Closing Amount," the "Actual PTO Amount" and the "Actual Customer
Rebate Amount", respectively.

(d) Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall, and shall cause their
respective representatives to, reasonably cooperate and assist in the
preparation of the Closing Statement, the calculation of the Closing Amount,
the PTO Amount and the Customer Rebate Amount and the conduct of the review
referred to in this Section 3.4, including the making available of books,
records, work papers and personnel to the extent necessary.

(e) If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Closing Purchase
Price, the Sellers' Representative shall pay, or cause to be paid, to
Purchaser, in the manner provided in Section 3.4(f), the amount of such
difference. If the Final Purchase Price is more than the Estimated Closing
Purchase Price, Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Sellers'
Representative, in the manner provided in Section 3.4(f), the amount of such
difference.

REQUEST. CONFIDENTIAL PORTIONS OF EXHIBIT ARE MARKED WITH [***] AND HAVE BEEN
FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.

(f) Any payment pursuant to Section 3.4(e) shall be made at a mutually
convenient time and place within three (3) Business Days after the Final
Purchase Price has been finally determined by wire transfer by Purchaser or
the Sellers' Representative, as the case may be, of immediately available
funds to the account of such other party as may be designated in writing by
such other party.

(g) The parties agree and acknowledge that any payment pursuant to Section
3.4(e) will be treated by the parties as an adjustment to the aggregate
consideration paid in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

3.5 Certain Funds in Bank Accounts. At the Closing, in addition to the
Estimated Closing Purchase Price, Purchaser shall pay to the Sellers'
Representative the amount (if any) of the "ledger funds" and unavailable funds
in the Bank Accounts at the Closing, to the extent that any of the foregoing
have been posted and have reduced any Seller's accounts receivable sub ledger
or related asset account balance.

3.6 Holdback.

(a) At the Closing, Purchaser shall hold back from the payment of the
Estimated Closing Purchase Price an amount equal to [***] (the "Holdback
Amount"). The Holdback Amount shall be held by Purchaser or an Affiliate of
Purchaser to satisfy any amounts due from any Seller for any claim for
indemnification pursuant to Article X. The Holdback Amount shall be released
to the Sellers' Representative for the benefit of Sellers in equal
installments on each anniversary of the Closing Date over the two (2) years
following the Closing Date (each, an "Early Release Date"); provided, however,
that Purchaser shall be permitted to withhold from any scheduled disbursement
from the Holdback Amount any amounts subject to a Claim made in good faith
pursuant to Article X (but only for so long as such indemnification claims
remain outstanding and only for the amounts remaining in dispute). The
Holdback Amounts shall be attributable to the Purchase Premium in allocating
the Total Consideration among the Purchased Assets pursuant to Section 2.7.

(b) In the event amounts are withheld from disbursement to the Sellers'
Representative on an Early Release Date because of an unresolved claim for
indemnification by Purchaser, as each such unresolved or unsatisfied claim for
indemnification is finally resolved or satisfied in accordance with the
provisions of Article X, any remaining portion of the scheduled early release
shall be disbursed to the Sellers' Representative. [***].

ARTICLE IV 

CLOSING AND TERMINATION

4.1 Closing Date. The consummation of the purchase and sale of the Purchased
Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities provided for in Article
II (the "Closing") shall occur on a mutually agreeable Monday that is a

Eastern Time on the Closing Date.

4.2 Termination of Agreement. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the
Closing as follows:

(a) by Sellers or Purchaser on or after [***] (the "Termination Date"), if the
Closing shall not have occurred by the close of business on such date;
provided, however, that, in the event that the conditions set forth in Section
9.1(e), Section 9.1(f), Section 9.1(g) (solely related to the HSR Act or any
other applicable Competition Laws), Section 9.2(c), Section 9.2(d) and Section

other conditions set forth in Article IX have been have been satisfied or
waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
by actions taken at the Closing provided that each such condition is then
capable of being satisfied at a Closing on such date) on or prior to the
Termination Date, then the Termination Date shall be extended without further
action by the parties to [***] after the Termination Date; provided, further,
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 4.2(a)

Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted, directly or indirectly, in, the
failure of the Closing to occur by the Termination Date;

(b) by mutual written consent of Sellers and Purchaser;

(c) by Purchaser if there has been an event, change or occurrence that,
individually or in the aggregate with any such other events, changes,
occurrences or circumstances, has a Material Adverse Effect;

(d) by Sellers or Purchaser if there shall be in effect a final nonappealable
Order of a Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction restraining, enjoining
or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated

this Section 4.2(d) shall not be available to a party if such Order was
primarily due to the failure of such party to perform any of its obligations
under this Agreement;

(e) by Purchaser if any Seller shall have materially breached or failed to
perform in all material respects any of its covenants or agreements set forth
in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of any Seller shall

conditions set forth in Section 9.1(a) or Section 9.1(b) would not be
satisfied and such breach is incapable of being cured or, if capable of being

by Purchaser or Sellers pursuant to Section 4.2, written notice thereof shall
forthwith be given to the other party or parties, and this Agreement shall
thereupon terminate, and the purchase of the Purchased Assets hereunder shall

7.4 HSR Filing; Consents.

(a) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 7.4,
each of the Sellers and Purchaser shall cooperate with each other and use (and
shall cause its respective Affiliates to use) its commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing all things
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this Agreement and
applicable Law to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as soon as reasonably practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly
as reasonably practicable all documentation to effect all necessary notices,
reports and other filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable all
consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or
advisable to be obtained from any third-party (including but not limited to
the consents, waivers, approvals and notices referred to in Section 5.4(b)
hereof) and/or any Governmental Body, including under the Competition Laws, in
order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, except
for all filing fees payable pursuant to the HSR Act or any additional
Competition Laws, for which Purchaser shall



be solely responsible, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall be
required to pay any amounts in connection with obtaining any consent,
registration, approval, permit or authorization.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the Sellers
and Purchaser (and their respective Affiliates, if applicable) shall: (i)

hereof, file any and all notices, reports and other documents required to be
filed by such party under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions

to cause promptly the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act; (ii) as promptly as practicable make all filings,
and use commercially reasonable efforts to timely obtain all consents,
permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances and approvals, and to cause the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods, as may be
required under any other applicable Competition Laws (to the extent required);
and (iii) if advisable, provide such information as may be requested by the
DOJ or the FTC under the HSR Act or by any other Governmental Body in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as well as
any information required to be submitted to comply with, a request for
additional information in order to commence or end a statutory waiting period.

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 7.4,
each party hereto shall (i) give the other parties prompt notice of the making
or commencement of any Legal Proceeding with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) keep the other parties reasonably

inform the other parties of any communication to or from the FTC, DOJ or any
other Governmental Body to the extent regarding the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, or regarding any such Legal Proceeding, and provide a copy
of all written communications. Subject to applicable Law, in advance and to
the extent practicable, each of Purchaser and the Sellers, as the case may be,
will consult the other on all the information relating to Purchaser or any
Seller, as the case may be, and any of their respective Affiliates that appear
in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third-party
and/or any Governmental Body in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and shall incorporate all comments reasonably proposed by
Purchaser or any Seller, as the case may be. In addition, except as may be
prohibited by any Governmental Body or by any applicable Law, in connection
with any Legal Proceeding in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each party hereto will permit authorized representatives of the
other party to be present at each meeting or conference relating to such Legal
Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any
document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Body in
connection with such Legal Proceeding; provided, however, Purchaser shall, on
behalf of the parties, control and make the final determination as to the
appropriate strategy relating to any filing or submission which is necessary
under the HSR Act or other applicable Competition Laws, including with respect
to any filings, notifications, submissions and communications with or to any
Governmental Body; provided, further, that Purchaser shall consider in good
faith the views of Sellers and their counsel in connection therewith.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither Purchaser
nor any Seller shall have any obligation under this Agreement to (i) commit to

or their respective Affiliates, (ii) terminate, relinquish, modify, transfer,
assign, restructure, or waive existing agreements, collaborations,
relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other arrangements
of the Business or Purchaser, any Seller or their respective Affiliates, or
(iii) create or consent to create any relationships, ventures, contractual
rights, obligations or other arrangements of the Business or Purchaser, any
Seller or their respective Affiliates (or, in each case, to enter, or offer to
enter, into agreements and stipulate to the entry of an order or decree or
file appropriate applications with any Governmental Body in connection with
any of the foregoing and in the case of actions by or with respect to any
Seller or such Seller's businesses or assets, by consenting to such action by
such Seller) (each a "Divestiture Action") to avoid the entry of, or to effect
the dissolution of or vacate or lift, any order, decree or ruling, that would
otherwise have the effect of preventing consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that at the request of
Purchaser, each Seller shall agree to any Divestiture Action with respect to
the Business, provided that such action is conditioned upon and is effective
no sooner than the Closing. Purchaser shall have the right (but not the
obligation) to propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect, by consent
decree, hold separate order or otherwise, any and all Divestiture Actions or
otherwise to offer to take or offer to commit (and if such offer is accepted,
commit to and effect) to take any Divestiture Action as may be required to
resolve any Governmental Body's objections to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; provided, however, that Purchaser shall consider in good faith
the views of Sellers and their counsel in connection therewith.

(e) Each Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain at the
earliest practicable date all consents, waivers, approvals and notices
required to consummate, or in connection with, the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the consents, waivers, approvals and notices
referred to in Section 5.4(b) hereof. All such consents, waivers, approvals
and notices shall be in writing and in form and substance satisfactory to
Purchaser, and executed counterparts of such consents, waivers and approvals
shall be delivered to Purchaser promptly after receipt thereof, and copies of
such notices shall be delivered to Purchaser promptly after the making
thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither
Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to pay any amounts in
connection with obtaining any consent, waiver or approval, except in
connection with obtaining such licenses as shall be required by Purchaser to
conduct the Business following the Closing and the cost of all filing fees
payable pursuant to the HSR Act or any additional Competition Laws, for which
Purchaser shall be solely liable.

7.5 Further Assurances. Each of the Sellers and Purchaser shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (a) take, or cause to be taken, all actions
necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (b) cause the fulfillment at the earliest practicable date of
all of the conditions to their respective obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.







7.6 No Shop.

(a) No Seller shall, nor shall any Seller permit any of its Affiliates,
directors, officers, Employees, representatives or agents (collectively, the
"Representatives") to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, encourage,
negotiate, initiate, recommend, or enter into, either as the proposed
surviving, merged, acquiring or acquired entity, any transaction involving a
merger, consolidation, business combination, purchase or disposition of any
material amount of the Purchased Assets or any material portion of the equity
interests of any Seller other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (an "Acquisition Transaction"), (ii) facilitate, encourage, solicit
or initiate discussions, negotiations or submissions of proposals or offers in
respect of an Acquisition Transaction, (iii) furnish or cause to be furnished,
to any Person, any information concerning the business, operations, properties
or assets of any Seller in connection with an Acquisition Transaction or (iv)
otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate in, facilitate
or encourage, any effort or attempt by any other Person to do or seek any of
the foregoing.

(b) Each Seller shall notify Purchaser orally and in writing promptly (but in
no event later than twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt by such Seller or
any of its Representatives of any proposal or offer from any Person other than
Purchaser to effect an Acquisition Transaction, or any request for non-public
information relating to any Seller or for access to the properties, books or
records of any Seller by any Person other than Purchaser in connection with
any such offer or proposal. Each Seller shall keep Purchaser informed, on a
current basis, of any material changes in the status of any such proposal,
offer, indication or request.

(c) Each Seller shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with
any Persons other than Purchaser conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Transaction. Each Seller agrees not to release any third-party
from the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any agreement relating
to any Seller or the assets or business thereof.

7.7 Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation; Confidentiality.

(a) For a period from the Closing until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the
Closing Date, no Seller shall, and each Seller shall cause its Affiliates to
not, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate or control, or participate
in the ownership, management, operation or control of, any business, whether
in corporate, proprietorship or partnership form or otherwise, engaged in the
convenience store distribution business or that otherwise competes with the
Business in any state in which the Business currently operates (a "Restricted
Business"); provided, however, that the restrictions contained in this Section
7.7(a) shall not restrict the acquisition by any Seller, directly or
indirectly, of less than two percent (2%) of the outstanding capital stock of
any publicly traded company engaged in a Restricted Business.



(b) For a period from the Closing until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the
Closing Date, no Seller shall, and each Seller shall cause its Affiliates to
not (i) cause, solicit, induce or encourage any Employee who becomes an
employee of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries to leave such employment or hire, or
employ or otherwise engage any such individual, or (ii) cause, induce or
encourage any actual or prospective client, customer, supplier or licensor of
the Business (including any existing or former customer of any Seller and any
Person that becomes a client or customer of the Business after the Closing),
or any other Person who has a business relationship with the Business, to
terminate or modify any such actual or prospective relationship.

(c) Except as set forth in Section 7.7(c) of the Disclosure Schedule, from and
after the date hereof, no Seller shall, and each Seller shall cause its
Affiliates, officers and directors to not, directly or indirectly, disclose,
reveal, divulge or communicate to any Person other than authorized officers,
directors and employees of Purchaser, or use or otherwise exploit for its own
benefit or for the benefit of anyone other than Purchaser, any Confidential
Information. No Seller shall, and its Affiliates, officers and directors shall
not, have any obligation to keep confidential any Confidential Information if
and to the extent disclosure thereof is specifically required by applicable
Law or necessary for purposes of proving a claim or asserting a defense in any
Legal Proceeding; provided, however, that in the event disclosure is required
by applicable Law, such Seller shall provide Purchaser with prompt notice of
such requirement prior to making any disclosure so that Purchaser may seek an
appropriate protective order; provided, further, however, that in the event
disclosure is necessary for purposes of proving a claim or asserting a defense
in any Legal Proceeding (other than a Legal Proceeding between Purchaser and
any Seller), each Seller shall have its legal counsel in such litigation issue
an opinion to Purchaser certifying such fact. For purposes of this Section
7.7(c), "Confidential Information" means any information with respect to the
Business, including methods of operation, customers, customer lists, products,
prices, fees, costs, Technology, inventions, Trade Secrets, know-how,
Software, marketing methods, plans, personnel, suppliers, competitors, markets
or other specialized information or proprietary matters. Confidential
Information does not include, and there shall be no obligation hereunder with
respect to, information that (i) is generally available to the public on the
date of this Agreement or (ii) becomes generally available to the public other
than as a result of a disclosure not otherwise permissible hereunder.

(d) The covenants and undertakings contained in this Section 7.7 relate to
matters which are of a special, unique and extraordinary character and a
violation of any of the terms of this Section 7.7 will cause irreparable
injury to Purchaser, the amount of which will be impossible to estimate or
determine and which cannot be adequately compensated. Accordingly, the remedy
at law for any breach of this Section 7.7 will be inadequate. Therefore,
Purchaser will be entitled to an injunction, restraining order or other
equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of any
breach of this Section 7.7 without the necessity of proving actual damages or
posting any bond whatsoever. The rights and remedies provided by this Section
7.7 are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies which
Purchaser may have hereunder or at law or in equity.

(e) The parties hereto agree that, if any court of competent jurisdiction in a
final nonappealable judgment determines that a specified time period, a
specified geographical area, a



specified business limitation or any other relevant feature of this Section
7.7 is unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, then a lesser time
period, geographical area, business limitation or other relevant feature which
is determined by such court to be reasonable, not arbitrary and not against
public policy may be enforced against the applicable party.

7.8 Preservation of Records. Each of the Sellers and Purchaser agree that each
of them shall preserve and keep the records held by it or its Affiliates
relating to the Business for a period of seven (7) years from the Closing
Date, and shall make such records and personnel and the Carroll, Iowa
facilities available to the other as may be reasonably required by such party
in connection with, among other things, any insurance claims by, Legal
Proceedings against or governmental investigations of any Seller or Purchaser
or any of their Affiliates or in order to enable such Seller or Purchaser to
comply with its respective obligations under this Agreement and each other
agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby.

7.9 Publicity.

(a) Neither Purchaser, nor Seller shall issue any press release or public
announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
without

obtaining the prior written approval of the other party, which approval will
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless disclosure is otherwise
required by applicable Law or by the applicable rules of any stock exchange or
other market.

(b) Each Seller agrees that it shall not disclose or otherwise make available
to the public the terms of this Agreement and shall not publicly file copies
of this Agreement.

7.10 Interim Financial Statements. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in
no event later than twenty-eight (28) calendar days after the end of each
interim four-week financial reporting period of Sellers during the period from
the date hereof to the Closing, Sellers shall provide Purchaser with an
unaudited interim-period consolidated balance sheet as of each interim period
end date, and the related unaudited statements of income and changes in equity
for such periods. In addition, from the date hereof to the Closing, Sellers
shall continue to provide Purchaser (in the form prepared by, and on the
schedule of, Sellers consistent with past practice) the same operating or
management reports as provided to Purchaser during the due diligence process.

7.11 Use of Name. Each Seller agrees that upon the Closing, Purchaser shall
receive an assignment of such rights as are held by such Seller to the use of
the name "Farner-Bocken", "Farner-Bocken Company" and "Farner-Bocken Building
Company" and any similar or derivative names to which any rights are held by
such Seller, and any service marks, trademarks, trade names, d/b/a names,
fictitious names, identifying symbols, logos, emblems or signs containing or
comprising the foregoing, or otherwise used in the Business, including any
name or mark confusingly similar thereto to which any rights are held by such
Seller, whether or not registered (collectively, the "Seller Marks"), and no
Seller shall, and shall not permit any Affiliate or third-party to, use any of
the Seller Marks or any variation or simulation thereof following the Closing.

any Seller Document or Purchaser Document, from the date of this Agreement and

(a) Each Seller shall give written notice with specificity to Purchaser,
referring to this Section 7.13(a), as promptly as reasonably practicable upon
becoming aware of (i) any fact, change, condition, circumstance, event,
occurrence or non-occurrence arising after the date of this Agreement that has
caused or is reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty in this
Agreement made by it to be untrue or inaccurate in any respect at any time
after the date hereof and prior to the Closing or (ii) the institution of or
the threat of institution of any Legal Proceeding related to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of doubt, the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this Section 7.13(a) shall not serve to qualify any
representations or warranties and shall not cure any breach of, or non-
compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or limit the remedies
available to Purchaser.

(b) [***].

7.14 Cooperation with Debt Financing. In the event that Purchaser obtains debt
financing for any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Sellers

Affiliates may reasonably request in connection with obtaining such debt
financing, including (a) cooperating with prospective lenders in performing
their due diligence, (b) furnishing customary payoff letters, lien
terminations and instruments of discharge with respect to the Purchased
Assets, in each case, effective as of or prior to the Closing Date, and (c)

each Seller agrees to pay all amounts owing under any accounts payable as they
become due, including open receivers and any accounts payable relating to
expenses of any Seller in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby unless such accounts payable is being disputed by Sellers
in good faith. Purchaser acknowledges that reasonable assistance of
transferred Employees will be necessary to effect the foregoing and to
otherwise wind down the Business, and agrees to make such Employees available
to Sellers for such purposes for up to ninety (90) days after the Closing
Date, as may be reasonably required, at no cost to Sellers.

ARTICLE VIII 

EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

8.1 Employment.

(a) Transferred Employees. From time to time prior to the Closing Date, each
Seller shall provide to Purchaser (i) a complete and accurate list of all of
the Employees as of such date and substantially in the same form as the list
provided in Section 5.15(a) of the Disclosure Schedule and (ii) a list of all
vested and accrued but unused vacation time and paid time off with respect to
the Transferred Employees estimated as of the Closing Date and calculated in
accordance with the applicable Seller's standard practice (each, an "Updated
Employee List"). Purchaser shall deliver an offer of employment (on an "at
will" basis [***]), contingent upon the Closing and subject to Purchaser's
customary hiring requirements, to those Employees identified by Purchaser

on a schedule to be delivered to Sellers no later than five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing, which shall consist of substantially all of the
Employees of Seller set forth on the most recent Updated Employee List
provided to Purchaser (the "Offered Employees"), to commence such employment
immediately upon the Closing Date; provided, however, that Purchaser may offer
employment to less than substantially all of such Employees if the Business is
or would reasonably be expected to be materially reduced as a result of the
announcement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Such
individuals who accept such offer by the Closing Date are referred to as the
"Transferred Employees."

(b) With respect to all Employees, Sellers shall be jointly and severally
responsible for providing any notices required to be given and otherwise
complying with WARN or similar statutes or regulations of any jurisdiction
relating to any plant closing or mass layoff (or similar triggering event)
caused by any Seller on or prior to the Closing Date. Sellers shall be jointly
and severally responsible for obligations and liabilities under WARN and/or
similar statutes or regulations of any jurisdiction resulting from an
Employment Loss, as defined by the applicable statute or regulation, due to
Purchaser's failure to offer employment to Employees on sufficient terms and
conditions.

(c) In addition, each Transferred Employee shall, as of the Closing Date,
receive full credit for service with a Seller prior to the Closing Date for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and vacation entitlement under
the employee benefit plans of Purchaser in which such Transferred Employee
becomes a participant (excluding any equity awards or incentives granted after
the Closing Date) to the same extent such service was recognized by a Seller
prior to the Closing Date under comparable Employee Benefit Plans; provided,
however, that nothing herein shall result in the duplication of any benefits
for the same period of service.

(d) Excluded Employees. Any Employee who is not offered employment by
Purchaser (or an Affiliate of Purchaser) prior to the Closing or who does not
accept an offer of employment by Purchaser (or an Affiliate of Purchaser) and
commence work with Purchaser (or an Affiliate of Purchaser) immediately after
the Closing, in each case pursuant to Section 8.1(a), is referred to as an
"Excluded Employee."











8.2 Standard Procedure. Pursuant to the "Standard Procedure" provided in
section 4 of Revenue Procedure 2004-53, 2004-34 IRB 320, (a) Purchaser and
each Seller shall report on a predecessor/successor basis as set forth
therein, (b) no Seller will be relieved from filing a Form W‑2 with respect to
any Transferred Employees and (c) Purchaser will undertake to file (or cause
to be filed) a Form W‑2 for each such Transferred Employee only with respect
to the portion of the year during which such Employees are employed by
Purchaser that includes the Closing Date, excluding the portion of such year
that such Employee was employed by any Seller.

8.3 Employee Benefits. Each Seller shall be responsible and liable for
providing, or continuing to provide, health continuation coverage notices
under COBRA with respect to its respective Employees (and such Employees'
qualified beneficiaries) who experience a COBRA "qualifying event" on or prior
to the Closing Date under any Employee Benefit Plan.

8.4 Third-Party Beneficiaries. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement
to the contrary, nothing in this Article VIII shall (a) be deemed or construed
to be an amendment or other

modification of any Employee Benefit Plan or (b) create any third-party rights
in any current or former employee, director or other service provider of any
Seller, Purchaser, or any of their respective affiliates (or any beneficiaries
or dependents thereof). Nothing contained in this Article VIII shall interfere
with the right of any Seller or Purchaser to terminate the employment of any
employee for any reason.

10.3 Notice of Claim.

(a) As used herein, the term "Claim" means a claim for indemnification of an
Indemnified Party for Losses under this Article X.

(b) The applicable Indemnified Party shall give written notice of a Claim
executed by an authorized representative of such Indemnified Party (a "Notice
of Claim") to the Indemnitor Administrator reasonably promptly after the
Indemnified Party becomes aware of the existence of any potential claim for
indemnification under this Article X, arising from or relating to:

(i) any matter specified in Section 10.2(a) or Section 10.2(b); or

(ii) the assertion, whether orally or in writing, against any Indemnified
Party of a Legal Proceeding brought by a third-party against such Indemnified
Party that is based on, arises out of, or relates to subject matter that, if
determined adversely to such Indemnified Party (regardless of the eventual
outcome of such Legal Proceeding), could result in a Claim (in each such case,
a "Third-Party Claim").

(c) No delay on the part of an Indemnified Party in giving the Indemnitor
Administrator a Notice of Claim (or any update or amendment thereto after
conducting discovery regarding the underlying facts and circumstances set
forth therein) shall relieve the Sellers' Representative or any Seller, on the
one hand, or Purchaser, on the other hand, from any of their respective
obligations under this Article X unless (and then only to the extent that) the
Sellers' Representative or such Seller, on the one hand, or Purchaser, on the
other hand, are materially prejudiced thereby in terms of the amount of Losses
for which such Persons are obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party.

10.4 Defense of Third-Party Claims.

(a) The Indemnified Party shall determine and conduct the investigation,
defense or settlement of any Third-Party Claim, unless both Purchaser and a
Seller are named as a party to such Third-Party Claim, in which case the
Indemnified Party and Indemnitor Administrator shall each conduct the
investigation, defense or settlement of such Third-Party Claim on its own
behalf. The costs and expenses incurred or paid by the Indemnified Party in
connection with the investigation, defense or settlement (including reasonable
attorneys' fees, other professionals' and experts' fees, costs of
investigation and court or arbitration costs) shall be included in the Losses
for which the Indemnified Party may seek indemnification pursuant to a Claim
made by any Indemnified Party hereunder, regardless of the resolution of such
Third-Party Claim.

(b) The Indemnitor Administrator shall at all times have the right to receive
copies of all pleadings, notices and communications with respect to the Third-
Party Claim to the extent that receipt of such documents by the Indemnitor
Administrator does not affect any privilege relating to the Indemnified Party.
The Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnitor Administrator the
opportunity to consult with and participate in, but not to determine or
conduct, any defense of



the Third-Party Claim or settlement negotiations with respect to the Third-
Party Claim, all at the sole expense of the Indemnitor Administrator.

(c) No settlement of any such Third-Party Claim with any third-party claimant
shall be determinative of the amount of Losses relating to such matter, except
with the consent of the Indemnitor Administrator, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and which shall be deemed to
have been given unless the Indemnitor Administrator shall have objected within
thirty (30) days after written request for such consent by the Indemnified
Party.

10.5 Contents of Notice of Claim. Each Notice of Claim by an Indemnified Party
given pursuant to Section 10.3 shall contain the following information: (a)
that such Indemnified Party has directly or indirectly incurred, paid or
properly accrued or, in good faith, believes it shall have to directly or
indirectly incur, pay or accrue, Losses in an aggregate stated amount arising
from such Claim (which amount may be an estimated amount or may be the amount
of Losses claimed by a third-party in a Third-Party Claim); and (b) a brief
description, in reasonable detail (to the extent reasonably available to such
Indemnified Party), of the facts, circumstances or events giving rise to the
alleged Losses based on such Indemnified Party's good faith belief thereof,
including, to the extent reasonably available to such Indemnified Party: (i)
the identity and address of any third-party claimant, (ii) copies of any
formal demand or complaint and (iii) the specific nature of the breach to
which such item is related; provided, however, that the Notice of Claim may be
updated and amended from time to time by the Indemnified Party in good faith
by delivering an updated or amended Notice of Claim to the Indemnitor
Administrator, so long as the delivery of the original Notice of Claim is made
within the applicable claims period and such update or amendment only asserts
bases for liability reasonably related to the underlying facts and
circumstances specifically set forth in such original Notice of Claim;
provided, further, that all Claims for Losses properly set forth in the
original Notice of Claim or any permitted update or amendment thereto shall
remain outstanding until such Claims for Losses have been finally resolved or
satisfied, notwithstanding the expiration of such claims period.

10.6 Resolution of Notice of Claim.

(a) Each Notice of Claim given by an Indemnified Party shall be resolved as
follows:

(i) Uncontested Claims. If, within thirty (30) days after a Notice of Claim is
received by the Indemnitor Administrator, the Indemnitor Administrator does
not contest such Notice of Claim in writing to the Indemnified Party as
provided in Section 10.6(a)(ii), the Indemnitor Administrator shall be
conclusively deemed to have consented, on behalf of the Sellers or Purchaser,
as applicable, to the recovery by the Indemnified Party of the full amount of
Losses (subject to the limitations contained in this Article X) specified in
the Notice of Claim in accordance with this Article X, including the
forfeiture of all or a portion of the Holdback Amount, and, without further
notice, to have stipulated to the entry of a final judgment for damages
against such Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, for such amount in any court
having jurisdiction over the matter where venue is proper.

(ii) Contested Claims. If the Indemnitor Administrator gives the Indemnified
Party written notice contesting all or any portion of a Notice of Claim (a
"Contested Claim") within the thirty (30)-day period specified in Section
10.6(a)(i), then such Contested Claim shall be resolved by either (A) a
written settlement agreement executed by Purchaser and the Sellers'
Representative or (B) in the absence of such a written settlement agreement
within thirty (30) days following receipt by the Indemnified Party of the
written notice from the Indemnitor Administrator, by binding litigation
between Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative in accordance with the terms
and provisions of Section 10.6(b).

(b) Litigation of Contested Claims. Either Purchaser or the Sellers'
Representative may bring suit in the courts of the State of Iowa and the
Federal courts of the United States of America located within the State of
Iowa to resolve a Contested Claim. The decision of a court of competent
jurisdiction as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Notice of
Claim shall be nonappealable, binding and conclusive upon the parties to this
Agreement and the Sellers



and Purchaser, as applicable, shall be obligated to act in accordance with
such decision and, if applicable, withdraw any payments out of the Holdback
Amount in accordance therewith. Judgment upon any award rendered by a court of
competent jurisdiction may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. For
purposes of this Section 10.6(b), in any suit hereunder in which any claim or
the amount thereof stated in a Notice of Claim is at issue, the party seeking
indemnification shall be deemed to be the non-prevailing party unless the
court of competent jurisdiction awards such party more than one-half of the
amount in dispute, in which case the party from whom indemnification is sought
shall be deemed to be the non-prevailing party. The non-prevailing party to a
suit shall pay its own expenses and the expenses, including attorneys' fees
and documented out-of-pocket costs, reasonably incurred by the other party to
the suit.

(c) Payment of Claims. If any amount is determined, agreed or deemed agreed to
be owed to Purchaser in accordance with this Section 10.6, then (i) Purchaser
shall be entitled to withdraw such amount from the Holdback Amount (to the
extent of the Holdback Amount) and (ii) if the remaining Holdback Amount is
insufficient to cover the full amount that is determined, agreed or deemed
agreed to be owed to Purchaser, then, subject to the limitations contained in
Section 10.8, each Seller shall, within ten (10) days following the date such
amount is determined, agreed or deemed agreed to be owed, pay such Seller's
pro rata share of the amount of such shortfall to Purchaser. If any amount is
determined, agreed or deemed agreed to be owed to any Seller in accordance
with this Section 10.6, then within three Business Days following the date
such amount is determined, agreed or deemed agreed to be owed, Purchaser shall
deliver such amount to the Sellers' Representative for further distribution to
Sellers.



EXHIBIT HAS BEEN REDACTED AND IS THE SUBJECT OF A CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
REQUEST. CONFIDENTIAL PORTIONS OF EXHIBIT ARE MARKED WITH [***] AND HAVE BEEN
FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.

10.7 Release of Remaining Holdback Amount. To the extent any Holdback Amount
remains at the time, Purchaser shall subtract from the Holdback Amount being
held by Purchaser any amounts which a Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled
to receive as indemnification pursuant to this Article X. Any such amounts
shall be subtracted from the Holdback Amount after any (i) final decision,
judgment or award shall have been rendered by a Governmental Body of competent
jurisdiction, or (ii) settlement or other agreement shall have been entered
into in writing by the applicable Purchaser Indemnified Party and the Sellers'
Representative. Upon depletion or distribution of the entirety of the Holdback
Amount, any amounts which a Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to receive
as indemnification pursuant to this Article X shall be paid directly to the
applicable Purchaser Indemnified Party by Sellers.

10.8 Limitations on Indemnification.

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article X: (i) Sellers shall not
have any indemnification obligations for Losses under Section 10.2(a)(i)
unless and until the aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds [***] (the
"Deductible"), except in the case of fraud; provided, however, that from and
after such time as the total amount of such Losses incurred by Purchaser
Indemnified Parties exceeds the Deductible, then Sellers shall be liable for
only those Losses in excess of the Deductible; (ii) in no event shall the
aggregate indemnification to be paid by Sellers under Section 10.2(a)(i)
exceed [***] as finally determined under Article III, except in the case of
fraud; (iii) in no event shall the aggregate indemnification to be paid by
Sellers under Sections 10.2(a)(ii), 10.2(a)(v), 10.2(a)(vi), 10.2(a)(ix) and
10.2(a)(x) exceed [***] as finally determined under Article III, except in the
case of fraud; and (iv) in no event shall the aggregate indemnification to be
paid by Sellers under Section 10.2(a)(iii) and Section 10.2(a)(iv) exceed
[***] as finally determined under Article III, except in the case of fraud.
For the avoidance of doubt, Sellers' indemnification obligations for Losses
under Section 10.2(a)(vii), Section 10.2(a)(viii) or for any fraud shall not
be subject to a cap.

(b) Subject to Section 7.7(d) and Section 12.2, and except to the extent that
any Seller engaged in fraud, the parties acknowledge and agree that the
indemnification provisions contained in this Article X shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy for Losses based upon, attributable to or resulting from the
breach or inaccuracy or failure to comply with any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties in this Agreement under any
theory of law or equity.

10.9 Indemnity Payments. Any payment that any Seller is obligated to make to
any Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article X shall be paid by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account(s) designated by
the applicable Purchaser Indemnified Party within thirty (30) calendar days
after the date notice of any sums due and owing is given to the Sellers'
Representative by the applicable Purchaser Indemnified Party in accordance
with Section 10.3. Any payment that Purchaser is obligated to make to any
Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Article X shall be paid by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account(s) designated by the
applicable Seller Indemnified Party within thirty (30) calendar days after the
date notice of any sums due and owing is given to Purchaser by the applicable
Seller Indemnified Party in accordance with Section 10.3.





10.10 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. For all income Tax purposes,
Sellers and Purchaser agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to
this Article X as an adjustment to the aggregate consideration paid in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

10.11 Representation of Sellers.

(a) Each Seller hereby irrevocably appoints Dennis Anderson as the Sellers'
Representative, attorney-in-fact and agent, with full power of substitution to
act in the name, place and stead of such Seller in accordance with the terms
and provisions of this Agreement and to act on behalf of such Seller in any
amendment of, or Legal Proceeding or indemnification claim involving, this
Agreement and to do or refrain from doing all such further acts and things,
and to execute and/or deliver all such documents, as such Sellers'
Representative shall deem necessary or appropriate in conjunction with any of
the Acquisition Transactions, including the power: (i) to take all action
necessary in connection with the waiver of any condition to the obligations of
the Sellers to consummate the Acquisition Transactions; (ii) to negotiate,
execute and deliver all documents required or permitted to be given in

Agreement if the Sellers are entitled to do so; (iv) to give and receive all
notices and communications to be given or received under this Agreement and to

powers of the Sellers' Representative, and (vii) to take all actions which
under this Agreement may be taken by any Seller and to do or refrain from

Representative deems necessary or appropriate in his sole discretion relating
to the subject matter of this Agreement as fully and completely as such Seller
could do if personally present.

(b) The appointment and grant of power and authority is coupled with an
interest and is in consideration of the mutual covenants made herein and is
irrevocable and shall not be terminated by any act of Sellers or by operation
of law. By execution of this Agreement, Sellers hereby consent to the taking
of any and all actions and the making of any decisions required or permitted
to be taken or made by the Sellers' Representative pursuant to this Section
10.11(b). By execution of this Agreement, Sellers agree that the Sellers'
Representative shall have no obligation or liability to any Person for any
action or omission taken or omitted by the Sellers' Representative in good
faith hereunder, and Sellers shall indemnify and hold the Sellers'
Representative harmless from and against any and all Losses (including
reasonable attorney's fees and expenses) which the Seller's Representative may
sustain as a result of any such action or omission by the Sellers'
Representative hereunder.

(c) If Dennis Anderson is unable or unwilling to serve as Sellers'
Representative, Tom Farner will serve as the Sellers' Representative. If Tom
Farner is unable or unwilling to serve as the Sellers' Representative, the
Sellers' Representative will be chosen by the board of directors of Farner-
Bocken. The candidate who receives more votes than any other, and who consents
to serve, shall be appointed the Sellers' Representative. The Sellers'
Representative shall have the right at any time to appoint an entity wholly
owned by the Sellers' Representative as his or her successor hereunder and
such entity shall agree in writing to accept such appointment. The choice of a
successor Sellers' Representative appointed in any manner permitted in this
Section 10.11 shall be final and binding upon the Sellers. The decisions and
actions of any successor Sellers' Representative shall be, for all purposes,
those of the Sellers' Representative as if originally named herein.

Taxes and Purchaser shall prepare and timely file all Tax Returns due after
the Closing Date with respect to such Taxes. If one party remits to the
appropriate Taxing Authority payment for Taxes which are subject to proration
under this Section 11.1 and such payment includes the other party's share of
such Taxes, such other party shall promptly reimburse the remitting party for
its share of such Taxes.

11.2 Cooperation on Tax Matters. Purchaser and Sellers shall furnish or cause
to be furnished to each other, as promptly as practicable, such information
and assistance relating to the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities as
is reasonably necessary for the preparation and filing of any Tax Return,
claim for refund or other filings relating to Tax matters, for the preparation
for any Tax audit, for the preparation for any Tax protest or for the
prosecution or defense of any Legal Proceeding relating to Tax matters.

11.3 Tax Clearance Certificates. Each Seller, as applicable, shall cooperate
to notify all of the Taxing Authorities for the jurisdictions set forth in
Section 5.9(c) of the Disclosure Schedule of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in the form and manner required by such Taxing Authorities, if
the failure to make such notifications or receive any available tax clearance
certificate ("Tax Clearance Certificate") could subject Purchaser to any Taxes
of any Seller. If, in respect to any application for Tax Clearance
Certificates made pursuant to this Section 11.3, any Governmental Body asserts
that any such Seller is liable for any Tax, such Seller shall promptly pay any
and all such amounts and shall provide evidence to Purchaser that such
liabilities have been paid in full or otherwise satisfied, unless contested by
such Seller in good faith by appropriate proceedings. Each Seller agrees to
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from each applicable Taxing
Authority Tax Clearance Certificates, and to deliver any such Tax Clearance
Certificate in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser.
Purchaser shall provide reasonable assistance as may reasonably be requested
by Sellers for purposes of notifying Taxing Authorities and obtaining Taxing
Authority Tax Clearance Certificates.



11.4 Transfer Taxes. Sellers shall be liable for and shall pay (and each
Seller shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser
against) all sales, use, stamp, documentary, filing, recording, transfer or
similar fees or Taxes or governmental charges as levied by any Governmental
Body (including any interest and penalties) ("Transfer Taxes") in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

ARTICLE XII 

MISCELLANEOUS

12.1 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of the
Sellers and Purchaser shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection with
the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and each other agreement,
document and instrument contemplated by this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Liabilities for expenses
incurred by any Seller will not be assumed by Purchaser.

12.2 Specific Performance. Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that its breach
of this Agreement would cause irreparable damage to Purchaser, and that
Purchaser may not have an adequate remedy at law. Therefore, the obligations
of each Seller under this Agreement may be enforceable by a decree of specific
performance issued by any court of competent jurisdiction, and appropriate
injunctive relief may be applied for and granted in connection therewith. Such
remedies shall, however, be cumulative and not exclusive and shall be in
addition to any other remedies which Purchaser may have under this Agreement
or otherwise.

12.3 Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.

(a) The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
of any federal or state court located within the State of Iowa over any
dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and each party hereby irrevocably agrees
that all claims in respect of such dispute or any suit, action or proceeding
related thereto shall be heard and determined in such courts. The parties
hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any such dispute brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum
for the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a
judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on
the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby consents to process being served by any
party to this Agreement in any suit, action or proceeding by the delivery of a
copy thereof in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.6.

12.4 Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement (including the
schedules and exhibits hereto), together with the other documents and
agreements to be delivered in connection herewith and therewith, represent the
entire understanding and agreement between the parties hereto with respect to
the subject matter hereof. This Agreement can be amended, supplemented or
changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only by written instrument
making specific reference to this Agreement signed by the party against whom
enforcement of any such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is
sought. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any
investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a
waiver of compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein by the party taking such action. The waiver by any party
hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be
construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of
any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any party to
exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.



12.5 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Iowa applicable to contracts made and
performed in such State.

12.6 Notices. All notices and other communications under this Agreement shall

12.8 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy,

beneficiary rights in any Person not a party to this Agreement. No assignment
of this Agreement or of any rights or obligations hereunder may be made by any
Seller (by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of
Purchaser and any attempted assignment without the required consent shall be
void, except for an assignment resulting from the conversion of Farner-Bocken
