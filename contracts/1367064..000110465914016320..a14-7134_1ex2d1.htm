 ** _PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT_**

 



 

 **THIS PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT** (as the same may be amended, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, this " ** _Agreement_**
") is entered into the 27th day of February, 2014 (the " ** _Execution Date_**
"), between **MidCon Compression, L.L.C.** , an Oklahoma limited liability
company (" ** _Seller_** "), and **EXLP Operating LLC**, a Delaware limited
liability company (" ** _Buyer_** "). Buyer and Seller may be referred to
collectively as the " ** _Parties_** " or individually as a " ** _Party_**."

 



 

 **Recitals**

 



 

Seller and LandCo hold the MidCon Assets (as hereinafter defined), which
assets are used (or are, or will be, available to be used) by Seller for the
provision of services to Access (as hereinafter defined) for the compression
of natural gas and related services under the ACMP Agreements (as hereinafter
defined) (such activities under the ACMP Agreements and with respect to such
assets, the " ** _Compression Business_** ").

 



 

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Seller desires
to sell and transfer to Buyer, and Buyer desires to acquire from Seller, the
MidCon Assets (the " ** _Sale_** "). Buyer desires to enter into the
Replacement Contract (as hereinafter defined) relating to the MidCon Assets as
contemplated pursuant to _Section 7.11_, in accordance with this Agreement.

 



 

The Sale will be consummated on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE,** for and in consideration of the mutual agreements herein
contained, the benefits to be derived by each Party, and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I** 
DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION

 



 

 ** _1.1_** ** _ _**_Defined Terms_. Capitalized terms used herein and not
otherwise defined will have the meanings given such terms in _Appendix I_.

 



 

 ** _1.2_** ** _ _**_References and Rules of Construction_. All references in
this Agreement to Exhibits, Appendixes, Schedules, Articles, Sections,
subsections and other subdivisions refer to the corresponding Exhibits,
Appendixes, Schedules, Articles, Sections, subsections and other subdivisions
of or to this Agreement unless expressly provided otherwise. Titles appearing
at the beginning of any Articles, Sections, subsections and other subdivisions
of this Agreement are for convenience only, do not constitute any part of this
Agreement, and will be disregarded in construing the language hereof. The
words "this Agreement," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and "hereof," and
words of similar import, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular Article, Section, subsection or other subdivision unless expressly
so limited. The word "including" (in its various forms) means including
without limitation. All references to "$" or "dollars" will be deemed
references to United States dollars. Each accounting term not defined herein,
and each accounting term partly defined herein to the extent not defined, will
have the

 



      
 

 



 

meaning given to it under GAAP. Pronouns in masculine, feminine or neuter
genders will be construed to state and include any other gender, and words,
terms and titles (including terms defined herein) in the singular form will be
construed to include the plural and vice versa, unless the context otherwise
requires. References to any Law or agreement means such Law or agreement as it
may be amended from time to time. The word "will" shall be construed to have
the same meaning and effect as the word "shall" and vice versa. The dollar
thresholds set forth herein shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the
terms "material" or "Material Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in this
Agreement.

 **ARTICLE III** 
CONSIDERATION

 



 

 ** _3.1_** ** _ _**_Consideration_. The consideration for the transfer by
Seller and LandCo of the MidCon Assets to Buyer, the transactions contemplated
hereby and the assumption of the Assumed Obligations by Buyer will be an
amount equal to $360,460,000 (the " ** _Purchase Price_** ") to be paid in
cash by Buyer (as adjusted pursuant to _Section 3.2_) by wire transfer in
immediately available funds at Closing as provided for in this Agreement.

 



 

 ** _3.2_** ** _ _**_Adjustments to Purchase Price_. The Purchase Price will
be adjusted as follows (and the resulting amount will be herein called the "
** _Adjusted Purchase Price_** "):

 



 

(a) The Purchase Price will be adjusted upward by the following amounts
(without duplication):

 



 

(i) if the Compression Unit Amount is positive, an amount equal to the
Compression Unit Amount;

 



 

(ii) the amount of all Taxes prorated to Buyer in accordance with _Section
13.2_ but paid or payable by Seller; and

 



 

(iii) an amount equal to all Operating Expenses paid by Seller (if any) that
are incurred with respect to the period of time on and after the Effective
Time, whether paid before, on or after the Effective Time, without duplication
of amounts paid by Buyer or its Affiliates to Seller or its Affiliates under
_Section 2.3_ for such Operating Expenses.

 



 

(b) The Purchase Price will be adjusted downward by the following amounts
(without duplication):

 



 

(i) all amounts determined pursuant to _Section 7.2(c)(ii) _and/or _Section
7.2(d) _to be applied as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for any casualty
or condemnation loss;

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) an amount equal to the Excluded Real Property Amount (if any);

 



 

(iii) if the Compression Unit Amount is negative, an amount equal to the
absolute value of the Compression Unit Amount;

 



 

(iv) the Inventory Amount (if any);

 



 

(v) the amount of all Taxes prorated to Seller in accordance with _Section
13.2_ but paid or payable by Buyer; and

 



 

(vi) the amount that is equal to the sum of all revenues attributable to the
ACMP Agreements and/or the MidCon Assets received by Seller (if any) and
earned with respect to the period of time on or after the Effective Time,
without duplication of amounts paid by Seller or its Affiliates to Buyer or
its Affiliates under _Section 2.3_ for such revenues.

 



 

(c) In addition to the adjustments set forth in _Section 3.2(a) _and _Section
3.2(b)_, the Purchase Price will be deemed adjusted following Closing pursuant
to _Section 2.3(b) _and _Section 11.12_; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such deemed adjustment shall result in any duplication of recovery by either
Party.

 



 

 ** _3.3_** ** _ _**_Deposit_. On the first Business Day following the
Execution Date, Buyer shall pay to the Escrow Agent, by wire transfer or
delivery of other immediately available funds an amount equal to $17,000,000
(such amount, together with any interest accruing thereon, the " **
_Deposit_** "). The Escrow Agent will hold the Deposit in the Escrow Account
in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. In the event the
Closing occurs, Seller shall be entitled to the Deposit in full and, at the
Closing, the Deposit shall be credited against the Purchase Price and released
to the Seller.

 



 

 ** _3.4_** ** _ _**_Inventory and Preliminary Settlement Statement_.

 



 

(a) Following the Execution Date, Buyer will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to complete an audit of the Inventory set forth on _Exhibit A-3_ to
be received by Buyer at Closing (the " ** _Inventory Audit_** "). At least
five Business Days prior to Closing, Buyer will deliver a notice to Seller
setting forth (i) a list of the Inventory (if any) set forth on _Exhibit A-3_
that was not accounted for in the Inventory Audit (the " ** _Missing
Inventory_** ") and (ii) the amount by which the value of the Missing
Inventory (based on the Scheduled Value) exceeds $250,000 (such amount, the "
** _Inventory Amount_** "). Until one Business Day prior to Closing Seller
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to replace any of the Missing
Inventory and to provide written notice to Buyer of the value of such
replacement Inventory (based on the Scheduled Value) and the related
adjustment to the Inventory Amount.

 



 

(b) Not earlier than 10 Business Days prior to Closing and not later than five
Business Days prior to the Closing (such date of delivery, the " **
_Preliminary Settlement Statement Date_** "), Seller will prepare in good
faith and submit to Buyer for review (i) a draft settlement statement (the "
** _Preliminary Settlement Statement_** ") that will set forth an estimate of
the Adjusted Purchase Price, reflecting (A) each proposed adjustment to be
made in accordance with this Agreement as of the Closing Date, including the
Closing Date Working HP and the Closing Date

 



      
 

 



 

Idle HP, (B) the calculation of the adjustments used to determine such amount,
and (C) the designation of Sellers accounts for the wire transfers of funds
as set forth in _Section 10.3(b)(vi) _and (ii) a revised version of _Exhibit
A-1_, updated to include any Additional Compression Units. Within four
Business Days of receipt of the Preliminary Settlement Statement, Buyer will
deliver to Seller a written report containing all changes that Buyer proposes
in good faith to be made to the Preliminary Settlement Statement, if any,
together with a reasonable explanation of such changes. The adjustments set
forth in the Preliminary Settlement Statement, as agreed upon by the Parties,
will be used to adjust the Purchase Price at Closing; _provided, that_, if the
Parties cannot agree on any individual adjustment set forth in the Preliminary
Settlement Statement (other than with respect to the Compression Unit Amount)
prior to the Closing, then such adjustment (other than with respect to the
Compression Unit Amount) as presented by Seller in good faith in the
Preliminary Settlement Statement will be used to adjust the Purchase Price at
Closing and with respect to the Compression Unit Amount, the adjusted
Compression Unit Amount, if any, delivered by written notice to Seller by
Buyer pursuant to _Section 7.14(c) _will be used to adjust the Purchase Price
at Closing.

 



 

 ** _3.5_** ** _ _**_Final Settlement Statement_. On or before the date that
is 120 days following the Closing Date, a final settlement statement (the " **
_Final Settlement Statement_** "), will be prepared by Seller in good faith
based on actual values at the Closing and that takes into account all final
adjustments made to the Purchase Price as determined by Seller in good faith
and shows the resulting final Adjusted Purchase Price. The Final Settlement
Statement will set forth the actual values and the amounts for the adjustments
required by this Agreement. Seller will supply reasonable documentation in the
possession or control of Seller or any of its Affiliates to support the items
for which adjustments are proposed or made in the Final Settlement Statement
and a reasonable explanation of any such adjustments. As soon as practicable,
and in any event within 45 days after receipt of the Final Settlement
Statement, Buyer will deliver to Seller a written report containing any
proposed changes to the Final Settlement Statement and a reasonable
explanation of any such changes (the " ** _Dispute Notice_** "). Any changes
related to the Final Settlement Statement not included in the Dispute Notice
will be deemed waived and Sellers determinations with respect to those
adjustments set forth in the Final Settlement Statement that are not addressed
in the Dispute Notice will prevail. If Buyer fails to timely deliver a Dispute
Notice to Seller containing changes Buyer proposes to be made to the Final
Settlement Statement, the Final Settlement Statement as delivered by Seller
will be deemed to be mutually agreed upon by the Parties and will be final and
binding upon the Parties. If the final Adjusted Purchase Price set forth in
the Final Settlement Statement is mutually agreed upon (or deemed to be agreed
upon) by Seller and Buyer, the Final Settlement Statement and the final
Adjusted Purchase Price, will be final and binding on the Parties. Once the
final Adjusted Purchase Price has been agreed upon (or deemed to be agreed
upon) by the Parties pursuant to this _Section 3.5_ or determined by the
Accounting Arbitrator pursuant to _Section 3.6_, as applicable, then, within
five Business Days of such agreement (or deemed agreement) or such
determination (as applicable), if the final Adjusted Purchase Price is (a)
more than the Adjusted Purchase Price used at Closing pursuant to _Section
3.4_, Buyer will pay to an account designated by Seller the amount of such
difference, and (b) less than the Adjusted Purchase Price used at Closing
pursuant to _Section 3.4_, Seller will pay to an account designated by Buyer
the amount of such difference, in each case, by wire transfer in immediately
available funds no later than five

 



      
 

 



 

Business Days after the date such final Adjusted Purchase Price is agreed upon
(or deemed to be agreed upon) pursuant to this _Section 3.5 _or determined
pursuant to _Section 3.6_, as applicable.

 



 

 ** _3.6_** ** _ _**_Disputes_. If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve the
matters addressed in the Dispute Notice (if any), including the Inventory
received by Buyer at Closing or the value thereof as of the Closing Date, each
of Buyer and Seller will within 30 Business Days after the delivery of such
Dispute Notice, summarize its position with regard to such disputed
adjustment(s) that have not been resolved by Seller and Buyer prior to the end
of such 30 Business Day period in a written document (an " ** _Arbitration
Notice_** ") and submit such summaries to the Houston, Texas office of Ernst and
Young LLP (or if Ernst and Young LLP is unable or unwilling to serve as
arbitrator within 20 days after receipt of a written request from the Parties
to serve and absent agreement by the Parties as to a replacement for such
arbitrator within 10 Business Days after notification that Ernst and Young LLP
is unable or unwilling to serve, the arbitrator will be a nationally
recognized accounting firm not materially affiliated with Seller or Buyer
selected by the Houston, Texas office of the AAA) (the " ** _Accounting
Arbitrator_** "), together with the Dispute Notice, the Final Settlement
Statement, this Agreement and any other documentation such Party may desire to
submit. The Parties will instruct the Accounting Arbitrator that, within 20
Business Days after receiving the Parties respective submissions, the
Accounting Arbitrator will render a decision choosing either Sellers position
in the Final Settlement Statement presented by Seller or Buyers position in
the Dispute Notice (in each case) with respect to each adjustment addressed in
an Arbitration Notice, whichever is most accurate based on the terms of the
Agreement and the materials described above. Notwithstanding the foregoing
sentence, the Accounting Arbitrator will calculate only the matters addressed
in an Arbitration Notice that are not otherwise resolved and agreed upon in
writing by Seller and Buyer after delivery of such Arbitration Notice. Absent
fraud, each choice between Sellers position and Buyers position with respect
to any adjustment that is rendered by the Accounting Arbitrator in accordance
with this _Section 3.6_ will be final, conclusive and binding on Seller and
Buyer and will be enforceable against each of the Parties in any court of
competent jurisdiction. The costs of such Accounting Arbitrator will be borne
one-half by Buyer and one-half by Seller. The final Adjusted Purchase Price
set forth in the Final Settlement Statement incorporating the adjustment
amounts determined by the Accounting Arbitrator in accordance with this
_Section 3.6_, in addition to the adjustment amounts agreed to in writing by
the Parties, will be final and binding on the Parties (other than with respect
to amounts not accounted for therein or settled thereby). The Accounting
Arbitrator will be authorized to resolve only the specific disputed aspects of
the Final Settlement Statement submitted by the Parties as provided above and
may not award damages, interest (other than with respect to _Section 3.3_) or
penalties to any Party with respect to any matter, notwithstanding any AAA
Rules to the contrary.

 



 

 ** _3.7_** ** _ _**_Allocation_.

 



 

(a) The Purchase Price (plus Assumed Obligations, to the extent properly taken
into account under the Code), will be allocated among the MidCon Assets in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder (and, if applicable, any similar provision of state,
local or foreign Law) (the " ** _Allocation_** "). Buyer will deliver a draft
Allocation to Seller within 150 days after the Closing Date. Seller will
deliver to Buyer any

 



      
 

 



 

proposed changes to the draft Allocation within 30 days after Buyer has
delivered such draft Allocation to Seller. Buyer and Seller shall use their
reasonable efforts to agree on a final Allocation no later than 30 days after
Buyers receipt of Sellers proposed changes. In the event Seller and Buyer
cannot reach an agreement within 30 days after Buyer receives Sellers
proposed changes, then the matters in dispute shall be resolved by the
Accounting Arbitrator. Seller and Buyer will instruct the Accounting
Arbitrator to deliver to Seller and Buyer a written resolution of the matters
in dispute within 20 days. Absent fraud, the determinations of the Accounting
Arbitrator as to the matters in dispute under this _Section 3.7_ will be
final, conclusive and binding on Seller and Buyer. Seller and Buyer agree to
subsequently prepare a final Allocation on the basis of such determinations.
Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, each shall bear and pay
one-half of the costs and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator under this
_Section 3.7(a)_.

 



 

(b) If the Purchase Price is adjusted (or deemed adjusted) pursuant to
_Section 3.2_, the Allocation will be adjusted in a manner consistent with
the procedures set forth in _Section 3.7(a) _above.

 



 

(c) Buyer and Seller will file (and Seller will cause LandCo to file) all Tax
Returns (including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) consistent with the
final Allocation. Buyer and Seller agree (and Seller will cause LandCo) to (i)
be bound by the final Allocation, (ii) act in accordance with the final
Allocation for all Tax purposes (including filing Internal Revenue Service
Form 8594 with their United States federal income Tax Return for the taxable
year that includes the Closing Date and in the course of any audit, review or
litigation), and (iii) take no position and cause their Affiliates to take no
position inconsistent with the final Allocation for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law or unless the other Party consents
thereto, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Not later than 30 days prior to the filing of their respective
Internal Revenue Service Forms 8594 relating to this transaction, each of
Buyer and Seller will deliver to the other party (and Seller will cause LandCo
to deliver to Buyer) a copy of its Internal Revenue Service Form 8594.

 



 

 ** _3.8_** ** _ _**_Withholding_. Except with respect to any Tax imposed
with respect to "bulk transfer laws" as described in _Section 7.18_, Buyer
will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Purchase Price otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to Seller such amounts as Buyer is required
to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any Tax Law, with respect to the
making of such payment; _provided_ , _however_ , that before making any such
deduction or withholding, Buyer shall give Seller written notice of Buyers
intention to make such deduction or withholding, any such notice shall include
an explanation and calculation of the proposed deduction or withholding, and
any such notice shall be given at least a commercially reasonable period of
time before such deduction or withholding is required, in order to permit
Seller to obtain any reduction of or relief from such deduction or withholding
available under applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and
withheld, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV** 
ACCESS; DISCLAIMERS

 



 

 ** _4.1_** ** _ _**_Access_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Execution Date and up to and including the Closing Date
(or earlier termination of this Agreement) but subject to the other provisions
of this _Section 4.1_ and obtaining any required consents of Third Parties,
including, if applicable, Access (with respect to which consents Seller will
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain), Seller will afford (and
cause LandCo to afford) to Buyer and its Affiliates and their respective
officers, employees, agents, accountants, attorneys, investment bankers,
consultants and other authorized representatives (the " ** _Buyer
Representatives_** "), upon prior reasonable notice, reasonable access during
normal business hours to the MidCon Assets and the ACMP Agreements. Seller
will also make available to Buyer and the Buyer Representatives, upon
reasonable notice, during normal business hours, Sellers personnel
knowledgeable with respect to the MidCon Assets and/or the Compression
Business, including the ACMP Agreements, in order that Buyer may make such
diligence investigation as Buyer considers necessary or appropriate. All
investigations and due diligence conducted by Buyer or any Buyer
Representative will be conducted at Buyers sole cost and expense. Buyer will
coordinate its access rights and physical inspections of the MidCon Assets
with Al Lavenue, as representative of Seller, so as not to unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the business by Seller or Access, and Seller
will have the right to accompany Buyer and any Buyer Representative in
connection with any physical inspection of the MidCon Assets. Buyer will, and
will cause all Buyer Representatives to, abide by Sellers (and, if
applicable, the Third Partys) safety rules, regulations, and operating
policies that Seller (or, if applicable, the Third Party) provides to Buyer or
are posted at the visited sites, while conducting Buyers due diligence
evaluation of the MidCon Assets, including any environmental or other
inspection or assessment of the MidCon Assets. For the avoidance of doubt, for
purposes of this _Section 4.1_, the MidCon Assets include the Real Property.

 



 

(b) Subject to the provisions of this _Section 4.1_, Buyer will be entitled
to conduct Phase I Environmental Site Assessments (as defined in applicable
ASTM International standards) of the Real Property. Seller will use its
reasonable efforts (without any obligation to incur Liability or to pay money)
to cooperate with Buyer to obtain any Third Party (including Access, if
applicable) authorizations or permissions necessary to conduct any Phase I
Environmental Site Assessments with respect to the Real Property.

 



 

(c) Except with respect to existing Environmental Liabilities, subject to
_Section 11.6_ and _Section 11.10_, Buyer hereby releases, indemnifies,
defends and holds harmless each Seller Indemnified Party and Access from and
against any and all Liabilities (including any injury, loss or damage arising
out of such entry that may occur to Buyer or any Buyer Representative),
arising out of, resulting from or relating to any office visit, field visit,
environmental property assessment or other property inspection conducted by
Buyer or any Buyer Representative with respect to the MidCon Assets, EVEN IF
SUCH LIABILITIES ARISE OUT OF OR RESULT FROM, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, THE SOLE,
ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR
OTHER FAULT OF A MEMBER OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, EXCEPTING ONLY
LIABILITIES ACTUALLY RESULTING ON THE ACCOUNT OF THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR

 



      
 

 



 

WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF A MEMBER OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES OR ACCESS.

 



 

(d) Upon completion or termination of Buyers due diligence inspection of the
MidCon Assets, Buyer will at its sole cost and expense, and without any cost
or expense to Seller or LandCo, (i) repair all damage done to the MidCon
Assets (including any real property and other assets associated therewith)
caused by Buyers due diligence inspection, (ii) restore any affected MidCon
Asset to the approximate same or better condition than it was prior to
commencement of Buyers due diligence inspection and (iii) remove all
equipment, tools or other property brought onto the MidCon Assets in
connection with Buyers due diligence inspection.

 



 

(e) Buyer agrees to promptly provide Seller, on or before the date that is
five Business Days after receipt or creation thereof, copies of all final
reports prepared by Buyer and/or any Buyer Representative generated in
association with any Phase I Environmental Site Assessment conducted in
accordance with _Section 4.1(b)_. All information obtained by Seller and its
representatives under this _Section 4.1(e) _shall be subject to the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement. Buyer makes no representation or warranty,
express, implied or statutory, as to the accuracy of any documents delivered
pursuant to this _Section 4.1(e) _or the information contained therein.
Seller shall not be deemed by its receipt of said documents or otherwise to
have made any representation or warranty, express, implied or statutory, as to
the condition of the MidCon Assets or to the accuracy of said documents or the
information contained therein.

 



 

 ** _4.2_** ** _ _**_Confidentiality_. The Parties acknowledge that, in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of them
will become privy to Evaluation Material regarding the other Party and,
subject to the rights of the Parties pursuant to _Section 7.10_, that such
Evaluation Material will be held confidential by the "receiving" Party and the
Buyer Representatives or Seller Representatives, as applicable, in accordance
with the confidentiality terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. If the
Closing occurs, Buyers and its Affiliates confidentiality obligations under
the Confidentiality Agreement and the foregoing confidentiality restriction on
Buyer will terminate with respect to Evaluation Material relating to the
MidCon Assets and the Compression Business (it being understood that any and
all other Evaluation Material provided to Buyer or any Buyer Representatives
by or on behalf of Seller that is unrelated to any MidCon Asset, the
Compression Business or the Replacement Contract shall be kept confidential by
Buyer and all Buyer Representatives following the Closing in accordance with
the confidentiality terms of the Confidentiality Agreement). From and after
the Closing, Seller agrees to be bound (and cause its Affiliates to be bound)
by the confidentiality terms of the Confidentiality Agreement with respect to
the MidCon Assets and the Replacement Contract (which assets and Contracts,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Confidentiality Agreement,
shall be considered Evaluation Material that was disclosed by Buyer or its
Affiliates to Seller pursuant to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement).
Each Party agrees that the other Party shall have the right to enforce the
confidentiality terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, this _Section 4.2_,
and _Section 12.3_ as if Buyer had been a party to the Confidentiality
Agreement from and after the Effective Date (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement). Each of Sellers and Buyers (and their respective Affiliates)
obligations pursuant to this _Section 4.2_ that survive the Closing shall
survive (notwithstanding anything to the contrary in such

 



       
 

 



 

Confidentiality Agreement) for a period of two years after the Closing Date.
The Parties acknowledge that, to the extent necessary to conform to the
obligations of the Parties under this _Section 4.2_, the Confidentiality
Agreement is hereby amended and that, in the event of any conflict between the
Confidentiality Agreement and this Agreement, this Agreement shall control.

recurring compensation payable by Seller or any of its Affiliates prior to the

event, occurrence, condition or fact resulting from Sellers failure to take
any action described in _Section 7.1(b)(viii)(B) _or _Section
7.1(b)(viii)(D) _due to Buyers unreasonable refusal to provide a timely,
unconditioned consent to such action shall be disregarded for all purposes of
this Agreement (including representations, warranties, indemnification,
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, termination and

 ** _7.2_** ** _ _**_Casualty or Condemnation Loss_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall assume all
risk of loss with respect to the depreciation of tangible MidCon Assets due to
ordinary wear and tear,

 



      
 

 



 

and Buyer shall not assert such matters as (and such matters shall be deemed
not to be) casualty losses hereunder.

 



 

(b) If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing Date, any portion of
the MidCon Assets (other than Inventory) is damaged or destroyed by fire or
other casualty, and the loss as a result of such individual casualty equals or
is less than $50,000 based on the fair market value of the affected MidCon
Assets, then Buyer will nevertheless be required to close and Seller, at
Closing, will pay to Buyer all sums paid to Seller by Third Parties by reason
of such casualty to the extent (and only to the extent) attributable to the
MidCon Assets and shall assign, transfer and set over to Buyer or subrogate
Buyer to all of Sellers right, title and interest (if any) in insurance
claims, unpaid awards, and other rights against Third Parties (excluding any
Liabilities, other than insurance claims, of or against any Seller Indemnified
Parties) arising out of such casualty to the extent (and only to the extent)
attributable to the MidCon Assets; _provided, however_ , that Seller will
reserve and retain (and Buyer will assign to Seller) all rights, title and
interests and claims against Third Parties for the recovery of Sellers costs
and expenses incurred prior to the Closing in pursuing or asserting any such
insurance claims or other rights against Third Parties.

 



 

(c) If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing Date, any portion of
the MidCon Assets (other than Inventory) is damaged or destroyed by fire or
other casualty, and the loss as a result of such individual casualty exceeds
$50,000 based on the fair market value of the affected MidCon Assets, then (i)
Seller may, prior to Closing, cause the MidCon Assets affected by such
casualty to be repaired, replaced or restored to Buyers reasonable
satisfaction to at least the same condition as such MidCon Assets were in
prior to such casualty, at Sellers sole cost, as promptly as reasonably
practicable (which work may extend after the Closing Date if agreed to by
Seller and Buyer) and (ii) to the extent Seller does not repair, replace or
restore the affected MidCon Assets prior to Closing pursuant to _Section
7.2(c)(i)_, the Purchase Price will be reduced by the estimated value (as
reasonably agreed by Seller and Buyer) of the costs and expenses to repair,
replace or restore any MidCon Assets affected by such casualty to the same
condition as such MidCon Assets were in prior to such casualty. In each case
pursuant to this _Section 7.2(c)_, Seller will retain all rights to
insurance, condemnation awards and other claims against Third Parties with
respect to the casualty except to the extent the Parties otherwise agree in
writing (the " ** _Retained Claims_** "). The Parties agree that the value of
the costs and expense to repair, replace and restore a Casualty Compression
Unit is an amount equal to (a) $825 multiplied by (b) the aggregate horsepower
of such Casualty Compression Unit.

 



 

(d) In the event the Parties are unable to agree upon (i) the amount of the
loss attributable to any individual casualty or (ii) the amount of the costs
and expenses to repair, replace or restore any MidCon Assets affected by a
casualty, then any such amount shall be determined by the arbitration
provisions of _Section 3.6_.

 



 

(e) If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing Date, any portion of
the MidCon Assets is taken in condemnation or under right of eminent domain,
then the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the estimated value (as reasonably
agreed by Seller and Buyer, taking into account the awards paid or payable to
Seller or LandCo in any condemnation or eminent domain action and the value
placed on the affected MidCon Assets by Buyer) of the MidCon Assets so taken.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) If any action for condemnation or taking under right of eminent domain is
pending or threatened with respect to any MidCon Asset or portion thereof
after the Execution Date, but no taking of such MidCon Asset or portion
thereof occurs prior to the Closing Date, then Buyer shall be required to
close and at Closing, Seller will (or if LandCo is the owner of such MidCon
Asset, will cause LandCo to) assign, transfer and set over to Buyer or
subrogate Buyer to all of Sellers (or, if applicable, LandCos) right, title
and interest (if any) in such condemnation or eminent domain action, including
any future awards therein, to the extent (and only to the extent) attributable
to the MidCon Assets threatened to be taken, except that Seller (or LandCo, if
applicable) will reserve and retain (and Buyer will assign to Seller (or
LandCo, if applicable)) all rights, titles, interests and claims against Third
Parties for the recovery of Sellers (or LandCos, if applicable) costs and
expenses incurred prior to the Closing in defending or asserting rights in
such action with respect to the MidCon Assets.

 



 

 ** _7.3_** ** _ _**_Permits_. Seller and Buyer will cooperate to provide all
notices and take any required action to transfer (or reissue) the Acquired
Permits (including those Acquired Permits held by LandCo) as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents.

its respective Affiliates may solicit or hire any officer or employee of the
other Party or its Affiliates who is based in the United States and who is a
Business Employee or who performs a function similar to a Business Employee
(any such Person, a " ** _Subject Employee_** ") without first obtaining the
prior written consent of the other Party, except pursuant to a general
solicitation which is not directed at any such Subject Employee. After the
Closing Date (or the earlier termination of this Agreement) until the date
that is the two-year anniversary of the Closing Date (or the earlier

may solicit or hire any officer or employee of the other Party or its
Affiliates who is a Subject Employee without first obtaining the prior written
consent of the other Party, except pursuant to a general solicitation which is
not directed at any such Subject Employee. In the event this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 12.1_, for the two-year period following the
date of such termination of this Agreement, neither Party nor its respective
Affiliates may hire any officer or employee of the other Party or its
Affiliates who is a Business Employee without first obtaining the prior
written consent of the other Party. Buyer and Seller agree that both Parties
intend the provisions of this _Section 7.4_ to be a valid and enforceable
agreement. To the extent that any part of this _Section 7.4_ may be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable for any reason, it is intended that such part will be
enforceable to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction will
determine that such part, if more limited in scope, would have been
enforceable, and such part will be deemed to have been so written and the
remaining parts will as written be effective and enforceable in all events and
the Parties agree to request that such court enforce this _Section 7.4_ as if
so written. The Parties agree (and Buyer shall cause Buyer Parent to agree)
that the non-solicitation provisions contained in Section 7 of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall be terminated as of the Execution Date and,
except for any liability of any Party or any of its Affiliates accruing
thereunder prior to such termination, shall be of no further force or effect.

Antitrust Laws, it will consult with the other Party and give the other Party
reasonable prior notice of, and to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority, an opportunity to participate in, such meeting. Any fees required
to be paid in connection with any filings required by a Party or any of its
Affiliates under any Antitrust Laws, including the HSR Act, if applicable,
will be borne one-half by Buyer and one-half by Seller.

 



 

(b) _Antitrust Limitations._ In connection with any such filings,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents, in no event will Buyer, Seller or any of their
respective Affiliates be required to agree to, enter into or offer to enter

Seller, or any of their respective Affiliates, or similar arrangement or
undertaking in connection with this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

 



 

 ** _7.9_** ** _ _**_Employees_.

 



 

(a) No later than 10 Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer an updated _Schedule 5.16_ (i) omitting those Business
Employees, if any, who are no longer employed by Seller or its Affiliates,
(ii) including those employees of Seller or any of its Affiliates who have
replaced (and have similar qualifications and experience as) those Business
Employees referenced in the foregoing clause (i) who are no longer employed by
Seller or its Affiliates, and (iii) subject to Buyers and Sellers consent
(which may be withheld in their sole discretion), including those employees of
Seller or any if its Affiliates who perform a function similar to a Business
Employee. No later than seven Business Days prior to the Closing Date

 



       
 

 



 

Buyer will, or will cause an Affiliate of Buyer to, offer employment to each
Business Employee set forth on _Schedule 5.16_ , as updated pursuant to this
_Section 7.9(a)_, who is expected to be actively employed, and for the
avoidance of doubt not on a leave of absence (including long term disability
leave), as of the Closing Date, effective as of the Closing, subject to and
conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing and the satisfaction of Buyers
and its Affiliates standard employment qualifications, including verification
of eligibility for employment under applicable Law (including any applicable
Department of Transportation regulations), compliance with Buyers drug and
alcohol policy and successful completion of a background check and, if
applicable, pre-employment physical, in each case, in accordance with Buyers
past practices then in effect. The Business Employees who accept Buyers or
its Affiliates offer of employment and commence employment with Buyer or one
of its Affiliates will be referred to herein as " ** _Transferred Employees_**
" as of the Closing. From and after the Execution Date, Seller will cooperate
with and use its commercially reasonable efforts (and will cause its
Affiliates to cooperate with and use its commercially reasonable efforts) to
make the Business Employees reasonably accessible to Buyer and its Affiliates
and to assist Buyer and its Affiliates in their efforts to secure satisfactory
employment arrangements with the Business Employees to whom Buyer or Buyers
Affiliate makes employment offers. Additionally, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Seller acknowledges and agrees that, on or prior
to the Closing Date, neither it nor its Affiliates will make offers or
counteroffers of employment to the Business Employees to whom Buyer or any
Affiliate of Buyer makes employment offers. Seller will (or will cause its
Affiliates to) terminate for all purposes (including under all Employee
Benefit Plans) the employment of each Business Employee who accepts employment
with Buyer or Buyers Affiliate, effective immediately prior to the Closing.

 



 

(b) Each offer of employment by Buyer or its Affiliate to a Business Employee
pursuant to this _Section 7.9_ shall initially provide each Transferred
Employee with (i) total target annual cash compensation which is substantially
comparable, on an aggregate basis, to the base salary (or hourly wages, if
applicable) and target bonus compensation provided by Seller or its Affiliates
immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) other employee benefits (excluding
equity incentive compensation) which are substantially comparable, in the
aggregate, to the employee benefits (excluding equity incentive compensation)
provided to similarly-situated employees of Buyer and its U.S. Affiliates.

 



 

(c) For purposes of eligibility and vesting under each benefit plan of Buyer
or its Affiliates in which such Transferred Employees are eligible to
participate following the Closing that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code and under each vacation or paid-time-off program or
policy of Buyer or its Affiliates in which such Transferred Employees are
eligible to participate following the Closing, in each case, if any,
Transferred Employees will be given credit for all service with Seller and its
Affiliates, and any subsidiaries or predecessor employers for which Seller or
its Affiliates credited service, _provided_ such credit is permitted under the
terms of the applicable plans and does not result in duplication of benefits.

 



 

(d) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that it will be responsible for the payment
of annual bonuses or other cash incentives, if any, for the Transferred
Employees to the extent such amounts are attributable to the period starting
January 1, 2014 and continuing through and including the Closing Date, as if
such Transferred Employees had been employed by Buyer as of

 



      
 

 



 

January 1, 2014 and eligible to earn annual bonus or other cash incentives
under Buyers bonus or other incentive plans (the " ** _Buyer 2014 Bonus
Amount_** "), and Buyer agrees that it shall pay the Buyer 2014 Bonus Amount
to the Transferred Employees, subject to such Transferred Employees continued
employment with Buyer or an Affiliate thereof through the applicable payment
date. Except with respect to annual bonuses, if any, earned or accrued by the
Transferred Employees under one or more Employee Benefit Plans to the extent
such amounts are attributable to the period starting January 1, 2014 and
continuing through and including the Closing Date, without limiting any other
provision hereof, Seller acknowledges and agrees that it and its Affiliates
will remain solely liable for and, upon or within 30 days following the
Closing Date, will pay (or will cause its Affiliates to pay) the Transferred
Employees all wages, termination or severance pay, allowances, reimbursements,
cash bonuses, sales commissions and other annual incentive compensation
payments, if any, earned or accrued by such Transferred Employees at any time
prior to or on the Closing Date, whether under any Employee Benefit Plan or
otherwise. In addition, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Seller shall pay each Transferred Employee such Transferred Employees Accrued
PTO as of Closing. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller
acknowledges and agrees that it and its Affiliates will remain liable to the
Transferred Employees for all earned, unpaid annual bonuses or other cash
incentives to the extent such amounts are attributable to the period starting
January 1, 2013 and continuing through and including December 31, 2013 (the "
** _Seller 2013 Bonus Amount_** "), and Seller agrees that it shall pay (or
will cause its Affiliates to pay to), upon or within 30 days following the
Closing Date, as an annual incentive in respect of 2013 services, an amount
equal to the full Seller 2013 Bonus Amount to those Transferred Employees who
remain employed through the applicable payment date. Seller shall indemnify
and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates against any and all liabilities
arising in connection with any failure of Seller or its Affiliates to comply
with the requirements of this _Section 7.9(d)_.

 



 

(e) Upon the Closing, the vesting of all outstanding and unvested equity
awards held by any Transferred Employee that were granted under any equity
plans of Seller or its Affiliates before March 1, 2014 shall accelerate and
vest in full. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall take all action necessary to
cause the Transferred Employees accounts under each Employee Benefit Plan
that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code to vest in
full (to the extent then unvested and to the extent permitted pursuant to
anti-discrimination rules applicable to such plans) no later than the Closing
Date.

 



 

(f) Effective immediately after the Closing Date, Buyer or an Affiliate of
Buyer shall assume and shall be solely responsible for complying with COBRA
and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as
amended, with respect to each Transferred Employee.

 



 

(g) Without limiting any other provision hereof, Seller will be solely
responsible for complying with the WARN Act and any and all obligations under
other applicable Laws requiring notice of plant closings, relocations, mass
layoffs, reductions in force or similar actions (and for any failures to so
comply), in any case, applicable to Business Employees as a result of any
action by Seller or its Affiliates on or prior to the Closing Date, or
following the Closing with respect to any employee who does not become a
Transferred Employee for any reason. On the Closing Date, Seller will notify
Buyer of any terminations or layoffs of any Business

 



      
 

 



 

Employees during the 90-day period prior to the Closing. After the Closing
Date, Buyer shall be solely responsible for complying with the WARN Act and
any and all obligations under other applicable Laws requiring notice of plant
closings, relocations, mass layoffs, reductions in force or similar actions
(and for any failures to so comply), in any case, applicable to Transferred
Employees.

 



 

(h) Subject to limitations imposed by applicable Law, with respect to the
employee welfare benefit plans maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates following
the Closing in which the Transferred Employees are eligible to participate,
Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) waive, or cause to be waived, any limitations on benefits
relating to waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions or actively at
work requirements, except to the extent that such waiting period, exclusions
or requirements applied to the Transferred Employee under the corresponding
Employee Benefit Plan and (ii) recognize any deductibles and other eligible
expenses that were incurred by such Transferred Employees in the plan year in
which the Closing occurs with respect to satisfying any deductibles or out-of-
pocket maximums applicable to such Transferred Employee during the applicable
plan year of the comparable Buyer benefit plan, to the extent such recognition
would have been given under comparable Employee Benefit Plans prior to the
Closing.

 



 

(i) At any time following the Execution Date, subject to applicable Law,
Seller and Buyer (and their Affiliates) may hold pre-arranged communication
sessions with Business Employees relating to employment-related matters in
connection with this Agreement (the " ** _Employment Matters_** ") as such
sessions may be organized by Seller or Buyer (any of their Affiliates) and
mutually agreed to by both Parties (the " ** _Employee Sessions_** "). Without
limiting the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) they shall
consult with each other prior to either or both Parties (or their respective
Affiliates) carrying out or informing any Business Employees of any Employee
Sessions or providing any written communications to the Business Employees
relating to the Employment Matters and (ii) any Employee Session shall comply
with all applicable Laws.

 



 

(j) The provisions of this _Section 7.9_ are solely for the benefit of the
Parties to this Agreement and nothing in this _Section 7.9_ , express or
implied, will confer upon any employee, consultant, manager or other service
provider (or any dependent, successor, legal representative or beneficiary
thereof), any rights or remedies, including any right to continuance of
employment or any other service relationship with Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, or any right to compensation or benefits of any nature or kind
whatsoever under this Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 7.9_, express or
implied, will be: (i) an amendment or deemed amendment of any plan providing
benefits to any employee, (ii) construed to interfere with the right of Buyer
or its Affiliates to terminate the employment or other service relationship of
any of the Transferred Employees at any time, with or without cause, or
restrict any such entity in the exercise of their independent business
judgment in modifying any of the terms and conditions of the employment or
other service arrangement of the Transferred Employees or (iii) deemed to
obligate Buyer or its Affiliates to adopt, enter into or maintain any employee
benefit plan or other compensatory plan, program or arrangement at any time.

 



 

 ** _7.10_** ** _ _**_Publicity_. The Parties and their respective Affiliates,
if applicable, will consult with each other with regard to all press releases
or other public announcements issued or made

 



      
 

 



 

concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein and neither
Party will issue, and each of them will not permit any Affiliate to issue any
press release or other public announcement or otherwise communicate with any
news media concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein
without the prior consent of the other Party, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided, however,_ that
following the first press release or other public announcement with respect to
announcing the execution of this Agreement by the Parties, this _Section
7.10_ will not restrict or prevent (a) disclosures by Buyer or Seller (or
their respective Affiliates) made in quarterly earnings releases, earnings
calls, investor communications or as may be required by applicable Laws or the
applicable rules and regulations of any Governmental Authority or stock
exchange having jurisdiction over the disclosing Party or its Affiliates, (b)
internal announcements by each Party (or its Affiliates) to its or its
Affiliates employees, (c) Buyer or Seller from recording the Assignment
delivered at Closing or from complying with any disclosure requirements of
Governmental Authorities that are applicable to the transfer of the MidCon
Assets from Seller to Buyer, and/or (d) Buyer or Seller (or their respective
Affiliates) from making any disclosure of information relating to this
Agreement if made in a manner, under conditions and to Persons that would be
permitted under the Confidentiality Agreement so long as such Person continues
to hold such information confidential on the same terms as set forth in this
_Section 7.10_.

 



 

 ** _7.11_** ** _ _**_Non-Competition_.

 



 

(a) In consideration for the acquisition by Buyer of the MidCon Assets and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and to protect the
benefits to be derived by Buyer as a result of the acquisition of the MidCon
Assets, the termination of the ACMP Agreements and the execution and delivery
of the Replacement Contract, and in order to satisfy certain conditions to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Seller
expressly covenants and agrees that during the three-year period from and
after the Closing Date (the " ** _Prohibited Period_** "), Seller will, and
will cause its Affiliates to, refrain from directly or indirectly carrying on
or engaging in the Restricted Business in the Restricted Area. Seller agrees
and covenants that because the following conduct would constitute carrying on
or engaging in the Restricted Business, Seller will not, and will cause its
Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly during the Prohibited Period, loan
money to or sell or lease equipment to any Third Party for the purpose of
engaging in, at any time during the Prohibited Period, a Restricted Business
in the Restricted Area.

 



 

(b) The Parties agree that the limitations as to time, geographical area and
scope of activity to be restrained as set forth in _Section 7.11(a) _are
reasonable and do not impose any greater restraint than is necessary to
protect the legitimate business interests of Buyer and that these limitations
are intended to comply with the provisions of all applicable Law. The Parties
further agree and acknowledge that, in the event of a breach of or breach
threatened in writing of any of the provisions of this _Section 7.11_, Buyer
will be entitled to seek immediate injunctive relief without the necessity of
posting any bond, as any such breach would cause the Buyer irreparable injury
for which it would have no adequate remedy at law. Nothing in this Agreement
(including _Section 11.5_) will be construed so as to prohibit Buyer from
pursuing or realizing any other remedies available to it under this Agreement,
at Law or in equity for any

 



      
 

 



 

such breach or breach threatened in writing; _provided_ that, notwithstanding
this _Section 7.11,_ Buyer shall not be entitled to rescission for any such
breach.

 



 

(c) To the extent that any part of this _Section 7.11_ may be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable for any reason, it is intended that such part will be
enforceable to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction will
determine that such part, if more limited in scope, would have been
enforceable, and such part will be deemed to have been so written and the
remaining parts will as written be effective and enforceable in all events and
the Parties agree to request that such court enforce this _Section 7.11_ as
if so written.

 



 

 ** _7.12_** ** _ _**_ACMP Agreement Terminations and the Replacement
Contract_. Prior to Closing, (a) Buyer will use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Replacement Contract to be effective as of Closing and
(b) Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the ACMP
Agreement Terminations, to be effective as of the Closing. Without the prior
consent of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed, withheld
or conditioned), Buyer shall not terminate or materially amend or modify the
terms of the Replacement Contract prior to Closing.

 



 

 ** _7.13_** ** _ _**_Excluded Real Property_. From and after the Execution
Date until the 20th Business Day following the Execution Date (the " ** _Real
Property Election Date_** "), if Buyers Phase 1 Environmental Assessments of
the Real Property pursuant to _Section 4.1(b)_ identifies one or more
Environmental Defects with respect to such Real Property, Buyer may elect in
good faith to exclude such Real Property (and the Facilities located thereon)
from the MidCon Assets to be conveyed at Closing by giving written notice to
Seller no later than 5p.m. CST on the Real Property Election Date identifying
in reasonable detail the Environmental Defect affecting such Real Property.
Any such Real Property so excluded (together with the Personal Property and
Facilities relating thereto, the " ** _Excluded Real Property_** ") shall
become Excluded Assets and any Real Property not excluded pursuant to this
Section 7.13 (the " ** _Acquired Real Property_** ") shall be included in the
MidCon Assets. Seller will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the
City of Waynoka (and deliver to Buyer at Closing) an easement for access and
utilities, in a form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer that are necessary in
order for Buyer to have reasonable access to, and utilities services, for the
Acquired Real Property in the location generally depicted on _Schedule
5.17(a)_ with a black line (the " ** _Black Easement_** "). In addition,
Seller will grant (and deliver to Buyer at Closing) a temporary easement along
the existing gravel road that is depicted on _Schedule 5.17(a) _near the
Black Easement, in a form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, for the purposes
of (a) providing access to the Acquired Real Property until the construction
on the Black Easement is complete such that Buyer can use the Black Easement
to access the Acquired Real Property and (b) installing and operating
utilities to the extent Buyer is unable to use the Black Easement for
utilities services.

 



 

 ** _7.14_** ** _ _**_Excluded Compression Units_.

 



 

(a) On the Preliminary Settlement Statement Date, Seller will prepare in good
faith and deliver to Buyer a written notice setting forth (i) Closing Date
Working HP and (ii) the aggregate Closing Date Idle HP (the " ** _HP Notice_**
"), which notice will be included as part of the Preliminary Settlement
Statement.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) If the Closing Date Idle HP as reflected on the HP Notice is less than or
equal to 10,000, then (i) Buyer will have no election with respect to the Idle
Compression Units and (ii) all of the Idle Compression Units will be
considered part of the "Compression Units" to be transferred as a "MidCon
Asset" at Closing hereunder.

 



 

(c) If the Closing Date Idle HP as reflected on the HP Notice is greater than
10,000, then, within four Business Days after receipt of the HP Notice, Buyer
will deliver to Seller a written notice (the " ** _HP Response_** ") setting
forth (i) the Idle Compression Units Buyer elects not to purchase, if any
(collectively, the " ** _Excluded Compression Units_** "); (ii) the Included
Idle Compression Units and the Included Idle HP and (iii) Buyers good faith
calculation in reasonable detail of the adjusted Compression Unit Amount based
on the foregoing; _provided_ that any election made by Buyer pursuant to this
_Section 7.14(c) _will include an election to purchase Included Idle
Compression Units (the selection of which Included Idle Compression Units
Buyer elects to purchase will be made in Buyers sole discretion) such that
the Included Idle HP after giving effect to such election is at least 10,000.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Included Idle Compression Units will be
considered part of the "Compression Units" to be transferred as part of the
"MidCon Assets" hereunder, and the Excluded Compression Units will be
considered "Excluded Assets" hereunder. If Buyer does not deliver a HP
Response to Seller in compliance with this _Section 7.14(c) _within four
Business Days after receipt of the HP Notice, then, provided that the HP
Notice correctly reflected the Closing Date Idle HP in all material respects
(i) Buyer will be deemed to have waived any election with respect to the Idle
Compression Units and (ii) all of the Idle Compression Units will be
considered part of the "Compression Units" to be transferred as a "MidCon
Asset" at the Closing hereunder.

 



 

(d) All costs of deinstallation, decontamination, removal and transportation
to Seller of Excluded Compression Units not borne by ACMP shall be the
responsibility of Seller.

 



 

 ** _7.15_** ** _ _**_Assistance_.

 



 

(a) Seller shall cause its independent registered public accounting firm to
prepare and provide to Buyer, and Buyer will cooperate with Seller and its
independent registered public accounting firm in the preparation of, such
audited and unaudited financial statements as are required under Rule 3-05 of
Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC (collectively, the " ** _Financial
Statements_** ") to be included in any filing by Buyer or its Affiliates with
the SEC in the time period set forth in Regulation S-X or otherwise required
by the SEC as a result of the Sale, _provided_ that Seller will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and provide to Buyer such Financial
Statements at or prior to Closing. Prior to and following Closing, Seller will
provide Buyer, its Affiliates and their representatives with reasonable access
during normal business hours to Sellers financial and accounting information
(i) used in the preparation of the Financial Statements or (ii) directly
relating to the MidCon Assets as needed for preparation of such financial
statements as are required by Article XI of Regulation S-X promulgated by the
SEC. Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
representation letters and similar documents from applicable personnel as may
be required in connection with the preparation and audit of the Financial
Statements; _provided_ that this obligation shall be inapplicable to any
requested representation that, in the reasonable judgment of such personnel,
is not factually accurate in all material respects. Subject to Sellers
compliance with the covenants of the immediately preceding sentence, Buyer
agrees that any inability or failure of

 



      
 

 



 

Seller to obtain any representation letter or similar document shall not in
and of itself create any liability on the part of Seller or constitute a
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Seller
contained in this Agreement. Upon Sellers request, Buyer will reimburse
Seller for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Seller
with respect to Sellers undertaking pursuant to this _Section 7.15_, or as
required pursuant to the Side Letter or the LOI. The Parties understand and
agree that the review and related activities in connection with preparation of
the Financial Statements and any financial statements required by Article XI
of Regulation S-X (as well as any requirement of representation letters and
similar documents) will only be required to be carried out one time.

 



 

(b) Seller and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer and its Affiliates,
on the other hand, shall reasonably cooperate with each other following the
Closing in the prosecution or defense of any of the Retained Litigation,
including affording reasonable access during normal business hours to
employees of Buyer and its Affiliates engaged in conducting the Compression
Business and the Records in Buyers or its Affiliates possession to the
extent (and then only to the extent) relating to such Retained Litigation;
_provided, however_ , that (i) the requesting Party will reimburse the other
Party for all of such other Partys reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred
in connection with this _Section 7.15(b) _and (ii) this _Section 7.15(b)
_shall not apply to any dispute, litigation or other proceeding or claim
between the Parties arising out of this Agreement, any Transaction Document or
any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby.

 



 

 ** _7.16_** ** _ _**_Seller Marks; Change of Name_. Buyer acknowledges and
agrees that it is not acquiring any right, title, interest, license or any
other right whatsoever to use the Seller Marks. Buyer shall, as promptly as
practicable, but in any case within 60 days after the Closing Date, eliminate
the Seller Marks from the MidCon Assets, including any signage. From and after
the earlier of 60 days after the Closing Date and the elimination of the
Seller Marks from the MidCon Assets, Buyer will not (a) do any business using
the Seller Marks or (b) otherwise operate any MidCon Assets or undertake the
Compression Business in any manner that might reasonably be expected to
confuse any Person into believing that Buyer has any right, title, interest,
license or any other right to use the Seller Marks or that Seller has any
responsibility for or involvement with the ownership or operation of the
MidCon Assets after the Closing. Buyer will not send, or cause to be sent, any
correspondence or other materials to any Person on any stationery that
contains any Seller Marks.

 



 

 ** _7.17_** ** _ _**_Insurance_. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that,
effective upon the Closing, the insurance policies of Seller and its
Affiliates related to the MidCon Assets and/or the Compression Business may be
terminated or modified to exclude coverage of the MidCon Assets and/or the
Compression Business including insurance required by any Third Party to be
maintained by Seller. From and after the Closing, Seller shall be under no
obligation to purchase, establish, renew or extend any insurance, performance
bonds, surety bonds, guarantees, warranties, indemnities and similar rights
relating to the MidCon Assets or the Compression Business.

 



 

 ** _7.18_** ** _ _**_Bulk Transfer Laws_. Buyer hereby waives compliance by
Seller with the provisions of any so-called "bulk transfer law" of any
jurisdiction in connection with the sale of the MidCon Assets to Buyer or any
Buyer Designee, as applicable.

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _7.19_** ** _ _**_LandCo Transfer of Real Property_. At the Closing,
Seller will cause LandCo to transfer and assign the Acquired Real Property (if
any) to Buyer, free of any lease, pursuant to deeds substantially in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit F_ (collectively, the " ** _LandCo Deed_** ").

 



 

 ** _7.20_** ** _ _**_Amendment of Schedules and Exhibits_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the following sentence, Buyer agrees that, with respect to any
disclosure schedule relating to the representations and warranties of Seller
contained in this Agreement (each, a " ** _Disclosure Schedule_** "), Seller
shall have the continuing right until the Closing to supplement or amend such
Disclosure Schedule with respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered
which, if such matter had existed or been known by Seller as of the date of
this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in such
Disclosure Schedule (each supplement or amendment to a Disclosure Schedule, a
" ** _Disclosure Schedule Supplement_** "). Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, for purposes of indemnification and for purposes of determining
whether or not the conditions set forth in this Agreement have been satisfied
each Disclosure Schedule Supplement shall be disregarded.

 



 

(b) Seller shall have the right to supplement and/or amend _Exhibit A-1_ and
_Exhibit A-3_ to reflect Additional Compression Units and to include
specifically identified items for which replacements of equal or greater value
has been obtained. Each such supplement or amendment permitted pursuant to
this _Section 7.20(b) _shall be deemed to be part of this Agreement for all
purposes from and after the date of such supplement or amendment.

 



 

 ** _7.21_** ** _ _**_New Compression Units_. In the event that Access
requests any compression unit under an ACMP Agreement (in addition to the
Compression Units) on or after the Execution Date, and Seller does not have
available a compression unit capable of providing the requested compression in
accordance with the standards under such ACMP Agreement, then Seller shall
order such requested additional compression unit to be built by Compass
pursuant to a purchase order that is subject to the terms and conditions of
the Compass Contract and which purchase order and rights under the Compass
Contract relating thereto is transferable to Buyer (a " ** _New Compression
Unit Purchase Order_** ").

 



 

 ** _7.22_** ** _ _**_Consents to Assign_.

 



 

(a) With respect to each Consent set forth on _Schedule 5.10_ (excluding the
Consents, if any, relating to the ACMP Agreements), within 10 Business Days
after the Execution Date, Seller will send to the holder of each such Consent
a notice in compliance with the contractual provisions applicable to such
Consent seeking such holders Consent.

 



 

(b) If Seller fails to obtain a Consent set forth in _Schedule 5.10_
(excluding the Consents, if any, relating to the ACMP Agreements) prior to
Closing, then the MidCon Asset (or portion thereof) affected by such un-
obtained Consent will be excluded from the MidCon Assets to be assigned to
Buyer at Closing. In the event that any such Consent (with respect to a MidCon
Asset excluded pursuant to the foregoing sentence of this _Section 7.22(b)_)
that was not obtained prior to Closing is obtained on or before 180 days
following the Closing, then, within 10 Business Days after such Consent is
obtained, Seller will assign the MidCon Asset (or portion

 



      
 

 



 

thereof) that was so excluded as a result of such previously un-obtained
Consent to Buyer (or a Buyer Designee) pursuant to an instrument in
substantially the same form as the Assignment.

 



 

(c) Prior to Closing and for the 180-day period following Closing, Seller will
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all Consents listed on
_Schedule 5.10_ (excluding the Consents, if any, relating to the ACMP
Agreements); _provided, however_ , that Seller will not be required to incur
any Liability or pay any money in order to obtain any such Consent. Buyer will
use its reasonable efforts (without any obligation to incur any Liability or
to pay money) to assist and cooperate with Seller in furtherance of Sellers
efforts pursuant to this _Section 7.22(c)_.

 



 

 ** _7.23_** ** _ _**_Compass Contract_. During the 18 months following the
Closing, Seller shall not terminate or materially amend or modify the terms of
any Contract under which a W/I Right arises or the Compass Contract, in each
case, to the extent relating to any W/I Claim.

 



 

 ** _7.24_** ** _ _**_Survey_. On or before 20 days prior to Closing, Seller
shall obtain (at Sellers sole cost and expense) a current survey (the " **
_Survey_** ") of the Real Property, prepared by a surveyor approved by Buyer
and made in conformance with American Land Title Association Standards. As
soon as reasonably possible after receipt, but in any event within five days
after receipt, Seller shall provide a copy of the Survey to Buyer for Buyers
approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,
solely as to boundary dimensions and the legal description. In the event of a
disapproval by Buyer, the Parties shall use their respective good faith,
commercially reasonable efforts to agree on the boundary dimensions and legal
description of the Real Property. Upon the determination of the boundary
dimensions and legal description of the Real Property, the Parties agree to
deliver a revised _Exhibit A-2_ setting forth the legal description of the

 ** _11.5_** ** _ _**_Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything to the

in _Section 4.1(c)_, _Section 7.11_ and _Section 13.16_ and (b) for the
remedies available at Law or in equity in connection with any Transaction
Document (other than the certificates delivered by the Parties pursuant to
_Section 8.3_ or _Section 9.3_, as applicable) to the extent permitted under

the other Seller Indemnified Parties and Buyer Indemnified Parties,
respectively) that, from and after Closing, the indemnification provisions set
forth in this _Article XI_ contain the Parties, the Seller Indemnified
Parties and the Buyer Indemnified Parties sole and exclusive remedies
against each other with respect to any and all claims relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or any Transaction Documents, the certificates delivered
by the Parties pursuant to _Section 8.3_ or _Section 9.3_, as applicable, or
any other claims relating to the MidCon Assets, the Compression Business, the

Agreement. In furtherance of and not in limitation of the foregoing, from and
after Closing, absent fraud and except (i) as provided in _Section 4.1(c)_,
_Section 7.11_ and _Section 13.16_ and (ii) for the remedies available at
Law or in equity in

 



      
 

 



 

connection with any Transaction Document (other than the certificates
delivered by the Parties pursuant to _Section 8.3_ or _Section 9.3_, as
applicable) to the extent permitted under any such Transaction Document,
Seller and Buyer (on behalf of themselves and the other Seller Indemnified
Parties and Buyer Indemnified Parties, respectively) each waives, releases,
remises and forever discharges, to the fullest extent permitted under any
applicable Laws, the other Party and its Affiliates and all such Persons

Liabilities, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, in Law or in equity,
known or unknown, which such parties might now or subsequently may have, based
on, relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any Transaction Documents,
any certificates delivered by the Parties pursuant to _Section 8.3_ or
_Section 9.3_, as applicable, or any other claims relating to the MidCon
Assets, the Compression Business, the events giving rise to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or any right of rescission
with respect to such matters.

 



 

 ** _11.6_** ** _ _**_Indemnification Procedures_. All claims for
indemnification under _Section 4.1(c), Section 11.2_ and _Section 11.3_ will
be asserted and resolved as follows:

 



 

(a) For purposes of _Section 4.1(c) _and this _Article XI_, the term " **
_Indemnifying Party_** " when used in connection with particular Liabilities
will mean the Party having an obligation to indemnify another Party or
Person(s) with respect to such Liabilities pursuant to _Section 4.1(c) _and
this _Article XI_, and the term " ** _Indemnified Party_** " when used in
connection with particular Liabilities will mean the Party or Person(s) having
the right to be indemnified with respect to such Liabilities by another Party
pursuant to _Section 4.1(c) _and this _Article XI_.

 



 

(b) To make claim for indemnification under _Section 4.1(c), Section 11.2_
and _Section 11.3_, an Indemnified Party will notify the Indemnifying Party
of its claim under this _Section 11.6_, including the specific details of and
specific basis under this Agreement for its claim (the " ** _Claim Notice_**
"). In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon a claim by a
Third Party against the Indemnified Party (a " ** _Third Party Claim_** "),
the Indemnified Party will provide its Claim Notice promptly after the
Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of the Third Party Claim and will
enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to the Third Party
Claim; _provided_ that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice of
a Third Party Claim as provided in this _Section 11.6_ will not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under _Section 4.1(c), Section 11.2_ or
_Section 11.3_ (as applicable) except to the extent such failure actually
prejudices the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend against the Third Party
Claim and then only to the extent such failure actually prejudices the
Indemnifying Partys ability to defend against the Third Party Claim. In the
event that the claim for indemnification is based upon a breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice will specify
the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that was breached.

 



 

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party will notify the Indemnified Party whether it will
assume and thereafter conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim. The
Indemnified Party is authorized, prior to notice by the Indemnifying Party
that it will assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, at the expense of
the Indemnifying Party, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it
will deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the
Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) If the Indemnifying Party will have assumed the defense of the Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party will have full control of such defense and
proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof. If requested by
the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party will cooperate in contesting any
Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party elects to contest, including
providing reasonable access to the Indemnified Partys premises, personnel,
accounts, documents and records during normal business hours. The Indemnified
Party may participate in, at its own expense, but subject to the Indemnifying
Partys full control of, any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim
controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 11.6(d)_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party will not be required to
bring any counterclaim or cross complaint against any Person. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, an Indemnifying Party will not, without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, (i) settle any Third Party Claim or consent
to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto that does not include an
unconditional written release of the Indemnified Party from all Liability in
respect of such Third Party Claim or (ii) settle any Third Party Claim or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto in any manner that
may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Party (other than as a
result of money damages covered by the indemnity); _provided, however_ , that
with respect to any Third Party Claim relating to Tax matters an Indemnifying
Party will not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
settle any such Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with
respect thereto.

 



 

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of the Third Party
Claim, then the Indemnified Party will have the right to defend against the
Third Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, with
counsel of its choosing. Any settlement of the Third Party Claim by the
Indemnified Party will require the consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless the
settlement is solely for money damages and results in a final resolution.

 



 

(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not involving a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party will have 30 days from its receipt of the Claim
Notice to (i) cure the Liabilities complained of, (ii) admit its liability for
such Liability or (iii) dispute the claim for such Liabilities. If the
Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within such 30-day
period that it has cured the Liabilities or that it disputes the claim for
such Liabilities, the Indemnifying Party will conclusively be deemed to have
rejected such Claim Notice.

 



 

 ** _11.7_** ** _ _**_Survival_.

 



 

(a) The representations and warranties of Seller in _Article V_ (other than
the Fundamental Representations of Seller and the representations and
warranties in _Section 5.6_, _Section 5.10(b) _and _Section 5.12_) will
survive the Closing for a period of one year. The Fundamental Representations
of Seller will survive the Closing without time limit and the representations
and warranties in _Section 5.6_ , _Section 5.10(b) _and _Section 5.12_ will
survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (plus
any applicable waivers or extensions of such statute of limitations). Except
to the extent any covenant expressly lasts for only a specified period of time
as set forth in this Agreement, each of the covenants of Seller shall survive
the Closing until 30 days following the expiration of the applicable statute
of limitations (plus any applicable waivers or extensions of such statute of
limitations) applicable to the

 



      
 

 



 

obligation covered by such covenant; _provided, however_ , Sellers covenants
in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 10.4_ shall survive the Closing only for a
period of one year.

 



 

(b) The representations and warranties of Buyer in _Article VI_ (other than
the Fundamental Representations of Buyer) will survive the Closing for a
period of one year. The Fundamental Representations of Buyer will survive the
Closing without time limit. Except to the extent any covenant expressly lasts
for only a specified period of time as set forth in this Agreement, the
covenants of Buyer shall survive the Closing until 30 days following the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (plus any applicable
waivers or extensions of such statute of limitations) applicable to the
obligation covered by such covenant.

 



 

(c) Representations, warranties, covenants and agreements will be of no
further force and effect after the date of their expiration, _provided_ that
there will be no termination of any bona fide claim asserted pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to such a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement prior to its expiration date.

 



 

(d) The indemnities in _Section 11.2(a)_, _Section 11.2(b)_, _Section
11.3(a) _and _Section 11.3(b) _will terminate as of the applicable
termination date pursuant to _Section 11.7(a) _or _Section 11.7(b) _of each
respective representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that is subject to
indemnification. Buyers indemnities set forth in _Section 4.1(c) _and
_Section 11.3(c) _will survive the Closing without time limit. Sellers
indemnities set forth in _Section 11.2(c) _will survive the Closing without
time limit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there will be no termination of any
bona fide claim asserted pursuant to the indemnities in _Section 11.2_ or
_Section 11.3_ prior to the date of termination for such indemnity.

 



 

 ** _11.8_** ** _ _**_No Setoff_. Neither Buyer nor Seller will have any right
to setoff any Liabilities against any payments to be made by either of them
under this Agreement.

 



 

 ** _11.9_** ** _ _**_No Duplication_. Any liability for indemnification under
this Agreement shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason
of any (i) state of facts constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or would otherwise be
indemnifiable under multiple provisions of this _Article XI_ or (ii) amount
taken into account in determining any adjustment to the Purchase Price under
_Section 3.2(b)(i), Section 3.2(b)(v), Section 3.2(a)(ii), _or _Section
3.2(a)(iii); provided, however_, that notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, this _Section 11.9_ shall not limit or alter the ability of a Party
to seek or receive damages to which it is otherwise entitled, subject to
_Section 11.4_ through _Section 11.11_ (but excluding this _Section 11.9_),
under applicable Law.

 



 

 ** _11.10_** ** _ _**_Non-Compensatory Damages_. **NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING
ELSE IN THIS AGREEMENT, ABSENT FRAUD, NONE OF THE BUYER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES

(f) by either Party, upon notice to the other Party, if the Closing

its Affiliates are at such time in material breach of any provision of this
Agreement and (ii) Buyer shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to subsection (c), (e) or (f) if damage to the MidCon Assets
resulting from Buyers due diligence actions in breach _Section 4.1_ is the
cause of or resulted in the failure of the condition set forth in _Section
8.1_ not to have been satisfied prior to the Outside Termination Date.

 



 

 ** _12.2_** ** _ _**_Right of Specific Performance; Effect of Termination_
**.**

 



 

(a) If the obligation to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to any provision of _Section 12.1_ hereof, then, except
for the provisions of _Article 1_, _Section 4.1(c)_, _Section 4.1(d)_,
_Section 4.2_, _Section 4.3_, _Section 7.4_, _Section 11.10_ , this
_Section 12.2, Section 12.3, Article XIII_ (other than _Section 13.2(b)_,
_Section 13.2(c)_, _Section 13.6, Section 13.7_ and _Section 13.16_ ) and
such of the defined terms in _Appendix I_ necessary to give context to the
surviving provisions, this Agreement will forthwith become void and, except as
expressly provided below in this _Section 12.2_, the Parties will have no
liability or obligation hereunder.

 



 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by Seller (or may be terminated by Seller)
pursuant to (i) _Section 12.1(b)(i) _(other than because of the breach by
Buyer of _Section 7.12_) or (ii) _Section 12.1(f) _because of (A) the
actual breach by Buyer of this Agreement (other than

 



       
 

 



 

Buyers breach of the provisions of _Section 7.12_) or (B) the failure of
Buyer to close in the instance where, as of the Outside Termination Date, (1)
all of the conditions in _Article VIII_ (excluding conditions that, by their
terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing) have been satisfied (or waived
by Buyer), (2) Seller is ready, willing and able to perform its obligations
under _Section 10.3_, and (3) Buyer nevertheless elects not to close, then in
either such event, the Parties agree and acknowledge that Seller will suffer
damages that are not practicable to ascertain. Accordingly, if Seller has such
right to terminate this Agreement, then Seller may elect either (x) to seek
specific performance in accordance with _Section 13.16_ or (y) to receive
$10,000,000 of the Deposit as liquidated damages (and Seller and Buyer
promptly shall give joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to deliver
$10,000,000 of the Deposit to Seller and to contemporaneously therewith return
the remainder of the Deposit to Buyer). The Parties agree that if Seller
elects to receive $10,000,000 as liquidated damages, such liquidated damages
are reasonable considering all of the circumstances existing as of the
Execution Date and constitute the Parties good faith estimate of the actual
damages reasonably expected to result from such termination of this Agreement
by Seller. Seller agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
Sellers right to specific performance under _Section 13.16_ or to receive
the Deposit as liquidated damages as provided in this _Section 12.2(b) _will
be the sole and exclusive remedies of Seller if the Closing does not occur as
a result of the termination of this Agreement by Seller (or Sellers right to
terminate this Agreement) pursuant to _Section 12.1(b)(i) _or _Section
12.1(f) _under the circumstances set forth in this _Section 12.2(b)_.

 



 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by Buyer (or may be terminated by Buyer)
pursuant to (i) _Section 12.1(c) _(other than because of the breach by
Seller of _Section 7.5_ or _Section 7.12_) or (ii) _Section 12.1(f)
_because of (A) the actual breach by Seller of this Agreement (other than
Sellers breach of the provisions of _Section 7.5 _or _Section 7.12_) or (B)
the failure of Seller to close in the instance where, as of the Outside
Termination Date, (1) all of the conditions in _Article IX_ (excluding
conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing) have
been satisfied (or waived by Seller), (2) Buyer is ready, willing and able to
perform its obligations under _Section 10.3_, and (3) Seller nevertheless
elects not to close, then in either such event, the Parties agree and
acknowledge that Buyer will suffer damages that are not practicable to
ascertain. Accordingly, if Buyer has such right to terminate this Agreement,
then Buyer may elect either (x) to seek specific performance in accordance
with _Section 13.16_ or (y) to the return of the Deposit (and Seller and
Buyer promptly shall give joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
deliver the Deposit to Buyer) and an amount equal to $10,000,000 as liquidated
damages, which amount will be immediately payable by Seller to Buyer by wire
transfer in immediately available funds. The Parties agree that if Buyer
elects to have the Deposit returned and have Seller pay Buyer an amount equal
to $10,000,000 as liquidated damages, such liquidated damages are reasonable
considering all of the circumstances existing as of the Execution Date and
constitute the Parties good faith estimate of the actual damages reasonably
expected to result from such termination of this Agreement by Buyer. Buyer
agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, Buyers right to specific
performance under _Section 13.16_ or to the return of the Deposit and the
payment of such liquidated damages as provided in this _Section 12.2(c)_ will
be the sole and exclusive remedies of Buyer if the Closing does not occur as a
result of the termination of this Agreement by Buyer (or Buyers right to
terminate this Agreement) pursuant to _Section 12.1(c) _or _Section 12.1(f)
_under the circumstances set forth in this _Section 12.2(c)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by Buyer pursuant to _Section
12.1(d)_, (ii) by Seller pursuant to _Section 12.1(b)(i)_ because of the
breach by Buyer of _Section 7.12 _or (iii) by Buyer or by Seller pursuant to
_Section 12.1(f)_, in each of the foregoing cases due to (A) the termination
of the Replacement Contract by Buyer (or its Affiliate, as applicable), (B)
the mutual termination of the Replacement Contract by Buyer and Access (or
their respective Affiliates, as applicable) or (C) the expiration of the
Replacement Contract prior to the Outside Termination Date in accordance with
the Replacement Contracts terms, then in any such event, the Parties agree
and acknowledge that Seller will suffer damages that are not practicable to
ascertain. Accordingly, if this Agreement is terminated under the
circumstances set forth in this _Section 12.2(d)_, then Seller shall be
entitled to receive $7,000,000 of the Deposit as liquidated damages (and
Seller and Buyer promptly shall give joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent to deliver $7,000,000 of the Deposit to Seller and to contemporaneously
therewith return the remainder of the Deposit to Buyer). The Parties agree
that Buyers payment to Seller of $7,000,000 of the Deposit pursuant to this
_Section 12.2(d) _as liquidated damages is reasonable considering all of the
circumstances existing as of the Execution Date and constitute the Parties
good faith estimate of the actual damages reasonably expected to result from
such termination of this Agreement. Seller agrees that, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, Sellers right to receive $7,000,000 as liquidated damages
as provided in this _Section 12.2(d) _will be the sole and exclusive remedy
of Seller if the Closing does not occur as a result of the termination of this
Agreement by Buyer pursuant to _Section 12.1(d)_, by Seller pursuant to
_Section 12.1(b)(i) _or by Seller or Buyer pursuant to _Section 12.1(f)_, in
each of the foregoing cases, under the circumstances set forth in this
_Section 12.2(d)_.

 



 

(e) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by Seller pursuant to _Section
12.1(b)(ii)_, (ii) by Buyer pursuant to _Section 12.1(c)_ because of the
breach by Seller of _Section 7.12 _or (ii) by Buyer or by Seller pursuant to
_Section 12.1(f)_, in each of the foregoing cases due to (A) the termination
of the ACMP Agreement Terminations by Seller (or its Affiliate, as
applicable), (B) the mutual termination of the ACMP Agreement Terminations by
Seller and Access (or their respective Affiliates, as applicable) or (C) the
expiration of the ACMP Agreement Terminations in accordance with the ACMP
Agreement Terminations terms, then in any such event, the Parties agree and
acknowledge that Buyer will suffer damages that are not practicable to
ascertain. Accordingly, if this Agreement is terminated under the
circumstances set forth in this _Section 12.2(e)_, then Buyer shall be
entitled to the return of the Deposit (and Seller and Buyer promptly shall
give joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to deliver the Deposit to
Buyer) and an amount equal to $7,000,000 as liquidated damages, which amount
will be immediately payable by Seller to Buyer by wire transfer in immediately
available funds. The Parties agree that Sellers payment to Buyer of
$7,000,000 as liquidated damages pursuant to this _Section 12.2(e)_ is
reasonable considering all of the circumstances existing as of the Execution
Date and constitute the Parties good faith estimate of the actual damages
reasonably expected to result from such termination of this Agreement. Buyer
agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, Buyers right to the
return of the Deposit and the payment of such liquidated damages as provided
in this _Section 12.2(e)_ will be the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer if
the Closing does not occur as a result of the termination of this Agreement by
Seller pursuant to _Section 12.1(b)(ii)_, by Buyer pursuant to _Section
12.1(c) _or by Buyer or Seller pursuant to _Section 12.1(f)_ , in each of the
foregoing cases, under the circumstances set forth in this _Section 12.2(e)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) If this Agreement is terminated by Buyer (or may be terminated by Buyer)
pursuant to _Section 12.1(c) _or _Section 12.1(f)_ , in each case, because of
the actual breach by Seller or its Affiliates of _Section 7.5_, the Parties
agree and acknowledge that Buyer will suffer damages that are not practicable
to ascertain. Accordingly, if Buyer has such right to terminate this
Agreement, then Buyer may elect either (i) to seek specific performance in
accordance with _Section 13.16_ or (ii) to the return of the Deposit (and
Seller and Buyer promptly shall give joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent to deliver the Deposit to Buyer) and an amount equal to $33,000,000 as
liquidated damages, which amount will be immediately payable by wire transfer
in immediately available funds by Seller to Buyer. The Parties agree that if
Buyer elects to have the Deposit returned and have Seller pay Buyer an amount
equal to $33,000,000 as liquidated damages, such liquidated damages are
reasonable considering all of the circumstances existing as of the Execution
Date and constitute the Parties good faith estimate of the actual damages
reasonably expected to result from such termination of this Agreement by Buyer
_._ Buyer agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, Buyers right
to specific performance under _Section 13.16_ or to the return of the Deposit
and the payment of such liquidated damages as provided in this _Section
12.2(f)_ will be the sole and exclusive remedies of Buyer if the Closing does
not occur as a result of the termination of this Agreement by Buyer (or
Buyers right to terminate this Agreement) pursuant to _Section 12.1(c) _or
_Section 12.1(f)_, in each case, under the circumstances set forth in this
_Section 12.2(f)._

 



 

(g) If this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than as set forth in
_Section 12.2(b)_, _Section 12.2(c), Section 12.2(d), Section 12.2(e) _or
_Section 12.2(f), _the Parties promptly shall give joint written instructions
to the Escrow Agent to deliver the Deposit to Buyer.

 



 

 ** _12.3_** ** _ _**_Return of Documentation and Confidentiality_. Upon
termination of this Agreement, Buyer will destroy all environmental
assessments and/or reports, maps and other information furnished by Seller to
Buyer or prepared by or on behalf of Buyer in connection with its due
diligence investigation of the MidCon Assets, in each case, in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement (and subject to such retention rights as are
provided in the Confidentiality Agreement); _provided_ that Buyer will be
entitled to retain in its corporate records a copy of board papers, reports to
management and other documentation prepared in connection with its decision to
enter into the transaction, the conduct thereof, and the termination thereof,
so long as it maintains the confidentiality thereof in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XIII** 
MISCELLANEOUS

 



 

 ** _13.1_** ** _ _**_Appendices, Exhibits and Schedules_. All of the
Appendices, Exhibits and Schedules referred to in this Agreement constitute a
part of this Agreement. Each Party to this Agreement and its counsel has
received a complete set of Appendices, Exhibits and Schedules prior to and as
of the execution of this Agreement.

 



 

 ** _13.2_** ** _ _**_Expenses and Taxes_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise specifically provided, all fees, costs and expenses
incurred by the Parties in negotiating this Agreement or in consummating the
transactions contemplated by

 



      
 

 



 

this Agreement will be paid by the Party incurring the same, including legal
and accounting fees, costs and expenses.

 



 

(b) All Transfer Taxes and all required documentary, filing and recording fees
and expenses in connection with the filing and recording of the assignments,
conveyances or other instruments required to convey title to the MidCon Assets
to Buyer will be borne by Buyer. Seller will retain responsibility for, and
will bear and pay, all Income Tax Liability, Franchise Tax Liability, and
other similar Taxes (including any applicable interest or penalties) incurred
or imposed with respect to the transactions described in this Agreement.
Seller will retain responsibility for, and will bear and pay, all Taxes
assessed with respect to the ownership or operation of the MidCon Assets or
the Compression Business for (i) any period ending prior to the Effective Time
and (ii) the portion of any Straddle Period ending immediately prior to the
Effective Time (which, for the avoidance of doubt, will include any Taxes with
respect to the ownership or operation of the MidCon Assets or the Compression
Business for the periods set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) that may be
assessed against an Affiliate of Seller, including without limitation LandCo).
Seller will retain responsibility for, and will bear and pay, all Taxes
assessed with respect to the ACMP Agreements. All Taxes with respect to the
ownership or operation of the MidCon Assets or the Compression Business
arising on or after the Effective Time (including all Straddle Period Taxes
not apportioned to Seller) will be allocated to and borne by Buyer. For
purposes of allocation between the Parties of Taxes assessed with respect to
the ownership or operation of the MidCon Assets or the Compression Business
that are payable with respect to Straddle Periods, the portion of any such
Taxes that are attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period that ends
immediately prior to the Effective Time will (A) in the case of such Taxes
that are based upon or related to income or receipts or imposed on a
transactional basis such as severance or production Taxes, be deemed equal to
the amount that would be payable if the Tax year or period ended immediately
prior to the Effective Time; and (B) in the case of other Taxes, be allocated
pro rata per day between the period ending immediately prior to the Effective
Time and the period beginning on the Effective Time. For purposes of
subsection (A) of the preceding sentence, any exemption, deduction, credit or
other item that is calculated on an annual basis will be allocated pro rata
per day between the period ending immediately prior to the Effective Time and
the period beginning on the Effective Time. To the extent the actual amount of
any Taxes described in this _Section 13.2(b) _is not determinable at Closing,
Buyer and Seller will utilize the most recent information available in
estimating the amount of such Taxes for purposes of _Section 3.2(a)(ii) _and
_Section 3.2(b)(v)_. Upon determination of the actual amount of such Taxes,
Seller will pay to Buyer to the extent not taken into account in the Final
Settlement Statement any additional amount necessary to equal Sellers share
of such Taxes. In the event the amount of such Taxes paid by Seller or
included as a reduction to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 3.2(b)(v)
_at Closing exceeds Sellers share of such Taxes, Buyer will pay the amount of
any such overage to Seller.

 



 

(c) From and after Closing, Seller will file any Tax Return with respect to
Taxes assessed with respect to the ownership or operation of the MidCon Assets
or the Compression Business attributable to any period ending prior to the
Effective Time and will pay any such Taxes shown as due and owing on such Tax
Return. Within 15 days prior to filing, Seller will deliver to Buyer a draft
of any such Tax Return for Buyers review and Seller will consider in

 



      
 

 



 

good faith any reasonable comments submitted by Buyer within seven days after
Seller has provided such draft to Buyer.

 



 

(d) From and after Closing, Buyer will file any Tax Return with respect to
Taxes assessed with respect to the ownership or operation of the MidCon Assets
or the Compression Business attributable to a Straddle Period (to the extent
such Tax Return was not previously filed) and will pay any such Taxes shown as
due and owing on such Tax Return, subject to Buyers right of reimbursement
for any Taxes for which Seller is responsible under _Section 13.2(b)_. Within
15 days prior to filing, Buyer will deliver to Seller a draft of any such Tax
Return for Sellers review and Buyer will consider in good faith any
reasonable comments submitted by Seller within seven days after Buyer has
provided such draft to Seller.

 



 

(e) Buyer and Seller agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to the other,
upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance
relating to the MidCon Assets or the Compression Business, including, without
limitation, access to books and records, as is reasonably necessary for the
filing of all Tax Returns by Buyer or Seller, the making of any election
relating to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any taxing authority and
the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any
Tax. Each of Buyer and Seller will retain all books and records with respect
to Taxes pertaining to the MidCon Assets or the Compression Business for a
period of at least seven years following the Closing Date. Buyer and Seller
will cooperate fully with each other in the conduct of any audit, litigation
or other proceeding relating to Taxes involving the MidCon Assets, the
Compression Business or the Allocation. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer will
have no obligations under this _Section 13.2(e) _with respect to the ACMP
Agreements.

 



 

(f) Seller will promptly notify Buyer in writing upon receipt by Seller of
notice of any pending or threatened Tax audits or assessments relating to the
income, properties or operations of Seller or its Affiliates that reasonably
may be expected to relate to or give rise to an Encumbrance on the MidCon
Assets or the Compression Business. From and after Closing, each of Buyer and
Seller will promptly notify the other in writing upon receipt of notice of any
pending or threatened Tax audit or assessment challenging the Allocation.

 



 

 ** _13.3_** ** _ _**_Assignment_. This Agreement may not be assigned by any
Party, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the other
Party, which may be withheld in such Partys sole discretion; _provided,
however_ , at any time prior to three Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
Buyer may, by written notice to Seller, direct Seller to assign a portion of
the MidCon Assets to one or more Buyer Designees as the assignee under the
applicable Assignment or the grantee under the LandCo Deed; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that following Closing, Seller may assign this Agreement to Seller
Parent. No assignment by any Party of this Agreement will relieve such Party
of any of its obligations and responsibilities hereunder.

 



 

 ** _13.4_** ** _ _**_Preparation of Agreement_. Both Seller and Buyer and
their respective counsel participated in the preparation of this Agreement. In
the event of any ambiguity in this Agreement, no presumption will arise based
on the identity of the draftsman of this Agreement.
