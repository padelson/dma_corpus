 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER** , dated as of December 20, 2006 (the "
_Agreement_ "), among **PROTECTION ONE, INC.** , a Delaware corporation ("
_Parent_ "),  **TARA ACQUISITION CORP.** , a Delaware corporation and a
direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and **INTEGRATED
ALARM SERVICES GROUP, INC.**, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

  

 ** _W_** ** _I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ :**

  

 **WHEREAS** , the Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
have each determined that it is in the best interests of their respective
stockholders for Parent to acquire the Company upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein;

  

 **WHEREAS** , in furtherance of such acquisition, the Boards of Directors of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have each approved the merger (the "
_Merger_ ") of Merger Sub with and into the Company, in accordance with the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") and subject
to the terms and conditions set forth herein, which Merger will result in,
among other things, the Company becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent;

  

 **WHEREAS** , as a condition to the willingness of, and an inducement to,
Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, contemporaneously with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent, the Company and certain
holders of Company Notes (as defined herein), have entered into a lock-up and
consent agreement (the " _Consent Agreement_ ") in the form of _Exhibit A_
attached hereto, providing for the exchange of Company Notes for new notes to
be issued by a subsidiary of Parent;

  

 **WHEREAS** , as a condition to the willingness of, and an inducement to,
Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, contemporaneously with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, certain holders of Company
Common Stock (as defined herein), have entered into an agreement (the "
_Stockholders Agreement_ ") in the form of _Exhibit B_  attached hereto,
providing for certain actions relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and

  

 **WHEREAS** , for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the
Merger shall qualify as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_
");

  

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
hereby agree as follows:

  

 **ARTICLE I** ** 
  
 THE MERGER**

  

 **1.1 ****_The_** ** _Merger_**. At the Effective Time (as defined in
_Section 1.2_ ) and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and in accordance with the terms and requirements of the DGCL, (a)
Merger Sub **** shall be merged with and into the Company, (b) the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and (c) the Company shall, as  

   

surviving corporation in the Merger, continue its existence under Delaware
law as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The Company as the surviving
corporation after the Merger is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "
_Surviving Corporation_."

  

 **1.2 ****_Effective_** ** _Time_**. At the Closing the parties hereto shall
cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, in such form as required by and executed in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the DGCL (the date and time of such filing, or such
later date and time as may be specified in the Certificate of Merger by
mutual agreement of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, being the "
_Effective Time_ ").

  

 **1.3 ****_Effect_** ** _of the Merger_**. From and after the Effective Time,
the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of
the DGCL, including Section 259 thereof. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, and subject thereto, from and after the Effective Time, all
the assets, property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and
all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become
the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  

 **1.4 ****_Certification_** ** _of Incorporation; Bylaws_**. At the Effective
Time and without any further action on the part of the parties hereto, (a)
the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall be amended and restated
so as to read in its entirely as set forth on _Exhibit C_ hereto and, as so
amended, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by the DGCL and (b) the
Bylaws of Merger Sub shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided by the DGCL.

  

 **1.5 ****_Directors_** ** _and Officers_**. The directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate
of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving
Corporations Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The officers of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
initial officers of the Surviving Corporation.

  

 **1.6 ****_Conversion_** ** _of Company Common Stock, Etc_**. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the parties hereto or the holders of the following securities:

  

(a) Subject to the provisions of this _Article I_ , each share of Common
Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common
Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any shares of the Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to
_Section 1.7_ and subject to _Section 1.10_ and _Section 1.11_) will be
converted automatically into the right to receive 0.29 of a fully paid and
nonassessable share (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of the Common Stock, par value
$0.01 per share (the " _Parent Common Stock_ "), of Parent (the "
_Merger Consideration_ ").

     

   

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such
Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid
in consideration therefor upon surrender of such certificate in accordance
with _Section 1.12_ hereof, without interest.

  

 **1.7 ****_Cancellation_** ** _of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_**.
Each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company, if
any, and each share of Company Common Stock, if any, owned by Parent or
Merger Sub, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no payment or
distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

  

 **1.8 _Stock Options_.**

  

(a) At the Effective Time, all Outstanding Stock Options (as defined herein)
(other than Outstanding Stock Options cancelled or exercised prior to the
Effective Time) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent in accordance with _Section
5.5_.

  

(b) The Company and its Board of Directors shall promptly take all actions
reasonably necessary to ensure that following the Effective Time no holder of
any options or other rights pursuant to, nor any participant in or party to,
the Option Plans (as defined herein) or any other Company Employee Plan (as
defined herein) or other plan, program, arrangement, agreement or other
commitment providing for the issuance or grant of any interest in respect of
the capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary (as defined herein) of the
Company will have any rights thereunder to acquire equity securities, or any
right to payment in respect of the equity securities, of Parent, the Company
or the Surviving Corporation, or any of their Subsidiaries, except as
provided herein.

  

 **1.9 _Capital _** ** _Stock_** ** _of Merger Sub_**.  Each share of Common
Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common
Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be automatically converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall
thereafter constitute all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing
ownership of any shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall continue to evidence
ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

 **1.10 ****_Adjustments_** ** _to Exchange Ratio_**. Without limiting any
other provision of this Agreement, the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately
adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement if there is any stock split, reverse
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Parent
Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof
and prior to the Effective Time.

     

   

 **1.11 ****_Fractional_** ** _Shares_**. No certificates or scrip
representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in
connection with the Merger, and such fractional interests will not entitle
the owner thereof to any rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu thereof,
each holder of shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to _Section
1.6_ or of options exchanged pursuant to _Section 1.8(b)_ who would otherwise
be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after
aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to have been
otherwise received by such holder) shall receive from Parent an amount of
cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent and without interest) equal to the
product of such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied
by the average closing price per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded to the
nearest cent) on the OTC Bulletin Board for the 20 trading days ending on the
trading day immediately prior to (and excluding the date of) the Effective
Time.

  

 **1.12 ****_Surrender_** ** _of Certificates_**.

  

(a) **_Exchange Agent_.** Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act
as the Exchange Agent (as defined herein) in the Merger.

  

(b) **_Deposit of Common Stock and Cash_**.  Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent for exchange in
accordance with this _Article I_ , sufficient shares of Parent Common Stock
to be exchanged pursuant to _Section 1.6_. In addition, Parent shall deposit
with the Exchange Agent an amount in cash sufficient to make the payments in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 1.11_.

  

(c) **_Exchange Procedures_**. Promptly after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates (collectively, the " _Certificates_ ") that
represented immediately prior to the Effective Time outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock to be exchanged pursuant to _Section 1.6_ , a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree prior to
Closing) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent
Common Stock. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing the
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock and payment in lieu of
fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Sections 1.6_ and _1.11_ , after giving effect to any required (as defined
herein) Tax withholdings, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be canceled. At any time following six months after the Effective Time, all
or any number of shares of Parent Common Stock (and any or all cash payable
in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock) deposited with the
Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 1.12(b)_ , which remain undistributed to
the holders of the Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock,
shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and thereafter such holders of
unexchanged shares of Company Common Stock shall be entitled to look only to
Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for
payment

     

   

of their claim for shares of Parent Common Stock and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares, and any dividends or distributions made thereon pursuant
to _Section 1.12(d)_.

  

(d) **_Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_**. No dividends or
other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to
shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time
will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to
the whole shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the holder
of record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject
to applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall
be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares
of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the
time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time and payable between the Effective Time
and the time of such surrender with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock. For purposes of dividends or distributions in respect of
Parent Common Stock, all shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant
to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends or distributions pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence as if issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time.

  

(e) **_Transfers of Ownership_**. If any certificate for shares of Parent
Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than the name in which the
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a
condition of the issuance thereof that (i) the Certificate so surrendered
will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the Person (as defined herein) requesting such exchange will have paid any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate
for shares of Parent Common Stock in a name other than the name of the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or (ii) established to
the reasonable satisfaction of Parent, or any agent designated by Parent,
that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

  

(f) **_No Liability_**.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, none of the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable to a holder of a Certificate for any
Parent Common Stock (and any cash payable for fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock or any other amount due, if any) that was properly delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

  

(g) **_Withholding of Tax_**. Parent or the Exchange Agent will be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Person such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld by Parent or the
Exchange Agent, such deducted or withheld amounts will be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
whom such deduction and withholding were made by Parent or the Exchange
Agent.

  

 **1.13 _Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_**. All shares of
Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Company Common
Stock in accordance with the terms of this _Article I_ (together with any
cash paid for any fractional share

     

   

of Parent Common Stock) shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock.  At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of
Company Common Stock on the records of the Surviving Corporation. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates evidencing ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding shall cease to have any rights
with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except as otherwise
provided for herein. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this _Article I_.

  

 **1.14 _Closing_**. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement abandoned pursuant to the
provisions of _Article VII_, and subject to the provisions of _Article VI_ ,
the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m.
(New York time) on the third Business Day (the " _Closing Date_ ") following
the satisfaction (or waiver in accordance with _Section 7.5_ , to the extent
the same may be waived) of the conditions to the Closing set forth in
_Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing).  The Closing shall take place at the offices of
Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York or
such other place as the parties hereto otherwise agree.

  

 **1.15 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_**. In the event any
Certificates evidencing Company Common Stock shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the holder thereof, such shares of Parent Common Stock and cash for
fractional shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to _Section 1.11_ ;
_provided_ , ___however_ _,_ that Parent may, in its reasonable discretion and
as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it
may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged
to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  

 **1.16 _Tax Consequences_**.  For federal income tax purposes, the parties
intend that the Merger be treated as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement shall be, and is hereby,
adopted as a plan of reorganization for purposes of Section 368 of the Code.
The parties shall not take a position on any Tax Return (as defined herein)
inconsistent with this _Section 1.16_.

  

 **ARTICLE II 
  
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

  

The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as
follows:

  

 **2.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_.**

  

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good

authority,

     

   

and is in possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses,
permits, easements, consents, waivers, qualifications, certificates, Orders
(as defined herein) and approvals (collectively, " _Approvals_ ") necessary
to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it
is now being conducted, except for such Approvals, the failure of the Company
to be in possession of would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined
herein).  The Company is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation
to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where (i)
the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature
of its activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary and (ii)
the Company markets, sells, installs or services alarm systems, or provides
alarm monitoring services and such marketing, selling, installing, servicing
or provision of services makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except, in each case, where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in
good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

(b) Except as set forth in Section 2.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
each Subsidiary of the Company is a legal entity, duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction
of incorporation or organization and has all the requisite power and
authority, and is in possession of all Approvals necessary to own, lease and
operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each such Subsidiary is
duly qualified or licensed as a foreign entity to do business, and is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction where (i) the character of the properties
owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification or licensing necessary and (ii) such Subsidiary markets, sells,
installs or services alarm systems, or provides alarm monitoring services and
such marketing, selling, installing, servicing or provision of services makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, except, in each case, where the
failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

  

(c) _Section 2.1(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the
date hereof, a true and complete list of all of the Companys directly and
indirectly owned Subsidiaries, together with the jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization of each such Subsidiary and the percentage of
each such Subsidiarys outstanding capital stock or other equity or other
interest owned by the Company or another Subsidiary of the Company. Except as

existing and in good standing under Delaware Law. Parent has all the
requisite corporate power and authority, and is in possession of all
Approvals necessary to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on

Effect (as defined herein). Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified

in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or
in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Merger Sub is a newly-
formed single purpose entity which has been formed solely for the purposes of
the Merger

   

29   

 

  

and has not and will not carry on any business or engage in any activities
other than those reasonably related to the Merger.

existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction
of incorporation or organization and has all the requisite power and
authority, and is in possession of all Approvals necessary to own, lease and
operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in
_Section 3.1(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, each such Subsidiary is
duly qualified or licensed as a foreign entity to do business, and is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned,

the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

  

(c) _Section 3.1(c)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of
the date hereof, a true and complete list of all of Parents directly
and indirectly owned Subsidiaries, together with the jurisdiction of

each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other party or parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, and by the Related Agreements. Each of the Company and Parent shall
use its reasonable best efforts to (i) as promptly as practicable, obtain all
Approvals (including those referred to in _Sections 2.6(a)_ and _2.6(b)_ of
this Agreement and _Sections 2.6(a)_ and _2.6(b)_  of the Company Disclosure
Schedule), and the Company and Parent shall make all filings under applicable
Law required in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company and Parent and the consummation by them of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger (in
connection with which Parent and the Company will cooperate with each other
in connection with the making of all such filings, including providing copies
of all such documents to the non-filing party and its advisors prior to
filings and, if requested, will consider all reasonable additions, deletions
or changes suggested in connection therewith); (ii) furnish all information
required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to the DGCL
or any other applicable Law (including all information required to be
included in the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement) in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Related
Agreements; and (iii) lift, rescind or mitigate the effects of any injunction
or other Order adversely affecting the ability of any party hereto to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and to prevent,
with respect to any threatened or such injunction or other Order,
the issuance or entry thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither
Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be under any obligation to (x) make
proposals, execute or carry out agreements or submit to Orders providing for
the sale or other disposition or holding separate (through the establishment
of a trust or otherwise) of any assets or categories of assets of Parent, any
of its Affiliates, including its Subsidiaries, the Company or the holding
separate of the Company Common Stock or imposing or seeking to impose any
limitation on the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates, including its
Subsidiaries, to conduct their business or own such assets or to acquire,
hold or exercise full rights of ownership of Company Common Stock, in each
case except as would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the assets and liabilities (taken together), financial condition or
business of Parent and its Subsidiaries and the Company and its Subsidiaries
on a combined basis, or (y) otherwise take any step to avoid or eliminate any
impediment which may be asserted under any Law governing competition,
monopolies or restrictive trade practices which would reasonably be expected
to have a material adverse effect on the assets and liabilities (taken
together), financial condition or business of Parent and its Affiliates and
the Company and its Subsidiaries on a combined basis. Neither party
hereto will knowingly take any action which results in any of the
representations or

     

   

warranties made by such party pursuant to _Articles II_ or _III_ , as the
case may be, becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect.

  

(b) The parties hereto shall use their reasonable best efforts to satisfy or
cause to be satisfied all of the conditions precedent that are set forth in
_Article VI_ , as applicable to each of them, and to cause the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated. Each party hereto, at the
reasonable request of another party hereto, shall execute and deliver such
other instruments in a form reasonably satisfactory to the requesting party
and do and perform such other acts and things as may be reasonably necessary
or desirable for effecting completely the consummation of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

(c) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with one another:

  

(i) in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement and the
Proxy Statement;

  

(ii) in connection with the preparation of any filing required by the HSR Act
or any Foreign Competition Laws;

  

(iii) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with,
any Governmental Authority or other third party, is required, or any
Approvals are required to be obtained from parties in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;

  

(iv) in seeking any Approvals or making any filings, including furnishing
information required in connection therewith or with the Registration
Statement or the Proxy Statement, and seeking timely to obtain any such
Approvals, or making any filings; and

  

(v) in connection with the listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market (as defined
herein) of the Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger and shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Outstanding Stock Options
pursuant to _Section 5.5_.

  

 **5.5** ** ****_Stock Options and Stock Plan; Options._**

  

(a) At the Effective Time, each Outstanding Stock Option (other than
Outstanding Stock Options cancelled or exercised prior to the Effective
Time), whether vested or unvested, will be assumed by Parent. Each such
Outstanding Stock Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement
shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set
forth in, to the extent applicable, the Option Plans, option agreements
thereunder and other relevant documentation immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that such Outstanding Stock Option will be exercisable
solely for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were purchasable
under such Outstanding Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock, and the per-share exercise price for the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable

     

   

upon exercise of such assumed Outstanding Stock Option will be equal to the
quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock at which such Outstanding Stock Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding
the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole cent.

  

(b) Parent shall reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent
Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Outstanding Stock Options assumed
by Parent under this Agreement. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall file with the SEC a registration statement on an
appropriate form or a post-effective amendment to a previously filed
registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the Parent
Common Stock issuable pursuant to exercise of any Outstanding Stock Options
(other than Outstanding Stock Options cancelled or exercised prior to the
Effective Time) and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the
current status of the prospectus contained therein, as well as comply with
any applicable Blue Sky Laws, until the earlier of (i) the date that all
Outstanding Stock Options (other than Outstanding Stock Options cancelled or
exercised prior to the Effective Time) have expired or been exercised and
(ii) the date the Parent Common Stock ceases to be registered under the
Exchange Act.

  

(c) Except as set forth in _Section 5.5(c)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the vesting of each Outstanding Stock Option shall not accelerate
as a result of, or in connection with, the transactions contemplated hereby.
In addition, the Company shall ensure that no discretion is exercised by the
Board of Directors or any committee thereof or any other body or Person so as
to cause the vesting of any Outstanding Stock Option to accelerate.

  

 **5.6** ** ****_Employee Benefits._**

  

(a) Parent agrees that individuals who are employed by the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
remain employees of the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries at
the Effective Time (each such employee, a " _Company Employee_ "); _provided_
, _however_ , that this _Section 5.6(a)_ shall not be construed to limit
the ability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate the
employment of any Company Employee at any time.

  

(b) After the Effective Time and on a schedule determined by Parent in
connection with its integration of its business with that of the Company, the
Company Employees shall be eligible to participate in the employee benefit
plans, programs, policies and arrangement of Parent or its Affiliates (the "
_Parent Plans_ ") to the same extent as any similarly situated and
geographically located employee of Parent. For the period beginning at the
Effective Time and ending at the time the Company Employees become eligible
to participate in a Parent Plan, the Company Employees shall continue to be
covered by the applicable corresponding Company Employee Plan or will be
provided with employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the benefits provided by the corresponding Company Employee Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time.  If the 401(k) Plan is terminated
prior to the Effective Time in accordance with the provisions of _Section
5.6(c)_ , Parent shall make available to the Company Employees, as promptly
as practicable after the Effective Time, participation in a 401(k) Plan of
Parent or its Affiliates. The Company Employees will be allowed credit for
their service with the Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes of (i)
vesting

   

57   

 

  

and participation only (and not for entitlement or benefit accrual purposes,
except with respect to vacation and severance), and (ii) satisfying any
waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or the application of
any pre-existing condition limitations, with respect to the applicable Parent
Plans and shall be given credit for amounts paid under a corresponding
Company Employee Plan during the same period for purposes of applying
deductibles, copayments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had
been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable
Parent Plans.

  

(c) If requested by Parent in writing prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall cause to be adopted prior to the Effective Time resolutions of
the Companys Board of Directors to cease all contributions to the Companys
401(k) Plan (the " _401(k) Plan_ "), and to terminate the 401(k) Plan,
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Such resolutions shall provide that
all participants shall be fully vested in their account balances under the
401(k) Plan. Such resolutions shall also authorize distributions of 401(k)
Plan balances to participants (to the extent permitted under Section 401(k)
(10) of the Code) as soon as practicable following the Companys receipt from
the IRS of a favorable determination letter regarding the tax-qualified
status of the 401(k) Plan following its termination. The Company shall
deliver to parent an executed copy of such resolutions as soon as practicable
following their adoption by Companys Board of Directors and shall fully
comply with such resolutions.

  

(d) It is understood and agreed between the parties that all provisions
contained in this Agreement with respect to employee benefit plans or
employee compensation are included for the sole benefit of the respective
parties hereto and do not and shall not create any right in any other person,
including, but not limited to, any Company Employee, any participant in any
benefit or compensation plan or any beneficiary thereof.

  

 **5.7** ** ****_Notification of Certain Matters_** **.**

  

(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any
event the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of which results in any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect (or, in the case of any representation or
warranty qualified by its terms by materiality, Company Material Adverse
Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, then untrue or inaccurate in any
respect) and any failure of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case
may be, to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section 5.7_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

  

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall give prompt notice to the other of
(i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
Approval of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger
or the Related Agreements, (ii) any notice or other communication from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger or the Related
Agreements, (iii) any Litigation, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries that relates to the Merger or the Related Agreements; (iv) the
occurrence of a default or event that, with notice or lapse of time or both,
will become a default under any Company Material Agreement,

     

   

to the extent known by the Company; and (v) any change that would reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

  

(c) Each of the Company and Parent shall give (or shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third Persons, and use, and
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, its reasonable best efforts to
obtain any consents from third Persons (i) necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) otherwise
required under any Contracts in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, for which Parent and Company agree consent
should be sought or (iii) required to prevent a Company Material Adverse
Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect from occurring.  If any party shall
fail to obtain any such consent from a third Person, such party shall use its
reasonable best efforts, and will take any such actions reasonably requested
by the other parties, to limit the adverse effect upon the Company and
Parent, their respective Subsidiaries, and their respective businesses
resulting, or which would result after the Effective Time, from the failure
to obtain such consent.

  

 **5.8** ** ****_Listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market_**. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Parent Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger and pursuant to the Outstanding Stock Options assumed by Parent under
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 5.5_ to be approved for listing on the
Nasdaq Stock Market, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the
Effective Time.

  

 **5.9** ** ****_Public Announcements_**.  Parent and the Company shall
consult with and obtain the approval of the other party before issuing any
press release or other public announcement with respect to the Merger or this
Agreement and shall not issue any such press release prior to such
consultation and approval, except as may be required by Law or any listing
agreement related to the trading of the shares of either party on any
national securities exchange or national automated quotation system, in which
case the party proposing to issue such press release or make such public
announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult in good faith
with the other party before issuing any such press release or making any such
public announcement.

  

 **5.10** ** ****_Takeover Laws_**.  If any form of anti-takeover Law or
charter provision is or shall become applicable to the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby or by the Related Agreements, the Company
and the Board of Directors of the Company shall grant such Approvals and take
such actions as are necessary under such Laws and provisions so that the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise act
to eliminate or minimize the effects of such Law or provision on the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

  

 **5.11** ** ****_Accountant s Letters_**.

  

(a) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be
delivered to Parent, in accordance with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPs internal
guidelines, a "comfort" letter of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, dated a date
within two Business Days before the date on which the Registration Statement
shall become effective and addressed to Parent and the Company, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory and customary in scope and

     

   

substance for letters delivered by independent public accountants in
connection with registration statements similar to the Registration
Statement.

  

(b) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to
the Company, in accordance with Deloitte and Touche LLPs internal guidelines,
a "comfort" letter of Deloitte and Touche LLP dated a date within two Business
Days before the date on which the Registration Statement shall become
effective and addressed to Parent and the Company, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory and customary in scope and substance for letters
delivered by independent public accountants in connection with registration
statements similar to the Registration Statement.

  

 **5.12** ** ****_Indemnification; Directors and Officer Insurance_** **.**

  

(a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless, to the greatest
extent permitted by Law as of the date of this Agreement, the individuals who
on or prior to the Effective Time were officers, directors and/or employees
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to all acts or
omissions by them in their capacities as such or taken at the request of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries at any time at or prior to the Effective
Time. All rights to indemnification, advancement of Litigation expenses and
limitation of personal liability existing in favor of the directors and
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the provisions existing on
the date hereof in their respective certificates of incorporation, bylaws or
similar organizational documents, as well as related director indemnification
agreements in accordance with their terms in existence on the date hereof,
shall, with respect to any matter existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement),
survive the Effective Time for a period of not less than six years, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all such obligations.

  

(b) Parent shall cause to be maintained for a period of six years from the
Effective Time the Companys current directors and officers insurance policy
(the " _Company s DandO Insurance_") to the extent that it provides coverage
for events occurring prior to the Effective Time for all Persons who are
directors and officers of the Company on the date of this Agreement, so long
as the annual premium therefor would not be in excess of 250% of the last
annual premium paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the date of
this Agreement (such amount, the " _Maximum Premium_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the annual premium for such insurance shall exceed 250%
of the last annual premium paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
date hereof for such insurance, Parent shall provide only such coverage as
shall then be available at an annual premium equal to 250% of such rate. Upon
request by Parent and at Parents sole expense, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to extend coverage under the Companys DandO Insurance
by obtaining a six-year "tail" policy and such "tail" policy shall satisfy
Parents obligations under this _Section 5.12(b)_. Parents obligations
under the first sentence of this _Section 5.12(b)_ shall also be satisfied
if Parents directors and officers insurance policy provides (or is amended
to provide), for a period of six years after the Effective Time,
substantially similar coverage for acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time for Persons who are directors and officers of the Company on
the date of this Agreement. If the Companys DandO Insurance expires, is
terminated or is canceled during the six-year period set forth above or a
"tail" policy cannot be purchased on the terms set

     

   

forth above and Parent cannot satisfy its obligations under this _Section
5.12(b)_  pursuant to the preceding sentence, Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause to be obtained as much directors and officers insurance
as can be obtained for the remainder of such period for an annualized premium
not in excess of the Maximum Premium, on terms and conditions no less
advantageous than the Companys DandO Insurance, and Parent shall be liable for
the difference between such coverage obtained and the coverage otherwise
required by this _Section 5.12(b)_. The Company represents to Parent that
the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement is not
greater than $600,000.

  

(c) The provisions of this _Section 5.12_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Person entitled to indemnification
hereunder and the heirs and representatives of such Person.

  

 **5.13** ** ****_Affiliates_** **. **No less than 45 days prior to the
Effective Time, the Company (a) shall deliver to Parent a letter identifying
all Persons who, in the Companys opinion, may be, as of the Effective Time,
its "affiliates" for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act, and (b)
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each Person who is identified
as an "affiliate" of it in such letter to deliver to Parent, as soon as
practicable, and in any event prior to the date of the Company Stockholders
Meeting, a written agreement, substantially in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit D_, relating to required transfer restrictions on the Parent Common
Stock received by them in the Merger pursuant to Rule 145.  The Company
shall notify Parent from time to time after the delivery of the letter
described above of any Person not identified in such letter who then is, or
may be, such an "affiliate" and use its reasonable best efforts to cause each
additional Person who is identified as an "affiliate" to execute such written
agreement.

  

 **5.14** ** ****_Parent Board of Directors_** **.  **Parent shall take all
requisite action so that, immediately following the Effective Time, Raymond
C. Kubacki and Arlene M. Yocum, each of whom is designated by the Company to
serve as members on Parents board of directors (the " _New Directors_ "),
shall become members of the board of directors of Parent (the " _Parent
Board_ "). In the event that any Person designated in the preceding sentence
is unable or unwilling to serve as a director on the Parent Board, the
Company shall have the right to designate a Qualified Person as a
replacement. A " _Qualified Person_ " means a person that the Parent Board
reasonably determines in good faith, after customary investigation of such
Persons qualifications, is qualified and acceptable to be a member of the
Parent Board under standards applied fairly and equally to all nominees.
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the New Directors to
be nominated and elected or appointed, and as necessary, re-nominated
and reelected or reappointed as members of the Parent Board for a period of
not less than two years from and after the Effective Time. In the event a New
Director elects not to serve in such capacity, is incapable of serving in
such capacity or is removed from the Parent Board for cause, the remaining
New Director may designate another Qualified Person as a replacement.  The
Company agrees that each such Person designated to become a New Director will
satisfy all applicable standards for independence and financial literacy for
audit committee members under the applicable rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market
as of the Effective Time.

     

   

 **5.15** ** ****_Section 16 Matters._**

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Companys Board of Directors, or an
appropriate committee of non-employee directors of the Company, shall, if
necessary, adopt a resolution consistent with the SECs interpretive guidance
to approve the disposition by any officer or director who is a "covered
person" of the Company for the purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act of
Company Common Stock or Outstanding Stock Options pursuant to this Agreement
and the Merger for the purposes of qualifying the disposition as an exempt
transaction under Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parents Board of Directors, or an
appropriate committee of non-employee directors of Parent, shall, if
necessary, adopt a resolution consistent with the SECs interpretive guidance
to approve the acquisition by any officer or director of the Company who will
become a "covered person" of Parent for the purposes of Section 16 of the
Exchange Act of Parent Common Stock or Parent Stock Options pursuant to this
Agreement and the Merger for the purposes of qualifying the acquisition as an
exempt transaction under Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

  

 **5.16** ** ****_Resale Registration_**.  Promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent shall file, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
to be declared effective as soon as practicable thereafter, a post-effective
amendment on Form S-3 to the Registration Statement (the " _S-3 Amendment_ ")
registering for resale the shares of Parent Common Stock received in the
Merger by each affiliate (within the meaning of Rule 145(c) of the Securities
Act) of the Company that is unable to sell all such shares held by such
affiliate in full pursuant to Rule 145(d)(1) of the Securities Act. Parent
shall keep the S-3 Amendment effective until the earlier of (i) the date of
final sale by each such affiliate of all shares of Parent Common Stock
registered on the S-3 Amendment and (ii) the date each such affiliate is able
to sell all remaining shares registered on the S-3 Amendment pursuant to Rule
145(d) (without being subject to volume limitations). Parent agrees
to indemnify and hold harmless each such affiliate for material misstatements
and omissions contained in the S-3 Amendment and any prospectus filed in
connection therewith pursuant to customary terms for resale registration
statements of this type, but excluding any information specifically provided
in writing by such affiliate to Parent for inclusion therein.

  

 **5.17** ** ****_Credit Agreement Amendment_**. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the amendment described on _Section 5.17_
of the Parent Disclosure Schedule (the " _Credit Agreement Amendment_ ")
under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of April 26, 2006,
by and among Parent, Protection One Alarm Monitoring, Inc., as borrower, the
several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time
parties thereto, Bear, Stearns and Co. Inc., as sole lead arranger and sole
bookrunner, Bear Stearns and Co. Inc. and Lehman Brothers Inc., as initial
joint lead arrangers and initial joint bookrunners, Lasalle Bank National
Association, as syndication agent, Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., as initial
syndication agent, Harris Nesbitt Financing, Inc., LaSalle Bank National
Association and U.S. Bank National Association, as co-documentation agents,
and Bear Stearns Corporate Lending Inc., as administrative agent.

  

 **5.18** ** ****_Company Internal Restructuring_**. The Company and Parent
shall each use reasonable efforts to cooperate with one another and agree
upon actions to be taken by the Company prior to the Effective Time with
respect to internal restructuring of certain of its Subsidiaries, and the
Company shall use reasonable efforts to effectuate any actions so agreed
upon; _provided_ , _however_ , that such actions shall not result in material
costs and expenses to the Company without the Companys prior written
consent.
