         3.5      CLOSING DATE BALANCE SHEET.

                  (a)      Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date,
Sellers shall prepare and deliver, or cause to be prepared and delivered, to
Buyer the balance sheet for the Company as of the close of business on the
Closing Date (the "Closing Date Balance Sheet"), except that the amount of the
unfunded pension liability, if any, ("Unfunded Pension Liability") under the
Plastic Trim, Inc. Hourly Pension Plan ("PTI Pension Plan") shall be determined
as of April 30, 2003. The Closing Date Balance Sheet shall set forth the
consolidated Net Working Capital (as defined below) of the Sellers, and shall be
prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP") used in the preparation of the Historic Financial Statements
(as defined in Section 5.6) of the Sellers, consistently applied, provided that
the amount of the Unfunded Pension Liability as of April 30, 2003 shall be
reasonably determined by the Company actuary using generally accepted actuarial
principles and practices consistent with the requirements of the governing plan
document, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and ERISA (as herein
defined) and consistent with those used in determining the unfunded pension
liability for Sellers' financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2002. For purpose of this Agreement, Net Working Capital shall be defined as set
forth on Schedule 3.5." Buyer shall permit representatives of Sellers that are
employed by Buyer to be reasonably available to Seller to assist Seller in the
preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet.

                  (b)      Unless the Buyer within 20 days after receipt of the
Closing Date Balance Sheet gives the Sellers a notice objecting thereto and
specifying the basis for such objection and the amount in dispute ("Notice of
Objection"), such Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be considered accepted and
binding upon the Sellers and Buyer. Sellers shall make available to Buyer during
such 20 day period, at Buyer's written request, the working papers utilized by
Sellers in preparing the Closing Date Balance Sheet. If within 20 days after the
receipt of the Closing Date Balance Sheet, Buyer gives a Notice of Objection to
the Sellers, the Sellers and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith with a view to
resolving any differences. If such negotiations fail to resolve all disputed
items within 15 days after Notice of Objection was first given by Buyer, the
remaining disputed items shall be submitted to Deloitte & Touche or, if such
accounting firm cannot serve for any reason, another recognized accounting firm
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and Sellers (the "Nonpartisan Accountants") for
final resolution. After affording the Buyer and its representatives and the
Sellers and their representatives the opportunity to present their positions as
to the disputed items (which opportunity shall not extend for more than 30
days), the Nonpartisan Accountants shall resolve all disputed items in writing
in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Such resolution
shall be final and binding upon the parties and shall be reflected in any
necessary revisions to the Closing Date Balance Sheet. The fees, costs and
expenses of the Nonpartisan Accountants in connection with any such
determination shall be divided evenly between the Sellers and Buyer. Otherwise,
the Sellers and Buyer shall each pay its costs in connection with this Section,
including the fees and expenses of their respective attorneys and accountants,
if any.

         3.6      POST-CLOSING ADJUSTMENT.

                  (a)      If the Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date as
conclusively determined as provided in Section 3.5 (such conclusive
determination is referred to herein as "Certified Net Working Capital"), is less
than $6,180,000, then Sellers cause the amount of such deficiency to be paid to
Buyer out of the Purchase Price Escrow Amount. The parties acknowledge that
$700,000 was used as the Unfunded Pension Liability amount in computing the Net
Working Capital base amount of $6,180,000 for purposes of this Section as Buyer
is assuming that amount of Unfunded Pension Liability as of the Closing. The
Unfunded Pension Liability is reflected in accounts 11002230 and 11002231 on
Schedule 3.5. In the event that the Purchase Price Escrow Amount is less than
the amount of the adjustment, if any, payable to Buyer under this Section
3.6(a), Sellers shall pay or cause to be paid, to Buyer the amount of such
deficiency. The positive remainder, if any, of (i) the Purchase Price Escrow
Amount plus any net accrued interest earned on the Purchase Price Escrow Amount,
less (ii) the amount of the adjustment, if any paid to Buyer out of the Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow under this Section 3.6(a), shall be paid to Sellers. In
the event that no amount is payable to Buyer under this Section 3.6(a), then the
entire Purchase Price Escrow Amount, plus all net accrued interest earned
thereon, shall be paid to Sellers. If the Certified Net Working Capital is
greater than $6,180,000, then Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Sellers
the amount of such excess. Any payment pursuant to this Section 3.6(a) shall be
made within five (5) business days following the determination of Certified Net
Working Capital (such fifth business day, the "Due Date"). Any payment not made
by the Due Date therefor shall bear interest from the Due Date at the rate of
six percent (6%) per annum. Any amount payable to Buyer under this Section
3.6(a) shall be paid, first, out of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow. Buyer
and Sellers shall give instructions to the escrow agent consistent with the
provisions of this paragraph.

                  (b)      Payments made pursuant to this Section 3.6 shall be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
the party receiving such payment.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                             COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE

         For a period of one year following the Closing, Sellers shall not
engage in the business of manufacturing or distributing plastic trim side
moldings in the United States or Canada to original equipment manufacturers of
motor vehicles.

reasonably be expected to cause an Encumbrance to be imposed on the Purchased
Assets. There are no unsatisfied judgments, penalties or awards against or

         7.3      COOPERATION AND BEST EFFORTS. Each party hereto agrees to
cooperate with the others in the performance of all obligations under this
Agreement and to use its reasonable best efforts to fulfill its obligations
under this Agreement, and to satisfy or cause to be satisfied, at or before the

         7.4      EMPLOYEE ARRANGEMENTS.

                  (a)      Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall offer
employment with Buyer to all of the employees of the Company except that Buyer
may refuse to offer employment to the Terminated Employees. A list of Company's
employees, their titles, full or part time status and compensation method (i.e.
salaried, hourly union or hourly non-union) as of the date hereof is set forth
on Schedule 7.4(a). The Company shall provide Buyer with an updated Schedule
7.4(a) at the Closing which shall reflect all changes in such employees that
occur between the date hereof and the Closing. Any offer of employment to such
employees by Buyer shall, subject to Section 8.2, not be construed to limit the
ability of Buyer to terminate any such employee at any time for any reason.
Except as otherwise expressly contemplated by this Section 7.4, and except with
respect to annual or hourly compensation, all such offers of employment pursuant
to this Section 7.4(a) shall be for employment on terms and conditions
(including severance) which, taken in the aggregate, are substantially
comparable to the terms and conditions of employment currently in effect for
such employees. Each such employee who accepts, as of the Closing Date, such
offer of employment shall hereinafter be referred to as a "Transferred
Employee."

                  (b)      (i) This subsection (i) shall apply to non-tax
qualified employee benefit plans. On and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
provide the Transferred Employees with substantially similar employee benefits,
taken in the aggregate, as such employees were receiving as pre-Closing
employees of Company (the "Buyer's Employee Benefits"), and shall credit the
Transferred Employees for service with the Seller for purposes of eligibility
and vesting under all of the Buyer's Employee Benefits to the extent that such
service credit is applicable. No exclusions for pre-existing conditions shall
apply to any disability or medical benefit plan for which Transferred Employees
may otherwise be eligible. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Section 7.4, the Company, effective as of the Closing, shall give notice to all
Transferred Employees that no additional benefits shall accrue under the
Company's employee benefit plans and that the Transferred Employees will
commence participation in the Buyer's employee benefit plans.

                           (ii)     This subsection (ii) shall apply to
tax-qualified employee benefit plans. Company is the sponsor of the Plastic
Trim, Inc. Hourly Employees 401(k) Plan ("PTI's 401(k) Plan") and the PTI
Pension Plan. Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer and Company shall take
such actions as are necessary to cause Buyer to assume sponsorship of PTI's
401(k) Plan and PTI's Pension Plan, together with the related trusts. All PTI's
401(k) Plan and PTI's Pension Plan assets and liabilities shall be transferred
to Buyer in accordance with the requirements of applicable law.

                                    To the extent any Transferred Employee is
not a member of the

                                     - 20 -

<PAGE>

International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement
Workers of America, Local Union 888 and is a participant in the JPE, Inc. 401(k)
Savings Plan, Buyer shall allow any such Transferred Employee to "roll over"
such employee's vested account balance (including any outstanding loans in such
account) in the JPE, Inc. 401(k) Savings Plan to a tax qualified 401(k) plan to
be established by Buyer, in which such Transferred Employees shall be eligible
to participate ("Buyer's 401(k) Plan"). Buyer's 401(k) Plan shall provide
substantially similar benefits, and have substantially similar terms and
conditions, as the JPE, Inc. 401(k) Savings Plan. Buyer's 401(k) Plan shall
credit any such Transferred Employee for service with the Sellers for purposes
of eligibility and vesting. Buyer shall establish Buyer's 401(k) Plan as of the
Closing Date.

         7.5      EXCLUSIVE NEGOTIATION PROVISION. Until such time, if any, as
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article XII, Sellers will refrain from
negotiations with any potential buyer of all or substantially all of the stock
or assets of Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (A) a Seller receives an
unsolicited bona fide proposal in writing by any Person relating to a purchase
of all or substantially all of the stock or assets of a Seller ("Competing
Transaction"), (B) the Board of Directors of JPE, after duly considering the
advice of outside legal counsel to JPE, determines in good faith that the
failure to negotiate with or enter into a letter of intent or other transaction
agreement with such a Person regarding a Competing Transaction would be
reasonably likely to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to stockholders
imposed by applicable Law, (C) JPE notifies Buyer in writing that it intends to
take such action, (D) in the event that JPE proposes to enter into a transaction
agreement with respect to such Competing Transaction, JPE attaches the most
current version of such agreement to such notice, and (E) Buyer does not make,
within 96 hours of receipt of JPE's written notification of its intention to
take such action, a written offer that is at least as favorable, from a
financial point of view (after considering all of the terms of such Competing
Transaction) to the stockholders of JPE as such Competing Transaction, as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of JPE after duly considering
the advice of JPE's investment bankers, JPE may terminate this Agreement upon
written notice to Buyer and payment to Buyer of a breakup fee equal to $437,500
plus actual documented out of pocket expenses of up to $150,000. Upon such
termination, neither the Sellers on the one hand nor the Buyer on the other hand
shall have any further right or obligation to the other (under Article XII
hereof or otherwise), except that Buyer shall continue to be bound by the
non-disclosure terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

all books and records of the Sellers included in the Purchased Assets, and to
provide Shareholder or its agents reasonable access to such books and records

Damages. A claim relating to indemnification arising out of a breach of the
Surviving Representations or out of a breach by Sellers of a covenant or

or (iii) above may be made at any time before the expiration of the statute of

                  (a)      The remedy provided by this Section 13.1, subject to
the limitations set forth in this Article XIII, shall be Buyer's sole and
exclusive remedy for the recovery of any damages, losses, deficiencies,
liabilities, costs and expenses resulting from, relating to or arising out of
any (i) misrepresentation or breach of warranty made by or on behalf of the
Sellers in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by the Sellers
pursuant hereto, (ii) non-fulfillment of any agreement or covenant on the part
of the Sellers or (iii) any other aspect of any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement.

                  (b)      Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, Seller
shall have no liability in respect of any claim for indemnification under this
Section 13.1:

                           (i)      if and to the extent that provision or
                                    reserve for or in respect of the liability
                                    or other matter giving rise to such claim
                                    has been made in the Closing Date Balance
                                    Sheet;

                           (ii)     if and to the extent that such claim arises
                                    or is increased as a result of any change in
                                    legislation that takes effect
                                    retrospectively;

                           (iii)    if and to the extent that such claim occurs
                                    or is increased as a result of any increase
                                    in the rate of taxation in force at the date
                                    hereof;

                           (iv)     if and to the extent that such claim is
                                    wholly or partly attributable to any
                                    voluntary act, omission, transaction or
                                    arrangement of Buyer from and after the
                                    Closing;

                           (v)      to the extent that Buyer is insured against
                                    any loss or damage suffered by it arising
                                    out of such breach or claim under the terms
                                    of any insurance policy; or

                           (vi)     to the extent that such claim relates to any
                                    matter disclosed in the Disclosure Statement
                                    or the Bring Down Letter.

         13.2     INDEMNIFICATION OF SELLER. From and after the Closing, Buyer
shall indemnify and hold harmless each of the Sellers from and against any and
all Damages arising after the Closing and actually suffered or incurred by a
Seller arising out of or as a result of (i) the inaccuracy of any representation
or warranty or the breach, nonfulfillment or nonperformance of any covenant or
agreement of Buyer under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or
(ii) the ownership or operation by Buyer of the Purchased Assets and the conduct
by Buyer of the business that had been conducted by Company, including, without
limitation, any liability arising under any Environmental, Health and Safety
Laws; or (iii) Sellers having made payments to Terminated Employees under
Section 3.3(f) that Buyer rehires within six months of Closing.

         13.3     INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES.

                  (a)      No party hereto shall be deemed to have breached any
representation, warranty, or covenant if (i) such party shall have notified the
other party hereto in writing, on or

                                     - 28 -

<PAGE>

prior to the Closing Date, of the breach of, or inaccuracy in, or of any facts
or circumstances constituting or resulting in the breach of, or inaccuracy in,
such representation, warranty or covenant and (ii) such other party has
permitted the Closing to occur, in which case such other party shall be deemed
to have waived such breach or inaccuracy.

                  (b)      In case any claim is made, or any suit or action is
commenced, by a third party against Buyer in respect of which indemnification
under Section 13.1 may be sought by it hereunder, or a Seller in respect of
which indemnification under Section 13.2 may be sought hereunder, the
indemnified party (the "Indemnitee") shall promptly give the indemnifying party
(the "Indemnifying Party") notice thereof and the Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled to control the defense thereof. The Indemnitee may (but need not)
retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at
the expense of the Indemnitee. The Indemnifying Party may at any time notify the
Indemnitee of its intention to settle or compromise any claim, suit or action
against the Indemnitee and provide the Indemnitee with the specifics of the
intended settlement or compromise, and the Indemnifying Party may settle or
compromise any such claim, suit or action unless the Indemnitee notifies the
Indemnifying Party in writing (within ten (10) business days after the
Indemnifying Party has given written notice of its intention to settle or
compromise) that the Indemnitee intends to conduct or to continue to conduct the
defense of such claim, suit or action. Unless the Indemnitee gives the notice
referred to in the foregoing sentence with respect to settlements or
compromises, any such settlement or compromise of, or (notwithstanding any
notice from the Indemnitee referred to in the foregoing sentence) any final
judgment or decree entered on or in respect of any claim, suit or action shall
be binding upon, the Indemnitee as fully as if the Indemnitee had assumed and
controlled the defense thereof and a final judgment or decree had been entered
in such suit or action, or with regard to such claim, by a court of competent
jurisdiction for the amount of such settlement, compromise, judgement or decree.
If the Indemnitee conducts or continues the conduct of the defense of any claim,
suit or action as aforesaid, it shall do so at its own cost and expense above
the terms of an intended settlement or compromise proposal by the Indemnifying
Party, holding the Indemnifying Party harmless from all costs, fees, expenses,
debts, liabilities and charges in connection with such defense.

                  (c)      If an Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified
hereunder other than in respect of a claim made or action commenced against
Buyer or a Seller as referred to in Section 13.3(b), the Indemnifying Party
shall be given written notice thereof promptly by the Indemnitee, which notice
shall specify the amount and nature of the amounts to be indemnified and include
the request of the Indemnitee for indemnification of such amount. The
Indemnifying Party shall within twenty (20) days pay to the Indemnitee the
amount so specified, or deliver to the Indemnitee written notice setting forth
in reasonable detail why Indemnifying Party is not obligated to pay such amount,
in which event the parties shall use good faith efforts to resolve any disputed
matters. Upon payment in full of any claim, the party making payment shall be
subrogated to the rights of the indemnified party against any Person with
respect to the subject matter of such claim.

         13.4     RECOVERY OF COSTS; LIMITATION OF DAMAGES. If any dispute
resolution, legal or equitable action is brought for the enforcement of this
Agreement, or because of an alleged dispute, breach, default, or
misrepresentation in connection with any of the provisions of this

                                     - 29 -

<PAGE>

Agreement, the successful or prevailing party or parties shall be entitled to
recover reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs incurred in that action, in
addition to any other relief to which it or they may be entitled. Under no
circumstances shall any party hereto be liable for any special, consequential,
indirect or punitive damages for any misrepresentation or breach of any
provision of, or any other matter arising pursuant to, this Agreement or any
Transaction Document. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Damages
shall be computed on an after-tax basis, and shall be net of any insurance
recoveries and any refunds, rebates and/or reductions of taxes resulting from
each item of Damages and/or the events giving rise thereto. In addition, under
no circumstances shall Damages include any losses, claims, liabilities, damages,
obligations, costs or expenses to the extent they affect or relate to any
business or operation of Buyer, including, without limitation, the financial
condition, prospects or operations thereof, other than the business of the
Company from and after the Closing.

         13.5     DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THE
SURVIVING REPRESENTATIONS, SELLERS ARE SELLING THE PURCHASED ASSETS (AND THE
BUSINESS REPRESENTED THEREBY) ON AN "AS IS, WHERE IS" BASIS AND DISCLAIMS ALL
OTHER WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS AND GUARANTEES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.
SELLERS MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR
ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NO IMPLIED WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER. Buyer acknowledges

any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of any memoranda, charts, forecasts or other forward looking
information, summaries or schedules heretofore made available to Buyer or any
other information which is not included in this Agreement or the Disclosure
Statement. Neither the Sellers nor their respective representatives or other
Persons will have or be subject to any liability to Buyer or any other Person
resulting from the distribution of any such information to, or use of any such
information by, Buyer or any of its agents, consultants, accountants, counsel or
other representatives.

                                  ARTICLE XIV

                                  MISCELLANEOUS
