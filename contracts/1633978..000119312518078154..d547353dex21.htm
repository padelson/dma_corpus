collectively as the " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as such holder
fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights
under Delaware Law with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into,
or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration but instead

accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (it being understood and acknowledged
that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the
right to receive the fair market value of such Dissenting Shares to the extent

right to appraisal, pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to
the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of Company Common

 Delaware Law that relates to such demand, and Parent shall have the
opportunity, at Parents expense, and right to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the
prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with
respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

 

(e) _Stock Adjustment_. If the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger (including all shares of
Parent Common Stock which may be issued after the Effective Time pursuant to
Company Compensatory Awards) would exceed nineteen and nine tenths percent
(19.9%) of the issued and outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Stock Threshold_ _"_ ), (A)
the Exchange Ratio shall be reduced to the minimum extent necessary (rounded
down to the nearest one thousandth) such that the aggregate number of shares
of Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger (including
all shares of Parent Common Stock which may be issued after the Effective Time
pursuant to Company Compensatory Awards) does not exceed the Stock Threshold
and (B) the Cash Consideration for all purposes under this Agreement will be
increased on a per share basis by an amount equal to $68.975 (the closing
price of Parent Common Stock on March 9, 2018), multiplied by the difference
between the initial Exchange Ratio and the Exchange Ratio as determined in
accordance with this Section __ _ 2.7(e)_ (rounded down to the nearest one-
hundredth of a cent).

 

(f) _Company Compensatory Awards_. At the Effective Time, each Company
Compensatory Award then outstanding under any of the Company Stock Plans

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment
agent for the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). The Exchange Agent shall also
act as the agent for the Companys shareholders for the purpose of receiving
and holding certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock (the "
_Certificates_ ") and uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (the "
_Uncertificated Shares_ ") and shall obtain no rights or interests in the
shares of Company Common Stock represented thereby. 

(b) _Exchange Fund_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit
(or cause to be deposited) with the Exchange Agent, for payment to the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article II_ , (i) evidence of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(a)_ in book-entry form sufficient to issue the aggregate
Stock Consideration, (ii) by transfer of immediately available funds, an
amount of cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration and (iii) by
transfer of immediately available funds, an amount of cash sufficient to pay
the aggregate Fractional Share Cash Amounts (such amount referenced in clauses
(ii) and (iii) together with the evidence of book-entry shares of Parent
Common Stock, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). In the event that the Exchange Fund
shall be insufficient to pay the aggregate amount of all Cash Consideration
and Fractional Share Cash Amounts, Parent shall promptly deposit additional
funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in
the amount required to make such payment. Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall make, delivery of the Cash
Consideration and Fractional Share cash Amount in accordance with this
Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not
expressly provided for in this Agreement. The Exchange Agent shall invest any

events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term

Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most
recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available),
and (B) no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to
holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this _Article
II_. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be
paid to Parent upon demand.

(c) _Payment Procedures_. As promptly as practicable following the Effective
Time, Parent and Merger Sub shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail within
three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time to each holder of record (as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of shares of Company Common Stock
(i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing customary
provisions (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares
to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to
the provisions of this _Article II_. Each holder of shares of Company Common
Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
(including the Fractional Share Cash Amount) in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share,
upon (x) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof), together with a duly completed and validly executed
letter of transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be requested
by the Exchange Agent, or (y) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange
Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated
Shares. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time
for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration (including
the Fractional Share Cash Amount) payable in respect thereof pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article II_. Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to
pay such Merger Consideration and Fractional Share Cash Amount within five (5)
Business Days following the later to occur of (x) the Effective Time or (y)
the Exchange Agents receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) or "agents message", and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu thereof) or Uncertificated Share so surrendered shall be forthwith
cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the
surrender or transfer of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share.

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is
to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be
a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such
Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other
similar Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid
or is not payable.

 

(e) _Treatment of Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions, if
any, with a record date after the Effective Time with respect to Parent
Common Stock, shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered share of
Company Common Stock to be converted into shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7(a)(i)_ until such holder shall surrender such
share in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.8_. After the surrender in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.8_ of a share of Company Common Stock
to be converted into Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.7(a)(i)_, Parent shall cause the holder thereof to be paid, without
interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time and theretofore paid with respect to such
shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
this Agreement and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such
surrender payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

 

(f) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under applicable Tax laws. To the extent that
such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts (i) shall be remitted
by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be, to the applicable Governmental Entity and (ii) shall be treated
for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to
whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that
remains unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares for one year after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent upon Parents demand, and any holder of
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares who has not theretofore complied with
this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving
Company (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws), as
general creditors thereof, for satisfaction of its claim for Merger
Consideration.

(h) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, none of the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving Company or
any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common
Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official if required by any
abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable Law. Any other provision of
this Agreement notwithstanding, any portion of the Merger Consideration or the
cash to be paid in accordance with this _Article II_ that
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates and Uncertificated
Shares immediately prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration or such
cash would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Entity, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property
of the Surviving Company, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto.

 

Section 2.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and
after the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to
exist, and each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Share theretofore
representing any shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting
Shares) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Merger Consideration (including the Fractional Share Cash
Amount) payable therefor upon the surrender thereof in accordance with the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.8_. The Merger Consideration paid in
accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Company of shares of
Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with
customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are
presented to the Surviving Company, Parent or the Exchange Agent for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as
provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this
_Article II_.

 

Section 2.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_;
_provided_ , _however_ , as a condition precedent to the payment of such
Merger Consideration, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the
Exchange Agent may require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to furnish a bond in form satisfactory to the Exchange Agent and
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving
Company or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed. The value of the bond of indemnity shall
be reasonably calculated by the Exchange Agent, based on the value of lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates.

 

Section 2.11 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time
after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Company
with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the
directors and officers of the Surviving Company shall take all such lawful and
necessary action on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub.

 

Section 2.12 _Tax Treatment_. The Merger is intended to constitute a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The
parties hereto intend the First Step Merger and the Second Step Merger to
constitute integrated steps in a single "plan of reorganization" within the
meaning of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3, which plan
of reorganization the parties adopt by executing this

 Agreement. Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement or as
otherwise required by Applicable Law, no party hereto shall take any action
that would cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

restrictions or actions would limit Parents or its Affiliates freedom of
action after the Effective Time with respect to such impacted asset, product
line, operation or business, respectively, of Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries in a respect that is material to such impacted
asset, product line, operation or business, respectively, of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries (it being understood that
an obligation to continue selling or supporting a product in any jurisdiction
shall not, in and of itself, be construed to be a material limitation), or (B)

Section 6.11 _Company Compensatory Awards_.

 

(a) _Company RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each Company RSU (or portion
thereof) that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Effective
Time (and does not vest as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby) shall, by virtue of the Merger, be assumed by Parent
(each, an " _Assumed RSU_ "). Each such Assumed RSU shall be subject
to substantially the same terms and conditions as applied to the related
Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the vesting
schedule applicable thereto, except that the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to each Assumed RSU shall be equal to the product of (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such unvested Company RSU
award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (with any performance
milestones deemed achieved based on maximum level of performance) multiplied
by (ii) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio (with the resulting number, rounded
down to the nearest whole share). Any Company RSU that is vested immediately
prior to the Effective Time (taking into account any acceleration of vesting
as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) but
as to which the underlying share of Company Common Stock has not been issued
by the Effective Time, will be issued as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and will be treated as outstanding Company Common Stock for
purposes of Section 2.7, and shall receive the Merger Consideration, subject
to applicable tax withholding. The applicable taxes required to be withheld
from the Merger Consideration shall reduce first the Cash Consideration
portion of the Merger Consideration with any remaining amount reducing the
Stock Consideration portion of Merger Consideration, with the value of the
stock portion for purposes of such deduction determined based on the Parent
Average Closing Price.

(b) _Company Restricted Stock_. At the Effective Time, each award of Company
Restricted Stock (or portion thereof) that is outstanding and unvested
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully vested at the
Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and be treated as a share of Company
Common Stock that shall be canceled and extinguished and automatically
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash and stock equal to the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_. The payment of Merger
Consideration pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.11(b)_ shall be reduced by
any applicable tax withholding required under the Code or any Applicable Law.
The applicable taxes required to be withheld from the Merger Consideration
shall reduce first the Cash Consideration portion of such amounts with any
remaining amount reducing the Stock Consideration portion of such amounts,
with the value of the stock portion for purposes of such deduction determined
based on the Parent Average Closing Price.

(c) _Company Options_.

 

(i) At the Effective Time and except as set forth in _Section_ __ _
6.11(c)(ii)_, each Company Option (or portion thereof) that is outstanding,
whether vested or unvested, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be assumed by Parent (each, an " _Assumed Option_ "). Each such Assumed
Option shall be subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as
applied to the related Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,
including the vesting schedule applicable thereto, except that (A) the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Assumed Option shall be
equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
underlying such unvested Assumed Option as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio (with
the resulting number

 



63 ##### Table of Contents

  

 rounded down to the nearest whole share), and (B) the per share exercise
price of each Assumed Option shall be equal to the quotient determined by
dividing (x) the exercise price per share at which such Assumed Option was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio (with the resulting price per share rounded up to the nearest
whole cent). Each Assumed Option that qualified as an incentive stock option
prior to the Effective Time shall continue to qualify as an incentive stock
option as defined in Section 422 of the Code following the Effective Time to
the extent permitted under Section 422 of the Code The assumption of Assumed
Options pursuant to this Section shall be effected in a manner that satisfies
the requirements of Sections 409A and 424(a) of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, and this  _Section_ __ _ 6.11(c)_ will
be construed consistent with this intent.

(ii) At the Effective Time, each Company Option (or portion thereof) that is
outstanding and vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (or vests
as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) and
held by a holder who is not an employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Cancelled Option_ ")
shall, by virtue of the Merger and at the direction of Parent (which is hereby
given pursuant to this Agreement), be cancelled and terminated and converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of each Net
Option Share covered by such Cancelled Option; _provided_ that, in lieu of the
Merger Consideration, any fractional Net Option Share (after aggregating all
shares represented by all Cancelled Options held by such individual) shall be
settled in cash based on the Cash Equivalent Consideration (such consideration
for each Net Option Share being hereinafter referred to as the " _Option
Consideration_ "). The holder of each Cancelled Option shall receive at the
Effective Time from the Company, or as soon as practicable thereafter (but in
no even later than the Companys first full payroll after the Effective Time)
from the Surviving Company, the Option Consideration. If the exercise price
per share of any such Cancelled Option is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration, such Company Option shall, by direction of Parent (which
is hereby given pursuant to this Agreement), be cancelled without any payment
being made in respect thereof. The payment of Option Consideration to the
holder of a Cancelled Option shall be reduced by any applicable tax
withholding required under the Code, any Applicable Law, or as otherwise
agreed by the parties at the time the Company Option was granted. The
applicable taxes required to be withheld from the Option Consideration shall
reduce first the Cash Consideration portion of the Option Consideration with
any remaining amount reducing the Stock Consideration portion of the Option
Consideration, with the value of the stock portion for purposes of such
deduction determined based on the Parent Average Closing Price.

 

(d) _Company_ _SARs_. At the Effective Time, each Company SAR (or portion
thereof) that is outstanding, whether vested or unvested, shall, by virtue of
the Merger and at the direction of Parent (which is hereby given pursuant to
this Agreement), be cancelled and terminated and converted into the right to
receive, a cash amount equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Company SAR, multiplied by
(ii) the excess, if any of (A) the Cash Equivalent Consideration over (B) the
strike price of such Company SAR (the " _SAR Consideration_ "). The holder of
each Company SAR shall receive at the Effective Time from the Company, or as
soon as practicable thereafter (but in no event later than the Companys first
regular payroll date following the Effective Time) from the Surviving
Company, the SAR Consideration, subject to applicable tax withholding required
under the Code or any Applicable Law.

 

(e) _Termination of Non-U.S. Company Compensatory Awards_. Notwithstanding the
provisions above, Parent may, prior to the Effective Time, determine
reasonably and in good faith, subject to the consent of the Company, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld (it being understood that withholding
consent in reliance on advice of Company counsel shall not be deemed
unreasonable) that any Company Compensatory Award that is subject to the
Applicable Laws of a non-U.S. jurisdiction may be treated in a manner other
than prescribed by  _Sections_ __ _ 6.11(a)_ through _6.11(d)_ , as
applicable, to the extent that (i) Parent reasonably and in good faith
determines that (A) the manner in which such Company Compensatory Award would
otherwise be treated pursuant to _Sections_ __ _ 6.11(a)_ through _6.11(d)_
, as applicable, would result in a violation of Applicable Laws or a
materially adverse tax consequence to the individual holding such Company
Compensatory Award in the 

 



64 ##### Table of Contents

  

 applicable non-U.S. jurisdiction and (B) such different treatment is
necessary to comply with such Applicable Laws and (ii) such
different treatment is no less favorable to the awardholder than as set forth
in with _Sections_ __ _ 6.11(a)_ through _6.11(d)_ , as applicable.

 

(f) _Necessary Actions; Form_ __ _ S-8_. The Company shall, at
Parents direction (which is hereby given pursuant to this Agreement), take
all actions reasonably necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by
this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ under all Company Stock Plans and Company
Compensatory Awards or any other plan or arrangement of the Company,
including delivering all required notices, obtaining all necessary consents,
and making any determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a
committee thereof. Promptly after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than 10 Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall prepare and
file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or other appropriate
form) relating to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to
assumed or converted Company Compensatory Awards under this _Section_ __ _
6.11_; _provided, however_ , that Parent shall not be deemed to have breached
its obligations hereunder if Parent shall fail to fulfill its obligations
under this _Section_ __ _ 6.11(f)_ at a time when trading of the Parent
Common Stock has been suspended globally under Parents then-effective
registration statements (it being understood and agreed that if Parent is
unable to file such registration statement on Form S-8 due to a global trading
suspension under Parents then-effective registration statements, then Parent
shall file such registration statement as soon as practicable after trading
has been restored).

 

Section 6.12 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) The Company shall terminate, effective as of the day immediately preceding
the date the Company becomes a member of the same Controlled Group of
Corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code) as Parent (the "
_401(k) Termination Date_ "), any and all 401(k) plans maintained by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, unless Parent provides written notice
to the Company that such 401(k) plan(s) shall not be terminated at least ten
(10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. The Company shall provide Parent
evidence that the 401(k) plan(s) of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been
terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board or the board of
directors of its Subsidiaries, as applicable. The form and substance of such
resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable review and approval of Parent,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. As soon as practicable
following the 401(k) Termination Date, Parent shall permit all Continuing
Employees who were eligible to participate in any 401(k) plan maintained by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the 401(k)
Termination Date to participate in Parents 401(k) plan, and shall permit each
such Continuing Employee to elect to transfer his or her account balance when
distributed from any terminated 401(k) plan maintained by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, including any outstanding participant loans from such
401(k) plans, to Parents 401(k) plan, except to the extent accepting such
transfers would adversely affect the tax-qualified status of the Parent
401(k) plan, or as may be prohibited by Parents 401(k) plan.

 

(b) From the Effective Time until the first anniversary of the Closing Date
(the " _Transition Period_ "), Parent shall cause the compensation and
benefits package provided to each Continuing Employee to be no less favorable,
in the aggregate, than the compensation and benefits package, in the
aggregate, provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time. During the Transition Period, each Continuing Employee will
be eligible to receive (i) base wages or salary, as applicable, that is not
less than the base wages or salary, as applicable, provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) severance benefits
not less favorable in amount or with regard to terms and conditions to receive
such severance benefits than those provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) As of the Effective Time, with respect to Continuing Employees, Parent
shall cause the service of each such Continuing Employee with the Company and
its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time to be recognized for purposes of
eligibility to participate, levels of benefits and vesting (but not for
purposes of benefit accrual) under each severance, vacation, fringe or
other welfare benefit plan, program or arrangement of the Parent or the
Surviving Company, as applicable, but in which any Continuing Employee is or
becomes eligible to

 



65 ##### Table of Contents

  

 participate, but solely to the extent permitted by Applicable Law and to the
extent such credit would not result in a duplication of benefits. From and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law and the terms of the applicable plans, (i) cause any pre-existing
conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any U.S. group
health plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries to be waived with respect to the
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents and (ii) give each of the
Continuing Employee in the U.S. credit for the plan year in which the
Effective Time occurs toward applicable deductibles and annual out of pocket
limits for expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time for which payment has
been made.

 

(d) Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Company, its Subsidiaries and
their permitted successors and assigns, to honor and perform the individual
severance arrangements and any plans, programs or arrangements required to be
maintained by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries by Applicable Law, as
disclosed on _Section_ __ _ 6.12(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(e) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring Parent, the
Company or any of their Affiliates to continue any specific benefit plan or
program, or to continue the employment of any specific person. No provision of
this Agreement shall be construed to create any right to any compensation or
benefits on the part of any Continuing Employee or other future, present or
former employee of Parent, the Company or their respective Affiliates.
_Section_ __ _ 6.11_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.12_ are intended to be for the
sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in _Section_ __ _
6.11_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.12_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed
to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder or make any
employee or other service provider of the parties or their respective
Subsidiaries a third party beneficiary of this Agreement. No provision of this
Agreement shall operate as an amendment to any benefit plan maintained by the
Company or Parent or their respective Affiliates. Further, Parent, the
Company and their respective Affiliates retain the right to amend or terminate
their benefit plans at any time and from time to time, subject to the
provisions of this Agreement and the terms of such plans.

 

Section 6.13 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Indemnification
and Insurance_.

(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to honor and fulfill in all respects
the obligations of the Company under its certificate of incorporation and
bylaws and its Subsidiaries under their respective certificates of
incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) and
all agreements for indemnification, exculpation of liability or advancement
of expenses, in effect as of the date hereof between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former directors or
officers or any person who becomes a director or officer prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), all of which shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms and shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of such Indemnified Parties. The foregoing notwithstanding,
if any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising
before, at or after the Effective Time) is made against any Indemnified Party
with respect to matters subject to indemnification hereunder on or prior to
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities and advancement of expenses referenced in the
preceding sentence shall continue in effect until the final disposition of
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Company shall maintain in effect the Companys current directors
and officers liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") in respect of facts,
events, acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
covering each person covered by the DandO Insurance immediately prior to the
Effective Time, on terms with respect to the coverage and amounts no
less favorable to such insured persons than those of the DandO Insurance in
effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Surviving Company may, at its option, substitute therefor policies of Parent,
the Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries containing
terms with respect to coverage and amounts no less favorable to such insured
persons than the DandO Insurance, _provided further_ , _however_ , that in
satisfying its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.13(b)_, Parent and
the Surviving Company shall not be obligated

 



66 ##### Table of Contents

  

 to pay annual premiums in excess of two hundred thirty-five percent (235%)
of the amount paid by the Company for such insurance coverage for its last
full fiscal year (such two hundred thirty-five percent (235%) amount, the "
_Maximum Annual Premium_ ") (which premiums the Company represents and
warrants to be as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.13_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter), _provided further _ that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, Parent and the Surviving Company shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. Prior to the Effective Time,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy (the " _Tail Policy_ ")
on the DandO Insurance on terms and conditions no less favorable to the insured
Persons, in the aggregate, than the DandO Insurance and for an amount not to
exceed two hundred thirty-five percent (235%) of the amount paid by the
Company coverage for its last full fiscal year. In the event that the Company
does not purchase the Tail Policy, Parent may purchase a Tail Policy on the
DandO Insurance on terms and conditions no less favorable to the insured
Persons, in the aggregate, than the DandO Insurance. In the event that either
the Company or Parent shall purchase such a Tail Policy prior to the Effective
Time, Parent and the Surviving Company shall maintain such Tail Policy in full
force and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations
thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Company under the first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 6.13(b)_ for so long
as such Tail Policy shall be maintained in full force and effect. 

(c) Each of the Indemnified Parties or other persons who are beneficiaries
under the DandO Insurance, the indemnification rights referred to in _Section_
__ _ 6.13(a)_ or the Tail Policy referred to in _Section_ __ _ 6.13(b)_ (and
their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries
of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.13_, with full rights of enforcement as if a party
thereto.

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Company (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper provision shall
be made so that such continuing or surviving entity or transferee of such
assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.13_. The rights of the Indemnified Parties (and other
persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance, the indemnification
rights referred to in _Section_ __ _ 6.13(a)_ or the Tail Policy referred to
in Section __ _ 6.13(b)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.13_ shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights that such persons may have under the certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents and any
and all indemnification agreements of or entered into by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or Applicable Law (whether at law or in equity).

 

Section 6.14 _Obligations of Merger Sub and Merger Sub LLC_. Parent shall take
all action necessary to cause Merger Sub, Merger Sub LLC and the Surviving
Company to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger and payment of any amounts payable hereunder, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

Section 6.15 _Director and Officer Resignations_. Prior to the Closing Date,
unless Parent instructs the Company otherwise, the Company shall obtain the
resignation of each individual serving as a director or officer of (or
comparable position with) the Company and its Subsidiaries as of immediately
following the Effective Time from his or her position as a director or
officer of (or comparable position with) the Company and its Subsidiaries (and
not as an employee, if applicable, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries),
which resignations shall be effective immediately following the Effective
Time. For the avoidance of doubt, such resignation shall not (i) prejudice in
any manner any contractual rights such officer or director may have with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) cause such officer or director to
cease to become entitled to any benefit under any Employee Plan to which
he/she would otherwise be entitled in his or her position as an employee of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable or (iii) terminate or modify
the terms of any officers employment relationship with the Company or its
Subsidiaries.

Section 6.16 _Debt Financing_.

 

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing
(including, to the extent required, complying with the full exercise of the
"flex" provisions) at or prior to the Closing, including using its reasonable
best efforts to: (i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letters in
accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions (including the "flex"
provisions) thereof, (ii) comply with its obligations under the Debt
Commitment Letters, (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with
respect thereto on the terms and conditions (including the "flex" provisions)
contained in the Debt Commitment Letters as promptly as practicable after the
date hereof, but in no event later than the Closing, or on such other terms
and conditions no less favorable in the aggregate to Parent and Merger Sub
than the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letters (
_provided_ that such other terms would not reasonably be expected to
materially delay or hinder the Closing), (iv) satisfy on a timely basis (or
obtain the waiver of) all conditions to funding that are within the control of
Parent and Merger Sub in the Debt Commitment Letters (or definitive
agreements entered into with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter), (v)
unless it has obtained alternative financing pursuant to Section 6.16(c)
hereof, enforce its rights pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letters, and (vi)
in the event that all conditions in the Debt Commitment Letters have been
satisfied, cause the Financing Sources to fund the Debt Financing at the
Closing. Parent will pay, or will cause to be paid, all fees arising under
the Debt Commitment Letters as they become due.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent will not
permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy pursuant to, the Debt Commitment Letters (other than
pursuant to "flex" provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letters)
without the consent of the Company if such amendment, modification or waiver
would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing to be funded on
the Closing Date (unless Parent has a sufficient amount of available cash on
hand from other sources to make the representation set forth in _Section_ __
_ 4.16_ as though made at the time of the effectuation of such amendment or
modification), (ii) impose new or additional conditions or other terms to the
Debt Financing or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to
the receipt of the Debt Financing, in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to: (A) delay, prevent or materially impede the consummation of the
Merger, or (B) make the timely funding of the Debt Financing, or the
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing, less likely to
occur in any material respect, or (iii) adversely impact the ability of Parent
or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt
Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements with respect thereto;
_provided_ , that for the avoidance of doubt, Parent may amend, amend and
restate or replace the existing Debt Commitment Letters to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not
executed the Debt Commitment Letters as of the date hereof. Parent shall
promptly (i) furnish the Company complete, correct and executed copies of any
amendments, restatements, supplements, amendments and restatements,
modifications, waivers or replacements to the Debt Commitment Letters and (ii)
give the Company prompt notice of any breach (or threatened breach asserted in
writing) by any party of the Debt Commitment Letters of which Parent becomes
aware or any termination thereof; _provided_ that in no event shall Parent be
under any obligation to disclose any information pursuant to clauses (i) or
(ii) that would waive the protection of attorney-client or similar privilege
if such party shall have used reasonable best efforts to disclose such
information in a way that would not waive such privilege. In addition to the
foregoing, Parent shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, release
or consent to the termination of the Debt Commitment Letters or of any
individual lender under the Debt Commitment Letters, except (x) for
assignments and replacements of an individual lender under the terms of, and
only in connection with, the syndication of the Debt Financing under the Debt
Commitment Letters, (y) for replacements of the Debt Commitment Letters with
alternative financing commitments pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.17(c)_,
and (z) in connection with a reduction of the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing otherwise permitted pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.16_.

 

(c) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters (after
giving effect to all applicable flex provisions), Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event, (i) to

 



68 ##### Table of Contents

  

 obtain alternative financing from alternative sources on terms and
conditions not materially less favorable in the aggregate to Parent than those
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters and in an amount at least equal to
the amount (taking into account cash on hand and other sources of funds
available to the Parent) sufficient to make the representation set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 4.16_ as though made at the time of the effectuation of such
alternative financing (the " _Alternate Debt Financing_ "), and (ii) obtain
one or more new financing commitment letters with respect to such Alternate
Debt Financing (the " _New Debt Commitment Letters_ "), which New Debt
Commitment Letters will replace the existing Debt Commitment Letters in whole
or in part. Parent shall promptly provide the Company with a copy of any New
Debt Commitment Letters (and any fee letter in connection therewith, which
such fee letter may be redacted as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.16(a)_). In
the event that any New Debt Commitment Letters are obtained, (A) any reference
in this Agreement to the "Debt Commitment Letters" will be deemed to include
the Debt Commitment Letters to the extent not superseded by the New Debt
Commitment Letters at the time in question and any New Debt Commitment Letters
to the extent then in effect, and (B) any reference in this Agreement to the
"Debt Financing" means the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters as modified pursuant to the foregoing.

 

(d) Parent shall (i) keep the Company fully informed on a reasonably current
basis of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing, and (ii)
provide the Company with copies of all executed definitive agreements related
to the Debt Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly (A) furnish the Company complete,
correct and executed copies of any amendments, restatements, supplements,
amendments and restatements, modifications, waivers or replacements to the
Debt Commitment Letters, (B) notify the Company of any breach (or threatened
breach asserted in writing) or default (or any event or circumstance that,
with notice or lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give
rise to any breach or default) by any party to the Debt Commitment Letters or
definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing, (C) notify the Company
of the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of any oral or written notice or
communication from any Debt Financing Source with respect to any breach (or
threatened breach asserted in writing), default, termination or repudiation
by any party to a Debt Financing Commitment Letter or any definitive
agreements related to the Debt Financing of any provisions of the Debt
Commitment Letters or such definitive agreements, and (D) if for any reason
Parent or Merger Sub at any time believes that it will not be able to obtain
all or any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms, in the manner or from
the sources contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters or any definitive
agreements related to the Debt Financing. Parent shall promptly provide any
information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any of the
circumstances referred to in the previous sentence.

 

(e) Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledge and agree that,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, their
obligations hereunder, including their obligations to consummate the Closing
are not subject to, or conditioned on receipt of the Debt Financing or any
alternative financing.

 

Section 6.17 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
its Representatives to, provide Parent with all cooperation reasonably
requested by Parent to assist it in causing the conditions in the Debt
Commitment Letters to be satisfied or as is otherwise reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with the Debt Financing, including;

(i) causing its management team, with appropriate seniority and expertise,

financing documents as may be requested by Parent or the Financing Sources
(including using reasonable best efforts to obtain consents of accountants
for use of their reports in any materials relating to the Debt Financing and

otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral and the granting
of security interests in respect of the Debt Financing, it being understood

required in connection with a confidential information memorandum or bank
presentation in respect of the Debt Financing, in each case customarily used
for the syndication of the Debt Financing (all such information and documents
in this _Section_ __ _ 6.17(a)(iv)_, the " _Required Financial Information_
"). If the Company in good faith reasonably believes that it has provided the
Required Financial Information, it may deliver to Parent a written notice
stating when it believes that it completed such delivery, in which case the
Company will be deemed to have complied with this _Section_ __ _ 6.17(a)(iv)_
and the Marketing Period shall be deemed to have commenced as of such date
unless Parent or the Financing Source in good faith reasonably believe that
the Company has not completed delivery of the Required Financial Information
and, within three (3) Business Days after the delivery of such notice by the
Company, deliver a written notice to the Company to that effect, stating in
good faith the specific items of Required Financial Information the Company
has not delivered, in which case such Required Financial Information shall be
deemed to have been delivered and the Marketing Period to have commenced when
such specific items have been delivered by the Company;

transfer, lend, or cause to distribute, transfer, or be loaned, (i) amounts to
the Company which, in the Companys reasonable determination, would interfere
with such non-U.S. Subsidiaries operating cash needs arising in the ordinary

certain customary assumptions and representations reasonably acceptable to
Parent and the Company after consultation with tax counsel, including
representations set forth in certificates of officers of Parent and the
Company, which Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable
