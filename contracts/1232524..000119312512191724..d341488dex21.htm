in France of any of the Companies who continues employment with the Buyer or any of its Affiliates, including any of the Companies, after the Merger Effective Time (each a &#147;<B>Continuing French Employee</B>&#148;): (a)&nbsp;at least the same
salary, wages and bonus opportunities as were provided to such Continuing French Employee by the applicable Company immediately prior to the Closing Date and (b)&nbsp;substantially similar terms and conditions of employment and employee benefits as
were provided to such Continuing French Employee by the applicable Company immediately prior to the Closing Date, and pursuant to the Companies Benefit Plans (as defined below) in which they previously participated. The Buyer agrees that each
Employee of any of the Companies who continues employment with the Buyer or any of its Affiliates, including any of the Companies, after the Merger Effective Time (each a &#147;<B>Continuing Employee</B>&#148;) shall be eligible, as determined after
the Merger Effective Time by the Buyer, to either: (a)&nbsp;continue participating in the health and welfare benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements of the Companies in effect immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time (the

applicable to similarly situated employees of the Buyer other than Continuing Employees (the &#147;<B>Similarly Situated Employees</B>&#148;). In the event that Continuing Employees participate in the Buyer Plans after the Merger Effective Time, and
subject to any necessary transition period, applicable plan provisions, contractual requirements or Law, the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such Continuing Employees (and their eligible dependents) receive credit
under such plans for their years of service with the Companies prior to the Merger Effective Time for purposes of eligibility requirements and for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or the application
of preexisting condition limitations; provided, however, that in no event shall the Continuing Employees be entitled to any credit to the extent that it would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service.
Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, neither the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (including the Companies) shall be obligated to continue to employ any Continuing Employee for any specific period of time following the Merger
Effective Time, subject to applicable Law. This Section&nbsp;10.3 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each of the Parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section&nbsp;10.3, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon
