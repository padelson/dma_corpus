THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of October 28, 2006 (this "
_Agreement_ ", is made and entered into by and among Schneider Electric SA, a
company organized under the laws of France (" _Parent_ "), Trianon Inc., a
Massachusetts corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("
_Subsidiary_ "), and American Power Conversion Corporation, a Massachusetts
corporation (the " _Company"_ ).

BACKGROUND

WHEREAS, Parent, Subsidiary and the Company wish to provide for a merger of
Subsidiary with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act (the "
_MBCA_ "), whereby all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ "
which term as used in this Agreement shall include the associated Company
Rights, unless the context otherwise requires) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than (i) the
shares of Company Common Stock owned directly or indirectly by Parent,
Subsidiary or the Company and (ii) to the extent appraisal rights are
available under the MBCA, any shares of Company Common Stock (" _Dissenting
Shares_ ") held by record holders or beneficial owners of shares of Company
Common Stock who duly satisfy the applicable requirements of the MBCA for the
exercise of appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value for
their shares (" _Dissenting Shareholders_ "), will be converted into the right
to receive $31.00 per share in cash (the " _Common Stock Price_ ");

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent has approved, and the respective
Boards of Directors of Subsidiary and the Company have adopted,
this Agreement, and each has determined that the Merger is in the best
interests of its corporation and shareholders;

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, Parent has
entered into a Voting Agreement dated as of the date of this Agreement (the "
_Voting Agreement_ ") with certain shareholders of the Company providing for
the vote of their shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the Merger; and

WHEREAS, Parent, Subsidiary and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger,

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, in accordance with this Agreement and the
MBCA, Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the Company. At the Effective
Time, the separate existence of Subsidiary shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ").

Section 1.2 _Effective Time of the Merger_. The Merger shall become effective
at the time (such time, the " _Effective Time_ ") of the filing of articles
of merger (in the form required by, and executed in accordance with, the
relevant provisions of the MBCA) with the Secretary of State of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts in accordance with the MBCA (the " _Merger
Filing_ "). The Merger Filing shall be made simultaneously with or as soon as
practicable following the Closing. Section 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the applicable provisions of the MBCA, including Section 11.07.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time,
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all the property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises, and all and every other interest of
Subsidiary and the Company, shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of Subsidiary and the Company shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

Section 1.4 _Closing_. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
to the obligations of the parties to effect the Merger set forth in this
Agreement, a closing to effectuate the consummation of the Merger (the "
_Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00 a.m. local time on the third business
day following the satisfaction or waiver of all the conditions set forth in
Article VII (other than conditions which, by their nature, are to be satisfied
at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions), at the offices of Clifford Chance US LLP, 31 West 52nd Street,
New York, New York, or at such other time or place as Parent and the Company
may agree. The date on which the Closing occurs is sometimes referred to in
this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."

ARTICLE II

THE SURVIVING CORPORATION 

Section 2.1 _Articles of Organization_. The articles of organization of the
Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended
in the Merger to be identical to the articles of organization of Subsidiary as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that the articles of
organization shall provide that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall
be the name of the Company) and, as so amended, shall be the articles of
organization of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time until
thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law.

Section 2.2 _Bylaws_. The bylaws of Subsidiary as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation after
the Effective Time until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law.

Section 2.3 _Directors_. From and after the Effective Time, the directors of
the Surviving Corporation shall be the directors of Subsidiary immediately
prior to the Effective Time and shall serve in accordance with the articles of
organization and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal.

Section 2.4 _Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, the officers of the
Surviving Corporation shall be the officers of the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time and such officers shall serve in accordance with
the articles of organization and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until

2 ARTICLE III

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT

CORPORATIONS; SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES

Section 3.1 _Conversion of Company Common Stock in the Merger_. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the
part of any holder of any capital stock of Parent, Subsidiary or the Company:

(a) each previously issued share of Company Common Stock that remains
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any shares
required to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.1(b) and any Dissenting Shares,
shall be converted into the right to receive the Common Stock Price, payable
to the holder thereof, in each case without interest, upon surrender of the
certificate formerly representing such shares of the Company Common Stock and
such other documents as reasonably may be required in accordance with Section
3.3, and all such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, no
longer shall be outstanding and automatically shall be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any
such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Common Stock Price per share
therefor, without interest, upon the surrender of such certificate in
accordance with Section 3.3 or to perfect any rights of appraisal as a holder
of Dissenting Shares that such holder may have pursuant to the MBCA; and

(b) each share of Company Common Stock of the Company, if any, owned of
record or beneficially, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Subsidiary or
held in treasury by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than shares held in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of any person or
persons other than the Company) automatically shall be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered
or deliverable in exchange therefor.

Section 3.2 _Conversion of Subsidiary Shares_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent or
Parents wholly owned subsidiary, Schneider Electric Holdings Inc. (" _SEHI_
"), as the sole shareholder of Subsidiary, each issued and outstanding share
of common stock, no par value per share, of Subsidiary that is issued and
outstanding prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 3.3 _Surrender and Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent in the
Merger (the " _Paying Agent"_ ). Parent agrees to deposit, or cause one or
more of its subsidiaries, which may include the Surviving Corporation, to
deposit, with the Paying Agent cash necessary from time to time, as and when
needed, to make the payments pursuant to Sections 3.1(a) and 3.6 on a timely
basis. The funds so deposited with the Paying Agent shall be held by the
Paying Agent and applied by it in accordance with this Section 3.3 and Section
3.6.

(b) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate
or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Company Certificates_ "),
whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Common Stock Price
pursuant to Section 3.1(a), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company
Certificates shall pass, only upon actual delivery of the Company Certificates
to the Paying Agent and



 

3 shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent reasonably may
specify), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Company Certificates in exchange for the Common Stock Price. Upon delivery to
the Paying Agent of a Company Certificate, a duly executed letter of
transmittal and such other documents specified in the instructions for use
referred to above as the Paying Agent reasonably shall require, the holder of
such Company Certificates shall be entitled promptly to receive in exchange
therefor the Common Stock Price for each share of Company Common
Stock formerly represented thereby, in accordance with Section 3.1(a), and
the Company Certificates so surrendered shall be canceled. If a transfer of
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock has occurred but has not been
registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check representing the
proper amount of Common Stock Price may be issued to the transferee if the
Company Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is
presented to the Paying Agent accompanied by all documents and endorsements
required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as provided
in this Section 3.3, each Company Certificate shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Common Stock Price for each share of Company Common Stock
represented thereby. No interest will be paid or accrue on any amounts payable
upon surrender of any Company Certificate.

(c) Promptly following the date that is one year after the Effective Time, the
Paying Agent shall deliver to Parent all cash and any documents in its
possession relating to the transactions described in this Agreement, and the
Paying Agents duties shall terminate. Thereafter, each holder of a Company
Certificate may surrender such Company Certificate to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat
or other similar Laws) receive in exchange therefor the Common Stock Price,
payable upon due surrender of the Company Certificate without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Paying Agent,
Parent, Subsidiary, the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable
to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amounts properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Laws. If any Company Certificate shall not have been
surrendered prior to two years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior
to such earlier date on which any Common Stock Price for each share of
Company Common Stock represented thereby would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Authority), the Common Stock Price
represented thereby shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of
any person previously entitled thereto.

(d) If any Company Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate the
Common Stock Price deliverable in respect thereof determined in accordance
with this Article III; _provided, however,_ that Parent or the Paying Agent
may, in its discretion, require the delivery of a reasonable indemnity or
bond against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation with
respect to such Company Certificate or ownership thereof.

Section 3.4 _Tax Withholding_. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former holder of shares of Company
Common Stock or of Options such amounts as Parent or the Surviving Corporation
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any
other provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the former holder of the shares of Company Common Stock or
Options in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent
or the Surviving Corporation.



 

4 Section 3.5 _Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. At and after the
Effective Time, holders of Company Certificates shall cease to have any
rights as shareholders of the Company, and the Company Share Certificates
shall represent solely the right to receive the Common Stock Price pursuant to
Section 3.1, without interest. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, Company Certificates formerly representing
shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation,
they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Common Stock Price in accordance
with this Article III.

Section 3.6 _Options; Restricted Stock Units_ .

(a) As of the Effective Time, each option, warrant or other similar right
(other than Restricted Stock Units, which are addressed in paragraph (b)
of this Section 3.6 and rights under the ESPP, which are addressed in
paragraph (c) of this Section 3.6) to acquire shares of Company Common Stock
(each an " _Option_ ") that then remains outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and originally was granted under any Company Plan or
otherwise, whether or not then vested or exercisable, automatically shall be
terminated at the Effective Time the holder thereof shall then become entitled
to receive, in full satisfaction of such Option, promptly after the Effective
Time, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the
Common Stock Price over the applicable exercise price of such Option and (y)
the number (determined without reference to vesting requirements or other
limitations on exercisability) of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of such Option.

(b) As of the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding restricted stock
unit outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or
unvested) granted under any Company Plan (or otherwise (each a " _Restricted
Stock Unit_ ") shall be terminated and the holder thereof shall then become
entitled to receive promptly after the Effective Time, in full satisfaction of
such Restricted Stock Unit, an amount in cash equal to the Common Stock Price
payable with respect to the number of shares of Company Common Stock then
underlying such Restricted Stock Unit.

(c) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company administering the ESPP), shall adopt such resolutions
or take such other actions as may be required to provide that with respect to
the ESPP (i) participants may not increase their payroll deductions or
purchase elections from those in effect on the date of this Agreement, (ii) no
offering or purchase period shall be commenced after the date of this
Agreement, (iii) each participants right to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock under the ESPP outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
terminate on the day immediately prior to the day on which the Effective Time
occurs, in exchange for a cash payment equal to the excess of (a) the Common
Stock Price over (b) the ESPP Price, multiplied by the Applicable Multiple and
(iv) the ESPP shall terminate (a) immediately following such termination of
rights or (b) if the purchase period in effect on the date of the Agreement
ends prior to the Effective Time, shall terminate immediately prior to the
Effective Time. For these purposes, (i) the term " _Applicable Multiple_ "
means a number equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock that,
subject to a maximum of 1,500 shares of Company Common Stock and the
limitations of Section 423(b)(c) of the Code, could be purchased at the ESPP
Price with such participants accumulated payroll deductions existing as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the term " _ESPP Price_ "
shall mean an amount equal to 85% of the average market price per share of
the Company Common Stock on the first business day of the offering period
applicable to such right under the ESPP (rounded up to the nearest cent).



 

5 (d) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate and as applicable, any committee
of the Board of Directors of the Company administering the Company
Consolidated 401K Plan and any trusts thereunder (collectively, the " _401K
Plan_ ")), shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be
required to provide that other than with respect to rights under the ESPP
relating to the purchase period ending October 31, 2006 no shares of Company
Common Stock may be newly issued by the Company pursuant to, under or to (i)
the 401K Plan and (ii) rights under the ESPP (although, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Company may make contributions to participant accounts under the
401K Plan in, and rights under the ESPP may be exercised for, shares of
Company Common Stock that (A) were issued by the Company prior to the date
hereof and (B) the Company acquired or acquires from third parties).

(e) All amounts payable to holders of the Options, Restricted Stock Units and
rights under the ESPP pursuant to Section 3.6 shall be subject to any required
withholding or deduction of Taxes and shall be paid without interest.

(f) The Company shall ensure that following the Effective Time, no holder of
an Option, Restricted Stock Unit or right under the ESPP (or former holder of
an Option, Restricted Stock Unit or right under the ESPP) or any current or
former participant in any Company Stock Plan, Company Plan or Company Benefit
Agreement shall have any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries or any other equity
interest therein (including "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights).

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will obtain all consents and make
all amendments, if any, to the terms of the Company Plans and
each outstanding award agreement issued pursuant to the Company Plans, as
applicable, that are necessary to give effect to the provisions of this
Section 3.6. Parent shall direct the Paying Agent to make the payments
required under this Section 3.6 at or as promptly as practicable following
the Effective Time.

Section 3.7 _Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
Dissenting Shares held by a Dissenting Shareholder shall not be converted
into the Common Stock Price but shall become the right to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Shareholder
pursuant to the MBCA; _provided, however,_ that each share of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
Dissenting Shareholder who, after the Effective Time, withdraws his demand or
fails to perfect or otherwise loses his right of appraisal, pursuant to the
MBCA, shall be deemed to be converted as of the Effective Time into the right
to receive the Common Stock Price, without interest.

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) notice of any demands for appraisal
pursuant to the applicable provisions of the MBCA received by the Company,
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
MBCA and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
the MBCA. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to any such demands for appraisal, or
settle, or offer to settle, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 3.8 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Subsidiary,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do,
in the name and on behalf of the Company or Subsidiary, any other actions and
things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.



 

6 ARTICLE IV

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Subsidiary that, except as
set forth in the disclosure schedule (with specific reference to the relevant
Sections of the representations and warranties or covenants in this Agreement
or disclosure in such a way to make its relevance to the information
called for by the representations and warranties or covenants reasonably
apparent) delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ "):

Section 4.1 _Organization and Qualification_. The Company is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts and has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease or otherwise hold its assets and properties and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The Company is qualified
to transact business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions
that recognize the concept) in each jurisdiction in which the properties
owned, licensed, used, leased and operated by it or the nature of the business
conducted by it makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure
to be so qualified and in good standing that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. As used in this Agreement, a " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ "
means any event, circumstance, change or effect that (i) has a material
adverse effect on or materially delays the Companys ability to consummate the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise
perform its obligations under this Agreement; or (ii) has a material adverse
effect on the business, assets or condition (financial or otherwise) or
results of operations of the Company and the subsidiaries of the Company
(each a " _Company Subsidiary_ "), taken as a whole, other than effects in the
case of this clause (ii), due to (A) general economic or market conditions to
the extent not disproportionately affecting the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (B) matters generally affecting the industries
or market sectors in which the Company operates to the extent not
disproportionately affecting the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, (C) the announcement of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including any impact of the announcement of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on relationships with customers or
employees), (D) any restrictions imposed on the Company pursuant to Section
6.1 of this Agreement to the extent the Company has requested consent to take
a prohibited action and Parent does not provide the requested consent, (E)
changes in Law to the extent not disproportionately affecting the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (F) changes in generally accepted
accounting principles by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC or
any other applicable regulatory body, (G) acts of war or terrorism that do
not directly affect the assets or properties of, or customers served by, the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, (H) fluctuations in the share price of the
Company Common Stock or (I) the failure to meet analyst projections. The
Company has made available to Parent and Subsidiary complete and correct
copies of the articles of organization and bylaws of the Company as in effect
on the date of this Agreement.

 

Section 4.2 _Capitalization_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists solely of 450,000,000
shares of Company Common Stock and 250,000 shares of Class A common stock, par
value $0.01 per share (" _Company Class A Common Stock_" and together with
the Company Common Stock, " _Company Capital Stock_ "). As of the close of
business on October 26, 2006, (i) 189,940,374 shares of Company Common Stock
were issued and outstanding, all of which were duly and validly issued and
are fully paid,



 

7 nonassessable and free of preemptive rights and each of which also entitles
the holder to one right (a " _Company Right_ ") issued pursuant to the Rights
Agreement, dated as of September 2, 1999, between the Company and
Computershare Trust Company, N.A., the successor to BankBoston, N.A., as
rights agent (the " _Company Rights Agreement_ "); (ii) no shares of Company
Class A Common Stock were issued and outstanding; (iii) no shares of Company
Common Stock were held in the treasury of the Company; (iv) 11,580,025 shares
of Company Common Stock were reserved and available for issuance pursuant to
the Companys 1987 Stock Option Plan, 1993 Non-Employee Director Stock Option
Plan, 1997 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan, 1997 Stock Option Plan, as
amended, 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan, Amended and Restated 1997 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") and the American Power Conversion
Corporation (A.P.C.) BV Profit Sharing Scheme (the " _Scheme"_ ) (such plans,
collectively, the " _Company Stock Plans_ "); (v) Options granted under the
Company Stock Plans (other than the ESPP) with respect to 10,586,345 shares of
Company Common Stock were issued and outstanding; and (vi) 1,148,332
Restricted Stock Units granted under the Company Stock Plans were issued and
outstanding. No shares of the Company Common Stock have been contributed to
the Scheme since December 31, 2003. Except as set forth above, at the close of
business on October 26, 2006, no shares of capital stock or other voting
securities or equity interests of the Company were issued, reserved for
issuance or outstanding.

(b) _Section 4.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ contains a complete
and correct list setting forth, as of October 26, 2006, (i) the number of
Options outstanding, the number of shares of Company Common Stock (or other
stock) subject thereto, the Company Stock Plan under which such Options were
granted, the grant dates, grant prices and vesting schedules thereof and the
names of the holders thereof and the aggregate number of Options outstanding
and the weighted average exercise price for all outstanding Options and (ii)
the number of Restricted Stock Units outstanding, the number of shares of
Company Common Stock (or other stock) subject thereto, the grant dates, and
vesting schedules thereof and the names of the holders thereof. All
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which the Company has
a right under specified circumstances to repurchase such shares at a fixed
purchase price, Options and Restricted Stock Units are evidenced by stock
option agreements, restricted stock unit award agreements or other award
agreements. Each grant of an Option was duly authorized no later than the date
on which the grant of such Option was by its terms to be effective (the "
_Grant Date_ " ) by all necessary corporate action, including, as applicable,
approval by the Board of Directors of the Company (or a duly constituted and
authorized committee thereof) and any required shareholder approval by
the necessary number of votes or written consents, and the award agreement
governing such grant (if any) was duly executed and delivered by each party
thereto, each such grant was made in accordance with the terms of the
applicable compensation plan or arrangement of the Company, the Exchange Act
and all other applicable Laws and regulatory rules or requirements, including
the rules of the Nasdaq National Market, the per share exercise price of each
Option was equal to the fair market value of a share of Company Common Stock
on the applicable Grant Date and each such grant was properly accounted for in
accordance with GAAP in the financial statements (including the related notes)
of the Company and disclosed in the Company SEC Reports in accordance with
the Exchange Act and all other applicable Laws. The Company has not knowingly
granted, and there is no and has been no Company policy or practice to grant,
Options prior to, or otherwise coordinate the grant of Options with,
the release or other public announcement of material information regarding
the Company or any Company Subsidiary or their financial results or prospects.
Each Option intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" under Section
422 of the Code so qualifies. As of the close of business on October 26,
2006, there were outstanding Options to purchase 10,530,745 shares of Company
Common Stock with exercise prices on a per share basis lower than the Common
Stock Price, and the weighted average exercise price of such Options was
equal to $15.88. 71,798 shares of Company Common Stock were subject to
outstanding rights under the ESPP based on payroll information for the period
ending October 31, 2006 (assuming the fair market value per share of Company
Common Stock on the first day of the offering period in effect under the ESPP
on the date of this Agreement was equal to the Common



 

8 Stock Price and that payroll deductions continue at the current rate). Each
Option, Restricted Stock Unit and right under the ESPP may be, or will be
amended to be, treated at the Effective Time as set forth in Section 3.6. All
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are, and all shares which
may be issued pursuant to the Options, Restricted Share Units or rights under
the ESPP will be, when issued in accordance with the terms thereof, duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to
preemptive rights.

(c) No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company having
the right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for,
securities having a right to vote) on any matters on which holders of the
Company Capital Stock or holders of capital stock of a Company Subsidiary may
vote (" _Voting Company Debt_ ") are authorized, issued or outstanding.

(d) Except for the Options, Restricted Stock Units and rights under the ESPP
or the Scheme described in Section 4.2(a), (i) there are no outstanding
shares of Company Capital Stock subject to vesting or restrictions on transfer
imposed by the Company, stock appreciation rights, "phantom" stock rights,
performance units, rights to receive shares of Company Common Stock on
a deferred basis or other rights (other than the Options, Restricted Stock
Units and rights under the ESPP) that are linked to the value of Company
Capital Stock and (ii) there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, calls,
contracts, scrip, commitments, understandings, restrictions, arrangements,
rights, warrants, stock appreciation or other rights (contingent or other),
including "phantom" stock rights, equity-based rights or interests or
preemptive rights, or rights of conversion or exchange under any outstanding
security, instrument or other agreement, obligating the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell, redeem or repurchase, or cause to be
issued, delivered or sold or repurchased, additional shares of the capital
stock of the Company or other voting securities or other equity interests in,
or any security convertible or exercisable for or exchangeable into any shares
of capital stock, other voting securities or other equity interests in, the
Company or of any Company Subsidiary or any Voting Company Debt or obligating
the Company or any Company Subsidiary to grant, extend or enter into any such
agreement or commitment or providing for any economic benefit or
right similar to or derived from the economic benefits and rights accruing to
holders of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or providing for any economic benefit or right similar and
there is no commitment of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to distribute
to holders of any class of its capital stock, any dividends, distributions,
evidences of indebtedness or assets. There are no voting trusts, proxies or
other agreements or understandings to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is a party or is bound with respect to the voting of any shares of
capital stock of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and no shares of
capital stock of the Company or any Company Subsidiary are subject to
transfer restrictions imposed by or with the knowledge, consent or approval of
the Company, or other similar arrangements imposed by or with the knowledge,
consent or approval of the Company, except for restrictions on transfer
imposed by the Securities Act and state securities Laws. The Company Common
Stock constitutes the only class of equity securities of Company or the
Company Subsidiaries registered or required to be registered under the
Exchange Act. 

Section 4.3 _Ownership Interests in Other Entities_. _Section 4.3 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth the name and the state or
jurisdiction of organization of each Company Subsidiary and, except for
minority and other nominee interests held in Company Subsidiaries to satisfy
requirements under applicable Laws (with each such Company Subsidiary
being designated as such in _Section 4.3 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_), the Company does not own less than 100% of the relevant Company
Subsidiary. The principal line or lines of business conducted by each Company
Subsidiary are not different from the core lines of business of the Company.
The only Company Subsidiaries are those listed in _Section 4.3 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule_. Except for shares of, or ownership interests in, the
Company Subsidiaries, the Company does not own of record or beneficially,
directly or indirectly, (i) any shares of outstanding capital stock or
securities convertible into or



 

9 exchangeable or exercisable for capital stock of any other corporation or (ii)
any equity interest in any limited or unlimited liability company,
partnership, joint venture or other business enterprise. Each Company
Subsidiary is (x) a corporation, partnership, limited liability company or
similar business entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
(with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept) under the Laws of
the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and has all requisite
power and authority to own, lease and otherwise hold its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and (y) qualified
to transact business in each jurisdiction in which the properties owned,
licensed, used, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business
conducted by it makes such qualification necessary, except with respect to
clause (y) where the failure to be so qualified, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of, or
other ownership interests in, each Company Subsidiary are validly issued,
fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive or similar rights and are
owned directly or indirectly by the Company free and clear of any Liens.

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the

Agreement inapplicable to the execution of this Agreement, the Voting
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement such that none of the execution of this Agreement, the Voting

of ERISA or any similar Law relating to breach of fiduciary duty with respect
to any Company Plan.

"applicable employee remuneration" (within the meaning of Section 162(m) of
the Code) has been disallowed or is subject to disallowance by reason of
Section 162(m) of the Code, and no Participant has received or is reasonably
expected to receive (including as a result of payments under any change in
control agreements during the terms thereof) any payment or benefit from the
Company or any Company Subsidiary that would be nondeductible pursuant to
Section 162(m) of the Code.

"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section
409A(d)(1) of the Code (a " _Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan_ " )
subject to Section 409A of the Code has been, to the knowledge of the Company,
operated in compliance with Section 409A of the Code since January 1, 2005,
based upon a good faith, reasonable interpretation of (A) Section 409A of the
Code and (B)(1) the Proposed Regulations issued thereunder or (2)
Internal Revenue Service Notice 2005-1 in each case, as modified by Internal
Revenue Service Notice 2006-79 (clauses (A) and (B), together, the " _409A

but for the effective date provisions that are applicable to Section 409A of
the Code, as set forth in Section 885(d) of the American Jobs Creation Act
of 2004, as amended (the " _AJCA_ " ), has been "materially modified" within

additional payment from the Company or any Company Subsidiary in respect of
any Tax (including Federal, state, local or foreign income, excise or other
Taxes (including Taxes imposed under Sections 280G or 409A of the Code)) or
interest or penalty related thereto. To the knowledge of the Company, no

Code and each award under the Company Stock Plans is exempt from Section 409A
of the Code.

result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the obtaining of the
approval of the Companys shareholders of the Merger, the consummation of the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in
combination with any other event, including as a result of termination of
employment on or following the Effective Time) by or for the benefit of any
Participant who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) with respect to the Company would be
characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as such term is defined in
Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code), and no disqualified individual is entitled to
receive any additional payment from the Company, any Company Subsidiary,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other person in the event that the
excise tax required by Section 4999(a) of the Code is imposed on such
disqualified individual (a " _Parachute Gross Up Payment"_ ). Within seven
business days following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall provide

the parties shall (and shall cause its respective subsidiaries to) use its
reasonable best efforts to take all actions and to do all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, including using
its reasonable best efforts to (i) take all actions necessary to cause the
conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable, (ii)
prepare, execute and deliver such instruments and take or cause to be taken

force and effect any of the Company Permits or the Companys Contracts,
leases, licenses or other rights following the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) _Antitrust Laws_. Without limiting the generality of anything contained in
Section 6.2(a) or elsewhere in this Agreement, each of the parties undertakes
and agrees to file as soon as practicable, a Notification and Report Form
under the HSR Act with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_
") and the United States Department of Justice, Antitrust Division (the "
_Antitrust Division_ ") and as promptly or reasonably practicable to make all
other required Antitrust Filings. Each of the parties shall (i) respond as
promptly as practicable to any inquiries received from the FTC, the Antitrust
Division or other applicable Governmental Authorities for additional
information or documentation and to all inquiries and requests received from
any State Attorney General or other Governmental Authority; and (ii) not
extend any waiting period under the HSR Act and other applicable antitrust or
competition Laws, rules or regulations or enter into any agreement with the
FTC, the Antitrust Division or other applicable Governmental Authorities not
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. Parent shall use its
best efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
antitrust, competition, or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by the
FTC, the Antitrust Division, any State Attorney General or any other
Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger (including if so requested
by the Company by agreeing to dispose of, hold separate or accept limitations
on the activities of, any businesses or assets) so as to enable the Closing to
occur as soon as reasonably possible, but in any event in sufficient time to
ensure that the Effective Time occurs before the Termination Date. Subject to
the following sentence, and subject to Parents obligation under the
preceding sentence, the parties agree that Parent and its counsel shall have
the primary lead role in any discussions and negotiations with any
Governmental Authorities with respect to the Antitrust Laws. Each party shall
(i) promptly notify the other party of any written communication to that party

Law, permit the other party to review in advance, and take into account any
reasonable comments of the other party in relation to, any proposed written

Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meeting; and (iii) furnish the other party with copies of
all correspondence, filings, and communications (and memoranda setting forth
the substance thereof) between them and their affiliates and their respective
representatives on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of
their respective staffs on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and
the Merger, except to the extent (x) the disclosure of any such information
would violate the terms of any confidentiality agreement with a third party or
(y) such information relates to competitively sensitive matters if the
exchange of such information, as determined by such partys counsel, may
result in antitrust difficulties for such party (or any of its affiliates);
_provided_ that in the case of clause (y), such information shall be provided
to the other partys counsel, who shall agree not to disclose such
information to its client.



 

31 (c) _Anti-Takeover Laws_. If requested by Parent and to the extent the Company
is legally permitted to do so, the Company and its Board of Directors shall

similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the
Voting Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Voting Agreement and (ii) if any state takeover statute
or similar statute becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Voting Agreement,
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Voting Agreement, take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreement
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement and the Voting Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect
of such statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Voting Agreement.

Section 6.3 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Meeting of Shareholders_.

(a) The Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of
this Agreement, prepare and no later than November 13, 2006, file
a preliminary form of the Proxy Statement with the SEC and each of the
Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond to any
comments of the SEC or its staff, and to cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed to the Companys shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable
after responding to all such comments to the satisfaction of the SECs staff.
The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from
the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information
and shall supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company
or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on
the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Merger. If at any
time prior to the Shareholders Meeting there shall occur any event that is
required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare, and, after consultation
with Parent, mail to its shareholders such an amendment or supplement. Parent
shall cooperate fully with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy
Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto and shall furnish the
Company, promptly upon the Companys request, with all information reasonably
requested by the Company for inclusion in, or otherwise in respect of, the
Proxy Statement. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon the Proxy Statement and the related
proxy materials and any proposed amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement prior to its filing with the SEC or dissemination to the
Companys shareholders.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the parties
shall correct promptly any information provided by it for use in the Proxy
Statement, if and to the extent any such information shall be or have become
false or misleading in any material respect and shall take all steps necessary
to correct the same and to cause the Proxy Statement as so corrected to be
disseminated to the Companys shareholders, in each case to the extent
required by applicable Law or otherwise deemed appropriate by the Company.

(c) The Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and its articles of
organization and bylaws, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
date which is 10 days after the preliminary Proxy Statement is filed with the
SEC, but in any event after substantially all of the comments provided by the
staff of the SEC, if any, have been resolved, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the
Company Shareholders Approval. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take all such actions as are necessary to hold the Shareholders
Meeting by January 16, 2007, or such later date as shall be requested by
Parent, and to obtain the Company Shareholders Approval. The Company shall
include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of its Board of Directors
that the Company Shareholders Approval be given (the " _Recommendation _ ").
Except as permitted by Section 6.3(d), neither the Board of Directors of the



 

32 Company nor any committee thereof shall (a) withdraw (or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent), or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent), the approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability by such Board of Directors or any such committee thereof of this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or (b) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to
recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in
clauses (a) or (b) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ").

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.3(c), at any time
before obtaining the Company Shareholders Approval, the Board of Directors
of the Company may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (i) if the
Company Adverse Recommendation Change does not relate to an Acquisition
Proposal other than a Superior Proposal, and (ii) if the Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after taking into account the advice of the
Companys outside legal counsel, that such Company Adverse Recommendation
Change is consistent with the fiduciary obligations of the Companys Board of
Directors to the Companys shareholders under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no Company Adverse Recommendation Change may be made until
after the fifth business day following Parents receipt of written notice (a
" _Notice of Adverse Recommendation_ " ) from the Company advising Parent that
the Board of Directors of the Company intends to take such action and
specifying the reasons therefor. Any Notice of Adverse Recommendation shall
set forth any facts or circumstances that may give rise to a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, including the terms and conditions of any Superior
Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the Board of
Directors (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial
terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new
Notice of Adverse Recommendation and a new five business day period). In
determining whether to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the
Board of Directors of the Company shall take into account all information
provided by Parent that is relevant to any decision by the Companys Board of
Directors whether to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, including
any changes to the financial terms or other material terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent in response to a Notice of Adverse Recommendation or
otherwise. The Company shall provide to its Board of Directors
any information provided by Parent that is relevant to any decision by the
Companys Board of Directors to make such Company Adverse Recommendation
Change. If the Companys Board of Directors determines to make such Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, (i) if requested by Parent, the Shareholder
Meeting shall be postponed to a date no earlier than a date designated by
Parent, or (ii) if the Board of Directors determines in good faith after
taking into account the advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, that
it is consistent with the fiduciary obligations of the Companys Board of
Directors, the Shareholders Meeting may be postponed to a date determined by
the Companys Board of Directors after consultation with Parent.

(e) The Company shall not be required to hold the Shareholders Meeting if
this Agreement is terminated before that meeting is held.



 

33 Section 6.4 _Public Statements_. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law
or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of the
Nasdaq Stock Market or any other securities exchange, none of the parties to
this Agreement will cause or permit any public announcement with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement. The initial press release with respect
to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
require the prior mutual agreement and approval of both Parent and the Company
and any subsequent press releases or other public statements and any general
communication to customers, distributors, suppliers or employees of the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or Parent, with respect to the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be made, subject to
the preceding sentence, only following prior consultation between Parent and
the Company.

activities and transition planning with the employees of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries) during normal business hours with reasonable notice
throughout the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective
Time to all of the Companys properties, books, contracts, commitments and
records (including Tax Returns and records) and, during that period,
shall furnish promptly to Parent or Parents Representatives (a) a copy of
each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of United States Federal or
state securities Laws, (b) a copy of each correspondence or written
communication with any Governmental Authority and (c) all other information
concerning the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries business, properties
and personnel as Parent reasonably may request. Except as required by Law,
Parent and Subsidiary shall hold, and shall cause the Parent Representatives
to hold, in strict confidence all nonpublic documents and confidential
information furnished to Parent, Subsidiary and any Parent Representative in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance
with the confidentiality agreement dated as of September 30, 2006 between the
Company and Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

Section 6.6 _Acquisition Proposals_.

(a) The Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective officers,
directors or employees, consultants, agents, advisors and other
representatives (collectively, the " _Company Representatives_ ") immediately
shall cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or
negotiations existing as of the date of this Agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and, to the extent permitted by the applicable
confidentiality or similar agreement governing such activities, discussions or
negotiations, require any third parties to such activities, discussions or
negotiations to return to the Company or to destroy all confidential
information of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Subject to the other
provisions of this Section 6.6, until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, none of
the Company, the Company Subsidiaries nor any of the Company Representatives
shall, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or encourage (including
by way of providing information) the submission of, or take any other action
designed to facilitate, any inquiries, proposals or offers that constitute or
may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal or engage in
any discussions or negotiations with respect thereto or otherwise cooperate
with or assist or participate in, or facilitate any such inquiries,
proposals, discussions or negotiations, or (ii) approve or recommend, or
propose to approve or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal or enter into any
merger agreement, letter of intent, agreement in principle, share purchase
agreement, asset purchase agreement or share exchange agreement, option
agreement or other similar agreement providing for or relating to an
Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement or agreement in
principle requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby or breach its obligations hereunder or
propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.



 

34 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.6(a), until the
Company Shareholders Approval is obtained, to the extent consistent with the
fiduciary obligations of the Board of Directors of the Company to the
shareholders of the Company under applicable Law, as determined in good faith
by the Board of Directors of the Company after consultation with the
Companys outside counsel, in response to a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal that the Companys Board of Directors determines, in good faith,
after consultation with the Companys outside counsel and financial advisors,
constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal , and
provided the Acquisition Proposal was not solicited by the Company or the
Company Representatives and did not otherwise result from a breach or deemed
of this Section 6.6, and, subject to compliance with this Section 6.6(b) and
Section 6.6(c), the Company may (x) furnish information with respect to the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the person making the
Acquisition Proposal (pursuant to a customary confidentiality and standstill
agreement not less restrictive of such person, in the aggregate, than the
Confidentiality Agreement, including paragraph 3 thereof) and (y) participate
in discussions or negotiations with such person regarding the Acquisition
Proposal; _provided, however,_ that the Company shall promptly provide to
Parent any material non-public information concerning the Company or any
Company Subsidiary that is provided to any person pursuant to this Section
6.6(b) and was not previously provided to Parent. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 6.6 by any Company Representative or affiliate of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, whether or not such person is purporting to act on
behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or otherwise, shall be deemed
to be a breach of this Section 6.6 by the Company.

 

(c) The Company promptly (but in any event within 24 hours of such request for
information or receipt of such Acquisition Proposal) shall advise Parent
orally and subsequently in writing (x) of any Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry with respect to or that could reasonably be expected to lead to any
Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the person making any such Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry and the principal terms and conditions of any such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and (y) if it is entering into discussions
under Section 6.6(b). The Company shall (i) keep Parent fully informed of the
status, including any change or proposed change to the terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, (ii) provide to Parent as soon as reasonably
practicable after receipt or delivery thereof with copies of all
correspondence and other written material sent or provided to the Company
from any third party in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or sent or
provided by the Company to any third party in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal and (iii) provide Parent with advance written notice of any
scheduled meeting of the Company Board to discuss an Acquisition Proposal.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholders Approval, the Company
receives an Acquisition Proposal which the Companys Board of Directors
determines in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, after consultation
with the Companys financial advisors, the Companys Board of Directors may
terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal if the Board of Directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel and financial advisors, that failure
to take such action will be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
shareholders of the Company under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
6.6(d) and any purported termination pursuant to this Section 6.6(d) shall be
void, unless at the time the Company is not in material breach of any of its
obligations under this Agreement, including its obligations under Section
6.6, and concurrently with such termination the Company pays the Termination
Fee payable pursuant to Section 8.2(b); and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Board of Directors may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
6.6(d) unless the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent
(a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ "), at least five business days in advance
(such five business day period, the " _Matching Period_ "), of its intention
to terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect
to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the material terms and
conditions of the Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party
making the Superior



 

35 Proposal), and shall be accompanied by a copy of a draft of the definitive
agreement proposed to be entered into with respect to the Superior Proposal.
The Company agrees that, during the Matching Period, the Company and the
Company Representatives shall consider in good faith any proposal that may be
made by Parent with respect to possible revisions of the terms of this
Agreement. The Company further agrees that it will deliver to Parent a new
Notice of Superior Proposal with respect to (A) each material revision or
material modification to a Superior Proposal that was the subject of a
previous Notice of Superior Proposal where such revision or modification is
adverse to the Company or its shareholders, and (B) each other material
revision or material modification to a Superior Proposal that was the subject
of a previous Notice of Superior Proposal where such revision or modification
is made during a Matching Period, and that a new Matching Period shall
commence for purposes of this Section 6.6(d) under either of the circumstances
described in clauses (A) and (B) above at the time Parent receives the new
Notice of Superior Proposal.

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Companys Board of
Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to the Companys shareholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or
(ii) making any other disclosure to the Companys shareholders if, in the
case of any disclosure described in this clause (ii), the Companys Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel,
that failure to disclose would be a violation of the obligations of the
Company or its Board of Directors under applicable Law.

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
person relating to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, directly
or indirectly, in one transaction or a series of transactions, (i) a merger,
consolidation, dissolution (other than the restructuring transaction with
respect to the Company Subsidiary described in item 1 of _Section 6.1 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule_), recapitalization or other business combination
involving the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (ii) the issuance of 25% or
more of the equity securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary

equity securities of the Company or assets (including equity securities or
assets of any Company Subsidiary) that represent 25% or more of the
consolidated assets of the Company and Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole
(based on the book value of such assets or revenues or "earnings before
interest taxes, depreciation and amortization" produced by such assets), in
each case other than the transactions contemplated by or expressly permitted
under this Agreement.

" _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (but
replacing references to "25% or more" in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal with "66-2/3% or more") on terms that the Companys Board of
Directors determines in good faith after consultation with the Companys
financial advisor to be superior from a financial point of view to the Merger,
taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this
Agreement (including any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this
Agreement, and including in each case the risks and probabilities of
consummation).

Section 6.7 _Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses,

mailing of the Proxy Statement shall be borne equally by Parent and the
Company.

(a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification and related rights to
advancement of expenses on the part of each person who at the Effective Time
is a current or former director or officer of the



 

36 Company (i) existing pursuant to the MBCA, (ii) the Companys articles of
organization or bylaws or (iii) each indemnification agreement identified on
_Section 6.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ between any such person
and the Company in effect on the date of this Agreement (collectively, the "
_Existing Indemnification Provisions_ "), shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with the terms of such
Existing Indemnification Provisions. Parent also agrees that for the period
beginning from and after the Effective Time and ending the sixth anniversary
of the Effective Time, it shall (and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
indemnify all such persons to the fullest extent provided by the Existing
Indemnification Provisions with respect to all actual or alleged acts or
omissions prior to the Effective Time occurring in connection with or arising
out of such individuals service as officers or directors of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries. Without limitation of the foregoing, if any
such person is or becomes involved in any such capacity in any action,
proceeding or investigation in connection with any actual or alleged action,
inaction, state of affairs or other matter, including any matter related to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, occurring on or prior to the
Effective Time, to the extent such action, proceeding, investigation,
allegation or other matter is the subject of the Existing Indemnification
Provisions, Parent shall (or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) pay
such persons reasonable fees and other expenses of counsel selected by such
person (including the cost of any investigation, preparation and settlement)
incurred in connection therewith promptly after statements therefor are
received by Parent, to the extent that doing so would be consistent with the
Companys prior custom and practice. Parent shall be entitled to assume the
defense of any such action or proceeding, with counsel selected by Parent
reasonably acceptable to the indemnified person. Parent shall pay all
reasonable fees and expenses, including fees and expenses of counsel, that may
be incurred by any indemnified person in enforcing the indemnity and
other obligations provided for in this Section. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no person shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Section 6.8(a) with respect to any actual or alleged acts or omissions
constituting (i) a breach of this Agreement or the Voting Agreement, (ii)
criminal conduct or (iii) any violation of federal, state or foreign
securities Laws relating to trading in any securities or the disclosure of
nonpublic information, except to the extent such person is otherwise entitled
to indemnification pursuant to the Existing Indemnification Provisions.

(b) Parent agrees that the Company and, from and after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect for not less
than six years from the Effective Time the insurance coverage provided under
the policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by
the Company at the date of this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that in no
event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to pay an annual premium for
such coverage in excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid by the
Company prior to the date of this Agreement, it being understood that if the
annual premiums payable for such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent
shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available
for a cost equal to such amount. Notwithstanding anything contained in the
previous sentence, the Company may obtain a prepaid tail policy (the " _Tail
Policy_ ") prior to the Effective Time, which policy provides
Indemnified Persons with directors and officers liability insurance for a
period ending no earlier than the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time;
_provided_ that the aggregate premium for the Tail Policy shall not exceed
$25,000,000. Parents obligations under this paragraph may be satisfied by
the purchase of a Tail Policy that provides the coverage described above.
Except as permitted by the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.8(b), the
Company shall not purchase any directors and officers liability insurance,
including any Tail Policy, on or after the date of this Agreement without the
written approval of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned), except in connection with any expiration of the Companys
current directors and officers liability insurance policy (it being
understood that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, upon the expiration of the Companys current directors and
officers liability insurance policy, the Company may replace such policy with
a policy having substantially the same level and scope of coverage).



 

37 Section 6.9 _Employee Benefits_.

(a) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall honor, and cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor, in accordance with their terms, all Company Plans,
all severance and separation pay plans, agreements and arrangements, and
written employment, severance, retention, change in control and termination
policies and agreements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent shall honor, in accordance with their terms, and cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor, all rights to vacation, personal and sick days accrued
by employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries under any Company
Plans in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. Until the first
anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, and cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide, to employees of the Company and Company
Subsidiaries who remain employed with the Surviving Corporation and
its subsidiaries (the " _Continuing Employees_ "), employee benefits under
employee benefit plans of Parent or its subsidiaries that are in the aggregate
not materially less favorable than those provided to such Continuing
Employees pursuant to Company Plans in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any equity or equity-based plans, programs or
arrangements, post-retirement welfare plans or defined benefit pension plans,
which in each case, shall not be taken into account for any purpose in making
such determination, taking into account the changes to the Company Plans
previously disclosed to Parent or subsequently agreed between Parent and the
Company). Nothing herein shall prohibit any changes to any Company Plan that
are (i) required by Law (including any applicable qualification requirements
of Section 401(a) of the Code); (ii) necessary as a technical matter to
reflect the transactions contemplated hereby; or (iii) required for the
Surviving Corporation to provide for or permit investment in its securities or
Parents securities. Furthermore, nothing herein shall (a) require Parent to
continue any particular Company Plan or Company Benefit Agreement or prevent
the amendment or termination thereof, subject to the obligation to provide
severance pay and benefits as provided above, or (b) shall require Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation to
continue to employ any particular Company employee following the Effective
Time.

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plans in which the Continuing
Employees first become eligible to participate, solely to the extent that
Parent makes such plan or program available to employees of the Surviving
Corporation, on or after the Effective Time, and in which the
Continuing Employees did not participate prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall, subject to any required approval of the applicable insurance provider,
if any, (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the
Continuing Employees under any such new plans in which such Continuing
Employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, except to
the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would
apply under the analogous Company Plan; (ii) provide each Continuing Employee
with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective
Time (to the same extent such credit was given under the analogous Company
Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or
out-of-pocket requirements under any such new plan in which such Continuing
Employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time; (iii)
recognize all service of such Continuing Employees for purposes of eligibility
to participate, vesting and vacation entitlement in any such new plan in which
such Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate after the
Effective Time; and (iv) with respect to flexible spending accounts, provide
each Continuing Employee of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with a
credit for any salary reduction contributions made thereto and a debit for any
expenses incurred thereunder with respect to the plan year in which the
Effective Time occurs; _provided_ that the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv)
shall not apply to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits.

(c) Without limiting the obligations of Purchaser under Section 6.9(a) with
respect to the employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries who are
employed primarily outside the United States, following the Effective Time,
Parent and its subsidiaries will provide such employees with employee benefits
in accordance with applicable Law.



 

38 (d) No provision of this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting or
limiting the ability of Parent or the Surviving Company to amend, modify or
terminate any plans, programs, policies, arrangements, agreements or
understandings of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Company. Without
limiting the scope of Section 9.6, nothing in this Section 6.9 shall confer
any rights or remedies of any kind or description upon any Participant or any
other person other than Parent, the Company and their respective successors
and assigns.

Section 6.10 _Shareholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any shareholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether commenced prior to or
after the execution and delivery of this Agreement; _provided,_ that (subject
to the following sentence) the Company shall control such defense and
settlement, and in no event shall Parent have the right or power to settle
such litigation. The Company agrees that it shall not settle or make an offer
to settle any litigation commenced against the Company or any of its
directors by any shareholder of the Company relating to this Agreement, the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, without the
prior written consent of Parent.

Parent or Subsidiary shall not have performed or complied in any material

41 Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the
Company pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.1, this Agreement
forthwith shall become void and there shall be no liability or further
obligation under or in respect of this Agreement on the part of the Company,
Parent, Subsidiary or their respective officers or directors, other than the
last sentence of Section 6.5, Section 6.7, this Section 8.2 and Article IX,
all of which shall survive, and except to the extent that such termination
results from a willful breach by a party of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement.

(b) The Company agrees that a fee (a " _Termination Fee_ ") shall be payable
under certain circumstances following a termination of this Agreement, as
follows:

Section 8.1(b)(iii) and after the date of this Agreement and before the
Shareholders Meeting an Acquisition Proposal by a third party has been
publicly disclosed or announced and not subsequently withdrawn and within one
year after the termination, the Company shall consummate a transaction or
enter into a definitive agreement or agreement in principle for an Acquisition
Proposal (replacing for this purpose, references to "25%" with "40%") (an "
_Alternative Transaction_ "), (y) is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section
8.1(d)(i), or (z) is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section
8.1(b)(iii) and before the Shareholders Meeting the Companys Board of

entering into a definitive agreement or an agreement in principle providing

this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the
amount due pursuant to Section 8.2(b), and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amount of the Termination Fee from the date such
payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the prime rate of
Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. In this Agreement, unless

whole and not to any particular Article, Section or other subdivision, (b) the

persons subsidiaries, or (z) by such first person and one or more of its

wholly owned by any other person shall be a subsidiary of such other person

construed against any party solely because that party or its legal
representative drafted the provision.

Section 9.10 _Jurisdiction_. Each of the Company, Parent and Subsidiary hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally consents and agrees to submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and of the
United States of America located in the State of New York (the " _New York
Courts_ ") for any litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any
litigation relating thereto except in such courts), waives any objection to
the laying of venue of any such litigation in the New York Courts and agrees
not to plead or claim in any New York Court that such litigation brought
therein has been brought in an inconvenient forum; _provided, however,_ that
nothing in this Section 9.10 is intended to waive the right of any party to
remove any such action or proceeding commenced in any such state court to an
appropriate federal court that is a New York Court to the extent the basis for
such removal exists under applicable Law.

Section 9.11 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms
hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity.



 

45 Section 9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this

represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event
of any action, suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and
(b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to
enter into this Agreement, by, among other things, the mutual waiver and
certifications in this Section 9.12.

Section 9.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of
which shall constitute one and the same agreement. 

Section 9.14 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents and
instruments referred to herein), the Voting Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement. No representation, warranty, promise,
