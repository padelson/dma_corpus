ARTICLE 2 
 PURCHASE AND SALE 

  

 Section 2.01. _Purchase and Sale_. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller shall sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver the Interests to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase the Interests from Seller, in exchange for the aggregate cash consideration described herein. The aggregate cash consideration to be paid to Seller by Buyer for the purchase of the Interests shall be the Final Purchase Price, an estimate of which, the Closing Purchase Price, shall be payable at Closing as provided in _Section 2.02_.

   

 (b) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Closing Purchase Price_ " means (i) $1,925,000,000 _minus_ (ii) the amount of the Secured Indebtedness _minus_ (iii) the amount of Estimated Indebtedness _plus_ (iv) the amount of Estimated Cash _minus_ (v) the absolute value of the amount, if any, by which the Target Net Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital determined in accordance with _Section 2.03(a)_  _plus_ (vi) the absolute value of the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital as determined in accordance with _Section 2.03(a)_ exceeds the Target Net Working Capital _minus_ (vii) the value of the Accrued Vacation Liability. The Closing Purchase Price as finally adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.03_ below is referred to herein as the " _Final Purchase Price_." 

 

 Section 2.02. _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the purchase and sale of the Interests hereunder shall take place at the offices of Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP, 200 Park Avenue, New York, New York, as soon as possible, but in no event later than two (2) Business Days, after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, waiver of all of the conditions set forth in _Article 7_ (other than any conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), or at such other time or place as Buyer and Seller may agree in writing. At the Closing:

   

 (a) Buyer shall deliver to Seller (or one or more Affiliates of Seller as designated prior to the Closing by Seller) an amount equal to the Closing Purchase Price in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account of Seller (or one or more Affiliates of Seller as designated prior to the Closing by Seller) designated by Seller to Buyer in writing not less than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date; 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Seller shall deliver an instrument in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer assigning the Interests to Buyer; 

  

 (c) Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer a certification to the effect that it is not a "foreign person" within the meaning of Section 1445 of the Code; and 

  

 (d) Buyer shall repay or cause to be repaid, on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries, all amounts necessary to discharge fully the then-outstanding balance of the Secured Indebtedness. 

 

 Section 2.03. _Closing Estimates; Final Purchase Price._ (a) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement including (i) the amount of Secured Indebtedness to be outstanding at Closing and (ii) a good faith estimate of the Companys (x) Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Closing Net Working Capital_ "), (y) Indebtedness, excluding Secured Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Indebtedness_ ") and (z) Cash (the " _Estimated Cash_ "), each determined as of the close of business on the day prior to the Closing Date (and without giving effect to the transactions contemplated herein), based on the Companys books and records and other information available at the time and calculated on a basis consistent with _Section 2.03_ of the Disclosure Schedules. Such statement shall be accompanied by a payoff letter (the " _Payoff Letter_ ") with respect to the Secured Indebtedness, which Payoff Letter shall be in form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and shall contain customary terms, which may include (A) the payoff amount, including principal, accrued but unpaid interest, fees, prepayment costs or penalties, make-whole premiums or similar costs (including a per diem amount or calculation through the day immediately preceding the Closing Date) of the Secured Indebtedness to which it relates, (B) authorize Buyer, following the payment in full of such Secured Indebtedness, to file any financing statements or take any other actions necessary to terminate any outstanding Liens relating to such Indebtedness, and (C) state that upon payment in full of the Secured Indebtedness to which it relates, all Liens related to such Secured Indebtedness will be released and the Company shall have no further Liability related to such Indebtedness other than customary indemnification obligations.

   

 (b) As promptly as practicable after the Closing, but in no event later than forty-five (45) days after the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), which shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP ( _provided_ that the Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Net Working Capital shall (i) be based exclusively on the facts and circumstances as they exist as of the close of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date and shall exclude the effects of any event, act, change in circumstances or similar development arising or occurring thereafter (including on the Closing Date), (ii) not reflect, directly or indirectly, any additional reserve or accrual that is not reflected in the Financial Statements and (iii) need not contain footnote disclosures) and, in the case of the Net Working Capital, Indebtedness and Cash, be determined on a basis consistent with  _Section 2.03_ of the Disclosure Schedules and the accounting principles and practices used or referred to herein and therein, in the same way, using the same methodologies, principles, conventions, policies and procedures (including any exclusions or deviations from GAAP and the methodology used by the Company with respect to accruals and reserves used to prepare the estimates described in _Section 2.03(a)_) that the 

   ##### 

  

    

Company used in calculating the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital,
Estimated Indebtedness and Estimated Cash, and, on that basis, set
forth Sellers calculation of Net Working Capital (the " _Closing Net Working
Capital_ "), Indebtedness (the " _Closing Indebtedness_ ") and Cash (the "
_Closing Cash_ "). To the extent any actions on or following the Closing with
respect to the accounting books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries on which the Closing Balance Sheet and the foregoing
calculations are to be based are not consistent with the Companys past
practices, such changes shall not be taken into account in preparing the
Closing Balance Sheet or calculating the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness and Closing Cash. In order for Seller to prepare the Closing
Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and Closing Cash, Buyer and the
Company shall, and Buyer shall cause the Company to, (i) permit Seller and
its Representatives to have reasonable access to the books, records and other
documents (including work papers, schedules, financial statements, memoranda,
etc.) and shall cooperate with Seller and its Representatives in seeking to
obtain work papers from Buyer and the Company pertaining to or necessary for
the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of the
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and Closing Cash and
provide Seller with copies thereof (as reasonably requested by Seller) and
(ii) provide Seller and its Representatives reasonable access to Buyers and
the Companys and its Subsidiaries employees and accountants as reasonably
requested by Seller. If Buyer disagrees with any part of Sellers calculation
of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and/or Closing Cash,
as set forth on the Closing Balance Sheet, Buyer shall, within thirty (30)
days after Buyers receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet, notify Seller in
writing of such disagreement by setting forth Buyers calculation of the
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and/or Closing Cash, as
applicable, and describing the basis for such disagreement (an "
_Objection Notice_ "). In order for Buyer to review the Closing Net Working
Capital, Closing Indebtedness and Closing Cash, Seller shall (i) permit Buyer
and its Representatives to have reasonable access to the books, records and
other documents (including work papers, schedules, financial
statements, memoranda, etc.) and shall cooperate with Buyer and its
Representatives in seeking to obtain work papers from Seller pertaining to or
used in connection with the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the
calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and
Closing Cash and provide Buyer with copies thereof (as reasonably requested
by Buyer) and (ii) provide Buyer and its Representatives reasonable access to
Sellers employees and accountants as reasonably requested by Buyer. If an
Objection Notice is delivered to Seller, then Buyer and Seller shall negotiate
in good faith to resolve their disagreements with respect to the computation
of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and/or Closing Cash.
In the event that Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve all such
disagreements within thirty (30) days after Sellers receipt of
such Objection Notice, Buyer and Seller shall submit such remaining
disagreements to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or another nationally recognized
certified public independent accounting firm as is reasonably acceptable to
Buyer and Seller (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "). 

  

 (c) Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accounting Firm to resolve all remaining disagreements with respect to the computation of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and/or Closing Cash identified in the Objection Notice as soon as practicable, but in any event shall direct the Independent Accounting Firm to render a determination within thirty (30) days after its retention. The Independent Accounting Firm shall consider only those items and amounts in Buyers and Sellers respective calculations of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and/or 

   ##### 

  

    

Closing Cash that are identified as being items and amounts as to which Buyer
and Seller have been unable to agree. In resolving any disputed item, the
Independent Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than
the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The Independent
Accounting Firms determination of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness and/or Closing Cash, as the case may be, shall be based solely
on written materials submitted by Buyer and Seller ( _i.e._ , not on
independent review) and on the definition of "Net Working Capital," "Closing
Indebtedness," and "Closing Cash" included herein. The determination of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties
hereto and shall not be subject to appeal or further review, absent manifest
error. 

  

 (d) The costs and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm in determining the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and/or Closing Cash, as the case may be, shall be borne 50% by Buyer and 50% by Seller. 

  

 (e) Within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash and Closing Indebtedness are finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.03_: 

   

 (i) if the Net Adjustment Amount is positive, Buyer shall promptly deliver to Seller the Net Adjustment Amount; 

   

 (ii) if the Net Adjustment Amount is negative, Seller shall promptly deliver to Buyer the absolute value of the Net Adjustment Amount; and 

   

 (iii) any payment to be made pursuant to this _Section 2.03(e)_ (the " _Purchase Price Adjustments_ ") shall include interest on the excess or deficiency, as applicable, at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate of interest reported from time to time in _The Wall Street Journal_ , calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed from the Closing Date to the date of payment, divided by 360. All Purchase Price Adjustments, other than payments of stated interest, shall (x) be treated by all parties for Tax purposes as adjustments to the Final Purchase Price and (y) be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by Buyer and/or Seller, as applicable. The obligations of Seller described in this _Section 2.03(e)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer for any and all claims arising under this Agreement with respect to this _Section 2.03(e)_. 

   

 (iv) For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Net Adjustment Amount_ " shall mean an amount equal to (1) the excess, if any, of the Closing Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.03_ (" _Final Net Working Capital_ ") over the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, _minus_ (2) the excess, if any, of the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital over the Final Net Working Capital, _plus_ (3) the excess, if any, of the Closing Cash as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.03_ (" _Final Cash_ ") over the Estimated Cash, _minus_ (4) the excess, if any, of the Estimated Cash over the Final Cash, _minus_ (5) the excess, if any, of the Closing Indebtedness as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.03_ (" _Final Indebtedness_ ") over the sum of the Secured Indebtedness and Estimated Indebtedness,  _plus_ (6) the excess, if any, of the 

   ##### 

  

    

sum of the Secured Indebtedness and the Estimated Indebtedness over the Final
Indebtedness. 

 

 Section 2.04. _Purchase Price Allocation_. The sale and purchase of the Interests shall be treated for Tax purposes as the sale and purchase of the assets of the Company (except that for franchise Tax purposes in the State of Texas the sale and purchase shall be treated as a sale of Interests) and no party hereto or any controlled Affiliate thereof shall take any position inconsistent with such treatment. Seller and Buyer agree that the Final Purchase Price (and any assumed liabilities as determined for Tax purposes) will be allocated among the assets of the Company for all Tax purposes in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. No later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer for Buyers review and approval, a copy of the Form 8594 and any required exhibits thereto (the " _Asset Acquisition Statement_ ") allocating the Final Purchase Price (and any assumed liabilities as determined for Tax purposes) among the Companys assets. Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer, from time to time, for Buyers review and approval revised copies of the Asset Acquisition Statement (the " _Revised Statements_ ") so as to reflect any matters on the Asset Acquisition Statement that need updating (including Purchase Price Adjustments, if any). Within thirty (30) days of delivery of the Asset Acquisition Statement or the Revised Statements, as the case may be, Buyer shall review such statements; and if Buyer agrees on the allocation of the Final Purchase Price (and any assumed liabilities as determined for Tax purposes) (which shall be evidenced by an Asset Acquisition Statement or the Revised Statements signed by each of Buyer and Seller), Buyer, Seller and their respective controlled Affiliates shall file all Tax Returns and information reports in a manner consistent with such agreed allocation and shall take no position inconsistent therewith. In the event that Buyer and Seller are unable to agree on such allocation within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Asset Acquisition Statement or the Revised Statements, as the case may be, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to reach agreement. In the event that the parties cannot reach an agreement on the disputed allocations, Buyer and Seller shall submit the disputed allocations for resolution to the Independent Accounting Firm, which shall, within thirty (30) days after submission, report to the parties hereto its determination on such disputed allocations. The allocations determined by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon Buyer and Seller, and Buyer, Seller and their respective controlled Affiliates shall file all Tax Returns and information reports (including, without limitation, Form 8594) in a manner consistent with such determination. Each of Buyer and Seller shall bear all fees and costs incurred by it in connection with the disputed allocations, except that all costs and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm relating to the disputed allocations shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller.

event shall Buyer or any of its Affiliates be required to, or required to
agree to, hold separate or divest any businesses or properties or assets in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, or terminate any
existing relationships and contractual rights and obligations, that have
generated in excess of $50,000,000 of revenues, in the aggregate, during the
twelve (12) month period prior to the date hereof. 

 

 Section 6.07. _Public Announcements_. Prior to and with respect to the Closing, the parties agree to consult with each other before issuing any press release or making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and, except for any press releases and public announcements which may be required by Applicable Law or any listing agreement with any national securities exchange where such prior consultation is not reasonably practicable, will not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation.

  

 Section 6.08. _Surety Bonds._ As soon as practicable after the Closing, Buyer will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain Sellers and any of its Affiliates release from any surety bonds of the Company and its Subsidiaries set forth in _Section 6.08_ of the Disclosure Schedules.

Seller shall have no obligation to keep such surety bonds in effect from and after the Closing.

  

 Section 6.09. _Employee Matters_. (a) Not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer agrees to make, or to cause the Company or a Subsidiary or another Affiliate of Buyer (" _Employer_ ") to make, a Qualifying Offer of employment to each of the Employees whose names and positions are set forth in _Section 4.15(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedules, excluding any such Employee who is not actively at work and not on Approved Leave (the " _Offered Employees_ "). For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Qualifying Offer_ " shall (i) be an offer of employment, consistent with the terms of this _Section 6.09_, to an Offered Employee for employment with Employer, (ii) be made on or before the Closing Date and confirmed in a letter (the " _Offer Letter_ ") within a reasonable time thereafter, (iii) be at a base salary or wage rate not less than the base salary or wage rate set forth in _Section 4.15(b)_ of the

    ##### 

  

     

Disclosure Schedules and in effect for such Offered Employee as an Employee
of Seller as of the date of this Agreement, (iv) offer employment at a
principal work place no more than 30 miles distant from such Offered
Employees principal work place as of the date of the Qualifying Offer, (v)
provide for bonus opportunities and employee benefits no less favorable in
the aggregate than those provided to similarly-situated employees of Buyer,
(vi) provide that such employment will be effective (contingent upon the
Closing and the Offered Employees timely acceptance of the Qualifying Offer
in accordance with its terms and conditions) as of the Closing Date, and
(vii) otherwise be consistent with Employers standard terms, conditions and
policies of employment and the terms hereof; _provided_ that Buyer shall be
entitled to specify in each Offer Letter that (i) the employment of each
Offered Employee is subject to termination at any time by Buyer subsequent to
the Closing and (ii) the base salary or wage rate, bonus opportunities and
other terms of employment may be changed at any time by Buyer subsequent to
the Closing, in each case consistent with the terms of this Agreement and
Employers standard terms, conditions and policies of employment. An Offered
Employee who signifies his or her acceptance of a Qualifying Offer, but does
not report for work as specified in the Qualifying Offer and does not
otherwise satisfy each of the terms and conditions of such Qualifying
Offer, shall be deemed not to have accepted the Qualifying Offer. An Offered
Employee who accepts and complies with the terms and conditions of a
Qualifying Offer shall become an employee of Employer (a " _Transferred
Employee_ ") as of the following date and time (the " _Employment Date_ "):
(i) in the case of an Offered Employee who is actively at work on the Closing
Date, 12:00 a.m. of the day after the Closing Date, (ii) in the case of an
Offered Employee who is on Approved Leave on the Closing Date, upon such
Offered Employees report to his or her assigned work location and the
inception of his or her rendering to Employer services for
compensation immediately upon the end of the Approved Leave and otherwise in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Qualifying Offer and (iii) in
the case of any Offered Employee not actively at work on the Closing Date and
not on Approved Leave whom Buyer decides in its sole discretion to hire, such
date as Employer may determine (subject to the Offered Employees satisfaction
of the terms and conditions of the Qualifying Offer). In the case of an
Offered Employee who is on Approved Leave, acceptance of the Qualifying Offer
and employment with Employer shall be conditioned upon the Offered Employees
timely provision of a medical release or other documentation reasonably
satisfactory to Employer which evidences the Offered Employees ability to
perform the essential functions of his or her regular work, with or without
reasonable accommodation, and the Offered Employees return to active work
with Employer no later than immediately upon the end of the leave of
absence. 

   

 (b) Each Transferred Employee shall be terminated by Seller or its Affiliates and shall cease active participation in the Seller Employee Plans prior to such Transferred Employees Employment Date. 

  

 (c) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, Employer shall, or shall cause the Company or a Subsidiary to, provide each Transferred Employee who remains employed by Employer with a base salary or wage rate that is comparable to what Seller provided such Employee prior to the Closing Date, and with bonus opportunities and employee benefits that are, in the aggregate, comparable to those provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer. To the extent permitted by the applicable plan, program or arrangement ( _provided_ that the following provision shall apply in all events to vacation benefits), the Transferred Employees shall receive credit for all periods of employment and/or 

   ##### 

  

    

service with Seller and its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date for purposes
of eligibility, vesting, early retirement determinations and benefit accrual
under all plans, programs and arrangements made available to such Transferred
Employees, except for purposes of benefit accruals under defined benefit
pension plans unless required by Applicable Law. 

  

 (d) In the event the employment of a Transferred Employee is terminated by Employer without cause within twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, and the terminated Transferred Employee executes and delivers a general release and waiver of claims reasonably acceptable to Employer that becomes irrevocable, such employee shall be eligible for severance benefits no less favorable than those afforded by the severance plan included in _Section 6.09(d)_ of the Disclosure Schedules (the " _Company s Severance Plan_"). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this  _Section 6.09(d)_ shall prohibit the termination of any Transferred Employee for cause. 

  

 (e) Buyer agrees to have, or cause to be, in effect on the Closing Date a defined contribution plan or plans with a salary reduction arrangement, the terms of which meet the requirements of Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code (such plan or plans, the " _Buyer Savings Plan_ ") and, subject to the applicable provisions of the Code and the Buyer Savings Plan, shall allow participation by Transferred Employees on terms no less favorable than those applicable to similarly situated employees of Buyer commencing on the Employment Date. Transferred Employees eligible to participate in the Buyer Savings Plan shall be permitted to roll over their vested account balances from Sellers tax-qualified defined contribution plan (the " _Seller Savings Plan_ ") into the Buyer Savings Plan in accordance with the terms of each such plan, ERISA and the Code. Any such rollover may be accomplished by a direct rollover, which may include any loan or promissory note outstanding and representing properly granted non-defaulted participant loans from the Seller Savings Plan in accordance with the applicable provisions of that plan, ERISA and Section 402 of the Code. 

  

 (f) Each Transferred Employee and his or her eligible dependents who are participating in a Seller welfare benefit plan shall be permitted to participate in Buyers or Employers corresponding welfare benefit plan (" _Buyer Welfare Benefit Plan_ ") on such Transferred Employees Employment Date. Buyer agrees that each Buyer Welfare Benefit Plan shall waive any pre-existing medical condition restrictions, and recognize the co-payments and deductible expenses of each Transferred Employee and each Transferred Employees eligible dependents incurred under Sellers corresponding welfare benefits plans immediately prior to such Transferred Employees Employment Date. Seller shall remain liable under and responsible for compliance with COBRA with respect to group health benefits of Transferred Employees (and their qualified beneficiaries as defined in COBRA) for qualifying events that occur before the Closing Date and with respect to all other current and former employees (and their qualified beneficiaries as defined in COBRA) who are not Transferred Employees regardless of when the qualifying event occurs. 

  

 (g) Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall assume all responsibilities and obligations for continuation coverage under Sections 601 _et seq._ of ERISA (" _COBRA Obligations_ ") and any state continuation coverage requirements with respect to "qualifying events" under COBRA that occur for any Transferred Employee and his/her beneficiaries under a Buyer group health plan after such Transferred Employees Employment Date. Seller agrees that 

   ##### 

  

    

it shall retain responsibility for all other COBRA Obligations for Employees
and their qualified beneficiaries. 

  

 (h) Buyer shall assume responsibility for the accrued and unused vacation of the Transferred Employees determined through the Closing Date under Sellers vacation policy (the " _Accrued Vacation Liability_ "). For periods of employment with Buyer beginning with the Employment Date, each Transferred Employees vacation and paid time off benefits shall be determined under the terms of Buyers vacation plans and policies and shall be Buyers responsibility. 

  

 (i) Buyer shall assume responsibility for making wage differential payments and providing employee benefits to any Employee who is on military leave at the time of the Closing, pursuant to a policy of Buyer or Employer that includes the same terms and conditions as applicable under Sellers military leave policy as in effect on the date hereof. 

  

 (j) Seller agrees to provide, as soon as reasonably practicable following the request thereof, complete and accurate information as Buyer or Employer shall reasonably request in connection with Buyers or Employers performance of any obligation under this _Section 6.09_, including the recognition by the Buyer Welfare Benefit Plans of the co-payments and deductible expenses of each Transferred Employee and each Transferred Employees eligible dependents incurred under Sellers welfare benefit plans. 

  

 (k) Nothing herein express or implied by this Agreement shall (a) confer upon any Employee, or legal representative thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment or benefits for any specified period, of any nature or kind whatsoever, under or by reason of this Agreement, (b) be deemed to amend any Employee Plan of Seller, Buyer or any of their Affiliates, or (c) require Buyer, the Company or any Affiliate to amend any existing, or establish any new, Employee Plan. 

 

 Section 6.10. _Tax Matters_. (a) Buyer shall be responsible for any and all excise, sales, use, stamp, transfer, documentary, filing, recordation, value added Taxes and other similar Taxes and fees, if any, that are actually incurred as a result of the purchase and the sale of the Interests, together with any interest, additions or penalties with respect thereto and interest thereon (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ").

 (b) Tax Returns. 

   

 (i) Seller shall prepare and timely file or cause to be prepared and timely filed all Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries required to be filed for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Period_ ").

 (ii) Buyer shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to prepare and timely file all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than Tax Returns required to be prepared and filed by Seller pursuant to _Section 6.10(b)(i)_). To the extent that any income Tax Return is to be filed with respect 

   ##### 

  

    

to a taxable period of the Company or its Subsidiaries that begins before and
ends after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), Buyer shall provide
such Tax Returns (each, a " _Straddle Period Return_ ") to Seller for
Sellers review and approval at least 60 days prior to the deadline for
filing such Tax Return. Seller shall have a period of twenty-one (21)
days following receipt of a Straddle Period Return to provide Buyer with a
statement of any disputed items with respect to the Straddle Period Returns.
In the event Seller and Buyer are unable to reach agreement with respect to
any disputed items within a period of thirty (30) days thereafter, such
dispute shall be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm. Seller shall
pay all Taxes imposed on the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
the pre-Closing portion of any Straddle Period (allocated in the manner set
forth in _Section 6.10(c)_ ) except to the extent that such Taxes have been
(i) paid on or before the Closing Date or (ii) included as liabilities in the
Closing Net Working Capital. Subject to  _Section 6.10(c)_ hereof, Buyer
shall pay or cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to pay all other Taxes

 (iii) For purposes of this _Section 6.10(c)_, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax which relates to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period shall be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date. 

   ##### 

  

    

However, exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an
annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be apportioned
ratably between such periods on a daily basis. 

   

 (iv) The indemnifications provided by this _Section 6.10(c)_ shall survive the Closing Date until ninety (90) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.

With respect to Taxes described in the preceding sentence, Seller shall have the right to determine whether any claim for refund or credits of Taxes shall be made by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to a period (or portion thereof) prior to Closing, and if Seller elects to make such a claim, Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall, upon Sellers request and at Sellers expense, cooperate in connection therewith, including the preparation of any Tax Return that is required to be filed by the Company and its Subsidiaries.

such leasing activity shall not allow for sub-leasing of such storage space
as an ongoing commercial activity, (x) any lease of any transportation
services on an NGL pipeline, (y) any lease of fractionation services or (z)
the purchase of products, in each case, from any operator in any of the
regions or markets referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph; (ii)
trading (in both the physical and financial markets), processing (including

 (c) It is agreed by the parties that the foregoing covenant imposes a reasonable restraint on Seller in light of the activities and businesses of Buyer on the date hereof and the current plans of Buyer for the businesses referred to in _Section 6.13(a)_ from and after Closing. Additionally, because of the difficulty of measuring economic losses to Buyer as a result of a breach of the foregoing covenant, and because of the immediate and irreparable damage that could be caused to Buyer for which it may not have any other adequate remedy, Seller agrees that Buyer may seek to enforce the foregoing covenant by seeking to obtain injunctions, restraining orders and other equitable actions; provided, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall in no manner restrict Sellers right to defend any claim asserted by Buyer with respect to this _Section 6.13_.

It is agreed by the parties that the foregoing covenant imposes a reasonable restraint on Seller and its controlled Affiliates in light of the activities and businesses of Buyer on the date hereof and the current plans of Buyer for its businesses from and after Closing. Additionally, because of the difficulty of measuring economic losses to Buyer as a result of a breach of the foregoing covenant, and because of the immediate and irreparable damage that could be caused to Buyer, for which it would have no other adequate remedy, Seller agrees that Buyer may seek to enforce the foregoing covenant by injunctions, restraining orders and other equitable actions; _provided_  the foregoing shall in no manner restrict Sellers right to defend any claim.

ARTICLE 8 
 TERMINATION 

  

 Section 8.01. _Grounds for Termination._ This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing:

   

 (a) by mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer; 

  

 (b) by either Seller or Buyer, if the Closing shall not have been consummated on or before September 1, 2011 (the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01(b)_ shall not be available to any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement results in the failure of the Closing to be consummated by such time; 

  

 (c) by Seller, if Buyer breaches or fails to perform in any respect any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement and such breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.03_, (ii) cannot be cured or, if curable, has not been cured prior to the earlier of thirty (30) days following receipt by Buyer of written notice of such breach or failure to perform or two (2) Business Days prior to the Termination Date, and (iii) has not been waived by Seller; 

  

 (d) by Buyer, if Seller breaches or fails to perform in any respect any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement and such breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.02_, (ii) cannot be 

   ##### 

  

    

cured or, if curable, has not been cured prior to the earlier of thirty (30)
days following receipt by Seller of written notice of such breach or failure
to perform or two (2) Business Days prior to the Termination Date, and (iii)
has not been waived by Buyer; 

  

 (e) by Seller, if all of the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.01_ and _7.02_  have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied other than at the Closing), Buyer fails to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.02_ and Seller and the Company stood ready and willing to consummate on that date; 

  

 (f) by Buyer, if all of the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.01_ and _7.03_  have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied other than at the Closing), Seller or the Company fails to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.02_ and Buyer stood ready and willing to consummate on that date; or 

  

 (g) by either Seller or Buyer, if consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or by the other Transaction Documents would violate any nonappealable final order, decree or judgment of any Governmental Authority having competent jurisdiction. The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01_ shall give written notice of such termination to the other parties. 

 

 Section 8.02. _Effect of Termination_.

The provisions of this  _Section 8.02_ and _Section 6.02(b)_ and _Article 10_ shall survive any termination hereof pursuant to _Section 8.01_.

   

ARTICLE 9 
 SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION 

  

 Section 9.01. _Survival._ The representations and warranties of the parties under this Agreement shall survive the Closing until the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ that (i) the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 3.01_, _3.02_ , _3.05_ ,  _3.06_ , _4.01(a)_ , _4.02_ , _4.04_ , _4.19_ , _5.01_ ,  _5.02_ , and _5.07_ (the " _Fundamental Representations_ ") shall survive the Closing until the five (5) year anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.17_ shall survive until ninety (90) days after the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the relevant Tax. The covenants and agreements of the parties hereto contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing in accordance with their terms. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, any inaccurate or breached representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Agreement shall survive the time at which it would otherwise terminate pursuant to the preceding sentences, if notice of the inaccuracy or breach thereof giving rise to

   ##### 

  

    

such right of indemnity shall have properly been given to the party against
whom such indemnity may be sought prior to the time at which it would
otherwise terminate pursuant to the preceding sentences. 

  

 Section 9.02. _Indemnification_. (a) Effective after the Closing, subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article 9_ , Seller hereby indemnifies Buyer and its Affiliates against, and shall hold each of them harmless from, any and all damages, losses, fines, settlement payments, awards, penalties, interest and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) (" _Damages_ ") actually incurred or suffered by Buyer or any of its Affiliates to the extent relating to or arising out of (i) any breach or inaccuracy of any of the representations and warranties of Seller or the Company contained in this Agreement (determined without regard to any materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualification contained therein) (each such breach or inaccuracy, a " _Warranty Breach_ "), (ii) any breach of covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Seller or, prior to the Closing, the Company pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) the Excluded Businesses, (iv) any assumption or guarantee (whether direct, contingent or otherwise) by the Company or any Subsidiary in respect of indebtedness for borrowed money or other obligations of any Person (other than any indebtedness or other obligations of the Company or any Subsidiary) or (v) the Seller Employee Plans or any Company Employee Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Seller be required to indemnify Buyer for any for any single Warranty Breach unless the aggregate amount of Damages with respect thereto exceeds $2,500,000 (each, a " _Qualifying Warranty Breach_ "). In addition, (1) Seller shall not be liable to indemnify Buyer for any Damages arising out of any Qualifying Warranty Breach unless and until the aggregate amount of Damages with respect to all Qualifying Warranty Breaches exceeds 2.5% of the Final Purchase Price and then only to the extent of such excess, and (2) Sellers maximum Liability for all Qualifying Warranty Breaches shall not exceed 15% of the Final Purchase Price;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the limitations set forth in the foregoing clauses (1) and (2) shall not apply to a Qualifying Warranty Breach to the extent relating to _Section 4.17_ or a Fundamental Representation.

   

 (b) Effective after the Closing, subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article 9_ , Buyer hereby indemnifies Seller and its Affiliates against, and shall hold each of them harmless from, any and all Damages actually incurred or suffered by Seller or any of its Affiliates to the extent relating to or arising out of (i) any breach or inaccuracy of any of the representations and warranties of Buyer contained in this Agreement (determined without regard to any materiality qualification contained therein) (each such breach or inaccuracy, a " _Buyer Warranty Breach_ ") or (ii) any breach of covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Buyer or, following the Closing, the Company pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Buyer be required to indemnify Seller for any for any single Buyer Warranty Breach unless the aggregate amount of Damages with respect thereto exceeds $2,500,000 (each, a " _Qualifying Buyer Warranty Breach_ "). In addition, (1) Buyer shall not be liable to indemnify Seller for any Damages arising out of any Qualifying Buyer Warranty Breach unless and until the aggregate amount of Damages with respect to all Qualifying Buyer Warranty Breaches exceeds 2.5% of the Final Purchase Price and then only to the extent of such excess, and (2) Buyers maximum Liability for all Qualifying Buyer Warranty Breaches shall not exceed 15% of the Final Purchase Price; _provided_ , _however_ , that the limitations set forth in the foregoing clauses (1) and (2) shall not apply to a Buyer Warranty Breach to the extent relating to a Fundamental Representation. 

   ##### 

  

 

 Section 9.03. _Third-Party Claim Procedures._ (a) The party seeking indemnification under _Section 9.02_ (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") agrees to give prompt notice in writing to the party against whom indemnity is to be sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of the assertion of any claim or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding by any third party (" _Third-Party Claim_ ") in respect of which indemnity may be sought under _Section 9.02_. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such Third-Party Claim and the basis for indemnification (taking into account the information then available to the Indemnified Party), including the specific representation claimed to have been breached or to be inaccurate and the calculation of Damages. So long as the notice thereof is given within the applicable survival period set forth in _Section 9.01_, the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations or Liability hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have actually prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third-Party Claim.

   

 (b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall continue to be entitled to assert any limitation of any claims contained in this _Article 9_. 

  

 (c) If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of any such Third-Party Claim, it shall within 30 days notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its intent to do so and the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof. The Indemnifying Party will have the right to assume control of such defense of the Third-Party Claim only for so long as it conducts such defense with reasonable diligence. The Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Parties advised of the status of such Third-Party Claim and the defense thereof on a reasonably current basis and shall consider in good faith the recommendations made by the Indemnified Parties with respect thereto. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the control of the defense of any Third-Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 9.03_, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any such Third-Party Claim and to employ, at its expense, separate counsel of its choice for such purpose, it being understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall continue to control such defense;  _provided_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the reasonable costs and expenses of such defense (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) of the Indemnified Party if (x) the Indemnified Partys outside counsel shall have reasonably concluded and advised the Indemnified Party in writing (with a copy to the Indemnifying Party) that there are defenses available to such Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party, or (y) the Indemnified Partys outside counsel shall have advised the Indemnified Party in writing (with a copy to the Indemnifying Party) that there is a conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct to have common counsel for the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party will not be permitted to settle, compromise, take any corrective or remedial action or enter into an agreed judgment or consent decree, in each case, 

   ##### 

  

    

that subjects the Indemnified Party to any criminal liability, requires an
admission of guilt or wrongdoing on the part of the Indemnified Party
or imposes any continuing obligation on or requires any payment from the
Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Partys prior written consent, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 

  

 (d) Each party shall reasonably cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to reasonably cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third-Party Claim and shall furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith. 

 

 Section 9.04. _Direct Claim Procedures._ If the Indemnified Party has a claim for indemnity under _Section 9.02_ against the Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees to give prompt notice in writing of such claim to the Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such claim and the basis for indemnification (taking into account the information then available to the Indemnified Party) and calculation of Damages. The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have actually prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

  

 Section 9.05. _Calculation of Damages_. (a) The amount of any Damages payable under _Section 9.02_ by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies or from any other Person alleged to be responsible therefor. If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Damages, subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or expense incurred by the Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification payment up to the amount actually received by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to collect any amounts available under insurance coverage, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible, for any Damages payable under _Section 9.02_.

   

 (b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under _Section 9.02_ for any (i) consequential, exemplary, punitive or indirect or special Damages or (ii) Damages for lost profits, except to the extent any such Damages are required to be paid in any Third-Party Claim for which such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Article 9_. 

  

 (c) To the extent an Indemnified Party is required by Applicable Law to mitigate Damages, such Indemnified Party shall comply with any such mitigation requirement. 

  

 (d) Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify Buyer or its Affiliates pursuant to  _Section 9.02_ to the extent the related Damages result or arise primarily from any disclosure or other communication to any Governmental Authority or other Third Party or any invasive sampling or testing of any building materials, soil, surface water, groundwater or other environmental media by or on behalf of Buyer or any of its Affiliates, except to the extent that such disclosure, communication, sampling or testing is undertaken (i) in order to comply with Applicable Law, (ii) at the request of a Governmental Authority, (iii) in order to defend against a 

   ##### 

  

    

claim brought by any Person, (iv) in connection with a bona fide construction
or repair project, or (v) in response to an emergency condition that in the
reasonable opinion of Buyer presents a potentially unreasonable risk to human
health, safety or the environment. 

  

 (e) Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify Buyer or its Affiliates pursuant to  _Section 9.02_ with respect to any Damages or alleged Damages to the extent that such Damages or alleged Damages were taken into account in the determination of Closing Net Working Capital. 

  

 (f) Any indemnity payment under this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for Tax purposes. 

 

 Section 9.06. _Exclusivity_. (a) Subject to the rights set forth in _Section 10.12_, from and after the Closing, except for the assertion of any claim based on fraud and for matters covered by the other Transaction Documents, the indemnification provisions of _Sections 6.08_ and _6.10_ and this _Article 9_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of each party and its Affiliates, regardless of Applicable Law or the legal theory under which any obligation or legal Liability may be sought to be imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity or otherwise, for any breach of the other partys representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.

   

 (b) Except as specifically set forth in this _Article 9_, effective as of the Closing, Buyer waives any rights and claims Buyer may have against Seller, whether in law or equity, relating to claims for contribution and other rights of recovery arising out of or relating to any Environmental Law (whether now or hereinafter in effect).

No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party hereto; _provided_ that Buyer may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any Affiliate of Buyer ( _provided_ that such Affiliate is organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, the State of New York or the State of Washington) without the consent of Seller so long as Buyer remains responsible for the performance of all its obligations hereunder and the Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect; and _provided_ , _further_ , Buyer may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the consent of Seller to a qualified intermediary organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, the State of New York or the State of Washington and/or a qualified exchange accommodation titleholder organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, the State of New York or the State of Washington (as that term is defined in Revenue Procedure 2000-37), in each case through a corporation or limited liability company formed in the State of Delaware, the State of New York or the State of Washington, in connection with any transaction described in _Section 6.10(g)_, provided that such assignment shall not relieve Buyer from any of its obligations or liabilities hereunder.

action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum,

Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such

This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts (including facsimile and electronic transmission counterparts), each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by the other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other parties hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other communication).

The parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the Disclosure Schedules may include certain items and information solely for informational purposes for the convenience of Buyer and (b) the disclosure by Seller of any matter in the Disclosure Schedules

    ##### 

  

     

shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment by Seller that the matter
is required to be disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or that the matter
is material. 

  

 Section 10.12. _Specific Performance._ The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof (including failing to take such actions as are required hereunder in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction. If, prior to the Termination Date, either party brings any action to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement by the other party, the Termination Date shall automatically be extended by (i) the amount of time during which such action is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days, or (ii) such other time period established by the court presiding over such action.

  

 Section 10.13. _Waiver of Conflicts; Attorney-Client Privilege._ (a) Buyer waives and will not assert, and Buyer agrees to cause its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) to waive and not to assert, any conflict of interest arising out of or relating to the representation, after the Closing (the " _Post-Closing Representation_ "), of Seller or any of its Affiliates or any present or former shareholder, officer, employee or director of Seller or any of its Affiliates (any such Person, a " _Designated Person_ ") in any matter involving this Agreement or any other agreements or transactions contemplated hereby or by any other Transaction Document, by any legal counsel currently representing Seller or any of its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement or any other agreements or transactions contemplated hereby or by any other Transaction Document (the " _Current Representation_ ").
