   ##### 

  

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound, the parties agree as follows:

The transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed to be effective at 12:01 a.m. (local time) on the Closing Date. 

  

 Section 1.2 _Purchase and Sale of Units and Blocker Interests._  

  

 (a) At the Closing, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, (x) each Genco Seller hereby agrees to sell to Buyer, and Buyer hereby agrees to purchase from such Genco Seller, all Units owned by such Genco Seller as of the Closing Date, and (y) each Blocker Seller hereby agrees to sell to Buyer, and Buyer hereby agrees to purchase from such Blocker Seller, all equity interests in the Blocker ("Blocker Interests") owned by such Blocker Seller as of the Closing Date, in each case free and clear of any and all Liens, for aggregate consideration from the Buyer in respect of the Units, Blocker Interests and Options equal to the sum of the following (together, the "Consideration"):

 (ii) immediately prior to the purchase and sale of Units, each holder of Options (each, an "Optionholder", and collectively, the "Optionholders") that are terminated in exchange for a cash payment immediately prior to the Closing pursuant to the second sentence of Section 1.4 (upon conversion of such Options pursuant to Section 1.4) shall receive from Buyer its Sharing Percentage of each of (A) the Cash Consideration less the Escrow Amount (the "Adjusted Cash Consideration"), (B) the Common Stock Consideration and (C) the Preferred Stock Consideration (if any); and 

   

 (iii) each Seller shall receive from Buyer its Sharing Percentage of each of (A) the Adjusted Cash Consideration, (B) the Common Stock Consideration and (C) the Preferred Stock Consideration (if any). 

 

The "Sharing Percentage" of each Seller and Optionholder shall be equal to the
"Sharing Percentage" set forth opposite such Sellers and/or Optionholders
name on _Annex A_ hereto. All deliveries and payments to be made by Buyer to
the Sellers and Optionholders under this Agreement shall be made in
accordance with the Sharing Percentages set forth on _Annex A_
attached hereto, as amended pursuant to Section 9.2 and, if applicable,
provided to Buyer pursuant to Section 1.7(a)(i), and Buyer shall not be
liable for the allocation of particular deliveries and payments among the
Sellers and Optionholders so long as such deliveries and payments are made
in accordance with _Annex A_. 

   

 (c) For the purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall be defined as: 

   

 (i) The "Average Price" shall mean the average closing sales price per share of the Buyer Common Stock for the twenty consecutive full trading days in which such shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") ending on, and including, the third trading day prior to the Closing Date, as reported in Bloomberg Financial Markets, or, if not reported therein, Dow Jones. The Average Price shall be calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of one cent. 

   

 (ii) The "Cash Consideration" shall mean cash in an amount equal to (i) $6,525,000,000 minus (ii) Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness plus (iii) Estimated Closing Date Cash less $5,000,000 plus (iv) the amount, if any, that the Estimated Net Working Capital is greater than "Target Net Working 

   ##### 

  

   

Capital" shown on Schedule 1.2 (the "Target Net Working Capital") minus (v)
the amount, if any, that the Estimated Net Working Capital is less than
the Target Net Working Capital plus (vi) if the number of shares of Buyer
Common Stock that Buyer elects to issue in satisfaction of the Common Stock
Consideration is less than 44,444,445 shares (but in no event less than the
Minimum Common Amount) (subject to adjustment pursuant to the last sentence
of the definition of "Common Stock Consideration"), any amount in cash that
the Buyer elects to pay in lieu of issuing all or any portion of the
Preferred Stock Consideration (such cash described in this clause (vi), the
"Preferred Stock Substitute Cash"). 

   

 (iii) "Cash Equivalents" shall mean the sum of cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments, plus all deposited but uncleared bank deposits and cash held by counterparties, and less all outstanding checks and cash posted by counterparties, in each case of any Company. 

   

 (iv) The "Common Stock Consideration" shall mean, subject to the final sentence of this definition, 35,406,320 shares (or such greater number of shares which is equal to the sum of (x) the total number of shares of Buyer Common Stock held in treasury by Buyer plus (y) 19.9% of the total number of outstanding shares of Buyer Common Stock, in each case, as of immediately prior to the Closing) (the "Minimum Common Amount"), subject to increase by Buyer, at its sole election, up to a maximum of 44,444,445 validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Buyer (the "Buyer Common Stock"). If during the period from the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date, any event or action inconsistent with Sections 6.2(b)(i), 6.2(c) or 6.2(d) and adverse to Sellers should occur, and the Closing should nevertheless be consummated, the Buyer and the Seller Representatives shall negotiate in good faith to agree on an adjustment to the number of shares set forth above so that the value to the Sellers and Optionholders is the same as if such event or action had occurred after the Closing. 

   

 (v) "Debt Obligations" shall, as applied to any person, mean, without duplication, (a) all indebtedness for borrowed money, including all indebtedness evidenced by a note, bond, debenture or similar instrument, (b) that portion of obligations with respect to capital leases that is properly classified as a liability on a balance sheet in conformity with GAAP, applied on a consistent basis with the financial statements of such person and (c) any obligation owed for all or any part of the deferred purchase price for the purchase of a business that in accordance with GAAP would be included as liabilities on the balance sheet of such person. For clarification, it is understood that the following shall not constitute "Debt Obligations" hereunder: operating leases, letters of credit issued for the account of such person to the extent undrawn and similar credit support obligations, trade payables and accrued expenses, prepaid or deferred revenue arising in the ordinary course of business, out of the money coal and power contracts, Derivative Products and other commercial contractual obligations or liabilities secured by second-priority Liens and any breakage, make whole, premium, penalty or prepayment fee on any indebtedness for borrowed money. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (vi) "Net Working Capital" shall mean the current assets specified on Schedule 1.2 of Genco and its subsidiaries less the current liabilities specified on Schedule 1.2 of Genco and its subsidiaries, all as determined pursuant to the methodology set forth in Schedule 1.2 and in accordance with GAAP as applied in the preparation of Gencos historical financial statements; _provided_ that, in determining Net Working Capital, (i) there shall not be any reevaluation of reserves or writedown of inventory from their respective levels at June 30, 2005, (ii) Cash Equivalents, Debt Obligations and any interest owing thereon shall be excluded, (iii) "accrued property tax" shall be calculated as $51.0 million multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days from January 1, 2006 through the day prior to the Closing Date and the denominator of which is 365 days, (iv) "transfer taxes" shall be calculated as 50% of any Transfer Taxes, if any, resulting directly from the Acquisition, (v) "accrued Blocker taxes" shall be calculated as any current accrued income taxes payable of the Blockers, minus any income tax receivables of the Blockers and any deferred tax asset of the Blockers relating to net operating losses or similar tax attributes to the extent such net operating losses or tax attributes can be used in the current taxable year or a prior taxable year (assuming, in the case of a carryback, no election to forego the carryback), (vi) "accrued STP taxes" shall be calculated as any current accrued income taxes payable of Holdings, minus any income tax receivables of Holdings and any deferred tax asset of Holdings relating to net operating losses or similar tax attributes and (vii) no costs, expenses or liabilities related to obtaining or incurrence of the Financing shall be included as current liabilities. 

   

 (vii) The "Preferred Stock Consideration" shall mean, in the event that the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock that Buyer elects to issue in satisfaction of the Common Stock Consideration is less than 44,444,445 shares (subject to the definition of "Common Stock Consideration"), shares of Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Buyer, having terms and conditions set forth on _Exhibit B_ hereto and as otherwise agreed to by Buyer and Sellers (the "Buyer Preferred Stock") with aggregate liquidation preference equal to (I) (A) 44,444,445 less the total number of shares of Buyer Common Stock issued to the Sellers in satisfaction of the Common Stock Consideration multiplied by (B) the Average Price minus (II) the amount of Preferred Stock Substitute Cash, if any. 

   

 (viii) The "Unit Consideration" is that portion of the Consideration received by the Genco Sellers and Optionholders. 

  

 Section 1.3 _Cash in Lieu of Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock shall be issued to a Seller or Optionholder in connection with the Acquisition, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each Seller or Optionholder who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock (after taking into account all shares of Buyer Common Stock deliverable to such Seller and/or Optionholder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, a cash payment (without interest) determined by multiplying the 

   ##### 

  

   

fractional share interest to which such Seller or Optionholder would
otherwise be entitled by the Average Price. 

  

 Section 1.4 _Treatment of Options and other Unit-based Company Plans_. The Board of Managers of Genco, or, where appropriate, its compensation committee, shall take all action necessary and appropriate to ensure that, at the Closing, each holder of an Option which is outstanding and unexercised (whether or not exercisable) immediately prior thereto shall, in cancellation and full settlement thereof, be entitled to receive the consideration due to such Optionholder pursuant to Section 1.2. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.1 hereof, Genco may elect to terminate any Option in exchange for a cash payment immediately prior to the Closing equal to the value allocated to such Option pursuant to _Annex A_ (prior to amendment of _Annex A_  to reflect termination of such Option); provided that Genco provides written notice to Buyer of such intention together with delivery of any required amendments to Annex A delivered pursuant to Section 1.7(a)(i) and the applicable cash payment amounts are reflected in the Preliminary Statement. Genco shall cause to be terminated a sufficient number of Options pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence such that no more than 35 Optionholders who are not "accredited investors" (as that term is defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act) will receive Buyer Common Stock or Buyer Preferred Stock in connection with the Acquisition and so that the holder of any Option who does not receive Buyer Common Stock or Buyer Preferred Stock receives cash in an amount and manner set forth in the second sentence of this Section 1.4. 

  

 Section 1.5 _Purchase Price Adjustment._  

  

 (a) Genco shall, at least two business days prior to the Closing Date, cause to be prepared and delivered to Buyer a statement (the "Preliminary Statement"), setting forth Gencos good faith estimates of (i) the Net Working Capital as of the Closing (the "Closing Date Net Working Capital"), (ii) the Debt Obligations of Genco and its subsidiaries outstanding on the Closing Date but immediately prior to the Closing (other than indebtedness owed to Genco or its subsidiaries) (the "Closing Date Indebtedness") and (iii) the amount of Cash Equivalents on hand at Genco and its subsidiaries on the Closing Date but immediately prior to the Closing (the "Closing Date Cash"). The estimates of Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness and Closing Date Cash provided in the Preliminary Statement are referred to herein as the "Estimated Net Working Capital, the "Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness" and the "Estimated Closing Date Cash", respectively. Buyer and Seller Representatives shall have the opportunity to review and comment on the Preliminary Statement and Genco shall consider those comments in good faith. 

  

 (b) Within 90 calendar days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Seller Representatives a statement (the "Statement") setting forth Buyers calculations of Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness and Closing Date Cash, and the components and calculation of each of Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness and Closing Date Cash. At the same time, Buyer shall also cause to be prepared and delivered to Seller 

   ##### 

  

 

Representatives a statement (the "Adjustment Statement") setting forth
the calculations (in each case whether a positive or negative number) of (A)
the amount of the Closing Date Net Working Capital as shown on the Statement
minus the Estimated Net Working Capital and (B) the amount of the Estimated
Closing Date Indebtedness minus the Closing Date Indebtedness as shown on the
Statement and (C) the amount of the Closing Date Cash as shown on the
Statement minus the Estimated Closing Date Cash. The sum of the amounts
referred to in (A), (B) and (C) above, whether a positive or negative number,
is referred to hereinafter as the "Adjustment Amount". Buyer shall provide
Seller Representatives and their accountants with access to the relevant books
and records and employees of Genco and its subsidiaries to the extent
required in connection with their review of and any dispute with respect to
the Statement and the Adjustment Statement and shall furnish Seller
Representatives with any other information that might be relevant to the
calculation of Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness
and Closing Date Cash. If, at any time prior to the final resolution of all
disputed items on the Statement or the Adjustment Statement, additional
information shall become known to Buyer or Seller Representatives that would
change the amount of the Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date
Indebtedness or Closing Date Cash shown on the Statement or the calculation
thereof, then Buyer or Seller Representatives shall have the right to amend
the Statement and Adjustment Statement to reflect such additional
information. Buyer or Seller Representatives shall promptly notify Seller
Representatives or Buyer, as applicable, upon becoming aware of any
additional information prior to the end of the Resolutions Period. 

   

 (c) After receipt of the Statement and the Adjustment Statement, Seller Representatives will have 30 calendar days from receipt to review the Statement and the Adjustment Statement together with the workpapers used in their preparation. Unless Seller Representatives deliver to Buyer written notice setting forth in reasonable detail the specific items disputed by Seller Representatives and a written statement setting forth Seller Representatives calculation of each line item shown on the Statement so disputed and the amount in dispute (the "Seller Representatives Statement") on or prior to the thirtieth day after its receipt of the Statement and the Adjustment Statement, Seller Representatives will be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the Statement and the Adjustment Statement and such agreement will be final, binding and conclusive. Any items on the Statement or Adjustment Statement as to which Seller Representatives have not given notice of their objection and provided an alternative calculation on the Seller Representatives Statement will be deemed to have been agreed upon by the parties, subject to the penultimate sentence of Section 1.5(b). If Seller Representatives so notify Buyer of their objections to any of the Statement or the Adjustment Statement and provide Buyer with the Seller Representatives Statement in an timely manner, Buyer and Seller Representatives will, within 30 calendar days following such notice (the "Resolution Period"), attempt to resolve their differences. Any resolution by Buyer and Seller Representatives during the Resolution Period as to any disputed amounts will be final, binding and conclusive. If the amount claimed by Buyer on the Adjustment Statement to be owed by Sellers is less than $100,000,000, then, promptly after delivery of the Adjustment Statement, any amount on deposit in the Escrow Account that is in excess of the amount claimed by Buyer to be owed by Sellers under this Section shall be distributed from the Escrow Account to Sellers in accordance with the Escrow 

   ##### 

  

   

Agreement, and Buyer agrees to reasonably cooperate with the Sellers in any
necessary joint instruction to the Escrow Agent. Money released from the
Escrow Account to Sellers shall be distributed to the Sellers in accordance
with the Sharing Percentages set forth on _Annex A_. 

  

 If Buyer and Seller Representatives do not resolve all disputed items by the end of the Resolution Period, then all items remaining in dispute will be submitted within 30 days after the expiration of the Resolution Period to Ernst and Young LLP or such other national independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to Buyer and Seller Representatives (the "Neutral Accounting Arbitrator"); it being understood that no member of the Neutral Accounting Arbitrators engagement team shall have an existing professional relationship with Buyer or any Sponsor Group (as defined in the LLC Agreement). The Neutral Accounting Arbitrator shall act as an arbitrator to determine only those items in dispute. All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Neutral Accounting Arbitrator will be allocated between Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller Representatives, on the other hand, in inverse proportion as they shall prevail on the amounts of such disputed items so submitted (as finally determined by the Neutral Accounting Arbitrator). The Neutral Accounting Arbitrator will deliver to Buyer and Seller Representatives a written determination (such determination to include a work sheet setting forth all material calculations used in arriving at such determination and to be based solely on information provided to the Neutral Accounting Arbitrator by Seller Representatives and Buyer) of the disputed items within 30 days of receipt of the disputed items (or as soon as practicable thereafter), which determination will be final, binding and conclusive. The final, binding and conclusive Statement and Adjustment Statement, which either are agreed upon by Buyer and Seller Representatives or are delivered by the Neutral Accounting Arbitrator in accordance with this Section 1.5, will be the "Conclusive Statement" and the "Conclusive Adjustment Statement," respectively. In the event that either Buyer or Seller Representatives fails to submit its statement regarding any items remaining in dispute within the time determined by the Neutral Accounting Arbitrator, then the Neutral Accounting Arbitrator shall render a decision based solely on the evidence timely submitted to the Neutral Accounting Arbitrator by Buyer and Seller Representatives. 

  

 (d) If the Adjustment Amount as shown on the Conclusive Adjustment Statement (the "Conclusive Adjustment Amount") is a negative number, then the Cash Consideration will be reduced by the amount of the Conclusive Adjustment Amount, but not in excess of $100,000,000, and Buyer shall be entitled to payment of such amount from the Escrow Account by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by the party entitled to receive such funds (and Seller Representatives agree to cooperate reasonably in facilitating such payment, including by executing and delivering an appropriate joint instruction to the Escrow Agent). If the Conclusive Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then the Cash Consideration will be increased by the amount of the Conclusive Adjustment Amount, but not in excess of $100,000,000, and Buyer shall pay to Sellers cash equal to such amount, to be paid to an account or accounts designated in writing by the Seller Representatives prior to the date when such payment is due. All payments to be made pursuant to this Section 1.5(d) will be made on the second business day following the date on which Buyer and Seller 

   ##### 

  

   

Representatives agree to, or the Neutral Accounting Arbitrator delivers, the
Conclusive Statement and the Conclusive Adjustment Statement and, in the case
of payment to Buyer, instruct the Escrow Agent by joint written instruction
accordingly. If the Conclusive Adjustment Amount is a positive number, or is
a negative amount that is less than the amount remaining on deposit in
the Escrow Account, then, promptly after determination of the Conclusive
Adjustment Amount, any amount remaining on deposit in the Escrow Account that
is in excess of the lesser of the Conclusive Adjustment Amount and
$100,000,000 shall be distributed from the Escrow Account to Sellers
in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, and Buyer agrees to reasonably
cooperate with the Sellers in any necessary joint instruction to the Escrow
Agent. Money released from the Escrow Account to Sellers shall be distributed
to the Sellers in accordance with the Sharing Percentages set forth on 
_Annex A_. Simultaneously with payment of the Conclusive Adjustment Amount,
any remaining amounts on deposit in the Escrow Account shall be paid to the
Sellers and Optionholders. 

  

 (e) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that its sole and exclusive remedy for any amount due to it pursuant to this Section 1.5 shall be its right to payment from the Escrow Account in an amount not to exceed the Escrow Amount. Sellers acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy for any amount due to it pursuant to this Section 1.5 shall be the right to payment from Buyer in an amount not to exceed $100,000,000. 

  

 Section 1.6 _Purchase Price Allocations_. The Genco Sellers and Buyer agree that the Unit Consideration shall be allocated for federal income tax purposes in accordance with Sections 755 and 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Buyer shall, within 60 days after the Closing Date, prepare and deliver to the Genco Sellers for their review a schedule allocating the Unit Consideration (and any other items that are required for federal income tax purposes to be treated as part of the purchase price of the Units) among the assets of Genco (such schedule, the "Allocation"). The Seller Representatives shall review such Allocation and provide any objections to Buyer within 30 days after the receipt thereof. If the Seller Representatives raise any objection to the Allocation, the parties will negotiate in good faith to resolve such objection(s). If the Seller Representatives and Buyer are unable to agree on the Allocation within 15 days after the Seller Representatives raise such objections, they shall request a nationally recognized accounting firm, mutually agreeable to both parties, to decide any disputed items. Buyer and the Seller Representatives shall cooperate in the filing of any forms (including Form 8594 under section 1060 of the Code) with respect to the Allocation as finally resolved (the "Final Allocation"). The Genco Sellers and Buyer shall file all federal, state and local tax returns and related tax documents consistent with the Final Allocation, unless otherwise required by applicable Law. 

  

 Section 1.7 _Preliminary Information_  

  

 (a) At least two business days prior to the Closing Date, Genco, on behalf of the Sellers, shall deliver to Buyer: 

   ##### 

  

   

 (i) if necessary, any amendments to _Annex A_ permitted pursuant to Section 9.2; 

   

 (ii) instructions designating the account or accounts to which the Adjusted Cash Consideration shall be deposited by federal funds wire transfer on the Closing Date; and 

   

 (iii) the names of the Sellers and Optionholders to whom the Buyer Common Stock, or, if applicable, the Buyer Preferred Stock, shall be issued and registered in the Buyers transfer books by Buyers transfer agent, as well as the amounts and form of shares to be issued to each of the Sellers and Optionholders. 

  

 (b) If the Consideration will include Buyer Preferred Stock or Preferred Stock Substitute Cash, then, at least two business days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall notify Genco, on behalf of the Sellers and Optionholders, of its calculation of the Average Price and copies of any relevant supporting materials. Sellers shall promptly review and comment on Buyers calculation of Average Price, and the final calculation of the Average Price shall be subject to the mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller Representatives. 

  

 Section 1.8 _Sellers  Closing Deliverables_. At the Closing, Genco or the Sellers shall deliver to Buyer: 

  

 (a) duly executed stock and unit powers of the Sellers, as applicable, transferring title of the Units and the Blocker Interests, free and clear of any Liens, to Buyer; 

  

 (b) the Investor Rights Agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (the "Investor Rights Agreement"), duly executed by the Sellers party thereto; 

  

 (c) the Escrow Agreement, duly executed by the Sellers; 

  

 (d) the officers certificate required by Section 7.2(c); and 

  

 (e) written resignations (or removals) of the non-officer directors of Genco, effective as of the Closing. 

  

 Section 1.9 _Buyer s Closing Deliverables_. At the Closing, the Buyer shall deliver to the Sellers and Optionholders:

Authority (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the ERCOT Market), (b)

 (d) During the Benefits Maintenance Period, Buyer agrees to, or to cause one of its subsidiaries to, provide each Transferred Employee with at least the same level and type of severance protection as was provided to such Transferred Employee under the Companies severance retention plans, practices and policies in effect as of the date hereof; provided, that, the expiration or termination of any severance plan or policy in effect as of the date hereof shall be disregarded and have no effect for purposes of determining the level of severance protection that the Buyer shall be required to be provide pursuant to this provision.

allocated in accordance with Article VI of the LLC Agreement. Buyer shall
prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, any other Tax Returns of
the Companies for any taxable period that are due after the Closing Date. The
Genco Sellers agree that (i) the Tax Return filed for the taxable year of
Genco ending on December 31, 2004 shall include the elections set forth on
Schedule 6.17 attached hereto, and (ii) in the event that the Tax Return of
Holdings filed for the taxable year ending December 31, 2005 is filed
prior to the Closing Date, such Tax Return shall include an election pursuant
to Section 468A(a) and Treasury Regulation Section 1.468A-7(a) to deduct
payments to Nuclear Decommissioning Fund. The Genco Sellers shall, and shall
cause Genco to, afford Buyer an opportunity to review the applicable portion
of such Tax Returns prior to filing solely to determine whether the elections
required by this Section 6.17 have been properly made. Buyer agrees to
cooperate with the Genco Sellers, and the Genco Sellers agree to cooperate
with Buyer, to provide any information requested by the Genco Sellers or
Buyer, as the case may be, in order to prepare such returns. 

  

 (b) All excise, sales, use, transfer (including real property transfer or gains), stamp, documentary, filing, recordation and other similar taxes, together with any interest, additions or penalties with respect thereto and any interest in respect of such additions or penalties, resulting directly from the Acquisition (the "Transfer Taxes"), shall be paid by Buyer.

   ##### 

  

   

affecting any Seller in his or her capacity as an officer or employee of any
Company, including salary or benefits earned with respect to, prior periods
to which such Seller is entitled from any of the Companies, and (iii) shall
not affect any right to indemnification, exculpation or advancement
of expenses to which such Seller may be entitled as a result of such Sellers
membership interest in Genco or service as a manager, officer, employee,
consultant or other representative of any Company, which rights shall not be
modified or amended following the Closing in a manner to adversely affect the
indemnification rights of the Sellers in effect immediately prior to
the Closing. 

  

 Section 6.20  _Restriction on Certain Transactions._ From and after the date hereof until the Closing Date, each of the Sellers hereby covenants and agrees that such Seller shall not, directly or indirectly, enter into transactions related to Buyer Common Stock designed to reduce its risk relative to its position as a holder of Buyer Common Stock.

 (b) by the Seller Representatives or Buyer if the Closing shall not have been consummated on or before the date that is nine months from the date of this Agreement (such date, as it may be extended under clause (A) of this paragraph, the "Optional Termination Date"); _provided_ , however, that (A) either the Seller Representatives or Buyer may, in its sole discretion, elect to extend the Optional Termination Date for up to 90 days if, (i) the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(c) have not been satisfied and (ii) all other conditions to consummation of the Acquisition are satisfied or capable of then being satisfied (other than the condition in Section 7.1(c)), and (B) the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) shall not be available to the Seller Representatives, if its failure to perform, or Buyer, if its failure to perform, its obligations under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Acquisition to have been consummated on or before the Termination Date or Optional Termination Date, as applicable;

 (d) by the Seller Representatives or Buyer if (i) a Governmental Authority shall have issued an Order or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such Order shall have become final and non-appealable or (ii) a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have denied or otherwise failed to grant a Required Approval and such failure or denial shall have become final and non-appealable, as a result of which the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 shall become incapable of being satisfied; or

 Section 8.2 _Procedure for and Effect of Termination_.

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 

   

 Section 9.1 _Representations and Warranties_. All representations and warranties in Articles II, III, IV and V of this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall not survive and shall terminate at the Closing Date or, subject to Section 8.2(c), upon termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII, as the case may be. 

  

 Section 9.2 _Amendment and Modification_. This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented at any time by the parties to this Agreement, under an instrument in writing signed by all parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller Representatives (by an instrument executed by each of the four members of the Seller Representatives) may amend _Annex A_ at any time prior to the Closing Date by written notice to Buyer to reflect changes in Sharing Percentages, transfers of Units permitted under Section 6.11, any termination of an Option at or prior to the Closing or additional Sellers pursuant to Section 6.15; provided, however, that no change to _Annex A_  shall be effected without the prior written consent of Buyer to the extent that such change would result in any Seller or Optionholder or any transferee thereof becoming the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the outstanding Buyer Common Stock immediately after consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 9.3 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement (including the Companies Disclosure Letter and Buyer Disclosure Letter), the Schedules, Annex and Exhibits hereto and the Confidentiality Agreements (a) constitute the entire agreement between the parties concerning the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, and (b) shall not be assigned, by operation of Law or otherwise, by a party (other than as permitted pursuant to Section 6.11), without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except that Buyer may assign its rights or obligations hereunder to any subsidiary or to a lender (or agent therefor) for security purposes, provided that no such assignment shall relieve Buyer of its obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may, at its election but subject to the proviso to this sentence, engage in a holding company merger (the "Holding Company Reorganization") pursuant to Section 251(g) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware for the purpose of interposing a newly formed holding company as the sole stockholder of Buyer ("Holdco"); provided, that, no such Holdco Company Reorganization shall be permitted hereunder if it or any related transactions (i) results in any required approvals (including stockholder approval or approval by any Governmental Authority) not specifically provided for as a condition in Article VII hereof or (ii) would reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the receipt or timing of receipt of any Required Approval, or otherwise delay satisfaction of the conditions to Closing set forth in Article VII. In the event that Buyer elects to consummate the Holding Company Reorganization, Buyer shall give written notice thereof to Sellers at least 10 business days prior to Closing and Holdco shall assume, pursuant to a joinder to this Agreement reasonably satisfactory to Sellers, and become responsible for, all of Buyers duties and obligations and shall succeed to, and be entitled to exercise, all of Buyers rights and privileges under this Agreement; provided, that no such assignment and assumption shall relieve Buyer of its obligations hereunder. In the event of a Holding Company Reorganization, "Buyer" shall be deemed to be Holdco for purposes of the definitions of "Buyer Common Stock", "Buyer Preferred Stock" (and the related Certificate of Designations attached as Exhibit B) and any related representations and covenants. 

  

 Section 9.4 _Severability_. The invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement in any situation or jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other terms or provisions of this Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction and the remaining terms and provisions shall remain in full force and effect, unless doing so would result in an interpretation of this Agreement which is manifestly unjust. 

  

 Section 9.5 _Notices_. Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, all notices and other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and may be given by any of the following methods: (a) personal delivery; (b) facsimile transmission; (c) registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested; or (d) overnight delivery service. Such notices and communications shall be sent to the appropriate party at its address or facsimile number given below or at such other address or facsimile number for such party as shall be specified by notice given

   ##### 

  

  

 parties or their respective successors and assigns any rights, remedies,
obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 9.12 _No Waivers_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, no failure to exercise, delay in exercising, or single or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy by any party, and no course of dealing between the parties, shall constitute a waiver of any such right, power or remedy. No waiver by a party of any default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant under this Agreement, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant under this Agreement or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence. No waiver shall be valid unless in writing and signed by the party against whom such waiver is sought to be enforced. 

  

 Section 9.13 _Specific Performance_. The parties to this Agreement agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and that the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms of this Agreement and immediate injunctive relief, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy, in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity. 

  

 Section 9.14 _Seller Representatives_

The Sellers have agreed that it is desirable to designate Blackstone TG Capital Partners IV L.P., Hellman and Friedman Capital Partners IV, L.P., KKR Millennium Fund (Energy) L.P. and TPG Partners IV - AIV 2, L.P., acting by any three of them (provided that any amendment of _Annex A_ and any modification of this Agreement that has the effect of modifying the substance of _Annex A_ shall require action by all four of them), as the representatives of the Sellers and Optionholders to act on behalf of the Sellers under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement for certain limited purposes (the "Seller Representatives"). The Seller Representatives shall serve as the representatives of the Sellers with respect to the matters expressly set forth in this Agreement to be performed by the Seller Representatives. 

  

 (b) _Authority_. Each of the Sellers hereby irrevocably appoints each of the Seller Representatives as agent, proxy and attorney in fact for such Sellers for all purposes of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, including the full power and authority on such Sellers behalf to take the actions required or permitted to be taken by the Seller Representatives pursuant to this Agreement and/or the Escrow Agreement, including such actions on behalf of a Seller. Each Seller agrees that such agency and proxy are coupled with an interest, are therefore irrevocable without the consent of each Seller Representatives and shall survive the death, incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of any Seller. All decisions and actions by the Seller Representatives (to the extent authorized by and in accordance with this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement) 

   ##### 

  

  

 shall be binding upon all of the Sellers, and no Seller shall have the right
to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. 

  

 (c) _Exculpation; Indemnification_. The Seller Representatives shall not have by reason of this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Seller. The Seller Representatives shall not be liable to any Seller for any action taken or omitted by it or any agent employed by it hereunder or under any other document entered into in connection herewith, except that the Seller Representatives shall not be relieved of any liability imposed by law for willful misconduct. The Seller Representatives shall not be liable to the Sellers for any apportionment or distribution of payments made by the Seller Representatives in good faith, and if any such apportionment or distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in error the sole recourse of any Seller to whom payment was due, but not made, shall be to recover from other Sellers any payment in excess of the amount to which they are determined to have been entitled. The Seller Representatives shall not be required to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement. Neither the Seller Representatives nor any agent or advisor employed by it shall incur any liability to any Seller relating to the performance of its duties hereunder, except for actions or omissions constituting fraud or bad faith. The Sellers do hereby jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold the Seller Representatives harmless from and against any and all liability, cost, expense or damage reasonably incurred or suffered as a result of the performance of such Seller Representatives duties under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, except for actions or omissions constituting fraud or bad faith.

 _Exhibit B_ 

   

NRG ENERGY, INC. 
 CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS 
 establishing the 
 Voting Powers, Designations, Preferences, Limitations, 
 Restrictions and Relative Rights of 
 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock 

   

Pursuant to Section 151 of the 
 General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware 

   

 NRG Energy, Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "Issuer"), does hereby certify that (i) pursuant to authority conferred upon the Board of Directors of the Issuer (the "Board of Directors") by its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate of Incorporation") and pursuant to the provisions of Section 151 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the Board of Directors authorized the creation and issuance of the Issuers Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and (ii) the following resolution fixing the designations, preferences and rights of such Preferred Stock which was duly adopted by the Board of Directors, on [], 2006, remains in full force and effect. 

  

 NOW THEREFORE IT IS RESOLVED, that pursuant to Section 151 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware and the authority expressly granted to and vested in the Board of Directors of the Issuer by the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors hereby creates a series of Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, to consist initially of [] shares, with the designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions as set forth in this Certificate of Designations: 

  

 1. _Designation and Amount_. 

  

       | 1.1  |   | All shares of this series of preferred stock
shall be known as "Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock" (the "Cumulative
Preferred Stock").  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | 1.2  |   | The number of shares constituting the Cumulative
Preferred Stock shall initially consist of [].1  
   

  

 2. _Rank_. 

  

       | 2.1  |   | The Cumulative Preferred Stock shall, with
respect to dividend rights and rights on liquidation, winding up, and
dissolution, (a) rank on a par with the Issuers 3.625% Convertible Perpetual
Preferred Stock (the "3.625% Preferred Stock") and the Issuers 4.0%
Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (collectively with the 3.625% Preferred
Stock, the "Existing Preferred Stock") and all other series of capital stock
issued by the Issuer, the terms of which expressly provide that such class or
series will rank on a par with the Cumulative Preferred Stock and the
Existing Preferred Stock (collectively, the "Parity Stock"), (b) rank senior
to each other class or series of capital stock now or hereafter authorized,
issued, or outstanding, including the common stock of the Issuer
(collectively, the "Junior Securities") and (c) have an initial liquidation
preference of $1,000.00 (as the "Liquidation Preference").  
---|---|---|--- 
   

   

 



 

       |   |   
---|---|--- 
      |   | 1 Calculated based upon definition of Preferred
Stock Consideration in Acquisition Agreement.  
       ##### 

  

    

 3. _Dividends_. 

  

       | 3.1  |   | The Holders shall be entitled to receive, when,
as, and if declared by the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available
therefor, cash dividends on each share of Cumulative Preferred Stock, at a
rate per annum equal to the Dividend Rate (as defined below and applicable
from time to time) on the Liquidation Preference and all accrued and unpaid
dividends. Such dividends shall be cumulative and accrue and compound
quarterly (whether or not earned or declared and whether or not there are
funds legally available therefor) from the date of issuance thereof (the
"Issue Date") and shall be payable on each dividend payment date declared by
the Board of Directors (each of such dates being a "Dividend Payment Date")
to holders of record at the close of business on the date specified by the
Board of Directors at the time such dividend is declared (the "Record Date").
Any such Record Date shall be no more than 60 days and no less than 10 days
prior to the relevant Dividend Payment Date. Any dividend not paid on the
Dividend Payment Date therefor shall be fully cumulative and shall accrue and
compound (whether or not earned or declared and whether or not there are
funds legally available therefor) at the Dividend Rate per annum compounded
quarterly from the date of such Dividend Payment Date and shall be in arrears
until paid.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | 3.2  |   | Each fractional share of Cumulative Preferred Stock
outstanding shall be entitled to a ratably proportionate amount of all
dividends accruing with respect to each outstanding share of Cumulative
Preferred Stock pursuant to paragraph 3.1, and all such dividends with
respect to such outstanding fractional shares shall be cumulative and shall
accrue and compound (whether or not declared) from the date of the issuance
of such share or fractional share, as the case may be, and shall be payable
in the same manner and at such times as provided for in paragraph 3.1 with
respect to dividends on each outstanding share of Cumulative Preferred Stock.
Each fractional share of Cumulative Preferred Stock outstanding shall also be
entitled to a ratably proportionate amount of any other distributions made
with respect to each outstanding share of Cumulative Preferred Stock, and all
such distributions shall be payable in the same manner and at the same time
as distributions with respect to each outstanding share of Cumulative
Preferred Stock.  
      
    | 3.3  |   | Accrued but unpaid dividends on the Cumulative
Preferred Stock for any past dividend periods may be declared by the Board of
Directors and paid on any date fixed by the Board of Directors, whether or
not a regular Dividend Payment Date, to holders of record on the books of the
Issuer on such record date as may be fixed by the Board of Directors, which
record date shall be no more than 60 days and no less than 10 days prior to
the payment date thereof. Holders will not be entitled to any dividends,
whether payable in cash, property or stock, in excess of the full cumulative,
compounded dividends provided for herein. Dividends payable on the Cumulative
Preferred Stock for any period less than a full quarterly period shall be
computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.  
      
    | 3.4  |   | So long as any shares of the Cumulative Preferred Stock
are outstanding, the Issuer shall not (i) declare, pay, or set apart for
payment any dividend other than in kind dividends on any Junior Securities,
(ii) make any distribution on or in  
   

   ##### 

  

  

       |   |   | respect of any Junior Securities, (iii) directly or
indirectly retire, redeem, purchase, or otherwise acquire, in whole or in
part, any Junior Securities, or (iv) make any payment on account of, or set
apart for payment money for a sinking or other similar fund for, the
purchase, redemption, or other retirement of, any Junior Securities.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | 3.5  |   | Nothing herein contained shall in any way or under
any circumstances be construed or deemed to require the Board of Directors
to declare, or the Issuer to pay or set apart for payment, any dividends on
shares of the Cumulative Preferred Stock at any time, except to the extent of
funds legally available therefor.  
   

  

 4. _Liquidation Preference_. 

  

       | 4.1  |   | Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
dissolution, or winding up of the affairs of the Issuer, no distribution
shall be made:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | to the holders of Junior Securities
unless, prior thereto, each Holder shall have received a liquidation payment
in cash for each share of outstanding Cumulative Preferred Stock held by it
equal to the Liquidation Preference with respect to such share plus any
accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not
declared, to the date fixed for liquidation, dissolution, or winding up
(including an amount equal to a prorated dividend for the period from the
last Dividend Payment Date to the date fixed for liquidation, dissolution, or
winding up); or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | to the holders of Existing Preferred Stock, Cumulative
Preferred Stock or any other class or series of Parity Stock, except
distributions made ratably on the Existing Preferred Stock, the Cumulative
Preferred Stock and each other class or series of Parity Stock in proportion
to the amounts to which the holders of the Existing Preferred Stock,
Cumulative Preferred Stock or other Parity Stock are entitled upon such
liquidation, dissolution, or winding up; or  
      
    | (c)  |   | to the holders of Cumulative Preferred Stock, except
distributions made ratably on such Cumulative Preferred Stock in proportion
to the total amounts to which the Holders of all such shares are entitled
upon such liquidation, dissolution, or winding up.  
   

  

       |   |   | After payment in cash and in full of the
Liquidation Preference of the Cumulative Preferred Stock plus any accrued and
unpaid dividends thereon compounded quarterly to the date of liquidation,
dissolution, or winding up (including an amount equal to a prorated dividend
for the period from the last Dividend Payment Date to the date fixed for
liquidation, dissolution, or winding up), Holders shall not be entitled to
receive any additional cash, property, or other assets of the Issuer upon
liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Issuer with respect to such
shares of Cumulative Preferred Stock.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

  

     

  

       | 4.2  |   | For the purposes of this Section 4, neither the
voluntary sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock,
securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the
property or assets of the Issuer nor the consolidation or merger of the
Issuer with any other corporation shall be deemed to be a voluntary or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Issuer, unless
such voluntary sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer shall be in connection
with a plan of liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Issuer.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

 5. _Redemption_. 

  

       | 5.1  |   | _Optional Redemption by the Issuer_. To the
extent the Issuer shall have funds legally available therefor, the Issuer, at
its option, may redeem for cash, in whole or in part, the shares of

 6. _Procedure for Redemption_. 

  

       | 6.1  |   | In the event that fewer than all the outstanding
shares of Cumulative Preferred Stock are to be redeemed at any time pursuant
to Section 5, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected pro rata among all
Holders from all outstanding shares of Cumulative Preferred Stock.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | 6.2  |   | In the event that the Issuer shall redeem shares of
Cumulative Preferred Stock pursuant to paragraph 5.2 hereof, the redemption
date shall not be later than the date of the Mandatory Redemption Date.  
      
    | 6.3  |   | In the event that the Issuer shall redeem shares of
Cumulative Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 5 hereof, notice of such
redemption shall be mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, not less
than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, in the case
of a redemption pursuant to paragraph 5.1, and otherwise not less than 30
days prior to the redemption date to the holders of record of all shares at
their respective addresses as they shall appear in the records of the Issuer;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that failure to give such notice or any defect
therein or in the mailing thereof shall not affect the validity of the
proceeding for the redemption of any shares so to be redeemed except as to

   ##### 

  

  

       |   |   | redeemed; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) the
place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for
payment of the redemption price; and (v) that dividends on the shares to be
redeemed will cease to accrue on such redemption date.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    |   |   | Failure by the Issuer to give any of the notices
prescribed by this paragraph 6.3, or the formal insufficiency of any such
notice, shall not prejudice the right of any Holder to cause the Issuer to
redeem any such shares of Cumulative Preferred Stock held by it.  
      
    | 6.4  |   | Notice by the Issuer having been mailed as provided
in paragraph 6.3, and provided that on or before the applicable redemption
date funds necessary for such redemption shall have been set aside by the
Issuer, separate and apart from its other funds, in trust for the pro rata
benefit of the Holders of the shares so called for or entitled to redemption,
so as to be and to continue to be available therefor, then, from and after
the redemption date (unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the
redemption price, in which case such rights shall continue until the
redemption price is paid), dividends on the shares of Cumulative Preferred
Stock so called for or entitled to redemption shall cease to accrue, and said
shares shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and shall not have the
status of shares of Cumulative Preferred Stock, and all rights of the Holders
thereof as stockholders of the Issuer (except the right to receive the
applicable redemption price and any accrued and unpaid dividends from the
Issuer to the date of redemption) shall cease. Upon surrender of the
certificates for any shares so redeemed (properly endorsed or assigned for
transfer, if the Board of Directors of the Issuer shall so require and notice
by the Issuer shall so state) to the Issuers transfer agent or to the
Secretary of the Issuer at the principal office of the Issuer, such shares
shall be redeemed by the Issuer at the applicable redemption price as
aforesaid, with payment made as promptly as practicable and in any event
within 7 days of surrender. In case fewer than all the shares represented by
any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate or certificates shall be
promptly issued representing the unredeemed shares without cost to the
Holder.  
   

  

 7. _Reacquired Shares_. Shares of Cumulative Preferred Stock that have been issued and reacquired in any manner, including shares reacquired by purchase, redemption, or exchange, may (upon compliance with any applicable provisions of the laws of the State of Delaware) be redesignated and reissued as part of any other class or series of preferred stock (but may not be reissued as additional shares of the Cumulative Preferred Stock). 

  

 8. _Voting Rights_. 

  

       | 8.1  |   | _No General Voting Rights_. Except as otherwise
provided in this Section 8, or as otherwise from time to time provided by
law, the Holders shall have no voting rights in respect of the shares of
Cumulative Preferred Stock. In exercising the voting rights provided by law
or in this Section 8, each share of Cumulative Preferred Stock shall have one
vote per share.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | 8.2  |   | _Voting Rights On Certain Other Matters_. In addition
to any vote or consent of stockholders required by law, the approval of
holders of at least 662/3% of the outstanding shares of Cumulative Preferred
Stock, voting as a class, shall be

 (iii) to the extent the Company is required by law or pursuant to the terms of any outstanding indebtedness of the Company to prepare such reports, any annual reports, quarterly reports and other periodic reports pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act actually prepared by the Company as soon as available. 

  

 (b) Inspection and Access. Subject to the execution of appropriate confidentiality agreements (i) the Company and its subsidiaries shall provide to each Fund Stockholder, true and correct copies of all documents, reports, financial data and other information as such Fund Stockholder may reasonably request and (ii), the Company shall permit any authorized representatives designated by each Fund Stockholder to visit and inspect, during normal business hours, any of the properties of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, including its and their books of account, and to discuss its and their affairs, finances and accounts with its and their officers, all at such times as such Fund Stockholder may reasonably request. 

  

 (c) Right of Consultation. Representatives of each Fund Stockholder shall have the right to consult with and advise the management of the Company and its subsidiaries, upon reasonable notice at reasonable times from time to time, on all matters relating to the operation of the Company and its subsidiaries. 

  

 (d) Advance Notice. At any time when the Company shall no longer be subject to the provisions of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, to the extent consistent with applicable law (and with respect to events which require public disclosure, only following the Companys public disclosure thereof through applicable securities law filings or otherwise), the Company shall inform each Fund Stockholder or its designated representative in advance with respect to any significant corporate actions that have been approved and authorized by the Company Board, including, without limitation, extraordinary dividends, mergers, acquisitions or dispositions of assets, issuances of significant amounts of debt or equity and material amendments to the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, and to provide each Fund Stockholder or its designated representative with the right to consult with the Company with respect to such actions. 

 

The Company agrees to consider, in good faith, the reasonable recommendations
of each Fund Stockholder or its designated representative in connection with
the matters on which it is 

    ##### 

  

   

consulted as described in Section 2.5(d) hereof, recognizing that the ultimate
discretion with respect to all such matters shall be retained by the
Company. 

  

The aforementioned rights are intended to satisfy the requirement of
management rights for purposes of qualifying each Fund Stockholders direct
or indirect investment in the Company as a "venture capital investment" for
purposes of United States Department of Labor Regulation § 2510.3-101 (the "
_Regulation_ "). In the event that a Fund Stockholders counsel determines
that the rights set forth herein are not satisfactory for such purpose, the
Company and such Fund Stockholder shall reasonably cooperate in good faith to
agree upon mutually satisfactory management rights that satisfy the
Regulations. 

  

All rights granted pursuant to this Section 2.5 to a Fund Stockholder are in
addition to the rights provided to such Fund Stockholder in its capacity as a
holder of Common Stock and Preferred Stock and nothing set forth in this
Section 2.5 shall be construed to limit, restrict or impair any claim, right
or privilege available, or granted, to a Fund Stockholder pursuant to any
other contractual arrangements with the Company or otherwise. 

  

In the event a Fund Stockholder transfers all or any portion of its direct or
indirect investment in the Company to an Affiliate (or to a direct or
indirect wholly owned conduit subsidiary of any such Affiliate) that is
intended to qualify as a "venture capital operating company" under
the Regulation, such Affiliate shall be afforded the same rights with respect
to the Company afforded to such Fund Stockholder hereunder and shall be
treated, for such purposes, as a third party beneficiary hereunder. 

  

Each Fund Stockholder shall notify the Company in writing at such time as such
Fund Stockholder ceases to own any Common Stock or Preferred Stock or any
other interests in the Company.

 _REGISTRATION RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO_ 
  _THE REGISTRABLE SECURITIES_  

   

 SECTION 3.1 _Shelf Registration Statement_. 

  

 (a) _Filing; Effectiveness; Expenses_. Subject to Section 6.1, the Company shall: 

   

 (i) file on or before the date 120 days from the date hereof, an "evergreen" shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (or, in the event Form S-3 is unavailable to the Company, Form S-1) pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act (or any successor provisions), providing for an offering to be made on a continuous basis of the Registrable Securities (the " _Shelf Registration_ "); 

   

 (ii) use reasonable best efforts to cause the Shelf Registration to become effective no later than the expiration of the Lock-Up Period, and in any event as soon as practicable after such filing; 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain in effect, supplement and amend, if necessary, the Shelf Registration, as required by the instructions applicable to such registration form or by the Securities Act; 

   

 (iv) furnish, upon request, to the holders of the Registrable Securities to which the Shelf Registration relates copies of any supplement or amendment to such Shelf Registration prior to such supplement or amendment being used and/or filed with the SEC; and 

   

 (v) pay all Registration Expenses in connection with the Shelf Registration, whether or not it becomes effective, and whether all, some or none of the Registrable Securities to which it relates are sold pursuant to it. 

  

 (b) _Effective Shelf Registration Statement_.  (i) If at any time, the Shelf Registration ceases to be effective, the Company shall use its best efforts to file and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to become effective a new "evergreen" shelf registration statement providing for an offering to be made on a continuous basis of the Registrable Securities. Such shelf registration statement shall be filed on Form S-3 or, if Form S-3 is unavailable to the Company, on Form S-1. 

   

 (ii) If, after the Shelf Registration has become effective, it is interfered with by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the SEC or other governmental agency or authority, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus and, if any such order is issued, to obtain the withdrawal of any such order at the earliest possible moment. 

  

 (c)   (i) If the Company shall at any time furnish to the Stockholders, a certificate signed by any of its authorized officers stating that the Company has pending or in process a material transaction, the disclosure of which would, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with its outside counsel, materially and adversely affect the Company, the Company may postpone the filing (but not the preparation) of the Shelf Registration for up to seventy-five (75) days; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be permitted to postpone registration pursuant to this Section 3.1(c)(i) more than once in any three hundred sixty (360) day period. The Company shall promptly give the Stockholders written notice of any postponement made in accordance with the preceding sentence. 

   

 (ii) If the Company shall at any time furnish to the Stockholders, a certificate signed by any of its authorized officers (a " _Suspension Notice_ ") stating that the Company has been advised in writing by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Company that, in such firms opinion, resales of the Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration would adversely affect any Company Offering with respect to which the Company has commenced preparations for a registration prior to the receipt of a Confirmation Request (as defined in Section 3.1(d)) and subject to Section 4.7, 

   ##### 

  

   

Stockholders may not effect any such resales until the earliest of (A) 30 days
after the completion of such Company Offering, (B) promptly after the
abandonment of such Company Offering or (C) 90 days after the delivery of
such Suspension Notice. 

   

 (iii) If upon receipt of a Confirmation Request, the Company determines in its good faith judgment after consultation with outside counsel that the filing of an amendment or supplement to the Shelf Registration is necessary in order to effect resales pursuant to the Shelf Registration and such filing would require disclosure of material information which the Company has a bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential and the Company provides the Stockholders a Suspension Notice within 48 hours of such receipt of a Confirmation Request, the Company shall not be required to comply with its obligations under Section 3.1(a)(iii), and the Stockholders, may not effect any resales, until the earlier of (A) the date upon which such material information is disclosed to the public or ceases to be material or (B) 90 days after such Confirmation Request was received by the Company. 

   

 (iv) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 3.1(c)(ii) and (iii), the Company shall be entitled to serve only one Suspension Notice (A) within any period of 180 consecutive days or (B) with respect to any two consecutive resales for which the Stockholders deliver Confirmation Requests. 

  

 (d) Not more than five (5) days nor less than 48 hours prior to effecting any sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration, the selling Stockholder or group of Stockholders will request the Company to confirm whether the Company is then exercising its rights pursuant to Section 3.1(c) (a " _Confirmation Request_ "). 

  

 (e) _Underwritten Offering_. Subject to Section 4.7 hereof, at the election of any Stockholder or group of Stockholders, holding in excess of 3% of the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding at the time of a request for an underwritten offering pursuant to this Section 3.1(e) or in excess of 20% of the aggregate number of shares of Preferred Stock originally issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, any resale pursuant to the Shelf Registration may involve an underwritten offering, and, in such case, the investment banker(s), underwriter(s) and manager(s) for such registration shall be selected by the holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities which are the subject of any such request; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such investment banker(s), underwriter(s) and manager(s) shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company. 

  

 SECTION 3.2 _Incidental Registrations_. (a) If the Company at any time after the Lock-Up Period has expired proposes to register Equity Securities under the Securities Act (other than a registration on Form S-4 or S-8, or any successor or other forms promulgated for similar purposes or any registration statement filed pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement dated December 27, 2004 among the Company and Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. with respect to the Companys 4% Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, whether or not for sale for its own account, in a manner which would permit registration of Registrable Securities for sale to the public under the Securities Act, it will, at 

   ##### 

  

   

each such time, give prompt written notice to all Stockholders of its
intention to do so and of such Stockholders rights under this Agreement.
Upon the written request of any such Stockholder made within thirty (30) days
after the receipt of any such notice (which request shall specify the
Registrable Securities intended to be disposed of by such Stockholder), the
Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect the
registration under the Securities Act of all Registrable Securities which the
Company has been so requested to register by the Stockholders thereof;
provided, that (i) if, at any time after giving written notice of its
intention to register any securities and prior to the effective date of the
registration statement filed in connection with such registration, the
Company shall determine for any reason not to proceed with the proposed
registration of the securities to be sold by it, the Company may, at its
election, give written notice of such determination to each Stockholder and,
thereupon, shall be relieved of its obligation to register any Registrable
Securities in connection with such registration (but not from its obligation
to pay the Registration Expenses in connection therewith), and (ii) if
such registration involves an underwritten offering, all Stockholders
requesting to be included in the Companys registration must sell their
Registrable Securities to the underwriters selected by the Company on the
same terms and conditions as apply to the Company, with such differences,
including any with respect to indemnification and liability insurance, as may
be customary or appropriate in combined primary and secondary offerings. If a
registration requested pursuant to this Section involves an underwritten
public offering, any Stockholder requesting to be included in
such registration may elect, in writing prior to the effective date of the
registration statement filed in connection with such registration, not to
register all or any part of such securities in connection with such
registration. The registrations provided for in this Section 3.2 are
in addition to, and not in lieu of, registrations made in accordance with
Section 3.1. 

  

 (b) _Expenses_. The Company will pay all Registration Expenses in connection with each registration of Registrable Securities requested pursuant to this Section 3.2. 

  

 (c) _Priority in Incidental Registrations_. If a registration pursuant to this Section 3.2 involves an underwritten offering and the managing underwriter advises the Company in writing that, in its opinion, the number of Registrable Securities requested to be included in such registration would be likely to have an adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the securities to be offered in such offering as contemplated by the Company (other than the Registrable Securities), then the Company shall include in such registration (a) FIRST, 100% of the securities the Company proposes to sell, (b) SECOND, to the extent of the amount of Registrable Securities requested to be included in such registration which, in the opinion of such managing underwriter, can be sold without having the adverse effect referred to above, the amount of Registrable Securities which the Stockholders have requested to be included in such registration, such amount to be allocated pro rata among all requesting Stockholders on the basis of the relative amount of Registrable Securities then held by each such Stockholder ( _provided_ , that any such amount thereby allocated to any such Stockholder that exceeds such Stockholders request shall be reallocated among the remaining requesting Stockholders and other Stockholders in like manner) and THIRD, to the extent of the amount of Registrable Securities subject to registration rights held by holders other than the Stockholders who have requested to be included in such registration, which, in the opinion of such managing underwriter, can be sold without having the adverse effect referred to above, the amount of Registrable Securities which the other holders have requested to be included in such registration, 

   ##### 

  

   

 such amount to be allocated pro rata among all requesting other holders on
the basis of the relative amount of Registrable Securities then held by each
such other holder. 

  

ARTICLE IV 

   

 _REGISTRATION PROCEDURES_  

   

 SECTION 4.1 _Registration Procedures_. If and whenever the Company is required to use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect or cause the registration of any Registrable Securities under the Securities Act as provided in this Agreement, the Company will, as expeditiously as possible: 

  

 (a) prepare and, in any event within thirty (30) days after the end of the period within which a request for registration may be given to the Company, file with the SEC a registration statement with respect to such Registrable Securities and, to the extent applicable use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective within ninety (90) days of the initial filing;

consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction;

 (g) otherwise use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, and make available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable (but not more than eighteen (18) months) after the effective date of the registration statement, an earnings statement which shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act; 

  

 (h) use its commercially reasonable efforts to list all Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement on the NYSE or any other national securities exchange on which Registrable Securities of the same class covered by such registration statement are then listed and, if no such Registrable Securities are so listed, on the NYSE or any national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed; 

  

 (i) enter into such customary agreements (including an underwriting agreement in customary form), which may include indemnification provisions in favor of underwriters and other Persons in addition to, or in substitution for the provisions of Section 4.4 hereof, and take such other actions as sellers of a majority of shares of such Registrable Securities or the underwriters, if any, reasonably requested in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities; 

  

 (j) obtain a "cold comfort" letter or letters from the Companys independent public accounts in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered by "cold comfort" letters as the seller or sellers of a majority of shares of such Registrable Securities shall reasonably request; 

  

 (k) make available for inspection by any seller of such Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement, by any underwriter participating in any disposition to be effected pursuant to such registration statement and by any attorney, accountant 

   ##### 

  

   

or other agent retained by any such seller or any such underwriter, all
pertinent financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and
properties of the Company, and cause all of the Companys officers, directors
and employees to supply all information reasonably requested by any such
seller, underwriter, attorney, accountant or agent in connection with such
registration statement; 

  

 (l) notify counsel (selected pursuant to Section 4.6 hereof) for the holders of Registrable Securities included in such registration statement and the managing underwriter or agent, immediately, and confirm the notice in writing (i) when the registration statement, or any post-effective amendment to the registration statement, shall have become effective, or any supplement to the prospectus or any amendment to the prospectus shall have been filed, (ii) of the receipt of any comments from the SEC, (iii) of any request of the SEC to amend the registration statement or amend or supplement the prospectus or for additional information, and (iv) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus, or of the suspension of the qualification of the registration statement for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of the institution or threatening of any proceedings for any of such purposes;

 SECTION 4.2 _Information Supplied_. The Company may require each seller of Registrable Securities as to which any registration is being effected to furnish the Company with such information regarding such seller and pertinent to the disclosure requirements relating to the registration and the distribution of such securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably request in writing. 

  

 SECTION 4.3 _Restrictions on Disposition_. Each Stockholder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 4.1(f), such Stockholder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the registration statement covering such Registrable Securities until such Stockholders receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by Section 4.1(f), and, if so directed by the Company, such Stockholder will deliver to the Company (at the Companys expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such Stockholders possession, of the prospectus covering such Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice. In the event the Company shall give any such notice, the period mentioned in Section 4.1(b) shall be extended by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of such notice pursuant to Section 4.1(f) and to and including the date when each seller of Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement shall have received the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by Section 4.1(f). 

  

 SECTION 4.4 _Indemnification_. (a) In the event of any registration of any securities of the Company under the Securities Act pursuant to Articles III or IV, the Company shall, and it hereby does, indemnify and hold harmless, to the extent permitted by law, the seller of any Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement, each Affiliate of such seller and their respective directors, officers, employees and stockholders or members or general and limited partners (and any director, officer, Affiliate, employee, stockholder and controlling Person of any of the foregoing), each Person who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of such securities and each other Person, if any, who controls such seller or any such underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, actions or proceedings (whether commenced or threatened) in respect thereof (" _Claims_ ") and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and reasonable expenses of investigation) to which such Indemnified Party may become subject under the Securities Act, common law or otherwise, insofar as such Claims or expenses arise out of, relate to or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged 

   ##### 

  

   

untrue statement of any material fact contained in any registration statement
under which such securities were registered under the Securities Act, any
preliminary, final or summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment
or supplement thereto, or (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein (in the case of a prospectus, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made) not misleading; provided, that the
Company shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party in any such case to the
extent that any such Claim or expense arises out of, relates to or is based
upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission made in such registration statement or amendment or
supplement thereto or in any such preliminary, final or summary prospectus in
reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the
Company through an instrument duly executed by or on behalf of such seller
specifically stating that it is for use in the preparation thereof;
and, provided, further, that the Company will not be liable in any such case
to the extent, but only to the extent, that the foregoing indemnity with
respect to any untrue statement contained in or omitted from a registration
statement or the prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any party (or
any person controlling such party) who is obligated to deliver a prospectus in
transactions in a security as to which a registration statement has been
filed pursuant to the Securities Act and from whom the person asserting any
such Damages purchased any of the Registrable Securities to the extent that
it is finally judicially determined that such Damages resulted solely from the
fact that such party sold Registrable Securities to a person to whom there
was not sent or given, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale,
a copy of the registration statement or the prospectus, as amended or
supplemented, and (x) the Company shall have previously and timely furnished
sufficient copies of the registration statement or prospectus, as so amended
or supplemented, to such party in accordance with this Agreement and (y) the
registration statement or prospectus, as so amended or supplemented, would
have corrected such untrue statement or omission of a material fact. Such
indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of
any investigation made by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party and shall
survive the transfer of securities by any seller. 

  

 (b) As a condition to including any Registrable Securities in any registration statement filed in accordance with Sections 3.2 or 4.1 herein, the Company shall have received an undertaking reasonably satisfactory to it from the prospective seller of such Registrable Securities or any underwriter to indemnify and hold harmless (in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth in Section 4.4(a)) the Company and all other prospective sellers or any underwriter, as the case may be, with respect to any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from such registration statement, any preliminary, final or summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, if such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company through an instrument duly executed by or on behalf of such seller or underwriter specifically stating that it is for use in the preparation of such registration statement, preliminary, final or summary prospectus or amendment or supplement, or a document incorporated by reference into any of the foregoing. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or any of the prospective sellers, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers or controlling Persons and shall survive the transfer of securities by any seller. In no event shall the liability of any selling holder of Registrable Securities hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds received by 

   ##### 

  

  

 such holder upon the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such
indemnification obligation. 

  

 (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of written notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding with respect to which a claim for indemnification may be made pursuant to this Section 4.4, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party, give written notice to the latter of the commencement of such action or proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of the indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under Section 4.4, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by such failure to give notice. In case any such action or proceeding is brought against an indemnified party, unless in such indemnified partys reasonable judgment (after consultation with legal counsel) a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist in respect of such action or proceeding, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in and to assume the defense thereof (at its expense), jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified to the extent that it may wish, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the latter in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided that, in the event, however, that the indemnifying party declines or fails to assume the defense of the action or proceeding or to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, in either case within a 30-day period, or if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the indemnifying party is not vigorously defending such action or proceeding, then such indemnified party may employ counsel to represent or defend it in any such action or proceeding and the indemnifying party shall pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel or other representative as incurred;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the indemnifying party shall not be required to pay the fees and disbursements of more than one counsel for all indemnified parties in any jurisdiction in any single action or proceeding. No indemnifying party will settle any such action or proceeding or consent to the entry of any judgment without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, unless such settlement or judgment (i) includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff of a release to such indemnified party from all liability in respect of such action or proceeding and (ii) does not involve the imposition of equitable remedies or the imposition of any obligations on such indemnified party and does not otherwise adversely affect such indemnified party, other than as a result of the imposition of financial obligations for which such indemnified party will be indemnified hereunder. No indemnified party will settle any such action or proceeding or consent to the entry of any judgment without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld). 

  

 (d) (i) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 4.4 from the indemnifying party is unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in respect of any Claim or expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Claim or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified party in connection with the actions which resulted in such Claim or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault 

   ##### 

  

   

of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including
any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or
alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates
to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and
the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The amount paid or payable by
a party under this Section 4.4(d) as a result of the Claim and
expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees
or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any action
or proceeding. 

   

 (ii) The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 4.4(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 4.4(d)(i). No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 

  

 (e) Indemnification similar to that specified in this Section 4.4 (with appropriate modifications) shall be given by the Company and each seller of Registrable Securities with respect to any required registration or other qualification of securities under any Law or with any governmental authority other than as required by the Securities Act. 

  

 (f) The obligations of the parties under this Section 4.4 shall be in addition to any liability which any party may otherwise have to any other party. 

  

 SECTION 4.5 _Required Reports_. The Company agrees that it will use best efforts to file the reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and it will take such further action as any Stockholder may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Stockholder to sell shares of Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement, including without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (i) Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as such Rule may be amended from time to time, or (ii) any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC. Upon the request of any Stockholder, the Company will deliver to such Stockholder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. 

  

 SECTION 4.6 _Selection of Counsel_. In connection with any registration of Registrable Securities pursuant to Articles III or IV hereof, the holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities covered by any such registration may select one counsel to represent all holders of Registrable Securities covered by such registration; provided, however, that in the event that the counsel selected as provided above is also acting as counsel to the Company in connection with such registration, the remaining Stockholders shall be entitled to select one additional counsel to represent all such remaining Stockholders. 

  

 SECTION 4.7 _Holdback Agreement_. If any Company Offering, registration under Section 3.2 hereof or any sale of securities in connection with a registration under Section 3.1 hereof shall be in connection with an underwritten public offering, the Company and each Stockholder agree not to effect any public sale or distribution, including, in the case of the 

   ##### 

  

   

Stockholders, any sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, of any
such securities of the Company, or options or other rights convertible into,
or exchangeable or exercisable for, such securities (other than as part of
such underwritten public offering), within seven (7) days before, or ninety
(90) days (or such lesser period as the managing underwriters may permit)
after, the effective date of any such Company Offering or registration
pursuant to Section 3.2 or the closing of any sale of securities in
connection with a registration under Section 3.1 (except as part of any such
registration or sale); provided that in no event shall this Section 4.7 be
effective against the Stockholders for the 90 days following expiration of
the Lock-Up Period. 

  

 SECTION 4.8 _No Inconsistent Agreement_. The Company represents and warrants that it will not enter into, or cause or permit any of its Subsidiaries to enter into, any agreement which conflicts with or limits or prohibits the exercise of the rights granted to the holders of Registrable Securities in this Agreement.

 _MISCELLANEOUS_  

   

 SECTION 6.1 _Termination_. The provisions of this Agreement (other than Section 4.4 hereof which shall not terminate and Section 2.4 which shall expire in accordance with its terms) shall terminate when no Registrable Securities remain outstanding. Nothing herein shall relieve any party from any liability for the breach of any provisions set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 6.2 _Amendments and Waivers_. Except as otherwise provided herein, no modification, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective against any party hereto unless such modification, amendment or waiver is approved in writing by such party. The failure of any party to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement shall in no way be construed as a waiver of such provisions and shall not affect the right of such party thereafter to enforce each and every provision of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. 

  

 SECTION 6.3 _Successors, Assigns; Transferees and Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors (including any parent company formed to hold all or a majority of the equity interests in the Company), permitted assigns and transferees. Except as expressly provided herein, this Agreement may not be assigned by the Company and may not be assigned by any Stockholder without the prior written consent of the Company, except that a Stockholder may assign its rights and obligations hereunder in respect of any Registrable Securities (a) to any Affiliate(s) or (b) to any transferee in connection with a Transfer in compliance with Section 2.1(c) in respect of Registrable Securities that constitute at least 10% of the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock or 20% of the aggregate number of shares of Preferred Stock, in each case, originally issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement (any of the foregoing, a " _Permitted Assignee_ "). Any Permitted Assignee of a Stockholder pursuant to the immediately preceding 

   ##### 

  

   

sentence shall be bound by all of the provisions of this Agreement (provided
that the provisions of Section 5.1 hereof shall only bind a Permitted
Assignee receiving at least 10% of the aggregate number of shares of Common
Stock originally issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement), and as a
condition to such transferees receipt of such shares, such transferee shall
execute an agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer,
agreeing to be bound by the applicable provisions hereof. Each Stockholder
shall inform the Company of, and the Company shall be entitled to rely upon,
the names, addresses and other contact details of each Stockholder. 

  

 SECTION 6.4 _Notices_. All notices required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given (i) upon personal delivery to the party to be notified, (ii) when sent by confirmed telex or facsimile if sent during normal business hours of the recipient or, if not, then on the next Business Day, (iii) five (5) days after having been sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid or (iv) one (1) Business Day after deposit with a nationally recognized overnight courier, specifying next day delivery, with written verification of receipt. All communications shall be sent as follows: 

  

 (i) to the Company and the Stockholders, to their respective addresses specified in _Annex A_ hereto; 

  

 (ii) to such other address for any party as it may specify by like notice. 

  

 SECTION 6.5 _Further Assurances_. At any time or from time to time after the date hereof, the parties agree to cooperate with each other, and at the request of any other party, to execute and deliver any further instruments or documents and to take all such further action as the other party may reasonably request in order to evidence or effectuate the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and to otherwise carry out the intent of the parties hereunder. 

  

 SECTION 6.6 _Entire Agreement_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, this document and the other Transaction Agreements embody the complete agreement and understanding among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede and preempt any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties, written or oral, that may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way. 

  

 SECTION 6.7 _Delays or Omissions_. It is agreed that no delay or omission to exercise any right, power or remedy accruing to any party, upon any breach, default or noncompliance by another party under this Agreement, shall impair any such right, power or remedy, nor shall it be construed to be a waiver of any such breach, default or noncompliance, or any acquiescence therein, or of or in any similar breach, default or noncompliance thereafter occurring. It is further agreed that any waiver, permit, consent or approval of any kind or character on the part of any party hereto of any breach, default or noncompliance under this Agreement or any waiver on such partys part of any provisions or conditions of this Agreement, must be in writing and shall be effective only to the extent specifically set forth in such writing. All remedies, either under this Agreement, by law, or otherwise afforded to any party, shall be cumulative and not alternative. 

   ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 6.8 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Delaware. Any suit, action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement may be brought in any court or before any similar authority in a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware, and the parties hereto hereby submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of such suit, proceeding or judgment. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives trial by jury in any legal action or proceeding in relation to this Agreement and for any counterclaim therein. 

  

 SECTION 6.9 _Severability_. In case any provision of this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. 

  

 SECTION 6.10 _Effective Date_. This Agreement shall become effective immediately upon the Closing. 

  

 SECTION 6.11 _Enforcement_. Each party hereto acknowledges that money damages would not be an adequate remedy in the event that any of the covenants or agreements in this Agreement are not performed in accordance with its terms, and it is therefore agreed that in addition to and without limiting any other remedy or right it may have, the non-breaching party will have the right to an injunction, temporary restraining order or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction enjoining any such breach and enforcing specifically the terms and provisions hereof. 

  

 SECTION 6.12 _Titles and Subtitles_. The titles of the sections and subsections of this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and are not to be considered in construing this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 6.13 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any rights of the Company at law or in equity, in the event of any default by the Stockholders under this Agreement or in the event of any claim in connection with the registration of Registrable Securities, the Companys remedies shall be restricted to enforcement of their respective rights against the property and assets of the Stockholders (including the Equity Securities held by such Stockholders) and no resort shall be had to (i) any of the members or stockholders of the Stockholders personally, or (ii) any property or assets of the members or stockholders of the Stockholders (other than the property and assets of the Stockholders). 

  

 SECTION 6.14 _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one instrument. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile signature(s).
