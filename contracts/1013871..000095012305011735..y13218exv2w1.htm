an instrument duly executed by or on behalf of such seller or underwriter specifically stating that
it is for use in the preparation of such registration statement, preliminary, final or summary

foregoing. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation
made by or on behalf of the Company or any of the prospective sellers, or any of their respective

claimant or plaintiff of a release to such indemnified party from all liability in respect of such
