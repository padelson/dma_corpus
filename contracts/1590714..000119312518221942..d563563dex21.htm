SECTION 2.06. _Post-Closing Adjustment of Purchase Price_

 

The Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment after the Closing as
specified in this Section 2.06:

 

(a) _Closing Statement_. As promptly as practicable, but in any event within
ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall prepare, or
cause to be prepared, and deliver to the Seller a statement (the " _Closing
Statement_ ") setting forth (i) a calculation (including a detailed summary of
such calculation) of the Closing Net Working Capital, the Closing Company
Debt, the Closing Company Transaction Expenses, the Closing Cash Amount and
the Specified Adjustments and (ii) the Purchase Price resulting from such
calculations in accordance with the formula set forth in  _Section_ __ _
2.02(a)_. The Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP and
the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Purchasers
calculation of the Purchase Price set forth in the Closing Statement is not
greater than or less than the Estimated Purchase Price by an amount at least
equal to the Designated Amount, then no adjustment shall be made to the
Purchase Price and the Estimated Purchase Price shall be deemed to be
the Final Purchase Price for all purposes of this Agreement.

 



21 (b) _Cooperation_. In connection with the Sellers review of the Closing
Statement, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company to, (i) provide
the Seller and its authorized Representatives with reasonable access to the
relevant books and records, its and its accountants work papers, schedules
and other unaudited financial statement reporting data as may be reasonably
requested by the Seller; and (ii) otherwise use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate in good faith with the Seller and its authorized
Representatives, including by providing on a timely basis all information
necessary or useful in the Sellers review of the Closing Statement and the
calculations of Closing Net Working Capital, the Closing Company Debt, the
Closing Company Transaction Expenses, the Closing Cash Amount, the Specified
Adjustments and the Purchase Price contained therein.

(c) _Disputes_.

 

(i) If the Seller disagrees with the Purchasers calculations or
determinations set forth in the Closing Statement, the Seller shall promptly,
but in no event later than forty-five (45) days following its receipt of the
Closing Statement (the " _Review Period_ "), deliver to the Purchaser written
notice describing in reasonable detail its dispute by specifying those items
or amounts as to which the Seller disagrees, together with the Sellers
determination of such disputed items and amounts (a " _Dispute Notice_ ").
Unless the Seller delivers a Dispute Notice to the Purchaser on or prior to
the expiration of the Review Period, the Seller will be deemed to have
accepted and agreed to the Closing Statement and such statement (and the
calculations contained therein) will be final, binding and conclusive. For
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 2.06(c)_, the Seller (A) may only deliver a
Dispute Notice on the basis that the Purchasers calculations set forth in the
Closing Statement were not in accordance with GAAP, were inconsistent with
the terms of this Agreement, were not supported by or were inconsistent with
the underlying books and records, or that such calculations contain
mathematical or other errors and (B) may not deliver a Dispute Notice unless
the aggregate value of all such disputed items is an amount at least equal to
the Designated Amount. During the forty-five (45) days (the " _Resolution
Period_ ") after the delivery of the Dispute Notice, the Purchaser and the
Seller shall reasonably cooperate in good faith to resolve any such dispute
and finally determine the Closing Statement and the Closing Company Debt, the
Closing Net Working Capital, the Closing Cash Amount, the Closing Company
Transaction Expenses, the Specified Adjustments and the Purchase Price set
forth therein. Any resolution by the Purchaser and the Seller during the
Resolution Period as to any item identified in the Dispute Notice shall be set
forth in writing and will be final, binding and conclusive. If the Seller and
the Purchaser are not able to resolve all disputed items identified in the
Dispute Notice within the Resolution Period, then the items that remain in
dispute shall be submitted to BDO Global, or if that firm and office is
unwilling or unable to serve, such other independent firm of national standing
capable of serving as an accounting expert mutually agreed upon in writing by
the Purchaser and the Seller (the " _Accountant_ ").

 



22 (ii) If any remaining issues in dispute are submitted to the Accountant
for resolution, each of the Seller and the Purchaser will be afforded an
opportunity to present to the Accountant any material relating to the
determination of the matters in dispute; _provided_ , _however_ , a copy of
all such material shall also be provided to the other party. The Accountant
shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator to calculate, based solely on
the written submissions of the Seller, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on
the other, and not by independent investigation, the numbers in dispute in
the Closing Statement and shall be instructed that its calculations must be
made in accordance with the standards and definitions in this Agreement, and
with respect to each item in dispute, must be within the range of values
established for such amount as determined by reference to the value assigned
to such amount by the Seller in the Dispute Notice and by Purchaser in the
Closing Statement.

 

(iii) The Purchaser and the Seller shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with the Accountant during its engagement in connection
with the matters contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.06(c)_. The Purchaser
and the Seller shall give the Accountant access to all documents, records,
work papers and personnel of such party and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates
as reasonably necessary to perform its function. The Accountant shall deliver
to the Seller and the Purchaser, as promptly as practicable and in any event
within thirty (30) days after his or her appointment, a written statement
setting forth his or her determination of the disputed items set forth in the
Closing Statement, each as determined in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. Such determination shall be final and binding upon the Seller
and the Purchaser to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and may
be enforced in any court having jurisdiction. The fees, costs and expenses of
the Accountant shall be allocated to and borne by the Purchaser and the Seller
based on the inverse of the percentage that the Accountants determination
(before such allocation) bears to the total amount of the total items in
dispute as originally submitted to the Accountant. For example, should the
items in dispute total in amount to one thousand dollars ($1,000) and the
Accountant awards six hundred dollars ($600) in favor of the Sellers
position, 60% of the costs of its review would be borne by the Purchaser and
40% of the costs would be borne by the Seller.

 

(d) _Purchase Price Adjustment_. The final, binding and conclusive calculation
of the Purchase Price, based either upon the last sentence of _Section_ __ _
2.06(a_), agreement or deemed agreement by the Purchaser and the Seller or the
written determination delivered by the Accountant, in each case, in accordance
with this  _Section_ __ _ 2.06_, will be the " _Final Purchase Price_ " for
all purposes of this Agreement.

 

(i) On or prior to the fifth (5th) Business Day following the determination
of the Final Purchase Price:

 



23 (A) In the event that the Final Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated
Purchase Price, the Purchaser shall pay the amount of such excess to the
Seller (or the Sellers designee) by wire transfer in immediately available
funds to the account designated by the Seller; and

 

(B) In the event that the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the Final Purchase
Price, the Seller shall pay the amount of such excess to the Purchaser (or
the Purchasers designee) by wire transfer in immediately available funds to
the account designated by the Purchaser.

 

(ii) The Seller and the Purchaser agree that any payment by Purchaser or
Seller pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.06(d)_ shall be treated for Tax
purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price to the extent permitted by
applicable Law.

 

SECTION 2.07. _Withholding_

 

The Purchaser and any of its agents or Affiliates shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any consideration, or other amounts, payable to the Seller
or any other Person pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement such
amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under any
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties agree to
cooperate in good faith to eliminate or minimize any withholding Tax with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and Purchaser. The
parties shall cooperate with each other in good faith and use commercially
reasonable efforts to seek to determine, at least ninety (90) days prior to
the Closing, whether any withholding requirement would apply to the
consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement, including the amount of any
such withholding and basis for such withholding. Purchaser agrees that unless
otherwise required by applicable Law, it will not take any action that, to the
Knowledge of Purchaser, would result in any withholding requirement that is
otherwise inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
be applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the
extent amounts are deducted or withheld pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.07_, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement or
the applicable Transaction Document as having been paid to the Person to whom

representatives of the Purchaser such additional financial and operating data
and other information regarding the Business (or copies thereof) as
the Purchaser may from time to time reasonably request; _provided_ ,

deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the Seller herein and
(B) any such access or furnishing of information shall be conducted at the
Purchasers expense during normal business hours, under the supervision of the
Sellers personnel and in such a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with
the normal operations of the Business; _provided_ , _further_ , that under no
circumstances shall the Purchasers pre-Closing access include testing of the
Real Property that involves digging, drilling, cutting or boring into the
ground or any buildings, structures, facilities or improvements thereon.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Seller shall
not be required to disclose any information contemplated by the immediately
preceding sentence to the Purchaser if the Seller reasonably determines that
such disclosure would (x) cause significant competitive harm to the Business
if the transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated, (y) jeopardize
any attorney-client or other legal privilege or (z) contravene any applicable
Laws, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date
hereof (provided that the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the consent of the counterparty to any such binding agreement so as to
permit the disclosure contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 5.02(a_)).

 

(b) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, the Seller will deliver
to the Purchaser, for (i) each fiscal month ended after the date hereof as
soon as reasonably practicable and available after the conclusion of such

claims made against or incurred by the Seller relating to the Business, for a
period of three (3) years after the Closing or, if shorter, the applicable
period specified in the Purchasers document retention policy (but in no event
prior to the completion of the Sellers consolidated financial statements for
the fiscal periods through the Closing Date), the Purchaser shall (i) retain
the books and records of the Business and the Acquired Companies relating to
periods prior to the Closing, and (ii) upon reasonable notice, afford the
officers, employees, agents and representatives of the Seller reasonable
access (including the right to make, at the Sellers expense, photocopies),
during normal business hours, to

 



61  such books and records and to such employees of the Acquired Companies as
the Seller shall reasonably determine are necessary to assist the Seller in
the preparation of such financial statements (and the Purchaser shall cause
such employees to cooperate with the Seller in such preparation); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Purchaser shall notify the Seller at least thirty (30)
days in advance of destroying any such books and records prior to the third
(3rd) anniversary of the Closing in order to provide the Seller the
opportunity to access such books and records in accordance with this Section
5.02(c); _provided_ , _further_ , that any such access or furnishing of
information shall be conducted at the Sellers expense during normal business
hours, under the supervision of the Purchasers personnel and in such a manner
as not to unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the Business.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Purchaser
shall not be required to disclose any information contemplated by the
immediately preceding sentence to the Seller if the Purchaser reasonably
determines that such disclosure would (x) cause significant competitive harm

consents from the relevant counterparties and to disclose or provide such

shorter, the applicable period specified in the Sellers document retention
policy, the Seller shall (i) retain the books and records of the Business and
the Acquired Companies relating to periods prior to the Closing which shall
not otherwise have been delivered to the Purchaser, the Company or any
Operating Subsidiary, and (ii) upon reasonable notice, afford the
officers, employees, agents and representatives of the Purchaser reasonable
access (including the right to make, at the Purchasers expense, photocopies),
during normal business hours, to such books and records; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Seller shall notify the Purchaser at least thirty (30)
days in advance of destroying any such books and records prior to the third
(3rd) anniversary of the Closing in order to provide the Purchaser the
opportunity to access such books and records in accordance with this _Section_
__ _ 5.02(d_); _provided_ , _further_ , that any such access or furnishing of
information shall be conducted during normal business hours, under the
supervision of the Sellers personnel and in such a manner as not to
materially interfere with the normal operations of the Business.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Seller shall
not be required to disclose any information contemplated by the immediately
preceding sentence to the Purchaser if the Seller reasonably determines that
such disclosure would contravene any applicable Laws, fiduciary duty or
binding agreement entered into prior to the date hereof; _provided_ that the
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any necessary
consents from the relevant counterparties and to disclose or provide such
requested information in redacted form.

 



62 SECTION 5.03. _Confidentiality_

 

(a) The terms of the letter agreement dated as of June 17, 2018 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ") between the Seller and UPL Limited ("
_Purchaser_ _Parent_ ") are hereby incorporated herein by reference and shall
continue in full force and effect until the Closing, at which time such
Confidentiality Agreement and the obligations of the Purchaser under this
Section 5.03 shall terminate; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate only in respect of that portion of
the Materials (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) to the extent
relating to the Acquired Companies and transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full
force and effect.

 

(b) From and after the Closing Date until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the
Closing Date, the Seller will, and will cause each of its Affiliates and its
and their respective Representatives (its " _Restricted Persons_ ") to,
maintain the confidentiality of and not disclose to any other Person, and not
use for their own benefit or the benefit of any other Person, any Materials
(as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement).

(c) If a party or any of its respective Restricted Persons become legally
compelled to make any disclosure that is prohibited or otherwise restricted by
this Agreement, then such party will (i) give the other party prompt written
notice of such requirement, (ii) consult with and assist the other party in
obtaining an injunction or other appropriate remedy to prevent such disclosure
and (iii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a protective order
or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to
any information so disclosed. Subject to the foregoing sentence, the
disclosing party or such Restricted Persons may make only such disclosure
that, in the opinion of its counsel, it is legally compelled or otherwise
required to make to avoid standing liable for contempt or suffering other
material penalty.

 

(d) Nothing provided to the Purchaser pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.02(a_)
shall in any way amend or diminish the Purchaser Parents obligations under
the Confidentiality Agreement. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that any
Materials (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) provided to the
Purchaser pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 5.02(a_) or otherwise by the Seller,
the Company, any Operating Subsidiary or any Representative thereof shall be
subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(e) Effective upon the Closing, the Seller hereby assigns to the Purchaser all
of its rights under each confidentiality agreement (other than the
Confidentiality Agreement) to which the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party and which pertain to the potential acquisition of the business or
operations of any of the Acquired Companies. The Seller shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, upon the request of the Purchaser from time
to time, use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Purchaser in
enforcing the provisions of any such confidentiality agreement. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Closing, the Seller shall deliver copies of
each such confidentiality agreement to the Purchaser to the extent permitted
by the terms thereof.

 



63 SECTION 5.04. _Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and Consents_

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.04(c_), each party shall use its best efforts
to promptly obtain all authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of all
Governmental Authorities and officials under Competition Laws that may be or
become necessary for its execution and delivery of, and the performance of its
obligations pursuant to, this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and will
cooperate fully with the other party in promptly seeking to obtain all such
authorizations, consents, orders and approvals. Each party hereto agrees to
make promptly its respective filing, if necessary, pursuant to the
Competition Laws of all jurisdictions, including (i) filing all required
notifications under the HSR Act within ten (10) Business Days of the date of
this Agreement, (ii) for each jurisdiction set forth on _Exhibit 5.04_ _(ii)_
, filing the notifications and filings under the relevant Competition Laws or,
where necessary or advisable, commencing pre-notification with the relevant
Governmental Authority, and including, if agreed between the Seller and the
Purchaser, submitting a draft reasoned submission to the European Commission
requesting a referral under Article 4(5) EUMR, with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable, but in
any event within twenty (20) Business Days of the date of this Agreement,
(iii) for each jurisdiction set forth on _Exhibit 5.04_ _(iii)_ , filing the
notifications and filings under the relevant Competition Laws as soon as
practicable, but in any event not later than August 31, 2018, unless an
earlier deadline is specified on _Exhibit_ _5.04(iii)_ , (iv) jointly
preparing and filing with CFIUS, within twenty (20) Business Days of the date
of this Agreement, a draft joint voluntary notice pursuant to the DPA relating
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and then within
fifteen (15) Business Days after receiving comments on the draft joint
voluntary notice from CFIUS, jointly file with CFIUS a joint voluntary notice
pursuant to the DPA with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (v) with respect to the Purchaser, filing an application seeking
the FIRB Approval with the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia within
ten (10) Business Days of the date of this Agreement, and (vi) supplying as
promptly as practicable and, in any event, within the required timeframe
(subject to receiving an extension of time), to the appropriate Governmental
Authorities any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the applicable Competition Laws or in connection with
the CFIUS Approval or the FIRB Approval. The Purchaser and Seller also agree
that if CFIUS suggests or requests, and the Purchaser and Seller mutually
determine it to be appropriate, that the parties withdraw and resubmit the
joint voluntary notice submitted to CFIUS, the Purchaser and Seller
shall cooperate in withdrawing and resubmitting the joint voluntary notice.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 5.04(a_), each of the Purchaser and the Purchaser Parent agrees to use
its best efforts and to take any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under any Competition Law that may be asserted by
any United States or non-United States governmental or supranational
antitrust, competition or merger control authority so as to enable the parties
hereto to expeditiously close the transactions contemplated hereby no later
than the Termination Date, including proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, commitment, undertaking, hold separate orders,
or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such of its (or its
Affiliates) assets, properties or businesses or of the assets, properties

 



64  or businesses to be acquired by it pursuant hereto as are required to be
divested in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of materially delaying or
preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. In
addition, each of the parties hereto shall use its best efforts to
defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any
party in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any
decree, order or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) under
Competition Law that would prevent the Closing by the Termination Date. The
Purchaser shall, in consultation with the Seller, be entitled to direct the
defense of the transactions contemplated hereby before any Governmental
Authority and to take the lead in the scheduling of, and strategic planning
for, any meetings with, and the conducting of negotiations with, Governmental
Authorities regarding the required clearances and approvals under any
Competition Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this sentence shall
obviate the Purchasers and the Purchaser Parents obligations pursuant to the
first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 5.04(b)_.

 

(c) In addition to the obligations under _Section_ __ _ 5.04(b_) (which apply
only to Competition Laws), each party to this Agreement shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party
in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the CFIUS
Approval and FIRB Approval as soon as practicable, including using
commercially reasonable efforts to take all such action as may be necessary to
resolve national security concerns, if any, that CFIUS or the Treasurer of
the Commonwealth of Australia may raise with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Each party to this Agreement shall promptly notify the other party of any
communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental
Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and
permit the other party to review in advance any proposed substantive
communication by such party to any Governmental Authority (or, where the
proposed substantive communication is competitively sensitive, permit the
other partys external legal advisers to do so). To the extent practicable,
no party to this Agreement shall agree to participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or other
inquiry unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting (withdrawing from any
such meeting as and when matters which are competitively sensitive arise).
Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the parties to this Agreement will
coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information
and providing such assistance as the other party may reasonably request in
connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any
applicable waiting periods. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the
parties to this Agreement will provide each other (or, where the materials are
competitively sensitive, the other partys external legal advisers)
with copies of all correspondence, filings or communications between them or
any of their representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority
or members of its

 



65  staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Attorney-client, work product and
any privileged information shall be exchanged so as to preserve the attorney-
client, work product or any applicable privilege or confidentiality concerns.

SECTION 5.05.  _Notifications_

Until the Closing, each party hereto shall promptly notify the other party in
writing of any fact, change, condition, circumstance or occurrence or
nonoccurrence of any event of which it is aware that will or is reasonably
likely to result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in _Article
VIII_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 5.05 _shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

 

SECTION 5.06. _Transition Services_

 

(a) The Seller and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to finalize,
within sixty (60) days following the date of this Agreement, the terms and
conditions of a transition services agreement, including the service schedules
thereto (the " _Transition Services Agreement_ "), to be entered into by the
Seller and the Purchaser as of the Closing, pursuant to which the Seller
shall, after the Closing, provide, or cause to be provided, to the Business
certain services that are currently provided by the Seller and its Affiliates
to the Business. In the event the Seller and the Purchaser are unable to
reach an agreement on a Transition Services Agreement, the Seller and the
Purchaser shall enter into the Transition Services Agreement attached as
_Exhibit 5.06_ hereto; _provided_ , that (a) the fees payable by the
Purchaser (or the Acquired Companies) for any transition service shall not
exceed Sellers Cost for providing such service (for the avoidance of doubt,
the fees payable by the Purchaser for a specific transition service may
increase or decrease from time to time to the extent Sellers Cost for
providing such services increases or decreases) and (b) the indemnification
obligations of each of the Seller, on the one hand, or the Purchaser (or the
Acquired Companies), on the other hand, under the Transition Services
Agreement shall not exceed the aggregate amount of fees paid by the Purchaser
(or the Acquired Companies) to the Seller pursuant to the Transition Services
Agreement. To the Sellers Knowledge, the services included in the Transition
Services Agreement attached hereto as _Exhibit 5.06_ are all of the additional
services that would be required if the Acquired Companies were to continue to
operate as subsidiaries of the Seller during the term of the
Transition Services Agreement in substantially the same manner as they
operated immediately prior to the Closing.

(b) For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 5.06_ and the Transition Services
Agreement, " _Seller s Cost_" means, with respect to the provision of any
transition service:

 

(i) in the case of a transition service or portion thereof provided by the
Seller through the use of a third party service provider, the cost to the
Seller, as the case may be, of such service or portion thereof incurred
following, or as a result of, the Closing, including any transfer fees and new
or initial set-up costs incurred as a result of the provision of the
services; and

 



66 (ii) in the case of a transition service or portion thereof provided by
the Seller without the use of a third party service provider, the cost to the
Seller of providing such service, without any margin or profit, which shall be
determined (A) if applicable, on the same basis and using an equivalent
methodology as used by the Seller to allocate costs for purposes of
determining the fully burdened EBIDTA of the Business for the year ended
December 31, 2017 (which EBITDA was $390,000,000) or (B) if not applicable, by
mutual agreement of the parties.

 

For the avoidance of doubt, the costs described in clause (i), on the one
hand, and clause (ii), on the other hand, are not intended to be duplicative
with respect to any transition service; to the extent the historical
allocation of costs described in clause (ii) includes the costs of any service
that was provided by the Seller to the Business but is subsequently provided
by a third party service provider, such allocation shall be reduced to the
extent of the allocated cost to the Seller of providing such service.

 

SECTION 5.07. _Further Action_

 

Subject to the other express provisions of this Agreement, the parties hereto
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all appropriate action, to do or cause to be done all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Law, and to execute and deliver such
documents and other papers, as may be required to carry out the provisions of
this Agreement and consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the Seller
shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, upon the request of the
Purchaser, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, and the Purchaser
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist with such efforts to
obtain, any consents or waivers in respect of Contracts required with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any consents required
from original product manufacturers in connection with the assignment of the
Product Registrations contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.04(k_); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such efforts shall not include any requirement that the
Seller, any Acquired Company or the Purchaser expend money (other than de
minimis amounts) or offer or grant any accommodation to any third party (and
no offer or grant of any accommodation or change in terms of a Contract
will be provided without the prior written consent of the Purchaser); and
_provided_ _further_ , that so long as the Seller has complied with its
obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.07_, the failure of the
Acquired Companies to obtain any such consent or waiver shall not be deemed a
breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.07_ for purposes of _Section_ __ _
8.02(a)(ii)_.

 

SECTION 5.08. _Non-Compete_

 

(a) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the
fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Restricted Period_ "),
the Seller will not, and it will cause its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, engage in any business anywhere in the world that competes with
the Business as conducted by the Acquired Companies immediately prior to the
Closing Date (such business, a " _Competitive_

 



67   _Business_ "), or own an interest in, manage, operate, join, control, lend
money or render financial or other assistance to or participate in or be
connected with, as a partner, stockholder, consultant or otherwise, any
Person that competes with the Business; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for the
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 5.08(a_), the acquisition or ownership of (i)
Equity Interests having no more than 5% of the outstanding voting power of
any Person which are listed on any national securities exchange as long as the
Person owning such securities has no other connection or relationship with
such Person or (ii) Equity Interests of any Person or business that derives
less than fifteen percent (15%) of its gross revenue from a Competitive
Business in its most recent completed fiscal year, will not be deemed to be in
violation of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.08(a_). In the event the Seller and/or
its Affiliates acquire any Person or business that has derived fifteen percent
(15%) or more of its gross revenue from a Competitive Business in its most
recent completed fiscal year, the Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to divest assets relating
to the Competitive Business within twelve (12) months after the consummation
of such acquisition such that, after giving effect to such divestiture, the
acquired Person or business would have generated less than such amount of its
consolidated revenues from the Competitive Business for the most recent
completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition of such Person or business.
Notwithstanding the foregoing if Seller or any of its Affiliates shall sell
all or any portion of their respective businesses (whether by means of
acquisition, asset purchase, merger, consolidation, similar business
combination or otherwise) to any Person who is not an Affiliate of the
Seller, the restrictions contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.08_ shall not
prohibit such sale and shall not apply to any such Person or such Persons
Affiliates (other than the Seller and its Affiliates prior to such sale)
following consummation of such sale, provided that (A) following such sale,
the restrictions contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.08_ shall continue to
apply to the Seller and those Persons that were the Sellers Affiliates prior
to such sale until the expiration of the Restricted Period and (B) if Seller
or any of its Affiliates sell only a portion of their respective businesses,
after consummation of such sale, Seller and/or its Affiliates, as the case
may be, shall continue to be subject to this _Section_ __ _ 5.08_.

 

(b) The Restricted Period will be extended by the length of any period during
which the Seller or any of its Affiliates is in breach of the terms of
_Section_ __ _ 5.08(a_).

SECTION 5.09.  _Non-Solicitation_

From the date hereof until the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date,
the Seller will not, and will cause its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, for itself or on behalf of or in conjunction with any other
Person, (a) solicit or hire or employ or engage any Person in any capacity who
at any time during the preceding 12-month period was an employee of, or
consultant providing agro-chemical services or services analogous to those
provided by an executive officer to, any Acquired Company for whom the base
annual compensation for such Person during such period exceeded $200,000 or
(b) cause, induce or attempt to cause or induce any customer, strategic
partner, supplier, distributor, landlord or others doing business with the
Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries
to cease or reduce the extent of its business relationship with the Purchaser,
the Company or any of their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries or to deal
with any competitor of the Purchaser, the Company or any of

 



68  their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that
this _Section_ __ _ 5.09_ will not be deemed to prohibit the Seller from (i)
engaging in general media advertising or solicitation that is not targeted
towards employees of the Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates or Subsidiaries and hiring any Person who responds to any such
general solicitation, (ii) soliciting, hiring, employing or engaging any
Person who has left the service of the Purchaser, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries, at least six (6) months prior to the
Closing Date, (iii) soliciting, hiring, employing or engaging any of the
employees, contractors or consultants of Seller whose names are listed on
_Exhibit 5.09_ attached hereto and (iv) engaging any consultant providing
services in respect of any matter not related to the Business, except for, in
the case of this clause (iv), any consultant providing services analogous to
those provided by an executive officer to the Business.

 

SECTION 5.10. _No Negotiation_

 

The Seller agrees that, from the date of this Agreement, none of the Seller or
any of the Acquired Companies, or any of their respective directors,
officers, Affiliates or Representatives will, directly or indirectly (a)
solicit, initiate, facilitate or encourage, (b) engage in any discussions or
negotiations with respect to or furnish to any other Person any
information connection with, (c) grant any Person access to its properties,
assets, books, Contracts, personnel or records in connection with respect to
or (d) approve or enter into any agreement or understanding in connection
with, in the case of the foregoing clauses (a) through (d), any proposals,
inquiries or offers from any Person (other than the Purchaser) relating to any
acquisition, purchase or similar transaction or business combination involving
all or any of the Equity Interests of any of the Acquired Companies or all or
a material portion of the assets of any Acquired Company (other than the sale
of inventory in the Ordinary Course of Business) (any such proposal, inquiry
or offer, an " _Alternative Proposal_ "). The Seller shall, and shall cause
the Acquired Companies and their respective directors, officers, Affiliates
and Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
existing discussions, conversations, negotiations and other communications
with any Person (other than the Purchaser) conducted heretofore with respect
to any of the foregoing and will, as promptly as practicable after the date
hereof, secure the return or destruction of any information of the type
referenced in clause (b) of this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ and terminate any
access of the type referenced in clause (c) of this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_.
Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall promptly (and in any event, within
three (3) Business Days) notify the Purchaser after receipt by the Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries (or any of its or their Representatives) of any
Alternative Proposal or any request for information relating to any
Alternative Proposal, which notice shall include the material terms and
conditions of any such Alternative Proposal or request (including, if
applicable, copies of any written proposals or offers with the identity of the
third party or parties redacted).

SECTION 5.11. _Release_

 

From and after the Closing, the Seller, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
Affiliates, and each of its and their respective successors and assigns,
hereby irrevocably, knowingly, and voluntarily releases, discharges, and
forever waives and relinquishes all claims, demands, Liabilities, defenses,
affirmative defenses, setoffs, counterclaims, actions, and causes of action of
whatever kind or nature, whether known or unknown, which the Seller or any of
its Affiliates has, may have, or may assert now or in the future against any
Acquired Company, any current or

 



69  former Representative of any Acquired Company, or any of their respective
successors, assigns, heirs, and executors arising out of, based upon, or
resulting from any circumstance, action, failure to act, occurrence, or
omission of any sort or type, whether known or unknown, that occurred,
existed, was taken or begun prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ shall be deemed to release
or waive any rights or remedies of the Seller under this Agreement or any
other agreement entered into in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

SECTION 5.12. _Intercompany Arrangements, Indebtedness and Release of
Encumbrances_

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Seller will, and will cause its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies) to (i) terminate all Contracts (other than
any Ancillary Agreements), between the Seller or any of its Affiliates (other
than the Acquired Companies), on the one hand, and any of the Acquired
Companies, on the other hand, that were entered into on or prior to the
Closing and (ii) settle or extinguish all intercompany receivables and
payables between the Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Acquired
Companies), on the one hand, and any of the Acquired Companies, on the
other hand, that were incurred on or prior to the Closing, in each case
without further recourse to or any Liability of any Acquired Company;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any (A) Contract solely by and among two or more
Acquired Companies, and (B) intercompany receivables and payables solely by
and among any two or more Acquired Companies, in the case of the foregoing
clauses (A) and (B), shall remain in place following the Closing.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Seller will extinguish all guarantees by
any of the Acquired Companies of any Indebtedness of the Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies), in each case without further
recourse to or any Liability of any Acquired Company; _provided_ , _however_
that all guaranties by any Acquired Company of any Indebtedness held solely
by one or more other Acquired Companies shall remain in place following the
Closing.

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Seller will take all action including
obtaining consents as necessary to permit the Purchaser to obtain clear title
to the equity interests and assets of the Acquired Companies (including the
Shares) free of all Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances (but
excluding the Encumbrances contemplated by clause (f) of the definition)), and
the Seller will deliver or cause to be delivered to the Purchaser termination
statements, releases and other appropriate evidence requested by the
Purchaser to the effect that no Encumbrances (other than Permitted
Encumbrances (but excluding the Encumbrances contemplated by clause (f) of the
definition)) exist as of the completion of the Closing against such
equity interests and assets.

SECTION 5.13. _R andW Insurance Policy_

 

The Seller shall provide to the Purchaser such cooperation as reasonably
requested by the Purchaser in connection with the RandW Insurance Policy.

 



70 SECTION 5.14. _Credit and Performance Support Obligations_

 

The Seller agrees to take commercially reasonable efforts to cause: the
Acquired Companies to be absolutely and unconditionally released, on or prior
to the Closing Date, of all Liabilities arising out of all guaranties,
Encumbrances, assurances or other credit support provided by any Acquired
Company with respect to the Seller Obligations; and the Seller to be released
from the Dow Guarantee. To the extent the Acquired Companies are not
absolutely and unconditionally released of all such Liabilities on or prior to
the Closing Date, the Seller agrees (a) to continue after the Closing to take
commercially reasonable efforts to absolutely and unconditionally release the
Acquired Companies of all such Liabilities and (b) with respect to any Seller
Obligations for which any Acquired Company has not obtained an absolute and
unconditional release of the Acquired Companies by the Closing Date (each
such Seller Obligation, until such time as such Seller Obligation is released
in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 5.14_, a " _Continuing Seller
Obligation_ "), to indemnify Purchaser and the Acquired Companies for any
demand or draw upon, or withdrawal from, any Continuing Seller Obligation or
any cash or other collateral posted by any Acquired Company in connection with
or in the place of any such Continuing Seller Obligation and for the carrying
costs of any cash collateral not replaced by the Seller, the fronting fee
costs, and any other out-of-pocket costs and expenses resulting from each
such Continuing Seller Obligation. To the extent the Seller is not absolutely
and unconditionally released from the Dow Guarantee on or prior to the Closing
Date, the Purchaser agrees (a) to continue after the Closing to
take commercially reasonable efforts to absolutely and unconditionally
release the Seller from the Dow Guarantee and (b) to indemnify Seller for any
demand or draw upon the Dow Guarantee and any other out-of-pocket costs and
expenses resulting from each such demand or draw; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such indemnity shall be limited to Liabilities covered by the Dow
Guarantee and included on the consolidated balance sheet of the Acquired
Companies as of the Closing Date and any Liabilities covered by the Dow
Guarantee incurred by Purchaser or any Acquired Company following the Closing.

 

SECTION 5.15. _Certain IP Matters_

 

(a) Following the Closing, the Purchaser agrees to promptly, and in any event
within ninety (90) Business Days after the Closing, cause its indirect
Subsidiary, MacDermid Agricultural Solutions Italy Srl, to amend its
organizational documents and make all necessary filings with all relevant
Governmental Authorities to change its name to remove all references
to "MacDermid." The Purchaser shall (at its election) cause all other
Acquired Companies that have the "MacDermid" name to (i) within ninety (90)
days of the Closing, amend such Acquired Companies organizational documents
and make all necessary filings with all relevant Governmental Authorities to
change such Acquired Companies names to remove all references to "MacDermid"
or (ii) as soon as reasonably practicable after Closing (given legitimate
business considerations such as obtaining and implementing tax and accounting
recommendations with regard to preparing such Acquired Companies for
liquidation, and in light of legitimate delays which may result from the
reliance on government agencies to deliver necessary documentation), make all
necessary filings with all relevant Governmental Authorities to initiate
liquidation of such Acquired Companies, and thereafter diligently prosecute
such liquidation. The Purchaser shall, upon the written request of Seller,
provide the Seller with written evidence reasonably

 



71  satisfactory to the Seller of the Purchasers compliance with this _Section_
__ _ 5.15(a)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser may maintain
product registrations in the United States in the name of MacDermid
Agricultural Solutions, Inc. until December 31, 2022. In addition, the
Purchaser may continue to issue invoices and other shipping documents in the
name of either MacDermid Agricultural Solutions, Inc. or MacDermid
Agricultural Solutions Italy Srl, for so long as doing so is required in order
to match the name of the holder of the product registration or the registered
manufacturer in the country to which the products are being exported.

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.15(a)_ with respect to entity names, the
Acquired Companies will, for a period of no more than 12 months after the
Closing Date, be entitled to use the Seller Names in connection with the
operation of the businesses of the Acquired Companies, in substantially the
same manner as, and to substantially the extent as, such Seller Names were
used in connection with the operation of the businesses of the Acquired
Companies prior to Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Acquired
Companies will take commercially reasonable efforts to cease using the Seller
Names as soon as possible following the Closing Date. The Acquired Companies
shall ensure that all uses of any Seller Names as provided in this _Section_
__ _ 5.15_ shall be only with respect to goods and services of a level of
quality equal to or greater than the quality of goods and services with
respect to which the Seller Names were used in the businesses of the Acquired
Companies prior to the Closing. Any and all goodwill generated by the use of
the Seller Names under this _Section_ __ _ 5.15_ shall inure solely to the
benefit of the Seller or its Affiliates, as the case may be.

 

SECTION 5.16. _Post-Closing VAT Reimbursement_

 

Following the Closing, the Purchaser agrees to promptly, and in any event
within ten (10) Business Days after the Purchasers or any Acquired Companys
receipt of any VAT reimbursement from an Italian Governmental Authority or
taxing authority, as the case may be, with respect to VAT paid to such Italian
Governmental Authority or taxing authority related to purchases by Platform
Sales Suisse GmbH __ from an Italian subsidiary of Chemtura Corporation in
2015 and 2016, whether such reimbursement is in the form of (i) cash or (ii)
by way of input Tax credit or by offset against any liability for the payment
of VAT which would otherwise be payable by Purchaser (in each case, a " _VAT
Reimbursement_ "), pay to the Seller an amount in cash in euros equal to the
aggregate value of such VAT Reimbursement received by the Purchaser or
the relevant Acquired Company by wire transfer to the account designated by
the Seller within fifteen (15) Business Days after the receipt or realization
of the VAT Reimbursement.

 

SECTION 5.17. _Financing_

 

(a) _Purchaser Financing Obligations_.

 

(i) The Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the proceeds
of the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Papers, including: (A) complying with in all material respects all
of its obligations under the Debt Commitment Papers that arise prior to the
Closing, 

 



72  (B) maintaining the Debt Commitment Papers in full force and effect (up to
the Closing) in accordance with its terms to the extent within its control;
(C) negotiating and entering into definitive agreements with respect thereto
on the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Papers (including
any market flex provisions therein) or on such other terms agreed to by
Purchaser (provided, that such other terms would not reasonably be likely to
make funding of the Debt Financing less likely to occur on the Closing Date);
(D) consummating the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing if the
conditions to the availability of the Debt Financing have been satisfied or
waived, including enforcing its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter to
cause the Lenders to fund the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing; and
(E) satisfying on a timely basis (taking into account the time periods
specified in the Debt Commitment Letter and the anticipated timing of the
Closing) all conditions to the availability of the Debt Financing that are
within the control of the Purchaser. If any portion of the Debt Financing
expires or terminates or otherwise becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter, the Purchaser shall
promptly notify the Seller thereof and use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange for and obtain as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of
any such event alternative debt financing (the " _Alternative Financing_ ") in
an amount sufficient to replace any unavailable portion of the Debt Financing
without the imposition of new conditions or expansion of existing conditions
in the Debt Commitment Letter or other contingencies to the obligations of the
counterparties thereto to procure the provision of, or provide, the entire
amount of the unavailable portion of the Debt Financing, it being understood
that if the Purchaser proceeds with any Alternative Financing, the Purchaser
shall be subject to the same obligations with respect to such Alternative
Financing as set forth in this Agreement with respect to the Debt Financing.
The Purchaser shall promptly provide to the Seller a copy of any commitment
letters or other agreements in respect of any such Alternative Financing and
any fee letters related thereto (with fee amounts redacted). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, in no event shall "reasonable best efforts" require,
or be deemed to require, the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including,
after the Closing, the Acquired Companies) to cash collateralize any portion
of the Debt Financing; or require the Purchasers ultimate parent to grant
security interests in any of its assets to any Financing Sources, provide any
guaranty in respect of any portion of the Debt Financing, or enter into
any arrangement that would reasonably be expected to require any approval or
consent from any Indian Governmental Authority.

 

(ii) The Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to obtain the proceeds of the Equity Financing at or prior
to the Closing on the terms and conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment
Letter, including: (A) complying with and performing all of its obligations
under the Equity Commitment Letter that arise prior to Closing, (B)
maintaining the Equity Commitment Letter in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms to the extent within its control; (C) consummating
the Equity Financing at or prior to the Closing, including enforcing its
rights under the Equity Commitment Letter to cause the funding of the Equity
Financing at or prior to the Closing; and (D) satisfying on a timely basis all
conditions in the Equity Commitment Letter to the extent within its control.



 



73 (iii) The Purchaser shall not replace, adversely amend, adversely
supplement, adversely modify or adversely waive the Equity Commitment Letter
or any provision thereof without the Sellers prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver of the Equity
Commitment Letter shall have the effect of (x) reducing the aggregate amount
of the commitment thereunder or (y) modifying in any manner adverse to the
Purchaser any of the conditions precedent to the obligation of the Investors
to fund the entire amount of the Equity Financing thereunder. The Purchaser
shall not replace, amend, supplement, modify or waive the Debt Commitment
Papers or any provision thereof without the Sellers prior written consent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) if such replacement,
amendment, supplement, modification or waiver would: (A) delay or prevent the
Closing; (B) make the funding of any of the Debt Financing or the
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing less likely to
occur; (C) reduce the aggregate amount of the commitments under the Debt
Commitment Letter unless there is a corresponding increase in the amount of
Equity Financing; (D) adversely impact the ability of the Purchaser to enforce
its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Papers; (E) bring
forward the expiry or termination date of the commitments of the
Lenders under the Debt Commitment Letter; (F) permit or effect the
assignment, release or termination of the Debt Commitment Letter or the
commitments or obligations of any Lender thereunder other than in accordance
with its terms; or (G) impose any new condition or expand, adversely amend or
adversely modify in any manner any of the existing conditions to the receipt
of any of the Debt Financing; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding
the foregoing, Purchaser may modify, supplement or amend the Debt Commitment
Papers solely to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents,
other agents or similar entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment
Papers as of the date hereof or to increase the amount of funds available
thereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, in no
event shall the Purchaser consent to or permit (including by amendment, waiver
or otherwise) any assignment, reduction or novation of any commitment of any
Lender or Investor under the Debt Commitment Papers or Equity Commitment
Letter. Upon any permitted amendment, supplement, modification or replacement
of the Debt Commitment Papers (including with respect to any Alternative
Financing) or the Equity Commitment Letter in accordance with this _Section_
__ _ 5.17(a)(iii)_, the term "Debt Commitment Papers" shall mean the Debt
Commitment Papers as so amended, supplemented, modified or replaced, the
term "Equity Commitment Letter" shall mean the Equity Commitment Letter as so
amended, supplemented, modified or replaced, and references to "Financings",
"Equity Financing", "Debt Financing" and/or "Alternative Financing" shall
including the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Papers and/or the
Equity Commitment Letter, as applicable, as so amended, supplemented, modified
or replaced.

 



74 (iv) The Purchaser shall provide the Seller prompt notice (A) upon
receiving written notice or a written communication in respect of, or
otherwise obtaining knowledge of, any breach, default, repudiation,
cancellation or termination (or any event or circumstance that, with or
without the lapse of time, the giving of notice or both, would reasonably be
expected to give rise to any breach, default, repudiation, cancellation or
termination) by any party (including any Lender or Investor) of the Commitment
Letters or any other agreement or document relating to the Debt Financing or
Equity Financing, and (B) of any written notice from a party to any Commitment
Letter (including any Lender or any Investor), or otherwise obtaining
knowledge, that it no longer intends to provide any portion of the Debt
Financing or Equity Financing to the Purchaser on the terms set forth
therein. The Purchaser shall provide any information reasonably requested by
the Seller relating to any circumstance referred to in the immediately
preceding sentence. In addition, the Purchaser shall, from time to time upon
request (of a reasonable frequency), keep the Seller informed in reasonable
detail of the status of the Debt Financing and the Equity Financing.

 

(v) The Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller, the Acquired
Companies and their respective Representatives and Affiliates from and
against all losses or damages suffered by, and all claims made against, such
Persons in connection with their compliance with, or any actions taken by any
of them in connection with, _Section_ __ _ 5.17(b)_, except to the extent
suffered or incurred as a result of any such indemnitees, or such
indemnitees respective Representatives, gross negligence, bad faith, willful
misconduct or material breach of this Agreement that would result in the
failure of the condition precedent in _Section_ __ _ 8.02(a)_. The Purchaser
shall promptly, upon request by the Seller, reimburse the Seller, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred by such Person in connection with their compliance
with, or any actions taken by any of them in connection with,  _Section_ __ _
5.17(b)_.

(b) _Seller Cooperation Obligations_. Prior to the Closing, the Seller agrees
to, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
Subsidiaries (including the Acquired Companies) and its and their respective
Representatives to, use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
provide, at the Purchasers expense, such cooperation and assistance in
connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing or, to the extent
expressly provided below, the Equity Financing, as may be reasonably requested
by the Purchaser upon reasonable prior notice, including (i) participation by
management with appropriate seniority and expertise in a reasonable number of
meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions and sessions with
rating agencies in connection with the Debt Financing, (ii) assisting with
the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, offering
documents, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda,
prospectuses and similar documents required in connection with the
Debt Financing (provided, that, all such rating agency

 



75  presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank
information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents shall contain (x)
disclosures reflecting Purchaser and its post-Closing subsidiaries as the
obligor(s), and (y) disclosures and disclaimers exculpating the Company, the
Seller and their respective Affiliates with respect to any liability related
to the contents or use thereof by the recipients thereof), and identifying
any portion of the information set forth in marketing materials that would
constitute material, non-public information regarding the Acquired Companies
or any of their respective securities, (iii) delivery of customary
authorization letters that authorize the distribution of the confidential
information memorandum in connection with (x) the Debt Financing to
prospective lenders and (y) the Equity Financing to prospective investors,
(iv) furnishing the Purchaser, the Financing Sources and the Investors with
the Required Financial Information, and other financial and other pertinent
information regarding the Acquired Companies as may be reasonably requested
by the Purchaser that are reasonably necessary for the satisfaction of the
obligations and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Papers and the
Equity Commitment Letter, (v) assisting the Purchaser in the preparation of
the pro forma financial statements required in connection with the Debt
Financing, (vi) cooperating with the Financing Sources in order to allow them
to benefit from the existing lending relationships of the Acquired Companies,
(vii) solely to the extent required by the Debt Commitment Papers, assisting
the Purchaser in procuring corporate and facilities ratings in connection with
the Debt Financing, (viii) facilitating the entrance into one or more credit
or other agreements reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser in connection
with the Debt Financing to the extent direct borrowings or debt incurrences by
the Acquired Companies are contemplated by the Debt Commitment Papers,
including participation by senior management of the Acquired Companies in the
negotiation of such agreements, provided that none of the Acquired Companies
shall be required to enter into any such agreement prior to the Closing, (ix)
providing customary payoff letters requested by the Purchaser or the
Financing Sources relating to the repayment of existing Indebtedness of the
Acquired Companies and the release of related Encumbrances to the extent such

matters ancillary to the Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested by the
Purchaser in connection with the Debt Financing and otherwise reasonably
facilitating the pledge of collateral and providing of guarantees
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Papers, including participation by senior
management of the Acquired Companies in the negotiation of such documents and
instruments (provided that the Acquired Companies shall not be required to

avoidance of doubt, subject to customary confidentiality arrangements, the
Purchaser may share the Required Financial Information and any
other information and/or material furnished by the Seller or its Subsidiaries
in connection with the Debt Financing with the Investors, prospective
investors, or otherwise in connection with the Equity Financing.
Notwithstanding anything in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.17(b_) to the contrary,
nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.17(b_) shall

 



76  require the Seller, the Acquired Companies or any of their respective
Representatives or Affiliates to (A) provide any cooperation, or take any
action, to the extent it would unreasonably interfere with the business or
operations of the Seller or the Acquired Companies, (B) pay any fees or
expenses or otherwise incur any Liabilities (or give any indemnity), or enter
into any instrument or Contract, other than, solely in the case of an
Acquired Company, any such fee, expense, Liability, instrument or Contract
that would become payable or otherwise become effective only upon the
occurrence of the Closing, (C) provide access to or disclose any information
to the Purchaser or its Representatives or any other Person to the extent
such disclosure would reasonably be expected to result in the waiver of the
attorney-client privilege, attorney work product protections or similar
protections or violate any applicable Law, (D) prepare or deliver any
financial statements, financial data or other information other than the
Required Financial Information, or (E) take any action that would authorize
any formal corporate or similar action that is not subject to the occurrence

herein shall require any director, manager or officer of any Acquired Company
who will not continue to hold such position following the Closing to
execute any resolution(s) or written consent(s), or any certification,
instrument or agreement, in connection with the Debt Financing or Equity
Financing or any agreements or instruments entered into in connection
therewith. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the
Seller shall not be deemed in default of, to have failed to comply with, or
otherwise be in breach of, its obligations under this _Section_ __ _
5.17(b_), and the condition set forth in  _Section 8.02(a)(ii)_ as it
relates to this _Section_ __ _ 5.17(b)_ shall be deemed satisfied, unless (x)
the Seller has knowingly materially breached its obligations under this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.17(b)_ and (y) the Financing shall have not been obtained
primarily as a result of such knowing material breach.

 

SECTION 5.18. _Insurance Matters_

 

(a) After the Closing, with respect to any event or circumstance pertaining to
any Acquired Company that relates to the period prior to the Closing and for
which claims for coverage have been made prior to the Closing under any
insurance policy maintained by the Seller or its Subsidiaries (each, an "

liability tail insurance policy that provides coverage for officers and
directors of the Acquired Companies at any time prior to the Closing Date, on
such terms and conditions as the Purchaser may specify, provided that the
Purchaser shall be responsible for, and shall promptly pay when due, the cost
of such tail policy.

Companies to, to the extent permissible under applicable Laws, use
commercially reasonable efforts to transfer, prior to the Closing, the Excess
Cash in each such jurisdiction to a Cash Redomicile Country in
accordance with Cash Redomicile Plan. In the event that after the date hereof
and prior to the Closing, the Acquired Companies maintain Cash in any

with each other in good faith to determine the Minimum Cash Balance for such
jurisdiction based on the same principles used for the determination of
Minimum Cash Balance for the other jurisdictions listed on _Exhibit 1.01(g)_
and update _Exhibit 1.01(g)_ accordingly.

 

SECTION 5.21. _Taiwan Product Registrations_

the Seller or MacDermid Taiwan with Taiwan Product Registrations transfer
matters, (vi) be solely responsible for maintaining the Taiwan Product

MacDermid Taiwan) promptly and until the Taiwan Products bearing the Sellers
or MacDermid Taiwans name and/or registration number are no longer sold by
the Purchaser or UPL (Taiwan) Limited, as the case may be; _provided_ ,
_however_ , the Seller and MacDermid Taiwan shall cooperate in such activities
and sign all related documents to the extent such documents are required to
be prepared in the Sellers or MacDermid Taiwans name, (vii) not make any
material changes in the Taiwan Products, the Purchaser Product Information, or

authorized to undertake or assume any obligation on behalf of the other party
to this Agreement.

(f) This  _Section_ __ _ 5.21_ shall remain in effect until the expiration

ARTICLE VI

EMPLOYEE MATTERS 

SECTION 6.01. _Employee Benefits_

 

(a) As of the Closing, each employee of the Acquired Companies shall cease to
be covered under those equity incentive plans sponsored by the Seller set
forth on _Exhibit 6.01(a)_ (the " _Retained Plans_ "). As of the Closing,
Purchaser shall (i) recognize the service completed by the employees of the
Acquired Companies who continue to be employed by the Purchaser or the
Acquired Companies after the Closing (the " _Company Employees_ ") for
purposes of determining eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual under any
employee benefit plan, program or arrangement maintained by the Purchaser for
their employees on or after the Closing Date, in which the Company Employees
are eligible to participate and (ii) assume responsibility for the vacation
time, personal days and sick leave benefits due to the Company Employees
as of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall such
credit result in the duplication of benefits or the funding thereof. The
Purchaser shall maintain for the period of at least one year immediately
following the Closing Date (A) salary or hourly wages, as applicable, and
incentive compensation opportunities for the Company Employees in an amount no
less favorable in the aggregate to such Company Employee as the salary or
wages paid and incentive opportunities made available in the aggregate to
such employee by the Acquired Companies as of the Closing Date (it being
understood that the Purchaser may offer cash incentive compensation
opportunities in lieu of any equity incentive compensation
opportunities offered prior to the Closing Date, and/or offer equity
incentive compensation opportunities in lieu of any cash

 



80  incentive compensation opportunities offered prior to the Closing), and (B)
employee benefit plans, programs, policies and fringe benefits (including
vacation, personal days and sick leave benefits, but excluding equity-based
compensation) that are substantially comparable in value in the aggregate to
those available to the employees by the Acquired Companies immediately prior
to the Closing Date. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon
any employee any right to continued employment with Purchaser or its
Affiliates, nor shall anything herein interfere with the right of Purchaser or
its Affiliates to relocate or terminate the employment of any employee at any
time after the Closing Date. Furthermore, notwithstanding any provision in
this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.01_ shall
create any third-party beneficiary rights in any Continuing Employee or
current or former service provider of the Seller or any Acquired Company (or
any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall cause all Plans and each other
employee benefit plan of the Seller, as applicable, covering employees of the
Company and the Subsidiaries, other than any equity-based plans and, for the
avoidance of doubt, any change in control agreements or arrangements, to be
separate and stand-alone plans of the Company and each of the applicable
Subsidiaries (the " _Stand-Alone Plans_ "), and to the extent any Stand-Alone
Plans are created after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing
covering employees of the Acquired Companies to the extent permitted under
_Section_ __ _ 5.01_, the Seller shall provide copies of such Stand-Alone
Plans to the Purchaser at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing.

SECTION 6.02. _Works Councils_

 

In accordance with applicable Law and the terms of any Contract or Plans,
prior to the Closing, each party hereto shall reasonably cooperate and
consult with the other in connection with any requirement of the Seller or the
Acquired Companies to notify, inform or consult with any Works Council in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
preparation and dissemination of any information note required in connection
with any Works Council consultation process. In connection with the foregoing,
the Seller shall (a) consult with the Purchaser and keep the Purchaser
informed of the timeline for any consultation process, (b) provide the
Purchaser with reasonable advance notice of, and shall permit the Purchaser to
review and shall incorporate the Purchasers reasonable comments in, any
communication to be given by the Seller or any Acquired Company to any Works
Council in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(c) provide the Purchaser with reasonable advance notice of, and the
opportunity to participate in, any meetings with any Works Council or
representatives thereof in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (d) promptly provide the Purchaser with any written
opinion, similar documentation or summaries of other material communications
issued or delivered by any Works Council.

 



81 ARTICLE VII

 

TAX MATTERS

SECTION 7.01.  _Tax Indemnity; Preparation of Tax Returns_ __

(a) From and after the Closing the Seller shall indemnify and defend the
Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) and their
respective Representatives against, and shall hold each of them harmless from
and against, and shall pay and reimburse each of them for, all Income Taxes
(or the non-payment thereof) imposed on or with respect to the assets and
operations of the Acquired Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or portion
thereof and any Seller Taxes except to the extent such Taxes are treated as a
liability in calculating Closing Net Working Capital. From and after the
Closing the Purchaser shall indemnify and defend the Seller and its Affiliates
and their respective Representatives against, and shall hold each of them
harmless from and against, and shall pay and reimburse each of them for, all
Income Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) imposed on or with respect to the
assets and operations of the Acquired Companies for any Post-Closing Tax
Period or portion thereof.

(b) The Seller shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Income Tax Returns
of the Acquired Companies for Tax periods that end on or before the Closing
Date (each, a " _Seller Tax Return_ ") that have not been filed on or prior to
the Closing Date. The Company or the relevant Operating Subsidiary shall bear
the cost of the tax return preparer retained by Seller for this purpose. For
this purpose, the parties agree that the tax year of the Company for federal
Income Tax purposes shall end at the end of the Closing Date and Purchaser
and the Company shall make all elections and take such other actions necessary
to effectuate the foregoing, including by including the Company and any of its
U.S. Subsidiaries in a consolidated Income Tax Return with Seller. All
such Seller Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance with past practices
of the Company or the relevant Operating Subsidiary, respectively, unless a
different treatment of any item is required by an intervening change in Law.
Seller shall provide such Seller Tax Returns, other than consolidated Income
Tax Returns, to the Purchaser and shall pay Purchaser any Taxes shown as due
on such Seller Tax Returns for the Pre-Closing Tax Period (except to the
extent such Taxes are taken into account in calculating Closing Net Working
Capital), other than consolidated Income Tax Returns, within one (1) Business
Day before the due date for such Taxes or the due date for filing such Seller
Tax Returns, whichever is earlier. The Seller shall be responsible for all
non-Income Tax Returns for Tax periods that are due on or before the Closing
Date.

 

(c) The Purchaser shall prepare and file (or cause the Acquired Companies to
prepare and file) all Income Tax Returns other than Seller Tax Returns that
relate to any Acquired Company for Straddle Periods (" _Straddle Tax Returns_
"). Such Straddle Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with
those prepared for prior taxable periods unless a different treatment of any
item is required by an intervening change in Law. Purchaser shall submit a
final draft of each Straddle Tax Return to the Seller for review and approval
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) no later
than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for such Straddle Tax Return. The
Seller shall pay to the Company within five (5) days following the
finalization of each Straddle Tax Return all Income Taxes required to be paid
with respect to such Straddle Tax Return to the extent such Income Taxes are
allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period under _Section_ __ _ 7.01(e_) and
have not been taken into account in the final Closing Net Working Capital or
in computing the Purchase Price. If, within

 



82  twenty (20) days after the receipt of the Straddle Tax Return, the Seller
(i) notifies the Purchaser that it disputes the manner of preparation of the
Straddle Tax Return or the portion of such Taxes allocable to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period calculated by the Purchaser and (ii) provides the Purchaser with a
statement setting forth in reasonable detail its computation of the portion of
such Taxes allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period and its proposed form of
the Straddle Tax Return, then Purchaser and the Seller shall attempt to
resolve their disagreement within five (5) days following the Sellers
notification of Purchaser of such disagreement. If the Purchaser and the
Seller are not able to resolve their disagreement, the dispute shall be
submitted to the Accountant. The Accountant will resolve the disagreement in a
manner consistent with this Agreement within thirty (30) days after the date
on which they are engaged or as soon as possible thereafter. The determination
of the Accountant shall be binding on the parties. The cost of the services of
the Accountant will be borne by the party whose calculation of the matter in
disagreement differs the most from the calculation as finally determined by
the Accountant. If each of the partys calculation differs equally from the
calculation as finally determined by the Accountant, then such cost will be
borne fifty percent (50%) by the Seller and fifty percent (50%) by the
Purchaser. If the Accountant is unable to resolve any such dispute prior to
the due date for such Straddle Tax Return, such Straddle Tax Return shall be
timely filed as prepared by the Purchaser subject to amendment, if necessary
to reflect the resolution by the Accountant.

 

(d) Purchaser shall not permit any Acquired Company to take any action, other
than transactions in the Ordinary Course of Business, consistent with past
practice, or transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements or pursuant to any Contract entered into prior to Closing that
could increase Sellers indemnification obligation for Taxes under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the Seller (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). None of Purchaser, any
Affiliate of Purchaser, the Company nor any Operating Subsidiary shall (or
shall cause or permit any Acquired Company to), unless otherwise required by
Law or a taxing authority or consented to by the Seller (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), amend, re-file or
otherwise modify any Tax Return of the Company or such Operating Subsidiary,
with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any Straddle Period, or extend
or waive the statute of limitations with respect to any Taxes for which
Seller could have an indemnification obligation under this Agreement.

(e) Whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of any
Acquired Company for a Straddle Period, the determination of the Taxes of such
Acquired Company for the portion of the year or period ending on, and the
portion of the year or period beginning after, the Closing Date generally
shall be determined by assuming that the Acquired Company had a taxable year
or period which ended at the close of the Closing Date, except that
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis
(such as the deduction for depreciation).

(f) Any Tax refunds received from a Governmental Authority that are received
by the Purchaser or the Company or an Operating Subsidiary (or the Affiliates
of any of them), and credits in lieu of a cash Tax refund against Tax to which
the

 



83  Purchaser or Company or any Operating Subsidiary (or the Affiliates of
either of them) become entitled, that relate to Pre-Closing Tax Periods
(which, for any Straddle Period, shall be determined consistently with the
computation of pre-Closing Taxes) shall be for the account of the Seller,
except to the extent such Taxes are taken into account in calculating Closing
Net Working Capital (subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.16_), and Purchaser shall
pay over to Seller any such refund and interest or the amount of any such
credit within five (5) days after receipt or entitlement thereto, net of (i)
any reasonable costs associated with obtaining such refund, (ii) any
applicable withholding Taxes required to be withheld on such payment, and
(iii) any Taxes incurred (net of Tax benefit realized) in respect of the
receipt or payment of such refund to Seller.

SECTION 7.02. _Tax Cooperation and Exchange of Information_

 

The Seller and the Purchaser shall provide each other with such cooperation
and information as either of them reasonably may request of the other (and
the Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Companies to provide such cooperation
and information) in filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for
refund, determining a liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes
or participating in or conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of
Taxes. Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of
relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with related work papers
and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by taxing
authorities. The Seller and the Purchaser shall make themselves (and their
respective employees) reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide explanations of any documents or information provided under this
_Section_ __ _ 7.02_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section_
__ _ 5.02_, each of the Seller and the Purchaser shall retain all Tax
Returns, work papers and all material records or other documents in its
possession (or in the possession of its Affiliates) relating to Tax matters of
any Acquired Company for any taxable period that includes the date of the
Closing and for all prior taxable periods until the later of (i) the
expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to which such
Tax Returns and other documents relate, without regard to extensions or (ii)
six (6) years following the due date (without extension) for such
Tax Returns. After such time, before the Seller or the Purchaser shall
dispose of any such documents in its possession (or in the possession of its
Affiliates), the other party shall be given an opportunity, after ninety (90)
days prior written notice, to remove and retain all or any part of such
documents as such other party may select (at such other partys expense). Any
information obtained under this Section 7.02 shall be kept confidential,
except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other proceeding.

 

SECTION 7.03. _Conveyance Taxes_

 

Each of the Seller and the Purchaser shall be liable for and agrees to pay
fifty percent (50%) of all Conveyance Taxes that may be imposed upon, or
payable or collectible or incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Purchaser and the Seller agree to
cooperate in the execution and delivery of all instruments and certificates
necessary to comply with any pre-Closing filing requirements.

 



84 SECTION 7.04. _Tax Contests_

 

(a) If Purchaser or an Acquired Company receives notice of any audit,
examination or other Tax proceeding from a tax authority involving an
Acquired Company (a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") for any Pre-Closing Tax Period for a
Tax for which the Seller is liable, Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller in
writing of such fact; provided that any failure to give such notice will not
waive any rights of the indemnified party except to the extent the rights or
obligations of the Seller is actually prejudiced.

 

(b) The Seller shall have the right to defend the Acquired Company in any Tax
Proceeding (including the right to extend or waive any statute of limitations
applicable to Taxes for which the Seller is liable) that could materially
affect the liability of the Seller (or refunds to which the Seller would be
entitled) hereunder at the expense of the Seller if (i) the Seller notifies
Purchaser in writing within thirty (30) days after Purchaser has given notice
of such Tax Proceeding, (ii) if Seller requested the Company to pay a Tax
claimed and sue for a refund, Seller shall have advanced to the Company, on
an interest free basis, the full amount the indemnified party is required to
pay, and (iii) the Seller conducts the defense of the Tax Proceeding in a
commercially reasonable manner.

 

(c) The Seller shall be entitled to prosecute such Tax Proceeding to a
determination in a court of initial jurisdiction, and if the Seller shall
reasonably request, to a determination in an appellate court.

(d) Seller shall not be entitled to settle or to contest any claim relating
to Taxes unless Purchaser has consented to such settlement, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(e) If, after actual receipt by an Acquired Company or its Affiliates of an
amount advanced by Seller pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.04(b_) above, such
amount is refunded or credited to the Acquired Company or its Affiliates
following judgment or decree of a court that has become final or a binding
settlement with an administrative agency having jurisdiction thereof that has
become final, the Acquired Company shall promptly pay to Seller any such
refund or credit, net of the net Income Tax cost (if any) to the Acquired
Company and its Affiliates of (i) the advance of such amount by Seller, (ii)
the refund of such amount to Purchaser or its Affiliates and (iii) the payment
thereof to Seller.

 

(f) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.04_, rather than the provisions
of Section 10.04, shall govern the conduct of any and all Tax Proceedings.

SECTION 7.05. _Section_ __ _ 338 Election_

 

(a) At the request and sole expense of the Purchaser, the Seller (and any
other necessary Person) shall assist the Purchaser in determining whether an
election or elections under Section 338 of the Code (and any corresponding
election under state, local, and non-US Law) (each a " _Section_ __ _
338 Election_") with respect to the actual or constructive acquisition of the
Shares of the Company or any other Acquired Company

 



85  pursuant to this Agreement can be made without unreasonable cost, expense,
time or effort by the Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller shall
have no obligation to assist Purchaser in making this determination if this
would require an unreasonable amount of time or effort by the Seller or
otherwise interfere with Sellers operations, to be determined by Seller in
its own discretion. If the Purchaser and the Seller mutually agree that the
Purchaser may make a Section 338 Election, then the Purchaser, the Seller, and
the Acquired Companies shall report the transaction consistent with such
Section 338 Elections and shall not to take any action that could cause such
Section 338 Elections to be invalid, and shall take no position contrary
thereto. In the event that the Purchaser and Seller agree that the Purchaser
may make a Section 338 Election, without limiting the foregoing, the Seller
shall cooperate with the Purchaser to properly complete, duly execute and
timely file any required IRS Form 8023 (and any corresponding state, local or
non-US form) within the time period required by applicable Law. 

(b) In the event that the Purchaser and the Seller agree that the Purchaser
may make a Section 338 Election in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.05(a)_,
then the Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller an allocation of the Final
Purchase Price (and other applicable amounts for Tax purposes), which
allocation shall be reasonably acceptable to the Seller, among the assets of
the Acquired Companies in accordance with Section 338 and Section 1060 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (and any similar provision of
applicable state, local or non-US Law) (the " _Purchase Price Allocation_ ").
Each party shall prepare and file, and cause its Affiliates to prepare and
file, all required Tax Returns on a basis consistent with the Purchase
Price Allocation (including any required IRS Form 8883 and any similar state,
local or non-US forms) and shall take no position, and cause its Affiliates to
take no position, inconsistent with the Purchase Price Allocation on any Tax
Return or in any audit or other Action with respect to Taxes or otherwise. In
the event that the Purchase Price Allocation is disputed by any Governmental
Authority, the party receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly notify
the other party of such dispute, and each party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to defend such Purchase Price Allocation in any audit or
other Action and not to settle or otherwise dispose of such audit or other
Action without the prior written consent of the other party (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(c) In the event that the Purchaser and Seller agree that the Purchaser may
make a Section 338 Election, as soon as practicable (but no later than thirty
(30) days) after delivery of the Purchase Price Allocation pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 7.05(b)_, the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser for review
and comment a detailed draft schedule calculating the amount of additional
consideration on a "with and without" basis that the Purchaser would need to
pay in order to cause the Sellers after-Tax proceeds from the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement, with all requested Section 338 Elections
assumed being made, to be equal to the after-Tax net proceeds that the Seller
would have received from such transactions, without any Section 338 Election
being made, taking into account the U.S. federal, state, local and non-US
Income Tax consequences of each requested Section 338 Election as appropriate.
The Seller shall provide the Purchaser with all such information as is
reasonably requested with respect 

 



86  to the calculation of such amounts. All reasonable comments of the Purchaser
shall be considered in good faith by the Seller and, if agreed to by the
Seller, incorporated into the calculation of such amounts as finalized (the
finalized amount, the " _Section_ __ _ 338 Tax Adjustment Amount_").

 

(d) If any Section 338 Election is made in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
7.05_, the Purchaser shall pay the applicable Section 338 Tax Adjustment
Amount to the Seller no later than five (5) days prior to the due date
(including any extension) for the filing of its U.S. federal Income Tax Return
for the taxable year that includes the Closing Date.

SECTION 7.06. _Miscellaneous_

 

(a) For purposes of this _Article VII_, all references to the Purchaser, the
Seller, Affiliates, the Company and any Operating Subsidiary include
successors.

(b) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
the covenants and agreements of the parties hereto contained in this _Article
VII_ shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force until the
expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations for the Taxes in question
(taking into account any extensions or waivers thereof).

(c) Any Tax sharing agreement or arrangement between the Seller or any of
its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies), on the one hand, and any
of the Acquired Companies, on the other hand, shall have been terminated, and
all payments thereunder settled, immediately prior to the Closing with no
payments permitted to be made thereunder on and after the date of the
Closing.

(d) All payments made under this _Article VII_ shall be treated by the
parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by Law.

ARTICLE VIII

 

CONDITIONS TO CLOSING

warranties of the Purchaser contained in this Agreement shall be true and
correct in all respects (disregarding all qualifications or limitations as to
"materiality," "material adverse effect" and words of similar import set
forth therein) as of the Closing as though made on and as of such date (other
than such representations and warranties that are made as of another date, in
which case such representations and warranties shall be

 



87  true and correct as of such other date), except where the failure of such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
material adverse effect on the Purchasers ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) the covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement to be complied with by the Purchaser

representations and warranties that are made as of another date, in which
case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct as of such

(excluding conditions that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied until the
Closing) shall have been satisfied or waived, except that the conditions set

Purchaser until the relevant consent, clearance or authorisation for that
jurisdiction shall have been obtained (the " _Relevant Jurisdiction Clearance_

(b) the Seller shall ensure that the Relevant Jurisdiction Assets are held
and operated in the Ordinary Course of Business and the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 5.01_ shall apply in this regard;

 



89 (c) the Purchaser and the Seller shall enter into such arrangements as
will ensure that the Relevant Jurisdiction Assets will be ring-fenced from

be required to take any action that would reasonably be expected to
constitute a violation of Law.

(iii) the Seller or the Purchaser pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.01(f)_, or

Purchaser shall pay to the Seller by wire transfer of immediately available
funds $168,000,000 (the " _Purchaser Termination Fee_ "), without any
deductions for withholding or other similar Taxes, within seven (7) Business
Days after such termination. If the Purchaser Termination Fee is due pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 9.03_, and, in order to obtain the payment thereof,
the Seller commences an Action which results in a final judgment not subject
to reasonable further appeal (or any settlement payment) against the Purchaser

Seller its reasonable out of pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees) incurred in connection with such Action and enforcing its
rights hereunder, together with interest on such amounts at the prime lending
rate as published in  _The Wall Street Journal_ on the date such payment was

right to receive the Purchaser Termination Fee plus any amounts owed pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 5.17(a)(v)_ (the " _Recoverable Amounts_ ") from the
Purchaser shall be the Sellers sole and exclusive remedy against the
Purchaser, Purchaser Parent, Investors, any Financing Source, and
their respective Representatives relating to or arising out of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) upon payment of the Recoverable
Amounts, none of the Purchaser, Purchaser Parent, Investors nor any Financing
Source, nor any of their respective Representatives, shall have any further
liability or obligation to the Seller, its stockholders, the Acquired
Companies, or any of their respective Representatives relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including for
(A) any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any covenant or agreement
in this Agreement or the failure of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be consummated and (B) any consequential, special, indirect or
punitive damages, and (iii) none of the Seller, its stockholders, the Acquired
Companies, nor any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any
Action against the Purchaser, Purchaser Parent, Investors, any Financing
Source or any of their respective Representatives arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (or the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters forming
the basis for such termination. Under no circumstances will the Seller be
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance and the Purchaser
Termination Fee.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Financing Source shall
have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the parties hereto
or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise), based on, in
respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith. In no event shall the Seller or any of its Affiliates, and the
Seller agrees not to and to cause its Affiliates not to, (i) seek to

 



92  enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement
against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Financing Source or the
Investors or (ii) seek to enforce the commitments against, make any claims
for breach of the Debt Commitment Letter or Equity Commitment Letter against,
or seek to recover monetary damages from, or otherwise sue, the Financing
Sources or the Investors for any reason, including in connection with the
Debt Commitment Papers or the obligations of lenders thereunder or the Equity
Commitment Letter or the obligations of the Investors thereunder. Nothing in
this _Section_ __ _ 9.03(c)_ shall in any way limit or qualify the
liabilities of the Financing Sources, the Investors and the other parties to
the Financing (or the definitive documents entered into pursuant thereto) to
each other thereunder or in connection therewith.

SECTION 10.03. _Claim Procedure_

 

(a) A party that seeks indemnity under this _Article X_ (an " _Indemnified
Party_ ") will give written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the party from
whom indemnification is sought (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") containing (i) a
description and, if known, the estimated amount of any Losses incurred or
reasonably expected to be incurred by the Indemnified Party, (ii) a
reasonable explanation of the basis for the Claim Notice to the extent of the
facts then known by the Indemnified Party and (iii) a demand for payment of
those Losses.

 

(b) Within thirty (30) days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying
Party will deliver to the Indemnified Party a written response in which the
Indemnifying Party will either:

(i) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the Losses
at issue in the Claim Notice; or

(ii) dispute the Indemnified Partys entitlement to indemnification by
delivering to the Indemnified Party a written notice (an " _Objection Notice_
") setting forth in reasonable detail each disputed item, the basis for each
such disputed item and certifying that all such disputed items are being
disputed in good faith.

 



94 (c) If the Indemnifying Party fails to take either of the foregoing
actions within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Claim Notice, then the
Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have irrevocably accepted the Claim
Notice and the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have irrevocably agreed to
pay the Losses at issue in the Claim Notice.

(d) If the Indemnifying Party delivers an Objection Notice to the Indemnified
Party within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Claim Notice, then the
dispute may be resolved by any legally available means consistent with the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 11.12_.

 

(e) Any indemnification of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to this
_Article_ __ _ X _will be effected by wire transfer of immediately available
funds from the Seller to an account designated by the Purchaser, and any
indemnification of the Seller pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ X_ will be
effected by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the Seller.

(f) The foregoing indemnification payments will be made within five (5)
Business Days after the date on which (i) the amount of such payments are
determined by mutual agreement of the parties, (ii) the amount of such
payments are determined pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 10.03(c_) if an
Objection Notice has not been timely delivered in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 10.03(b_) or (iii) both such amount and the Indemnifying Partys obligation
to pay such amount have been finally determined by a final Governmental Order
of a court having jurisdiction over such proceeding as permitted by _Section
11.12_ if an Objection Notice has been timely delivered in accordance with 
_Section_ __ _ 10.03(b_).

SECTION 10.04. _Third Party Claims_

 

(a) If the Indemnified Party seeks indemnity under this _Article_ __ _ X_ in
respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or demand, whether or not
involving an Action, by another Person not a party to this Agreement other
than any Tax Proceeding (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), then the Indemnified
Party will include in the Claim Notice (i) notice of the commencement or
threat of any Action relating to such Third Party Claim within thirty (30)
days after the Indemnified Party has received written notice of the
commencement of the Third Party Claim and (ii) the facts constituting the
basis for such Third Party Claim and the amount of the damages claimed by the
other Person, in each case to the extent known to the Indemnified Party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no delay or deficiency on the part of
the Indemnified Party in so notifying the Indemnifying Party will relieve the
Indemnifying Party of any Liability or obligation under this Agreement except
to the extent the Indemnifying Party has suffered actual Losses directly
caused by the delay or other deficiency.

(b) If the Seller is the Indemnifying Party, the Purchaser shall be entitled
to control the defense of any Third Party Claim, provided that all of the
out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by the Purchaser in connection with
such defense will be considered and included as "Losses" for purposes of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller shall be entitled to
control the defense of any Third Party

 



95  Claim to the extent involving a Specified Matter, provided that (i) such
Third Party Claim is not a Special Claim and (ii) the Seller retains counsel
for the defense of such Third Party Claims reasonably satisfactory to the
Purchaser. A " _Special Claim_ " means any Third Party Claim (A) involving
criminal liability or (B) in which any relief other than monetary damages is
sought against the Indemnified Party.

(c) The party controlling the defense (the " _Controlling Party_ ") will
reasonably advise the party not controlling the defense (the "
_Noncontrolling Party_ ") of the status of the Third Party Claim and the
defense thereof and, with respect to any Third Party Claim that does not
relate to a Special Claim, the Controlling Party will consider in good faith
recommendations made by the Noncontrolling Party. The Noncontrolling Party
shall be entitled to participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim at
its own cost and expense, unless the Noncontrolling Party is the Indemnified
Party and the Noncontrolling Party reasonably concludes that the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party have conflicting interests or different
defenses available with respect to the Third Party Claim, then the reasonable
out-of-pocket fees and expenses of the Noncontrolling Party will be considered
and included as "Losses" for purposes of this Agreement. The Noncontrolling
Party will furnish the Controlling Party with such information as it may have
with respect to such Third Party Claim and related Actions (including copies
of any summons, complaint or other pleading which may have been served on such
party and any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or other document
evidencing or asserting the same) and will otherwise cooperate with and assist
in the defense of the Third Party Claim.

 

(d) If the Indemnified Party is controlling the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party has the right to agree in good faith to any
compromise or settlement of, or the entry of any Governmental Order arising
from, the Third Party Claim subject to obtaining the prior written consent of
the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. All amounts paid or payable under such
settlement or Governmental Order are Losses that the Indemnifying Party owes
to the Indemnified Party under this _Article_ __ _ X_. The Indemnifying Party
will not agree to any compromise or settlement of, or the entry of any
Governmental Order arising from, the Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent the Indemnified Party
will not unreasonably withhold or delay. The Indemnified Party will have no
Liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of, or the entry of any
Governmental Order arising from, any Third Party Claim effected without its
consent.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 11.12_, the Seller
consents to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any court in which an Action is
brought by another Person against any Purchaser Indemnified Party for purposes
of any claim that a Purchaser Indemnified Party may have under this Agreement
with respect to the Action or the matters alleged therein. The Seller agrees
that process may be served on it with respect to such a claim anywhere in the
world.



 



96 SECTION 10.05. _Survival_.

 

(a) All representations and warranties contained in this Agreement and the
covenants that by their terms were to be performed prior to the Closing will
survive the Closing for a period of eighteen (18) months following the Closing
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Fundamental Warranties and the
representations and warranties set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 3.15_ will
survive the Closing for a period of seven (7) years following the Closing Date
and (ii) the representations and warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.11_
will survive the Closing for a period of five (5) years following the Closing
Date. The covenants contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms (or, if no survival period is
specified), indefinitely.

 

(b) All claims for indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 10.01(a)_, _Section_
__ _ 10.01(c)_ or _Section_ __ _ 10.02(a)_ must be asserted prior to the
expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in _Section_ __ _
10.05(a);_ _provided_ , _however_ , that if an Indemnified Party delivers to
an Indemnifying Party, before expiration of the applicable survival period of
a representation or warranty as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 10.05(a)_, either
a Claim Notice based upon a breach of any such representation or warranty, or
a notice that, as a result of a claim or demand made by a Person not a party
to this Agreement, the Indemnified Party reasonably expects to incur Losses,
then the applicable representation or warranty will survive until, but only
for purposes of, the resolution of the matter covered by such notice. If the
claim with respect to which such notice has been given is definitively
withdrawn or resolved in favor of the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party
will promptly so notify the Indemnifying Party.

SECTION 10.06. _Limitations on Liability_

the Purchaser pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 10.01(a)_, _Section_ __ _
10.01(c)_ or _Section_ __ _ 10.02(a)_, as the case may be, in respect of any
individual claim or series of claims having the same nature or origin

_however_ , that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to any
indemnification with respect to any Fundamental Warranties or the
representations and warranties set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 3.15_;

(ii) the aggregate total amount in respect of which the Seller will be liable
to indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to

of _Section_ __ _ 10.06(a)(vi)_) will not exceed $14,700,000 (the " _Seller_
__ _s Cap_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing limitation shall
not apply to any indemnification with respect to any Fundamental Warranties of
the Seller or the representations and warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _
3.15_;

(iii) the aggregate total amount in respect of which the Seller will be
liable to indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.01(b)_ and in respect of breaches of
Fundamental Warranties and the representations and warranties set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 3.15_ will not exceed the Purchase Price;

 



97 (iv) the aggregate total amount in respect of which the Seller will be liable

_however_ , that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to any
indemnification with respect to any Fundamental Warranties of the Purchaser;
and

(vi) any indemnification payments (excluding litigation costs and attorneys
fees, costs and expenses) required to be made by or on behalf of the Seller
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.01(a)_ shall be reduced by fifty percent (50%);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to any
indemnification with respect to any Fundamental Warranties of the Seller or
the representations and warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.15_.

 

(b) The Indemnified Party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate any Losses with respect to which it may be entitled to seek
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement.

(c) Nothing in this Agreement (including  _Section_ __ _ 4.09_) will limit
the Liability of a party hereto to the other party hereto for fraud or willful
misconduct.

 

(d) Any Loss shall be reduced by any Tax benefit actually realized by an
Indemnified Party or an Affiliate of an Indemnified Party in the form of a
refund or reduction in Taxes otherwise payable by the applicable Indemnified
Party or its Affiliates arising in connection with the accrual, incurrence or
payment of any such Losses, including any such Tax benefit arising from a

Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, all costs and expenses,
including, fees and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors
and accountants, incurred in connection with this Agreement and the

occurred; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that each of the Purchaser and the Seller

including any filing(s) required by the requirements of the antitrust laws of
any relevant jurisdiction.

SECTION 11.02. _Specific Performance_

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and otherwise to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Nothing contained herein shall
prevent a party from seeking damages in the event that specific performance
is not available.

(b) The right of the Seller to obtain an injunction, or other appropriate form
of specific performance or equitable relief, in each case, solely with
respect to causing the Purchaser to consummate the Closing shall be subject to
the requirements that (i) all of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _
8.02_ have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms
are to be satisfied at or shortly before the Closing ( _provided_ , such
conditions would be satisfied if the Closing were to occur on any relevant
date during the pendency of such action for specific performance)), (ii) the
Debt Financing has been funded or would concurrently be funded in accordance

thereof at the Closing if the Debt Financing is funded at the Closing and (iv)

Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing will occur. To avoid doubt, the
foregoing sentence shall not apply to or otherwise limit the right of the

obligations other than with respect to the obligations of the Purchaser to
consummate the Closing.

party unless otherwise required by Law or applicable stock exchange

SECTION 11.05. _Severability_

 

If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy, all other terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect for so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 

SECTION 11.06. _Entire Agreement_

 

This Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements,
understandings, representations and undertakings, either written or oral,
between the Seller and the Purchaser with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Confidentiality Agreement
will remain in effect in accordance with its terms as modified pursuant to
_Section 5.03_.

 

SECTION 11.07. _Assignment_

 

This Agreement may not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise without
the express written consent of the Seller and the Purchaser (which consent
may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of the Seller or the
Purchaser), as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser
may assign this Agreement to (a) an Affiliate of the Purchaser or (b) any
lender to the Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof as security for obligations
to such lender in respect of the financing arrangements entered into in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and any refinancing or
extensions thereof, provided that no assignment to any such Affiliate or
lender shall relieve the Purchaser of its obligations under this Agreement.

 



102 SECTION 11.08. _Amendment_

 

This Agreement may not be amended or modified except by an instrument in
writing signed by, or on behalf of, the Seller and the Purchaser, and that

"Lenders" and the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 9.01_, _Section_ __ _
9.03(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.03(c)_, _Section_ __ _ 11.06_, _Section_ __ _
11.10_, _Section_ __ _ 11.12_,  _Section_ __ _ 11.13_ and this _Section_ __
_ 11.08_ (and any provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment,
modification, waiver or termination of such provision would modify the

terminated in a manner that adversely affects the Financing Sources or the
Investors without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources or the
Investors, as applicable, adversely affected thereby.

SECTION 11.09. _Waiver_

 

Any party to this Agreement may (a) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered by the other party pursuant
hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements of the other party
or conditions to such partys obligations contained herein. Any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party to be bound thereby. Any waiver of any term or
condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a
subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term
or condition of this Agreement. The failure of any party hereto to assert any
of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any of such rights.

SECTION 11.10. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_

 

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and
nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any

103 SECTION 11.12. _Governing Law_

 

This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the conflict of law
rules thereof to the extent that the application of the law of another
jurisdiction would be required thereby. All Actions arising out of or relating
to this Agreement shall be heard and determined exclusively in any Delaware
federal court sitting in Wilmington, Delaware; provided, however, that if
such federal court does not have jurisdiction over such Action, such Action
shall be heard and determined exclusively in any Delaware state court sitting
in Wilmington, Delaware. Consistent with the preceding sentence, the parties
hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state
court sitting in Wilmington, Delaware for the purpose of any Action arising
out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any party hereto and (b)
irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or
otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to
the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or
immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may not be
enforced in or by any of the above-named courts. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller agrees and consents to be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the English courts in any suit, action or proceeding commenced
by Seller against any Financing Source arising out of, or relating to the
Debt Commitment Papers, the Debt Financing or the performance of services
thereunder.

PARTIES HERETO HEREBY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE,
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
11.13_.

 

SECTION 11.14. _Counterparts_

 

This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile or
electronic (including .pdf) transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by
the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when
executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 

SECTION 11.15. _Interpretation_

 

In the negotiation of this Agreement, each party has received advice from its
own legal counsel. The language used in this Agreement is the language chosen
by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no provision of this
Agreement will be interpreted for or against any party because that party or
its attorney drafted the provision.

 



104 SECTION 11.16. _Exhibits and Schedules_

 

The Exhibits and Disclosure Schedule to this Agreement are incorporated herein
by reference and made a part of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 11.17. _Privileged Communications; Representation by Greenberg
Traurig_

 

(a) Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby agrees, on its own behalf and
on behalf of its directors, managers, members, partners, officers, employees
and Affiliates, that Greenberg Traurig LLP may serve as counsel to each and
any of the Seller and its Affiliates (individually and collectively, the "
_Seller Representation Group_ ") in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, and that, following consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, Greenberg Traurig LLP (or any successor) may
serve as counsel to the Seller Representation Group or any director, manager,
member, partner, officer, employee or Affiliate of any member of the Seller
Representation Group, in connection with any litigation, claim or obligation
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements
notwithstanding such representation or any continued representation any
Acquired Company, and each of the parties hereto (on its own behalf and on
behalf of its Affiliates) hereby consents thereto.

 

(b) The parties agree to take the steps necessary to ensure that any privilege
attaching as a result of Greenberg Traurig LLP representing any Acquired
Company solely in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements (the " _Engagement_ ") shall survive the
Closing and shall remain in effect, provided that such privilege from and
after the Closing shall be controlled by the Seller. As to any privileged
attorney-client communications between Greenberg Traurig LLP and any Acquired
Company prior to the Closing Date that relate to the preparation for or
negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements (collectively, the " _Privileged
Communications_ "), the Purchaser and the Company together with any of their
respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries, successors or assigns agree that no such
party may use the Privileged Communications in any action against or involving
any of the parties hereto after the Closing. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, solely in the context of a
dispute between the Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Acquired
Companies) and the Purchaser and its Affiliates with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, (i)
the Seller and its Affiliates (and not the Acquired Companies) shall be the
sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to the Engagement,
and none of any Acquired Company shall be a holder thereof, (ii) to the
extent that files of Greenberg Traurig LLP in respect of the Engagement
constitute property of the client,

 



105  only the Seller and their Affiliates (and not the Company or any of its
Affiliates) shall hold such property rights and (iii) Greenberg Traurig LLP
shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such Privileged
Communications to any of any Acquired Company by reason of any attorney-client
relationship between Greenberg Traurig LLP and any of any Acquired Company or
otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a dispute arises after the
Closing between the Purchaser or any Acquired Company, on the one hand, and a
third party other than (and unaffiliated with) the Seller, on the other hand,
then the Purchaser or any Acquired Company (to the extent applicable)
may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure to such third
party of confidential communications by Greenberg Traurig LLP, and, in
relation to such dispute, the Seller shall not be permitted to waive its
attorney-client privilege with respect to such confidential communications
without the Purchasers prior written consent.

[ _Signature page follows_ ]

 



106 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Seller and the Purchaser have caused this Agreement to
be executed as of the date first written above by their respective officers
thereunto duly authorized.
