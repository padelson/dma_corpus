corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_

Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board of
Directors_ ") has (a) unanimously determined that it is in the best interests
of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into
this Agreement, (b) approved the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger and (c) resolved to recommend adoption of this Agreement

approved the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger;

WHEREAS, Parent has caused American Air Liquide Holdings, Inc., as the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub, to approve the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger, and adopted this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Parents willingness to enter into
this Agreement, certain persons, in their capacity as stockholders of the
Company, have simultaneously herewith entered into a Voting and Support
Agreement (the " _Voting and Support Agreement_ ") in connection with the
Merger; and

 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements specified herein
in connection with this Agreement. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I.

_THE MERGER_

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_
"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall
continue its existence under Delaware law as the surviving company in the
Merger (the " _Surviving Company_ ") and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent.

 

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton LLP, One
Liberty Plaza, New York, New York 10006 at 8:00 a.m., local time, as promptly
as practicable but in no event later than the fifth Business Day after the
satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of the
conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), or at such other place, date and
time as the Company and Parent may agree in writing. The date on which the
Closing actually occurs is referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

 

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, the Company and Merger Sub
shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate
of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), executed in accordance with, and
containing such information as is required by, the relevant provisions of the
DGCL in order to effect the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such
time as the Certificate of Merger has been filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware or at such time as is agreed between the parties and
specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL (such time is hereinafter referred to as the "
_Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.4  _Effects of the Merger_. The effects of the Merger shall be as
provided in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Company,
and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall
become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company, all as
provided under the DGCL.

Section 1.5 _Organizational Documents of the Surviving Company_.

 

(a) Subject to the requirements set forth in _Section 5.9_, at the Effective
Time, the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended in accordance
with the provisions thereof and applicable Law, except that the name of the
Surviving Company shall be "Airgas, Inc.".

 



2 (b) Subject to the requirements set forth in _Section 5.9_, at the Effective
Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Company until thereafter
amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable Law, except
that the name of the Surviving Company shall be "Airgas, Inc.".

Section 1.6 _Directors_. Subject to applicable Law, the directors of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of
the Surviving Company and shall hold office until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or
removal.

 

Section 1.7 _Officers_. Except as otherwise determined by Parent prior to the
Effective Time, the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Company and shall hold
office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or
their earlier death, resignation or removal.

 

ARTICLE II.

 

 _CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

 

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or common stock of Merger Sub:

(i) _Common Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Company. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates
representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes
to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Company
into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence.

(ii) _Cancellation of Certain Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned
or held in treasury by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each share
of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time that is owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(including Merger Sub) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and shall cease to exist (the " _Cancelled Shares_ "), and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(iii) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Cancelled Shares, any Dissenting Shares, and any shares of Company
Common Stock held by any Subsidiary of the Company) shall be automatically
converted into the right to receive $143.00 in cash (the " _Merger
Consideration_ ").

 



3 All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_ shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as
of the Effective Time, and uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock
represented by book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and each certificate
that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented any such shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration into which the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Book-Entry Share or Certificate have
been converted pursuant to this _Section 2.1_.

 

(b) _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, any issued and outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock held by a person (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who has not
voted in favor of, or consented to, the adoption of this Agreement and has
complied with all the provisions of the DGCL concerning the right of
holders of shares of Company Common Stock to require appraisal of their
shares (the " _Appraisal Provisions_ ") of Company Common Stock (" _Dissenting
Shares_ "), to the extent the Appraisal Provisions are applicable, shall not
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as described
in _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_, but shall become the right to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder
pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If such
Dissenting Stockholder withdraws its demand for appraisal or fails to perfect
or otherwise loses its right of appraisal, in any case pursuant to the DGCL,
each of such Dissenting Stockholders shares of Company Common Stock shall
thereupon be treated as though such shares of Company Common Stock had been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.1(a)(iii)_. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any
demands for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock received by the
Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL and shall give Parent the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect thereto. The
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

 

(c) _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have
been changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares
by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization,
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split,
combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred,
then the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without
duplication, to proportionally reflect such change; _provided_ , that nothing
in this _Section 2.1(c)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take
any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of
this Agreement.

 



4 Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Appointment of Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act
as payment agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger
Consideration and shall enter into a paying agent agreement reasonably
acceptable to the Company relating to the Paying Agents
responsibilities under this Agreement.

(b) _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, in
trust for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, cash sufficient
to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (such aggregate Merger
Consideration, the " _Payment Fund_ ").

 

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable (and no later
than the third Business Day) after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of shares of Company Common
Stock whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted pursuant to _Section
2.1(a)(iii)_ into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates or
transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as Parent shall reasonably designate)
(the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration.

(d) _Surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares_. Upon surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent together with the
Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this Agreement. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer or stock records of the Company, any cash to be
paid upon due surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share formerly
representing such shares of Company Common Stock may be paid or issued, as
the case may be, to such a transferee if such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer or other similar Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. No
interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the Merger Consideration payable
upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

 

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after the
Effective Time, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares,
(i) all holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any
rights as stockholders of the Company other than the right to receive the
Merger Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this Agreement upon the
surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with

 



5   _Section 2.2(d)_, without interest, and (ii) the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares formerly representing shares of
Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Company, Parent or the
Paying Agent for any reason, such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_, subject to
applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

 

(f) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Payment Fund as directed by Parent;  _provided_ , that no
such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Article II_, and
following any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares
of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time in the amount of such losses,
which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Payment Fund.
Any interest or other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent, upon demand.

(g) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including
any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that remains
unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be delivered
to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
who has not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look
only to Parent or the Surviving Company (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Laws), as general creditors thereof, for satisfaction
of its claim for Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to this _Article II_ without any interest thereon. 

(h) _No Liability_. Subject to applicable Law, none of Parent, the Company,
Merger Sub or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any portion of the Payment Fund or the Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. Subject to applicable Law, notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, any portion of the Merger Consideration or the cash to be
paid in accordance with this _Article II_ that remains undistributed to the
holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares as of immediately prior to the
date on which the Merger Consideration or such cash would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled
thereto.

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Company, Parent, Merger Sub
and the Paying Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, any
amounts required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under applicable Tax Law; it being understood that, no withholding or
deduction shall be required under the Laws of France from any

 



6  amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement solely as a result of
the fact that Parent is organized under the Laws of France rather than the
United States, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, except to the
extent that any such deduction or withholding shall be required by a change in
Law (or official interpretation thereof announced by the French taxing
authorities) after the date hereof. Any amounts so deducted, withheld and
paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of
which such deduction or withholding was made.

 

(j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such
amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Company with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent (or, if subsequent
to the termination of the Payment Fund and subject to _Section 2.2(g)_,
Parent) shall deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

 

Section 2.3 _Company Options; Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan_.

 

(a) As of the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock granted pursuant to a Company Stock Plan or otherwise granted to an
employee or other individual service provider for compensatory purposes (each,
a " _Company Option_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be cancelled by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, in consideration for
the right to receive a cash payment with respect thereto equal to the product
of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option as of the Effective Time and (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option as of the Effective Time (the " _Option
Cash Payment_ "). The Option Cash Payment shall be payable (without interest
and less applicable withholding Taxes) in a lump sum promptly (but in no event
more than five Business Days) following the Closing Date. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company Board of Directors and/or the appropriate
committee thereof shall take all reasonable actions to provide that (i) no
holder of Company Options shall have any rights in respect of the Company
Options other than the right to receive the Option Cash Payment contemplated
by this _Section 2.3(a)_ and (ii) the Company Stock Plans shall be terminated
as of the Effective Time.

 

(b) As of the Effective Time, notional investments in Company Common Stock

procedures are designed to ensure that all information required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Companys management has completed an assessment of
the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting

loss, or suspension, limitation or impairment of any right of Parent or
Merger Sub to own or use any assets required for the conduct of their business
or result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation,
or acceleration of, any obligation or to the loss of a benefit under any loan,
guarantee of indebtedness or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage,

the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of
such a Specified Acquisition would reasonably be expected to (A) prevent,

any material respect the ability of Parent to procure, any authorizations,
consents, orders, declarations or approvals of any Governmental Entity or
the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or (B) materially increase the

during normal business hours upon reasonable advance notice to the Company,
throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its and its
Subsidiaries personnel, properties, contracts, commitments, books and records
and any report, schedule or other document filed or received by it pursuant to
the requirements of applicable Laws and, during such period, the Company

39  Agreement and (iii) all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ ,
_however_ , until the condition in  _Section 6.1(c)_ is satisfied, the Clean
Team Confidentiality Agreement between the Company and Parent, dated as of
November 10, 2015 (the " _Clean Team Confidentiality Agreement_ ") shall
govern access to "Highly Confidential Information" as defined therein.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 5.2(a)_,
any document, correspondence or information provided pursuant to this _Section
5.2(a)_ may be redacted to remove references concerning the valuation of the
Company and the Merger or other similarly confidential information. All access
pursuant to this _Section 5.2(a)_ shall be (A) conducted in such a manner as
not to interfere unreasonably with the normal operations of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and (B) coordinated through the General Counsel of the
Company or a designee thereof.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 5.2_,
no party to this Agreement nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
provide any access, or make available any document, correspondence or
information, if doing so would, in such partys and its outside legal
counsels reasonable judgment, (i) jeopardize the attorney-client privilege
of such party or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) conflict with any (A) Law
applicable to such party or any of its Subsidiaries or the assets, or
operation of the business, of such party or any of its Subsidiaries or (B)
Contract to which such party or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which
any of their assets or properties are bound; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
such instances such party shall inform the other party of the general nature
of the information being withheld and, upon the other partys request,
reasonably cooperate with the other party to provide such information, in
whole or in part, in a manner that would not result in any of the outcomes
described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii).

(c) No investigation by Parent or its representatives shall affect or be
deemed to modify or waive the representations and warranties of the Company
set forth in this Agreement.

(d) The parties hereto hereby agree that all information provided to them or
their respective officers, directors, employees or representatives in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be governed in accordance with the confidentiality
agreement, dated as of October 20, 2015, between the Company and Parent (the
" _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms and the Clean Team Confidentiality
Agreement.

 

Section 5.3 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.3_, the Company shall,
and shall cause each of its Affiliates and its and their respective officers,
directors, employees and agents, and shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause each of its financial advisors, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants and other representatives (collectively, with its Affiliates and
its and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, "
_Representatives_ ") to: (i) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions or negotiations with (and provision of information to) any persons
(other than 

 



40  Parent) that may be ongoing with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal and
(ii) not, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage
or knowingly facilitate any inquiries regarding, or the making of any
proposal or offer, including any proposal or offer to its stockholders, that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Takeover
Proposal, (B) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions
or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other person any information in
connection with or for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, any
inquiry, proposal or offer (whether written or oral, binding or nonbinding)
that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company
Takeover Proposal (other than, solely in response to an unsolicited inquiry,
to ascertain facts from the person making such Company Takeover Proposal for
the sole purpose of the Company Board of Directors informing itself about
such Company Takeover Proposal and the person that made it and to refer the
inquiring person to this _Section 5.3_ and to limit its conversation or other
communication exclusively to such referral and such ascertaining of facts),
or (C) approve, recommend or enter into, or propose to approve, recommend or
enter into, any letter of intent or similar document, agreement, commitment,
or agreement in principle (whether written or oral, binding or nonbinding)
with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal.

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, promptly request
(to the extent it has not already done so prior to the date of this Agreement)
any person that has executed a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement
that remains in effect as of the date of this Agreement in connection with
any actual or potential Company Takeover Proposal to return or destroy all
confidential information of the Company or its Affiliates in the possession of
such person or its Representatives. The Company shall not, and shall cause
its Affiliates not to, release any third party from, or waive, amend or
modify any provision of, or grant permission under, (i) any standstill
provision in any agreement to which the Company or any of its Affiliates is a
party or (ii) any confidentiality provision in any agreement to which the
Company or any of its Affiliates is a party; _provided_ , that if the Company
Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the
Company may waive any such standstill provision solely to the extent necessary
to permit a third party to make, on a confidential basis to the Company Board
of Directors, a Company Takeover Proposal. Except to the extent otherwise
permitted by the proviso in the foregoing sentence, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, enforce the confidentiality and
standstill provisions of any such agreement. The Company shall not (A) except
as expressly provided by this Agreement, take any action to exempt any Person
from the restrictions on "business combinations" or any similar provision
contained in any applicable Takeover Statute or the Company Organizational
Documents or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply, or (B) (x) except
as provided in _Section 3.23_, terminate (or permit the termination of),
waive or amend the Rights Agreement, (y) redeem any Rights under the Rights
Agreement or (C) take any action with respect to, or make any determination
under, the Rights Agreement that would interfere with Parent consummating the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case without the prior
written consent of Parent.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in  _Section 5.3(a)_
or _(b)_ , if at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company receives a _bona fide_
, unsolicited written Company Takeover Proposal from any person that did not
result from a breach of _Section 5.3_, and if the

 



41  Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
its independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such
Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead
to a Company Superior Proposal, then the Company and its Representatives may,
(i) furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information
(including non-public information) with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the person who has made such Company Takeover Proposal and its
Representatives; _provided_ , that the Company shall substantially
concurrently with the delivery to such person provide to Parent any non-
public information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is
provided or made available to such person or its Representatives unless such
non-public information has been previously provided to Parent and (ii) engage
in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the person
making such Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives regarding such
Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within
24 hours) notify Parent and Merger Sub in writing if the Company takes any of
the actions in clauses (i) and (ii) above.

(d) The Company shall promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after
receipt) notify Parent in writing in the event that the Company or any of its
Representatives receives a Company Takeover Proposal or any offer, proposal,
inquiry or request for information or discussions relating to the Company or
its Subsidiaries that would be reasonably likely to lead to or that
contemplates a Company Takeover Proposal, including the identity of the person
making the Company Takeover Proposal or offer, proposal, inquiry or request
and the material terms and conditions thereof (including an unredacted copy
of such Company Takeover Proposal, offer, proposal, inquiry or request or,
where such Company Takeover Proposal, offer, proposal, inquiry or request is
not in writing, a description of the material terms thereof). The Company
shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a current basis (but in no event
more often than once every 24 hours), as to the status of (including any
material developments, discussions or negotiations) such Company Takeover
Proposal, offer, proposal, inquiry or request (including by promptly (and in
no event later than 24 hours after receipt) providing to Parent copies of any
written correspondence, proposals, indications of interest, and/or
draft agreements relating to such Company Takeover Proposal, offer, proposal,
inquiry or request). The Company agrees that it and its Affiliates will not
enter into any agreement with any person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement which prohibits the Company from providing any information to
Parent in accordance with, or otherwise complying with, this _Section 5.3_.

(e) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.3(e)_, neither the
Company Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) change,
qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or authorize or resolve to or publicly
propose or announce its intention to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or
modify, in each case in any manner adverse to Parent, the Company
Recommendation, or (B) adopt, approve or recommend to stockholders of the
Company, or resolve to or publicly propose or announce its intention to
adopt, approve or recommend to stockholders of the Company, a Company Takeover
Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a "
_Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), or (ii) authorize, cause or
permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement (including an acquisition
agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement or other agreement),
commitment or agreement in principle with respect to, or that is intended or
would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal (other

 



42  than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with
_Section 5.3(c)_) (a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ ") or resolve,
publicly propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to the time the
Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, but not after, the Company Board of
Directors may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change of the type
described in clause (A) of such definition if and only if, both (1) such
action is taken solely in response to an Intervening Event (and not in
response to a Company Takeover Proposal) and (2) prior to taking such action,
the Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after
consultation with independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company
Board of Directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that prior to making such Company Adverse Recommendation Change,
(x) the Company has given Parent at least four Business Days prior written
notice of its intention to take such action, and specifying, in reasonable
detail, the reasons therefor, and (y) upon the end of such notice period, the
Company Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith any revisions
to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have
determined, after consultation with independent financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that the Company Board of Directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law continue to require a Company Adverse Recommendation Change of
the type described in clause (A) of such definition.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the time the Company Stockholder
Approval is obtained, but not after, if the Company Board of Directors has
determined in good faith, after consultation with independent financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that a  _bona fide_ , unsolicited,
written Company Takeover Proposal made after the date hereof that did not
result from a breach of this _Section 5.3_ constitutes a Company Superior
Proposal, the Company Board of Directors may, subject to compliance with this
_Section 5.3(f)_, cause the Company to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with _Section 7.1(h)_ in order to enter into a definitive agreement relating
to such Company Superior Proposal subject to paying the Company Termination
Fee which shall be paid prior to or concurrently with such termination in
accordance with _Section 7.3_; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to so
terminating this Agreement, (A) the Company has given Parent at least four
Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action,
including the material terms and conditions of, and the identity of the person
making, any such Company Superior Proposal and has contemporaneously provided
to Parent a copy of the Company Superior Proposal, an unredacted copy of any
proposed Company Acquisition Agreements and a copy of any financing
commitments relating thereto which are provided to the Company and which may
include customary redactions (or, in each case, if not provided in writing to
the Company, a written summary of the terms thereof), (B) if Parent wishes to
negotiate, the Company shall have afforded Parent and its Representatives the
opportunity to negotiate with the Company and its Representatives, during
such notice period to enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms of this
Agreement such that it would cause such Company Superior Proposal to no longer
constitute a Company Superior Proposal, (C) upon the end of such notice
period, the Company Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith any
revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and
shall have determined, after consultation with its independent financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that the Company Superior Proposal would
nevertheless continue to constitute a Company Superior Proposal if the
revisions proposed by Parent were to be given effect, and (D) in the event of
any change to any of the financial terms (including the form, amount and
timing of

 



43  payment of consideration) or any other material terms of such Company
Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent
an additional notice consistent with that described in clause (A) above of
this proviso and a new notice period under clause (A) of this proviso shall
commence ( _provided_ that the notice period thereunder shall only be two
Business Days) during which time the Company shall be required to comply with
the requirements of this _Section 5.3(f)_ anew with respect to such
additional notice, including clauses (A) through (D) above of this proviso;
and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company has complied in all material
respects with its obligations under this _Section 5.3_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary shall enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms.

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit the Company or
the Company Board of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to the
stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) from making any "stop, look
and listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act. Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_
shall be deemed to limit the proviso set forth in Section 5.8.

(h) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that its
Representatives are aware of the provisions of this _Section 5.3_. Any
violation of the restrictions contained in this _Section 5.3_ by any of the
Companys Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section
5.3_ by the Company.

Section 5.4 _Filings; Other Actions_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, and in any event within 25 Business Days after the date
hereof, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the preliminary Proxy
Statement. Parent shall cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the
Proxy Statement and furnish all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub
that is required in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement.
The Company will respond promptly to any comments from the SEC or the staff of
the SEC. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement,
will be made by the Company without Parents prior consent (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and without providing Parent
and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company, in connection with a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, may amend or supplement the Proxy Statement to
effect such change (it being understood that any such amendment or supplement
shall solely contain (i) such Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (ii) a
statement of the reasons of the Company Board of Directors for making such
Company Adverse Recommendation Change and (iii) such other information as the
Company believes is necessary to be included in such amendment or supplement
and, in such event, the right of consent set forth in this _Section 5.4(a)_
shall not apply). The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of
any comments (whether written or oral) from the SEC or the staff of the
SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall
supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and any of
its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on
the other hand, with

 



44  respect to the Proxy Statement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects
with the requirements of the Exchange Act. The Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement, at and from the date it is first
mailed to the stockholders of the Company until the Company Stockholders
Meeting, not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholders
Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) any information relating
to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors, is discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy
Statement would not include a misstatement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed by the Company with the SEC and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. The Company
will cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as
promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within five Business
Days) after the date of the resolution of any comments of the SEC or the staff
of the SEC with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement (such date, the "
_Clearance Date_ ").

 

(b) Subject to _Section 5.3(f)_ and _Section 5.4(c)_, the Company shall take
all action necessary in accordance with applicable Laws and the Company
Organizational Documents to set a record date for, duly give notice of,
convene and, not later than 30 Business Days following the Clearance Date,
hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval (the " _Company Stockholders  Meeting_"). Except as
expressly permitted by _Section 5.3_, the Company Board of Directors (or any
committee thereof) shall not make any Company Adverse Recommendation Change
and, unless the Company shall have made a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, shall include the
Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and shall solicit, and use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain, the Company Stockholder Approval at
the Company Stockholders Meeting (including by soliciting proxies in favor of
the adoption of the Merger and this Agreement and ensuring that all proxies so
solicited are solicited in compliance with all applicable Laws and the rules
of the New York Stock Exchange) and otherwise comply with all legal
requirements applicable to the Company Stockholders Meeting.

 

(c) The Company shall cooperate with and keep Parent informed on a current
basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following the
dissemination of the Proxy Statement to its stockholders. The Company may
adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting (i) to allow time for
the filing and dissemination of any supplemental or amended
disclosure document that the Company Board of Directors has determined in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) is required to
be filed and disseminated under applicable Laws, (ii) if as of the time which
the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in
the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting, (iii) if the
Company reasonably

 



45  determines in good faith that the Company Stockholder Approval is unlikely
to be obtained, or (iv) with the prior written consent of Parent; _provided_
that in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), each such adjournment or
postponement shall be for a period of no more than 10 Business Days from the
most recent scheduled meeting date and (x) without the consent of Parent (not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), no such adjournment or
postponement shall be to a date that is later than seven months from the date
of this Agreement but (y) in any event, no such adjournment or postponement
shall be to a date that is later than eight months from the date of this
Agreement. During any such period of adjournment or postponement, the Company
shall continue in all respects to comply with its obligations under _Section
5.3_ and this _Section 5.4_. Without the prior written consent of Parent
(not to be unreasonably withheld), the adoption of this Agreement shall be the
only matter (other than matters of procedure and matters required by
applicable Law to be voted on by the Companys stockholders in connection
with the adoption of this Agreement) that the Company shall propose to be
acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders
Meeting.

 

Section 5.5 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time and until the first anniversary of the
Effective Time (the " _Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall provide, or
shall cause the Surviving Company to provide, to employees of the Company or
its Subsidiaries who continue to be employed by Parent or the Surviving
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries following the Effective Time
(the " _Company Employees_ "), other than any Company Employees who are
covered by Collective Bargaining Agreements, with (i) an annual base salary or
wage rate and target incentive compensation opportunities (including
cash incentive compensation opportunities but excluding equity-based
incentive compensation opportunities) that, in each case, are no less than
those provided to each such Company Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (ii) employee benefits that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than the employee benefits provided to each such Company Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that with respect to
each Company Employee who is covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, comply with the terms
and conditions of the Collective Bargaining Agreements as in effect from time
to time; _provided_ , _further_ , that in respect of any Company Employee who
is based outside of the United States, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Company to take any other additional actions as required by
applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
during the Continuation Period, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide, each Company Employee with severance
payments and benefits that are no less favorable than the severance payments
or benefits that such Company Employee would have received under the Company
severance plan applicable to such Company Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time ( _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such Company Employee is
entitled to severance benefits under an individual severance, employment, or
similar agreement, the terms of such agreement and not this _Section 5.5(a)_
shall govern).

 

(b) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Company to, cause any employee benefit plans sponsored or maintained by
Parent or the Surviving Company or their Subsidiaries in which the Company
Employees are eligible to participate following the Closing Date
(collectively, the " _Post-Closing Plans_ ") 

 



46  to recognize the service of each Company Employee with the Company prior to
the Closing Date for purposes of eligibility, vesting and level of benefits
under such Post-Closing Plans;  _provided_ , that such recognition of service
shall not (i) apply for purposes of any Post-Closing Plan that is a defined
benefit retirement plan or any Post-Closing Plan that provides retiree welfare
benefits, (ii) operate to duplicate any benefits of a Company Employee with
respect to the same period of service or (iii) apply for purposes of any plan,
program or arrangement (x) under which similarly situated employees of Parent
and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service or (y) that is
grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or
participation. With respect to any Post-Closing Plan that provides medical,
dental or vision insurance benefits, for the plan year in which such Company
Employee is first eligible to participate, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to (A) cause any preexisting condition limitations or
eligibility waiting periods under such plan to be waived with respect to such
Company Employee to the extent such limitation would have been waived or
satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) credit each
Company Employee for any co-payments or deductibles incurred by such Company
Employee in the Post-Closing Plan year that includes the Closing Date (or, if
later, the year in which such Company Employee first participates in such
Post-Closing Plan) for purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-
of-pocket expense requirements under any such Post-Closing Plan, subject to
the applicable information being provided to Parent in a form that Parent
reasonably determines is administratively feasible to take into account under
its plans. Such credited expenses shall also count toward any annual or
lifetime limits, treatment or visit limits or similar limitations that apply
under the terms of the applicable plan.

 

(c) Unless the content of any such communication is consistent with
information contained in any previously issued press release,
public announcement or public filing or other communication previously made
in accordance with this _Section 5.5(c)_, the Company will provide Parent
with a copy of any written communications intended for broad-based and general
distribution to current or former employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that relate to Parent or this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and will provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on such communications prior to distribution; provided
that the foregoing shall not apply to any such communication that relates to
any Company Takeover Proposal.

 

(d) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" of the Company or
other event with similar import, within the meaning of the Company Benefit
Plans that contain such terms and are marked on the Company Disclosure
Schedule as containing such provisions, will occur upon the Effective Time.

 

(e) No later than 30 Business Days following the date of this Agreement, with
respect to any individual that the Company reasonably determines in good
faith to be a "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the
Code), the Company shall furnish to Parent a schedule that sets forth (i) the
Companys reasonable, good faith estimate of the amount that could be paid to
such disqualified individual as a result of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in combination with any other event),
(ii) the Companys good faith calculations of the "base amount" (as defined
in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) for each such disqualified individual and
(iii) underlying documentation on which such

 



47  calculations are based. The schedules and underlying documentation required
by this _Section 5.5(e)_ shall be updated and delivered to Parent not later
than 15 Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date.

(f) To the extent not made available as of the date hereof, no later than 30
Business Days following the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall
make available to Parent copies of each material non-U.S. Company Benefit
Plan, the most recent summary plan description, and the most recent actuarial
valuation report, in each case, to the extent applicable.

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee or other
service provider any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent,
the Surviving Company or any Affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or
restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Company or any of
their Affiliates, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or
terminate the services of any Company Employee at any time for any reason
whatsoever, with or without cause. In no event shall the terms of this
Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit
Plan or any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or
any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or
sponsored by Parent, Surviving Company, the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, Company and its
Subsidiaries) or Affiliates; or (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent, the
Surviving Company or any of their Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing
Date, Company and its Subsidiaries) or Affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any Company Benefit Plan or any other compensation or benefit or
employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in
this  _Section 5.5_ shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any
Company Employee or current or former service provider of the Company or its
Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

 

(h) Prior to and effective upon the Effective Time, the Company shall amend
the terms of the Airgas, Inc. Supplemental Severance Program Administrative
Procedure to provide for its administration, effective as of the Effective
Time, by a committee comprised of the chief executive officer of the Company,
or his successor, and up to two additional persons designated by Parent.

 

Section 5.6 _Regulatory Approvals; Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including _Section
5.6(d)_ and _Section 5.6(f)_), prior to the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all reasonable actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all
reasonable things necessary, proper or advisable under any applicable Laws to
consummate and make effective the Merger including (i) the preparation and
filing of all forms, registrations and notices required to be filed to
consummate the Merger, (ii) using reasonable best efforts to satisfy
the conditions to consummating the Merger, (iii) using reasonable best
efforts to obtain (and to cooperate with each other in obtaining) any consent,
authorization, expiration or termination of a waiting period, Permit, Order or
approval of, waiver or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity (which
actions shall include furnishing all information and documentary material
required under the HSR Act) required to be obtained or made by Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection

 



48  with the Merger or the taking of any action contemplated by this Agreement,
(iv) using reasonable best efforts to defend any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, brought by any Governmental
Entity challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger, (v) using
reasonable best efforts to obtain (and to cooperate with each other in
obtaining) any consent, approval of, waiver or any exemption by, or notice to
any non-governmental third party, in each case, to the extent necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate the Merger, and (vi) the execution and
delivery of any reasonable additional instruments necessary to consummate the
Merger and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

(b) Parent and the Company shall each keep the other apprised of the status
of matters relating to the completion of the Merger and work cooperatively in
connection with obtaining all required consents, authorizations, Orders or
approvals of, or any exemptions by, any Governmental Entity
undertaken pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 5.6_. In that regard,
prior to the Closing, each party shall promptly consult with the other parties
to this Agreement with respect to and provide any necessary information and
assistance as the other parties may reasonably request with respect to (and,
in the case of correspondence, provide the other parties (or their counsel)
copies of) all notices, submissions, or filings made by such party with any
Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by such party to, or
correspondence with, a Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement
and the Merger. Each party to this Agreement shall promptly inform the other
parties to this Agreement, and if in writing, furnish the other parties with
copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise the other parties
orally of) any communication from or to any Governmental Entity regarding the
Merger, and permit the other parties to review and discuss in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of the other parties in connection with, any
proposed communication with any such Governmental Entity. Without limiting the
foregoing or any of the other provisions of this _Section 5.6_, the
parties agree that, it is Parents sole right, in consultation with the
Company and subject to the other provisions of this _Section 5.6_, to devise
the strategy for filings, notifications, submissions and communications with
or to any antitrust regulatory authority. If any party to this Agreement or
any Representative of such parties receives a request for additional
information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect
to the Merger, then such party will use reasonable best efforts to make, or
cause to be made, promptly and after consultation with the other parties to
this Agreement, an appropriate response in substantial compliance with such
request. No party shall participate in any meeting or teleconference with any
Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the Merger unless it
consults with the other parties in advance and, to the extent not prohibited
by such Governmental Entity, gives the other parties the opportunity to
attend and participate thereat. Without limiting the foregoing obligations,
each party shall promptly furnish the other parties with copies of all
material correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda setting
forth the substance thereof) between it and any such Governmental Entity with
respect to this Agreement and the Merger, and furnish the other parties with
such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other parties may
reasonably request in connection with its preparation of necessary filings or
submissions of information to any such Governmental Entity; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other under this _Section 5.6(b)_ as "Antitrust Counsel Only
Material." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given
only to the outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such

 



49  outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless
express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials
(Parent or the Company, as the case may be) or its legal counsel.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 5.6_,
materials provided pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ may be redacted (i) to
remove references concerning the valuation of the Company and the Merger or
other similarly confidential information, (ii) as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements, and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable
privilege concerns.

 

(c) The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to file, as
promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than 10 Business Days
after the date of this Agreement, all notifications required under the HSR
Act. In the event that the parties receive a request for information or
documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act (a " _Second Request_ "), the
parties will use their respective reasonable best efforts to certify
compliance with such Second Request as promptly as practicable, and counsel
for both parties will closely cooperate during the entirety of any such Second
Request review process.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
Parent shall, in order to permit the satisfaction of  _Section 6.1(b)_ and
_Section 6.1(c)_ so as to permit the Closing to occur as promptly as
reasonably practicable and in any event before the End Date, (i) propose,
negotiate, commit to, effect and agree to, by consent decree, hold separate
order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license, holding separate, and
other disposition of and restriction on the businesses, assets, properties,
product lines, and equity interests of, or changes to the conduct of business
of, the Company, Parent and their Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries) and take such action or actions that would in
the aggregate have a similar effect, (ii) terminate or divest relationships,
ventures, contractual rights or obligations of the Company or Parent or their
respective Subsidiaries, and (iii) otherwise take or commit to take any action
that would limit Parents freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to
retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any businesses, assets, equity
interests, product lines or properties of Parent or the Company (including any
of their respective Subsidiaries) (such actions in clauses (i) through (iii),
" _Antitrust Actions_ "); _provided_ , that (A) any such Antitrust Actions
are conditioned upon and become effective only from and after the Effective
Time and (B) under no circumstances shall Parent, pursuant to its undertakings
relating to the satisfaction of _Section 6.1(b)_ and _Section 6.1(c)_, or
any other provision contained herein, be required to propose, negotiate,
commit to, effect and agree to Antitrust Actions relating to the businesses,
assets, properties, product lines, equity interests, relationships, ventures,
contractual rights, or obligations of Parent and its Subsidiaries (including,
prior to the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries, and following the
Closing, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries) that, directly or
indirectly, generated in the aggregate more than $500,000,000 in gross revenue
during the 12 calendar months ended December 31, 2014 (the " _Detriment Limit_
"). The parties agree that the calculation of revenue shall be measured by
reference to the revenue of Parent and its Subsidiaries for each such business
or asset of Parent and/or its Subsidiaries for which an Antitrust Action is
taken. If Parent elects to take an Antitrust Action with respect to a
business or asset of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, the calculation of
revenue for purposes of the Detriment Limit shall be the lower of the revenue
for such business or asset and revenue of any such overlapping business or
asset of Parent and/or its Subsidiaries. Without limiting the foregoing, in no
event will the Company (and the Company will not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to) propose, negotiate, effect or agree to any such actions
without the prior written consent of Parent.

 



50 (e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this  _Section 5.6_, if any administrative or judicial action
or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any antitrust Law, each of the
Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any
such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned
any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the Merger.

 

(f) The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to make an
appropriate notification under the DPA at such time as reasonably agreed by
the Company and Parent in order to permit the satisfaction of _Section
6.1(d)_ so as to permit the Closing to occur as promptly as reasonably
practicable and in any event before the End Date. Parent and the Company shall
use their respective reasonable best efforts to provide CFIUS with any
additional or supplemental information requested by CFIUS as promptly as
practicable, but in any event no later than as required under the DPA. Parent
and the Company, in cooperation with each other, shall take all steps
advisable, necessary, or desirable to obtain CFIUS Approval; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
in no event shall Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates
be obligated to consent to or take any action, and, without the prior written
consent of Parent, neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates shall
propose, negotiate, commit to, effect or agree to, including to
sell, license, divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any assets,
businesses, properties, product lines, equity interests, relationships,
ventures, contractual rights, obligations, or interest, or agree to conditions
relating to or changes in the conduct of its business, that would be, or
would reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material
and adverse to the Company and its Subsidiaries together with the U.S.
industrial bulk and industrial cylinder business of Parent, on a combined
basis, taken as a whole (any such measure, a " _CFIUS Burdensome Condition_
").

Section 5.7  _Takeover Statutes_. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall not
take any action that would cause the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Voting and Support Agreement to be subject to requirements
imposed by any takeover statute. If any "moratorium," "control share
acquisition," "fair price," "supermajority," "affiliate transactions" or
"business combination statute or regulation" or other similar state anti-
takeover Laws (including Section 203 of the DGCL) and regulations (each, a "
_Takeover Statute_ ") may become, or may purport to be, applicable to this
Agreement, the Voting and Support Agreement, the Merger or any
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting and Support
Agreement, each of the Company and Parent shall grant such approvals and take
such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated
hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of
such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



51 Section 5.8 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent agree that (a)
the initial press release to be issued with respect to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement shall be in a form agreed to by the parties and (b)
with respect to all other press releases and public announcements with respect
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, except as set
forth in _Section 5.5(c)_, the parties shall consult with each other before
issuing any such press release or making any such public announcement with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby unless the
content of such press release or public announcement shall be consistent with
the initial press release agreed to by the parties, in which case, each of the
parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to give the other party a copy
of any such press release or public announcement prior to the issuance
thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without the prior consent
of the other party (but after prior consultation, to the extent practicable
in the circumstances) issue such press release or make such public
announcement to the extent required by applicable Law or the applicable rules
of any stock exchange or by any regulatory authority; _provided_ ,  _further_
, that in the case of press releases or public announcements by the Company
with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal, (i) the Company shall not be
required to consult with Parent but shall give Parent a copy of any such
press release or public announcement prior to the issuance thereof, and (ii)
following any press release or public announcement by the Company with respect
to a Company Takeover Proposal, Parent shall not be required to consult with
the Company regarding any press releases or public announcements by Parent
with respect to such Company Takeover Proposal, as it may be amended or
modified from time to time, but it shall give the Company a copy of any such
press release or public announcement prior to the issuance thereof.

Section 5.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), now existing in favor of the
current or former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as
provided in the Company Organizational Documents and the certificate of
incorporation, bylaws, limited partnership agreement, limited liability
company agreement or comparable constituent or organizational documents for
each Subsidiary of the Company or in any agreement set forth on _Section
5.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule and a copy of which shall have
been made available to Parent (an " _Indemnity Agreement_ "), each as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period
of not less than six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance expenses
to the Indemnified Parties with respect to all acts or omissions by them in
their capacities as such at any time prior to the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent provided by: (i) the Company Organizational Documents or the
certificate of incorporation, bylaws, limited partnership agreement, limited
liability company agreement or comparable constituent or organizational
documents for each Subsidiary of the Company as in effect on the date of this
Agreement; (ii) any Indemnity Agreement between any such Indemnified Party on
the one hand and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on the other hand, as
in effect on the date of this Agreement; and (iii) applicable Law.

 



52 (b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 5.9(a)_, from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall and shall cause the Surviving Company to, in
each case, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law: (i) indemnify,
defend and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
each Indemnified Party from and against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
penalties, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement (including, in each
case, any interest or assessments thereon) in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to any action or
omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnified Partys capacity
as a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) pay the expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees) of any Indemnified Party incurred in connection with any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay such amount if
it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled
to be indemnified, in each case, to the extent that such persons are
indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of
this Agreement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the
Company Organizational Documents, the certificate of incorporation, bylaws,
limited partnership agreement, limited liability company agreement or
comparable constituent or organizational documents for each Subsidiary of the
Company, any Indemnity Agreement or applicable Law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law firm to
represent them (and local counsel in each necessary jurisdiction) with respect
to each such matter unless there is, under applicable standards of
professional conduct, a conflict on any significant issue between the
positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties.

 

(c) For a period of six years after the Closing and at all times subject to
applicable Law, Parent shall not (and shall not cause or permit the Surviving
Company or any its Subsidiaries or any of Parents other Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to) amend or modify in a manner that would adversely affect the
rights of the Indemnified Parties under the exculpation and
indemnification provisions set forth in the organizational documents of the
Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries to make them less favorable to the
Indemnified Parties than the provisions which are currently provided by the
Company and its Subsidiaries. In addition, Parent will provide, or cause the
Surviving Company to provide, for a period of not less than six years after
the Effective Time, the Indemnified Parties who are insured under the
Companys directors and officers insurance and indemnification policy with
an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is
no less favorable than the existing policy of the Company; _provided_ that
Parent and the Surviving Company shall not be required to pay an annual
premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the annual premium paid as
of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance;  _provided_ , _further_
, that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage at any time exceed
such amount, Parent or the Surviving Company shall obtain a policy which, in
its good faith determination, provides the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding such amount. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the Company may and at Parents request shall purchase a "tail"
directors and officers insurance and indemnification policy; _provided_
that payment for insurance coverage provided by such "tail" directors and
officers insurance policy shall not exceed 300% of the annual premium paid as
of the date hereof by the Company. Any such "tail" directors and officers
insurance policy will satisfy Parents obligations under this _Section
5.9(c)_ to provide DandO Insurance.

 



53 (d) The Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 5.9_ applies shall be
third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.9_. The provisions of this
_Section 5.9_ are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnified Party
and his or her successors, heirs and representatives.

 

(e) This _Section 5.9_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall
be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent,
the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by the
Indemnified Parties and their successors, heirs or representatives. In the
event that Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other
person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that such other person or the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall succeed
to its obligations set forth in this  _Section 5.9_.

Section 5.10 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of
Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company
Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 5.11 _Financing and Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, advisable
or proper to obtain the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter on or
prior to the Closing Date on the terms and conditions described in the
Commitment Letter, including using reasonable best efforts to: (i) maintain in
effect and enforce the Commitment Letter and comply with its obligations
thereunder ( _provided_ , that the Commitment Letter may be amended,
supplemented, modified and replaced as permitted by clauses (b) and (c) of
this  _Section 5.11_); (ii) satisfy on a timely basis and in a manner that
will not impede the ability of the parties to consummate the Merger in advance
of the End Date all conditions applicable to Parent and Finance Sub to the
funding of the Financing (including the Financing Conditions) set forth in
the Commitment Letter and any definitive agreements executed in connection
therewith within Parents control (other than any condition where the failure
to be so satisfied is a direct result of the Companys failure to furnish
information to Parent or otherwise to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement) and (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with
respect thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Commitment
Letter (including, if necessary, any "flex" provisions). Parent shall keep the
Company informed on a regular basis and in reasonable detail of the status of
its efforts to arrange the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter
and any other Financing and shall give the Company prompt notice of any fact,
change, event or circumstance that is reasonably likely to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a material adverse impact with respect to the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter.

 



54 (b) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall not, and shall not permit Finance Sub
to, agree to or permit any termination, amendment, replacement, supplement or
other modification of, or waive any of its material rights under, the
Commitment Letter without the Companys prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ ,
that Parent and Finance Sub may, without the Companys prior written consent,
(x) enter into any amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification to
or waiver of any provision of the Commitment Letter that would not (i) reduce
the aggregate amount of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter,
(ii) adversely alter or expand the Financing Conditions contemplated by the
Commitment Letter, (iii) impair the ability of Parent or Finance Sub to
enforce their rights under the Commitment Letter, or (iv) otherwise reasonably
be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation
of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter or the Merger; (y)
amend, replace, supplement or otherwise modify the Commitment Letter to add
lenders, lead arrangers, book runners, syndication agents or similar entities
who had not executed the Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement
so long as any such addition would not reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter or the Merger and (z) implement or
exercise the "flex" provisions contained in one or more fee letters related
to the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter. Upon any such
amendment, replacement, supplement or modification, the term "Commitment
Letter" shall mean the Commitment Letter as so amended, replaced,
supplemented or modified. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies
of any such amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification or waiver
of the Commitment Letter.

 

(c) Parent shall have the right to substitute the proceeds of consummated
equity offerings or debt offerings or other incurrences of debt (including
unsecured notes) for all or any portion of the Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letter by reducing commitments under the Commitment Letter;
_provided_ , that to the extent any such debt has a scheduled special or
mandatory redemption right, such right is not exercisable prior to the
earlier of the consummation of the Merger on the Closing Date, the termination
of this Agreement or the End Date (for the avoidance of doubt as it may be
extended pursuant to the terms of this Agreement as in effect on the date
hereof). Further, Parent shall have the right to substitute commitments in
respect of other financing for all or any portion of the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter from the same and/or alternative bona
fide, financially capable third-party financing sources so long as (i) all
conditions precedent to effectiveness of definitive documentation for such
financing have been satisfied, (ii) the conditions precedent to funding of
such financing are in all respects (other than related to customary
documentation and ministerial matters) no less favorable to Parent than the
Financing Conditions and (iii) such substitution could not otherwise
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the
consummation of the Merger. For the purposes of this Agreement, the terms
"Commitment Letter" and "Financing" shall be deemed to include any commitment
letter (or similar agreement) or commitment with respect to any such
replacement financing or such consummated replacement financing, as
applicable, arranged in compliance with this _Section 5.11(c)_ (and any
Commitment Letter and Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter

advise the other party of (i) any written notice or other written
communication from any person alleging that the consent of such person is or
may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to the extent that the party receiving such notice or communication
believes there is a reasonable likelihood that the failure to obtain such
consent would have a material impact on the timing of the consummation of the
Merger or on the Company, the Surviving Company or Parent or (ii) upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity or third party whose
consent or approval is required for the satisfaction of one of the conditions
to Closing set forth in _Article VI_ that causes such party to believe that
there is a reasonable likelihood that any such consent or approval will not be
obtained or that the receipt of any such consent or approval will be
materially delayed. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any notice or
other communication received to the knowledge of the Company from any party

the Company shall, prior to the expiration of such Listed Supply Agreement,
enter into a supply agreement substantially in the form set forth in _Exhibit

accordance with _Article VII_ , the Company shall negotiate in good faith with
the applicable counterparties to renew or extend the term of each Listed
Supply Agreement prior to the applicable expiration date thereof; _provided_
, _however_ , that the failure to agree to any such renewal or extension shall
not relieve Parent of its obligation as set forth in the preceding sentence.

right to terminate relates to an order or injunction arising under Antitrust
Laws and such order or injunction did not result from a material breach by the
Company of its obligations pursuant to Section 5.6 of this Agreement), then
Parent shall pay the Company the Parent Termination Fee in immediately
available funds within two Business Days of such termination. Solely with
respect to clause (i)(x) of this _Section 7.3(d)_, the term "End Date" shall
mean the later of (1) five Business Days prior to the End Date, as defined in
_Section 7.1(b)_ and (2), if Parent has waived completely or agreed to reduce
the 5 Business Day period referred to in Section 1.2, the End Date as defined
in _Section 7.1(b)_ or the date corresponding to such reduced period of time
prior to the End Date as defined in _Section 7.1(b)_.

(e) " _Parent Termination Fee_ " shall mean a cash amount equal to
$400,000,000.00.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the full
Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee (as applicable) shall become
due and payable in accordance with this _Section 7.3_, from and after such
termination and payment of the Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination
Fee (as applicable) in full pursuant to and in accordance with this _Section
7.3_, the Company, in the case of the Company Termination Fee, or

 



65  Parent, in the case of the Parent Termination Fee, shall have no further
Liability of any kind for any reason in connection with this Agreement or the
termination contemplated hereby other than as set forth in _Section 7.2_ and
this _Section 7.3_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that each of the
Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee is not intended to be a
penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate Parent in the circumstances in which such Company Termination Fee
is due and payable or the Company in the circumstances in which such Parent
Termination Fee is due and payable, for the efforts and resources expended
and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision. In no event shall Parent be entitled to payment of the
Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion, and in no event shall the
Company be entitled to payment of the Parent Termination Fee on more than one
occasion.

 

(g) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails to pay in a timely manner any
amount due pursuant to _Section 7.3_, then (i) the party failing to pay
shall reimburse the party that is owed for all costs and expenses (including
disbursements and reasonable fees of counsel) incurred in the collection of
such overdue amount, including in connection with any related claims, actions
or proceedings commenced and (ii) the party failing to pay shall pay to the
party that is owed interest on such amount from and including the date payment
of such amount was due to but excluding the date of actual payment at the
prime rate set forth in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made plus 2% per annum.

action (whether at Law, in contract or in tort or otherwise) that may be
based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation,
execution or performance hereof, shall be governed by and construed in

Section 8.5 _Jurisdiction; Specific Enforcement_.

 

(a) The parties rights in this _Section 8.5_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party hereby waives any
objections to any remedy referred to in this _Section 8.5_. The parties agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed, or were threatened to be not performed, in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that
money damages would not be an adequate remedy, even if available. It is
accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other remedy that may be available
to it, including monetary damages, each of the parties shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware
Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) (in addition to any
and all other rights and remedies at law or in equity, and all such rights and
remedies shall be cumulative, except, in each case, as may be limited by
_Section 7.3_). In the event any party seeks any remedy referred to in this
_Section 8.5_, such party shall not be required to prove damages or obtain,
furnish, provide or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or
as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this  _Section 8.5_
and each party waives any objection to the imposition of such relief or any
right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing, providing or posting
of any such bond or similar instrument. In addition, each of the
parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with
respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or
for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement
and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by the other party
hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined
exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court
therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal
court within the State of Delaware). Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or 

 



67  proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and
agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim
or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a)
any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above
named courts, (b) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune
from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in
such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
claim that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, each of the parties hereto hereby consents to the service of process in
accordance with _Section 8.7_; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing herein
shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by Law.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company agrees that (i) in no event shall the Financing Sources have any
liability or obligation to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its
Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Financing, any
commitment letters or engagement letters relating thereto or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby and (ii) in no event shall the Company or any
of its Affiliates or stockholders seek or obtain any other damages of any
kind against any Financing Source (including consequential, special, indirect
or punitive damages), in each case, relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Financing, any commitment letters or engagement letters
relating thereto or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. For
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 8.5(b)_ shall modify or alter
the rights of Parent or Finance Sub under the Commitment Letter and
any provision of any definitive loan documentation between or among Parent,
Finance Sub, any of their Subsidiaries and any Financing Source entered into
in connection with or as contemplated by this Agreement, and in the event of a
conflict between the foregoing and any provision in the Commitment Letter or
any such definitive loan documentation, as applicable, the provisions of the
Commitment Letter or any such definitive loan documentation, as applicable,
shall govern and control.

 

(c) NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO AGREES THAT (I)
ANY ACTION, CLAIM, SUIT, OR PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND OR DESCRIPTION, WHETHER IN
LAW OR IN EQUITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT OR OTHERWISE, AGAINST THE
FINANCING SOURCES OR ANY AFFILIATE THEREOF (IN THEIR CAPACITIES AS SUCH)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY
THIS AGREEMENT, THE FINANCING OR THE COMMITMENT LETTER OR THE PERFORMANCE OF
SERVICES THEREUNDER OR RELATED THERETO SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE EXCLUSIVE
JURISDICTION OF _TRIBUNAL DE COMMERCE DE PARIS_ AND (II) IT WILL NOT BRING OR
SUPPORT OR PERMIT ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES TO BRING OR SUPPORT ANY ACTION,
CLAIM, SUIT OR PROCEEDING IN ANY OTHER COURT.

 



68 Section 8.6 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY
(INCLUDING ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE FINANCING OR THE
COMMITMENT LETTER OR THE PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES THEREUNDER OR RELATED
THERETO).

Section 8.7 _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall
be in writing and shall be deemed given (a) upon personal delivery to the

the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned or delegated
by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other
parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that each of Merger Sub and Parent may

Section 8.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which
is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining
terms and provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any

shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 

Section 8.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement together with the exhibits
hereto, schedules hereto, the Voting and Support Agreement, the Rights
Agreement Amendment, the Confidentiality Agreement and the Clean Team

other than the parties hereto.

 

Section 8.11 _Amendments; Waivers_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if,
such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an
amendment, by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that after receipt of Company Stockholder Approval, if any such amendment or
waiver shall by applicable Law or in accordance with the rules and regulations
of the New York Stock Exchange require further approval of the stockholders of
the Company, the effectiveness of such amendment or waiver shall be subject to
the approval of the stockholders of the Company; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that _Sections 8.5(b)_ , _8.5(c)_ and _8.6_ , clause (ii) of Section _8.13_
and this proviso of _Section 8.11_ may not be amended, supplemented, waived
or otherwise modified in any manner that is materially adverse in any respect
to the Financing Sources in their capacities as such without the prior written
consent of the adversely affected Financing Sources. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no failure or delay by any party hereto in exercising any right
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right
hereunder.

Agreement are for convenience of the parties only and shall be given no
substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever. The table of contents to this

which it is entitled under the provisions of _Article II_.

be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein"

intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is
drafted by all the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
