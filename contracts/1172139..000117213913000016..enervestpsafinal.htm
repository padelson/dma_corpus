 PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT

This Purchase and Sale Agreement (this "Agreement") is made and entered into
this 22nd day of October, 2013, by and between BILL BARRETT CORPORATION, a
Delaware corporation ("Seller"), on the one hand, and ENERVEST ENERGY
INSTITUTIONAL FUND XIII-A, L.P., ENERVEST ENERGY INSTITUTIONAL FUND XIII-WIB,
L.P., and ENERVEST ENERGY INSTITUTIONAL FUND XIII-WIC, L.P., each a Delaware
limited partnership, (collectively, "Buyer"), on the other hand. Seller and
Buyer are collectively referred to herein as the "Parties," and are sometimes
referred to individually as a "Party."

R E C I T A L S:

WHEREAS, Seller owns certain oil and gas leases located in the West Tavaputs
area of Utah and certain associated assets as defined and more fully described
below in Section 1.02 (collectively, the "Assets"); and

WHEREAS, Seller desires to sell to Buyer, and Buyer desires to purchase from
Seller, in their respective undivided proportionate interests set forth
opposite each Buyer's name in Exhibit H hereto (each Buyer's "Proportionate
Share") the Assets, upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of Ten Dollars ($10.00) cash in hand paid and
of the mutual benefits derived and to be derived from this Agreement by each
Party, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Seller and Buyer hereby agree as
follows:

ARTICLE 1

ASSETS



Section 1.01 Agreement to Sell and Purchase. Subject to and in accordance with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer agrees to purchase the
Assets from Seller, and Seller agrees to sell the Assets to Buyer. In
addition, Buyer agrees to purchase from Seller and Seller agrees to sell to
Buyer an undivided and unrestricted ownership interest in and to all seismic
data, records and information related to, associated with or that is a part of
the seismic data set described on Exhibit G (the "Seismic"), it being the
intent that such interest shall carry all of the rights and benefits of
ownership currently held by Seller and that such interest shall not be
restricted in any way, including without limitation, by way of use,
disclosure, or ability to license or otherwise transfer. Seller represents and
warrants to Buyer that it has (and Buyer will have) good and marketable title
to the Seismic, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, and that the
transfer of the Seismic to Buyer and Buyer's undivided and unrestricted
ownership of the Seismic (including







without limitation, use, disclosure and ability to license or otherwise
transfer) will not infringe upon the rights of any other party.

Section 1.02 Assets. Subject to Section 1.03, the term "Assets" shall mean all
of Seller's right, title and interest in and to:

(a) the oil, gas and other mineral leases described on Exhibit A-1
(collectively referred to as the "Leases" or, singularly, as a "Lease") and

ARTICLE 2

PURCHASE PRICE

Section 2.01 Purchase Price. The total consideration for the purchase, sale,
and conveyance of the Assets and the Seismic to Buyer and Buyer's assumption
of the Assumed





Obligations and all other liabilities provided for in this Agreement, is
Buyer's payment to Seller of the sum of Three Hundred Twenty-Five Million Four
Hundred Sixty-six Thousand Fifty Dollars ($325,466,050.00) (the "Purchase
Price"), as adjusted in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

Section 2.02 Deposit.

(o) No later than five (5) business days after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, Purchaser will deliver or cause to be delivered to an account
(the "Escrow Account") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the "Escrow Agent"), a
wire transfer in the amount equal to Sixteen Million Two Hundred Fifty-Five
Thousand Dollars ($16,255,000.00) (the "Deposit") to be held, invested, and
disbursed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and an escrow
agreement of even date herewith among Seller, Buyer, and Escrow Agent (the
"Escrow Agreement"). The balance in the Escrow Account shall be distributed to
Seller in accordance with Section 10.07(o) and Section 10.08(j) if the Closing
occurs or shall be otherwise distributed in accordance with the terms of this
Section 2.02.

(p) Subject to the proviso set forth in Section 11.01, if this Agreement is
terminated by Seller pursuant to Section 11.01(b), but only as to a condition
to Closing described in Section 8.01, Section 8.02, Section 8.03 or Section
8.04, and Seller does not waive the non-satisfaction of that particular
condition to Closing, Seller and Buyer shall promptly instruct the Escrow
Agent to distribute the Deposit to Seller as liquidated damages, which remedy
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to Seller for Buyer's failure
to perform its obligations under this Agreement, and Seller expressly waives
any and all other remedies, legal or equitable, that it otherwise may have for
Buyer's breach of this Agreement or failure or refusal to close. Buyer and
Seller acknowledge and agree that (i) Seller's actual damages upon the event
of such a termination are difficult to ascertain with any certainty, (ii) the
Deposit is a reasonable estimate of such actual damages, and (iii) such
liquidated damages do not constitute a penalty.

(q) Subject to the proviso set forth in Section 11.01, if this Agreement is
terminated (i) by Buyer pursuant to Section 11.01(c) and Buyer does not waive
the non‑satisfaction of any conditions to Closing set forth in ARTICLE 9 or
(ii) by Buyer or Seller pursuant to Section 11.01(a), Section 11.01(d),
Section 11.01(e), Section 11.01(f) or Section 11.01(g), then Seller and Buyer
shall promptly instruct the Escrow Agent to distribute the balance in the
Escrow Account to Buyer. Buyer and Seller shall thereupon have the rights and
obligations set forth elsewhere herein.

(r) If all conditions precedent to the obligations of Seller set forth in
ARTICLE 8 have been met, then notwithstanding any provision in this Section
2.02 to the contrary, if Closing does not occur because Seller wrongfully
fails to tender performance at Closing or otherwise Breaches this Agreement in
any respect prior to Closing, and Buyer is ready and otherwise able to close,
at





Buyer's sole election, either (i) Seller and Buyer shall promptly instruct the
Escrow Agent to distribute the balance in the Escrow Account to Buyer, or (ii)
Buyer shall have the right to pursue specific performance of this Agreement,
provided that Buyer must give Seller written notice within thirty (30)
business days after the date set for Closing in Section 10.01 of Buyer's
election to pursue specific performance. If Buyer elects to pursue specific
performance, Buyer must pursue specific performance as its sole and exclusive
remedy in lieu of all other legal and equitable remedies. If Buyer fails to
timely notify Seller of Buyer's election to pursue specific performance or if
Buyer is unsuccessful for any reason, then Seller and Buyer shall promptly
instruct the Escrow Agent to distribute the balance in the Escrow Account to
Buyer. Buyer and Seller shall thereupon have the rights and obligations set
forth elsewhere herein.

Section 2.03 Allocated Values. The Purchase Price is allocated to the Wells
and undeveloped locations on a well-by-well or location-by-location basis, as
set forth on Exhibit C (the "Allocated Values"). In no event shall the
aggregate of the Allocated Values exceed the unadjusted Purchase Price. Seller
and Buyer agree that the Allocated Values shall be used to compute any
adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to the provisions of ARTICLE 4. Any
adjustment to the Purchase Price hereunder shall be reflected in the
allocation set forth in Exhibit C consistent with Treasury Regulation Section
1.1060-IT(f). For tax purposes, the Parties agree to report the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent with the terms of this
Agreement, including the allocations set forth above as of the Closing Date,
and that neither Party will take any position inconsistent therewith,
including in any tax return, refund claim, litigation, arbitration, or
otherwise.

Section 2.04 Section 1031 Like-Kind Exchange. Seller and Buyer hereby agree
that Seller shall have the right at any time prior to completion of all the
transactions that are to occur at Closing to assign all or a portion of its
rights under this Agreement to a Qualified Intermediary (as that term is
defined in Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(iii) of the Treasury Regulations) in
order to accomplish the transaction in a manner that will comply, either in
whole or in part, with the requirements of a like-kind exchange pursuant to
Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Likewise, Buyer shall have
the right at any time prior to completion of all the transactions that are to
occur at Closing to assign all or a portion of its rights under this Agreement
to a Qualified Intermediary for the same purpose. If Seller assigns all or any
of its rights under this Agreement for this purpose, Buyer agrees to (a)
consent to Seller's assignment of its rights in this Agreement, which
assignment shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer, and (b) pay the
Purchase Price (or a designated portion thereof as specified by Seller) into a
qualified escrow or qualified trust account at Closing as directed in writing.
If Buyer assigns all or any of its rights under this Agreement for this
purpose, Seller agrees to (i) consent to Buyer's assignment of its rights in
this Agreement, which assignment shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to
Seller, (ii) accept the Purchase Price from the qualified escrow or qualified
trust account at Closing, and (iii) at Closing, convey and assign directly to
Buyer the Assets (or any portion thereof) as directed by Buyer. Seller and
Buyer acknowledge and agree that





any assignment of this Agreement (or any rights hereunder) to a Qualified
Intermediary shall not release any Party from any of its respective
liabilities and obligations hereunder, and that neither Party represents to
the other Party that any particular tax treatment will be given to any Party
as a result thereof. The Party electing to assign all or any of its rights
under this Agreement pursuant to this Section 2.04 shall defend, indemnify,
and hold harmless the other Party and its Affiliates from all Claims relating
to such election.

ARTICLE 3

EFFECTIVE TIME

Section 3.01 Ownership of Assets. If the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof, the ownership
of the Assets shall be transferred from Seller to Buyer on the Closing Date,
but effective for all purposes as of 7:00 a.m. Mountain Time on August 1, 2013
(the "Effective Time").

Section 3.02 Production Imbalances. Upon Closing, subject to the adjustments
described in Section 10.02(b)(vii), Buyer shall assume the positions of Seller
with respect to all gas imbalances and make-up obligations related to the
Assets regardless of whether such imbalances or make-up obligations arise
before or after the Effective Time, at the wellhead, pipeline, gathering
system, or other location, and regardless of whether the same arise under
contract or otherwise ("Production Imbalances"). Seller's Production Imbalance
position as of the Effective Time is set forth on Schedule 1.02(i). As a
result of such assumption, Buyer shall (a) be entitled to receive any and all
benefits that Seller would have been entitled to receive by virtue of its
position, including rights to produce and receive volumes of production in
excess of volumes that it would otherwise have been entitled to produce and to
receive cash gas balancing by virtue of ownership of the Assets, (b) be
obligated to suffer any detriments or losses that Seller would have been
obligated to suffer by virtue of such position, including the obligation to
deliver to others production volumes that would have otherwise been
attributable to its ownership of the Assets, to deliver production to
purchasers thereof without Buyer receiving full payment therefor, or to make
cash balancing payments or to repay any take or pay payments, and (c) be
responsible for any and all royalty obligations and other burdens with respect
to such Production Imbalances; provided however, nothing in this Section 3.02
shall relieve Seller from any royalty obligation affecting payment Seller has
actually received for production occurring prior to the Effective Time.

ARTICLE 4

TITLE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Section 4.01 Examination Period. From the date of this Agreement through 5:00
p.m. Mountain Time on December 3, 2013 (the "Notification Date"), Seller shall
permit Buyer and/or its Representatives to examine during normal business days
and hours at a location designated by





Seller, all abstracts of title, title opinions, title files, ownership maps,
lease, Well, and division order files, assignments, operating, and accounting
records and all Leases, Surface Agreements, Permits, Contracts, and other
agreements, data, analyses, and information pertaining to the Assets insofar
as the same may now be in existence and in the possession of Seller (or
Representatives of Seller), subject to such restrictions upon disclosure as
may exist under confidentiality or other agreements binding upon Seller and
relating to the data. If there are any documents that Seller cannot provide
Buyer due to a confidentiality requirement, Seller shall describe to Buyer the
withheld documents and cooperate with Buyer to obtain access thereto from the
third party if Buyer so requests.

Section 4.02 Title Defects. The term "Title Defect" means any encumbrance on,
encroachment on, irregularity in, defect in, or objection to Seller's
ownership of the Assets (excluding Permitted Encumbrances) that causes Seller
not to have Marketable Title to a particular Well or undeveloped location, all
as described on Exhibit C. The term "Marketable Title" means such ownership by
Seller in the Assets (except as to the Fee Surface Interests and the Water
Rights) that, subject to and except for the Permitted Encumbrances, is free of
restrictions that would prevent the development of Hydrocarbons from the
Assets consistent with current practices and:

(a) entitles Seller to receive not less than the percentage set forth on
Exhibit C as Seller's Net Revenue Interest of all Hydrocarbons produced,
saved, and marketed from any Well or undeveloped location, all without
reduction, suspension, or termination of such interest throughout the
productive life of such Asset, except as specifically set forth on Exhibit C;

(b) obligates Seller to bear not greater than the percentage set forth on
Exhibit C as Seller's Working Interest of the costs and expenses relating to
the exploration, maintenance, development, and operation of any Well or
undeveloped location, all without increase throughout the productive life of
such Asset, except as specifically set forth on Exhibit C;

(c) is free and clear of all liens and encumbrances;

(d) entitles Buyer to use, without subjecting Buyer to a valid Claim of
trespass, all roads, power lines, pits, reservoirs, and pipelines (water and
Hydrocarbon) necessary for the operation of the Assets as they are currently
being used by Seller;

(e) as to the Fee Surface Interests, "Marketable Title" means good and
marketable title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, but subject to
the Permitted Encumbrances; and

(f) the Water Rights will be conveyed by either a quitclaim deed or transfer
on a Governmental Authority form without any warranty of title, other than
that in Section 5.29.

"Net Revenue Interest" means with respect to any Asset as of the Effective
Time, the interest in and to all Hydrocarbons produced, saved, and sold from
or allocated to such Asset, after giving effect





to all royalties, overriding royalties, production payments, carried
interests, net profits interests, reversionary interests, and other burdens
upon, measured by, or payable out of, production therefrom. "Working Interest"
means with respect to any Asset as of the Effective Time the interest in and
to such Asset that is burdened with the obligation to bear and pay costs and
expenses of maintenance, development, or operations on or in connection with
such Asset.

Section 4.03 Notice of Title Defects. Buyer shall provide Seller notice of all
purported Title Defects no later than 5:00 p.m. Mountain Time on the
Notification Date; provided, however, that (1) Buyer agrees that it will use
reasonable efforts to furnish Seller, as soon as practicable until the
Notification Date, written notice of any Title Defect that Buyer discovers or
learns about during that week, which notice may be preliminary in nature and
supplemented prior to the Notification Date, and (2) the failure of Buyer to
give Seller such preliminary notice will not waive any Title Defects. To be
effective, such notice must (a) be in writing, (b) be received by Seller on or
prior to the Notification Date, (c) describe the Title Defect in reasonable
detail (including any alleged variance in the Net Revenue Interest or Working
Interest), (d) identify the specific Asset or Assets affected by such Title
Defect, (e) include the Title Defect Value and supporting calculations
prepared by Buyer in good faith, (f) provide Buyer's suggested means to
address the Title Defect, including any suggested curative work, and (g)
comply with the limitations and Title Defect Value qualifications set forth in
Section 4.13. ANY MATTERS THAT MAY CONSTITUTE TITLE DEFECTS (EXCEPT THOSE
COVERED BY THE SPECIAL WARRANTY OF TITLE SET FORTH IN THE ASSIGNMENT, BY THE
WARRANTY IN THE WARRANTY DEEDS TRANSFERRING THE FEE SURFACE INTERESTS OR BY
THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5.29), BUT OF WHICH SELLER HAS
NOT BEEN SPECIFICALLY NOTIFIED BY BUYER IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FOREGOING,
SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN WAIVED BY BUYER FOR ALL PURPOSES AND SHALL
CONSTITUTE PERMITTED ENCUMBRANCES AND ASSUMED OBLIGATIONS. Upon the receipt of
such notice from Buyer, the Parties shall meet and determine upon which of the
Title Defects, Title Defect Values, and methods of cure the Parties have
reached agreement. Upon the receipt of such notice from Buyer, Seller shall
have the option, but not the obligation, for a period ending thirty (30) days
after the Closing to cure such Title Defect. If Seller should not elect to
cure a Title Defect, and no aspect of such Title Defect is reasonably in
dispute, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted for such Title Defect by the
amount of the Title Defect Value.

(a) The value attributable to each Title Defect (the "Title Defect Value")
that is asserted by Buyer in the Title Defect notices shall be determined
based upon the criteria set forth below:

(i) If the Title Defect is a lien upon any Asset, the Title Defect Value is
the amount necessary to be paid to remove the lien from the affected Asset;





(ii) If the Title Defect asserted is that the Net Revenue Interest
attributable to any Well or undeveloped location is less than that stated in
Exhibit C, then the Title Defect Value shall be the absolute value of the
number determined by the following formula:

Title Defect Value = A x (1 - [B/C])

| 
---|--- 

A

|

= Allocated Value for the affected Asset 

| 
---|--- 

B

|

= Correct Net Revenue Interest for the affected Asset 

| 
---|--- 

C

|

= Net Revenue Interest for the affected Asset as set forth on Exhibit C. 

(iii) If the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden, or
charge upon the affected Asset (including any increase in Working Interest for
which there is not a proportionate increase in Net Revenue Interest) for which
the economic detriment to Buyer is unliquidated, the amount of the Title
Defect Value shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of
the affected Asset, the portion of the Asset affected by the Title Defect, the
legal effect of the Title Defect, the potential discounted economic effect of
the Title Defect over the life of the affected Asset, and the Title Defect
Values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller;

(iv) If a Title Defect is not in effect or does not adversely affect an Asset
throughout the entire post-Effective Time productive life of such Asset, such
fact shall be taken into account in determining the Title Defect Value;

(v) The Title Defect Value of a Title Defect shall be determined without
duplication of any costs or losses included in another Title Defect Value
hereunder;

(vi) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall a
Title Defect Value exceed the Allocated Value of the Asset affected thereby;

(vii) If the Title Defect Value of an Asset is equal to the Allocated Value of
such Asset, the affected Asset shall remain in the purchase and sale
contemplated by this Agreement, but the Purchase Price shall be adjusted
accordingly; and

(viii) Such other factors as are reasonably necessary to make a proper
evaluation.

(b) The term Title Defect shall not include those matters deemed not to impair
marketability in accordance with the applicable title standards for the State
of Utah.

Section 4.04 Remedies for Title Defects.





(a) For any Title Defect noticed pursuant to Section 4.03 that has not been
cured at or prior to Closing, the Purchase Price shall, subject to the
provisions of Section 4.13, be decreased at Closing by either (i) the amount
the Parties acting reasonably and in good faith agree in lieu of a cure of the
asserted Title Defect, or (ii) with respect to any Title Defect for which the
Parties have not yet agreed as to the validity of the Title Defect, the Title
Defect Value, or the manner of cure, then by the amount of the Title Defect
Value asserted by Buyer for such uncured or unadjusted Title Defect.

(b) If, at the expiration of thirty (30) days after Closing, the Parties have
not agreed upon the validity of any asserted Title Defect, the appropriate
cure of the same, or the Title Defect Value attributable thereto, either Party
shall have the right to elect to have any such dispute determined by an
Independent Expert pursuant to Section 4.12.

(c) Once a Title Defect is cured within the time specified in Section 4.03, by
Seller at its sole cost and expense to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction, or the
existence or value of the Title Defect is determined with finality either by
agreement between Buyer and Seller or in accordance with Section 4.12, Buyer
shall promptly pay to Seller (i) in the case of a Title Defect that is cured,
the amount the Purchase Price was decreased at Closing as a result of this
previously uncured Title Defect or (ii) in the case of an Asset affected by an
unresolved Title Defect and for which the validity of the Title Defect or the
Title Defect Value is determined with finality whether by agreement or in
accordance with Section 4.12, the difference, if any, between the amount the
Purchase Price was decreased at Closing as a consequence of such asserted and
unresolved Title Defect and the amount determined with finality.

Section 4.05 Conveyances and Title.

(a) Except for the Fee Surface Interests (which are subject to Section
4.05(b)) and the Water Rights (which are subject to Section 4.05(c)), the
transfer of the Assets by Seller to Buyer shall be accomplished with an
Assignment and Bill of Sale (the "Assignment") in the form of Exhibit D. The
Assignment shall provide for a special warranty of title by, through, and
under Seller, but not otherwise, subject to the Permitted Encumbrances. The
term "Permitted Encumbrances" shall mean any of the following matters to the
extent the same are valid and subsisting and affect the Assets as of the
Effective Time:

(i) the terms, conditions, restrictions, exceptions, reservations,
limitations, and other matters contained in (including any liens or security
interests created by law or reserved in oil and gas leases for royalty, bonus,
or rental, or created to secure compliance with the terms of) the Contracts,
Surface Agreements, Leases, and any other agreements, instruments, documents,
and other matters described or referred to in any Exhibit or Schedule hereto;
provided, that, such matters do not operate to (A) reduce the Net Revenue
Interest of Seller





in any Well or undeveloped location as reflected on Exhibit C, or (B) increase
the Working Interest of Seller with respect to any Well or undeveloped
location as reflected on Exhibit C, unless there is a proportionate increase
in Seller's applicable Net Revenue Interest;

(ii) any obligations or duties affecting the Assets to any Governmental
Authority with respect to any franchise, grant, license, or permit, and all
applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules, regulations, guidance,
ordinances, decrees, and orders of any Governmental Authority ("Laws");

(iii) all royalties, overriding royalties, net profits interests, carried
interests, production payments, reversionary interests, and other burdens on
or deductions from the proceeds of production created or in existence as of
the Effective Time, that do not (A) reduce the Net Revenue Interest of Seller
in any Well or undeveloped location as reflected on Exhibit C, or (B) increase
the Working Interest of Seller with respect to any Well or undeveloped
location as reflected on Exhibit C, unless there is a proportionate increase
in Seller's applicable Net Revenue Interest;

(iv) required third-party consents to assignments or similar agreements with
respect to which (A) waivers or consents have been obtained from the
appropriate parties for the transaction contemplated hereby, or (B) required
notices have been given for the transaction contemplated hereby to the holders
of such rights and the appropriate period for asserting such rights has
expired without an exercise of such rights;

(v) all rights to consent by, required notices to, filings with, or other
actions by, Governmental Authorities in connection with the sale, transfer, or
conveyance of the Assets that are customarily obtained after such sale or
conveyance;

(vi) rights reserved to or vested in any Governmental Authority to control or
regulate any of the Wells or units included in the Assets and the applicable
laws, rules and regulations of such Governmental Authorities;

(vii) conventional rights of reassignment contained in any Leases or any
assignment thereof, providing for reassignment upon a decision to surrender or
abandon any Leases (as long as the right has not been triggered prior to
Closing);

(viii) statutory liens for Taxes or assessments not yet due and delinquent;

(ix) easements, rights‑of‑way, servitudes, permits, surface leases, and other
rights with respect to surface operations, on, over or in respect of any of
the Assets of which Buyer has notice, either actual, constructive, or inquiry;





(x) materialmen's, mechanics', operators' or other similar liens arising in
the ordinary course of business (A) if such liens and charges have not been
filed pursuant to law and the time for filing such liens and charges has
expired, or (B) if filed, such liens and charges have not yet become due and
payable or payment is being withheld as provided by law;

(xi) such Title Defects as Buyer has waived; and

(xii) all deeds of trust and other security interests burdening the Assets
granted by Seller in connection with its Third Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement dated as of March 16, 2010, as further amended, under which JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. serves as administrative agent (the "JPMorgan Chase Liens"),
it being understood that the release of the JPMorgan Chase Liens is a
condition to the Closing.

(b) The transfer of the Fee Surface Interests among the Assets shall be
accomplished by (i) warranty deeds substantially in the form of Exhibit E-1
and Exhibit E‑2 for the Medicine Springs Ranch located in Carbon County, and
(ii) a warranty deed substantially in the form of Exhibit E-3 for the Fasselin
Ranch located in Carbon and Duchense Counties. The transfer of the related
grazing rights shall be accomplished by use of the form required by the
appropriate Government Authority (the "Fee Surface Conveyances"). Such Fee
Surface Conveyances shall be subject to the Permitted Encumbrances.

(c) The transfer of the Water Rights among the Assets shall be accomplished by
(i) quitclaim deeds in substantially the form of Exhibit E-4 (Medicine Springs
Ranch, Carbon County) and Exhibit E-5 (Fasselin Ranch, Carbon and Duchense
Counties), and (ii) the water permit transfer forms required by the
appropriate Governmental Authority (the "Water Rights Conveyances"). The Water
Rights Conveyances shall be subject to the Permitted Encumbrances.

Section 4.06 Consents. No consent to assignment is required in connection with
any of the Assets, except those consents customarily obtained after a sale or
conveyance or as shown on Schedule 7.04.

Section 4.07 Remedies for Title Benefits.

(a) If, prior to the Notification Date, Seller or Buyer obtains knowledge of
any Title Benefit affecting the Assets, such Party shall promptly notify the
other Party in writing thereof. Seller shall not be entitled to an upward
adjustment to the Purchase Price with respect to any Title Benefits; provided,
Title Benefits qualifying for adjustment pursuant to Section 4.13 shall be
offset against Title Defects qualifying for adjustment pursuant to ARTICLE 4
hereof. The term "Title Benefit" shall mean Seller's actual Net Revenue
Interest in any Well or undeveloped location that is greater than or in
addition to the Net Revenue Interest set forth on Exhibit C, or Seller's
actual





Working Interest in any Well or undeveloped location that is less than the
Working Interest set forth on Exhibit C (with less than a proportionate
decrease in the Net Revenue Interest).

(b) The value attributable to each Title Benefit (the "Title Benefit Value")
that is asserted by either Party in the Title Benefit notices shall be
determined based on the criteria set forth below:

(i) If the Title Benefit is that the actual Net Revenue Interest attributable
to any Well or undeveloped location is greater than stated on Exhibit C, then
the Title Benefit Value shall be the absolute value of the number determined
by the following formula:

Title Benefit Value = [A x (B/C)] - A

| 
---|--- 

A

|

= Allocated Value for the affected Asset 

| 
---|--- 

B

|

= Correct Net Revenue Interest for the affected Asset 

| 
---|--- 

C

|

= Net Revenue Interest for the affected Asset as set forth on Exhibit C. 

(c) If the Title Benefit represents a decrease in Working Interest for which
there is not a proportionate decrease in Net Revenue Interest, the amount of
the Title Benefit Value shall be determined by taking into account the
Allocated Value of the affected Asset, the portion of the Asset affected by
the Title Benefit, the legal effect of the Title Benefit, the potential
discounted economic effect of the Title Benefit over the life of the affected
Asset, and the Title Benefit Values placed upon the Title Benefit by Buyer and
Seller.

(d) If the Parties have not agreed on the amount of the Title Benefit Value of
a Title Benefit by the expiration of thirty (30) days after Closing, Seller or
Buyer shall have the right to elect to have such Title Benefit Value
determined by an Independent Expert pursuant to Section 4.12.

Section 4.08 Environmental Review. From the date of this Agreement through the
Notification Date, Buyer may conduct an environmental assessment of the
Assets, subject to the following:

(a) Buyer shall have the right to conduct on‑site inspections, including Phase
I testing (as that term is defined by the American Society for Testing and
Materials) environmental assessments of the Assets, including sampling and
analysis of soil, air, surface water, groundwater and waste materials, prior
to the end of the Notification Date ("Buyer's Environmental Review"), and
Seller shall provide to Buyer a copy of any environmental review Seller has in
its possession subject to the same terms of confidentiality subsequently set
forth herein. Buyer shall not conduct Phase II testing (as that term is
defined by the American Society for Testing and Materials) of the





Assets prior to Closing without the prior written consent of, and subject to a
written protocol with, Seller (which consent and agreement to protocol shall
not be unreasonably withheld or conditioned), and any such Phase II testing
shall be limited to recognized environmental conditions identified in the
Phase I testing or other inspection conducted by Buyer pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence. Buyer shall bear all costs associated with any
Phase II testing, and Buyer shall bear all costs to remediate disturbed lands
or repairs required because of any Phase II testing conducted on its behalf.

(ii) The cost and expense of Buyer's Environmental Review shall be borne
solely by Buyer;

(iii) All inspections must be coordinated through a designated representative
of Seller who may accompany Buyer during the course of Buyer's inspection of
the Assets;

(iv) Buyer shall give Seller notice not less than forty-eight (48) hours
before any visits by Buyer and/or its consultant to the Assets, and Buyer
shall seek and obtain Seller's prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld) before either Buyer or Buyer's consultant enters the Assets;

(v) Buyer shall provide Seller a copy of any Phase I reports (and Phase II
reports, if obtained), or drafts thereof if a final report is not prepared
affecting the Assets promptly after Buyer's receipt of the same;

(vi) Buyer and/or its consultant shall perform all such work in a safe and
workmanlike manner, shall not unreasonably interfere with Seller's operations,
and shall comply with all Laws of applicable Governmental Authorities;

(vii) Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any third-
party consents that are required in order to perform any work comprising
Buyer's Environmental Review; and

(viii) Buyer hereby agrees to release and defend, indemnify, and hold harmless
Seller and Seller's Representatives from and against all Claims made by (or
attributable to the acts or omissions of) Buyer or Buyer's Representatives
(INCLUDING THOSE RESULTING FROM THE SOLE, JOINT, OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE (BUT
NOT WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL
FAULT OF SELLER OR ANY OF SELLER'S REPRESENTATIVES) arising out of or relating
to Buyer's Environmental Review. The release and indemnity provisions of this
Section 4.08 shall survive termination or Closing of this Agreement
notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided for in this Agreement.





(b) Unless otherwise required by applicable Laws, Buyer shall treat any
matters revealed by Buyer's Environmental Review and any environmental review
provided by Seller to Buyer, including any analyses, compilations, studies,
documents, reports, or data prepared or generated from such review, but
excluding any public information (the "Environmental Information"), as
confidential, and, except as provided below, Buyer shall not disclose any
Environmental Information to any Governmental Authority, or, prior to Closing,
to any other third party, without the prior written consent of Seller. Buyer
may use the Environmental Information prior to Closing only in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Environmental Information
shall be disclosed by Buyer to only those persons who need to know the
Environmental Information for purposes of evaluating the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, and who agree to be bound by the terms of this
Section 4.08. If Buyer or any third party to whom Buyer has provided any
Environmental Information is requested, compelled, or required to disclose any
of the Environmental Information prior to Closing, Buyer shall provide Seller
with prompt notice sufficiently prior to any such disclosure so as to allow
Seller to file for any protective order, or seek any other remedy, as it deems
appropriate under the circumstances. If this Agreement is terminated prior to
the Closing, upon Seller's request Buyer shall deliver the Environmental
Information, and all copies thereof and works based thereon, to Seller, which
Environmental Information shall become the sole property of Seller. Upon
request Buyer shall provide copies of the Environmental Information to Seller
without charge. The terms and provisions of this Section 4.08(b) shall survive
any termination of this Agreement, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
provided for in this Agreement.

Section 4.09 Definitions Used in ARTICLE 4 and in this Agreement.

(a) Environmental Defects. The term "Environmental Defect" shall mean, with
respect to any given Asset (including air, land, soil, surface and subsurface
strata, surface water, groundwater, or sediments), a violation of or a
condition that can reasonably be expected to give rise to a violation of any
Environmental Law in effect before the Closing Date in the State of Utah. The
term "Environmental Defect" shall not include the March 2010 release at the
Dry Canyon Compressor Station which resulted in Hydrocarbon impacts to soil
and groundwater, the associated regulatory proceeding, or Seller's ongoing
monitoring and remediation activities at the Station (the "Dry Canyon
Environmental Release").

(b) Governmental Authority. The term "Governmental Authority" shall mean the
United States and any state, county, city, and political subdivisions that
exercises jurisdiction over the Assets, and any agency, court, department,
board, bureau, commission, or other division or instrumentality thereof.

(c) Environmental Laws. The term "Environmental Laws" shall mean any and all
laws, statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, or orders of any Governmental
Authority pertaining to health and natural resources (but excluding laws,
orders, rules, and regulations that pertain to the prevention





of waste or the protection of correlative rights) and the protection of the
environment including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the
Comprehensive Environmental, Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980
("CERCLA"), the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act of 1976 ("RCRA"), the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Toxic
Substances Control Act, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments Act of 1984,
the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, the Hazardous
Materials Transportation Act, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 ("OPA"), any state
laws implementing the foregoing federal laws, or equivalent or analogous state
or local laws, statutes or ordinances, any regulation promulgated thereunder,
including those pertaining to the handling of oil and gas exploration and
production wastes or the use, maintenance, and closure of pits and
impoundments, and all other environmental conservation or protection laws in
effect as of the Closing Date hereof that are applicable to the Assets. For
purposes of this Agreement, the terms "hazardous substance," "release," and
"disposal" have the meanings specified in the applicable Environmental Laws as
in effect as of the Closing Date.

(d) Environmental Defect Value. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Environmental Defect Value" shall mean, with respect to any Environmental
Defect, the estimated costs and expenses net to Seller's interest in the
affected portion of the Assets to correct and/or remediate such Environmental
Defect consistent with applicable Environmental Laws, plus any and all fines,
penalties, court and/or administrative costs and other expenses attributable
to or arising from the existence of such Environmental Defect.

Section 4.10 Notice of Environmental Defects. Buyer shall provide Seller
notice of all Environmental Defects no later than 5:00 p.m. Mountain Time on
the Notification Date. To be effective, such notice must (a) be in writing,
(b) be received by Seller prior to the expiration of the Notification Date,
(c) describe the Environmental Defect in reasonable detail, including the
written conclusion of Buyer that an Environmental Defect exists, which
conclusion shall be reasonably substantiated by the factual data gathered in
Buyer's Environmental Review, (d) identify the specific Asset or Assets
affected by such Environmental Defect, (e) set forth the procedures
recommended to correct the Environmental Defect, (f) set forth Buyer's
reasonable, good faith estimate of the Environmental Defect Value, including
supporting calculations for such estimate, and (g) comply with the limitations
and Environmental Defect Value qualifications set forth in Section 4.13. ANY
MATTERS THAT MAY CONSTITUTE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECTS (EXCEPT THOSE COVERED BY THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5.27) BUT OF WHICH SELLER HAS NOT
BEEN SPECIFICALLY NOTIFIED BY BUYER IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FOREGOING SHALL BE
DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN WAIVED BY BUYER FOR ALL PURPOSES AND CONSTITUTE AN ASSUMED
OBLIGATION. Upon receipt of notices of Environmental Defects, Buyer and Seller
shall meet and determine upon which of the Environmental Defects,
Environmental Defect Values, and methods of correction they have reached
agreement. Upon the receipt of such notice from Buyer,





Seller shall have the option, but not the obligation, to attempt to correct to
Buyer's reasonable satisfaction such Environmental Defect during a period
expiring thirty (30) days after Closing.

Section 4.11 Remedies for Environmental Defects.

(a) If, as of the Closing Date, any Asset is affected by an uncured or
otherwise unresolved Environmental Defect noticed pursuant to the provisions
of Section 4.10, the affected portion of the Assets shall not be sold,
transferred, or conveyed to Buyer at Closing, and the Purchase Price shall,
subject to the terms of Section 4.13, be decreased by the Allocated Value of
the portion of the Assets so affected. With respect to any Environmental
Defect as to which Buyer and Seller are unable to agree within thirty (30)
days of Closing as to the validity of the Environmental Defect, the
Environmental Defect Value, or the manner of correction, either Buyer or
Seller may submit such matter for determination by an Independent Expert
pursuant to Section 4.12.

(b) With respect to any Asset that is not sold, transferred, or conveyed to
Buyer at the Closing pursuant to the terms of Section 4.11(a), after the
Closing and at such time as any Environmental Defect Value or the manner of
correction for an Environmental Defect is determined and, in either event, the
amount thereof is determined to be less than the Allocated Value for the
affected portion of the Assets, Seller shall have the right (i) in the case of
an Environmental Defect Value determination, to have the Purchase Price
reduced by only the Environmental Defect Value as so determined or (ii) in the
case of the cure determination, to elect to cure the Environmental Defect to
Buyer's reasonable satisfaction. The consequence of (i) shall be that Buyer
will pay to Seller an amount equal to the Allocated Value for the affected
Assets minus the Environmental Defect Value and the affected portion of the
Assets previously retained by Seller shall be conveyed to Buyer. The
consequence of (ii) shall be that upon achieving Buyer's written
acknowledgement that the Environmental Defect has been cured to its reasonable
satisfaction, the Allocated Value for such previously retained Asset shall be
paid to Seller and the affected portion of the Assets shall be conveyed to
Buyer. If no Environmental Defect is determined to exist, Buyer shall pay the
Allocated Value attributable to the affected portion of the Assets to Seller,
and Seller shall convey the previously retained portion of the Assets to
Buyer. If the Environmental Defect Value or the cost to cure an Environmental
Defect is determined to be greater than the Allocated Value of the affected
portion of the Assets, Seller shall retain the affected portion of the Assets,
and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value attributable to
such portion of the Assets.

Section 4.12 Independent Experts.

(a) Any disputes regarding Title Defects, Title Benefits, Environmental
Defects, Title Defect Value, Title Benefit Value, Environmental Defect Value,
appropriate cure of any Title Defect or correction of any Environmental
Defects, the calculation of the Settlement Statement or the Final Settlement
Statement, or revisions thereto, and the tax allocations may, subject to the
provisions of





Section 4.04, Section 4.07, Section 4.11, and Section 4.13, be submitted by a
Party, with written notice to the other Party, to an independent expert (the
"Independent Expert"), who shall serve as the sole and exclusive arbitrator of
any such dispute. The Independent Expert shall be selected by Buyer and Seller
(acting reasonably and in good faith) within fifteen (15) days following the
effective date of said notice. The Independent Expert shall be a person who is
independent, impartial, and knowledgeable in the subject matter and
substantive laws involved. For example, but not by way of limitation, in the
case of a dispute concerning an alleged Environmental Defect, Environmental
Defect Value, or cure of the same, the Independent Expert shall have expertise
in both the applicable Environmental Laws and environmental science relating
to the oil and gas industry.

(b) Buyer and Seller shall determine, acting in good faith, the procedures to
be followed to facilitate the decision of the Independent Expert. Such
procedures shall include the following scenario:

(i) If the dispute involves the method or adequacy of cure or correction of a
Title Defect or Environmental Defect, the Independent Expert shall provide in
writing the particulars necessary to cure or correct or to remedy any
deficient cure or correction, and shall provide Seller sixty (60) days (or
such additional time as reasonable and necessary under the circumstances, but
not to exceed ninety (90) days unless specifically agreed to in writing by
Seller and Buyer) to effect such cure or correction; and

(ii) In the event of circumstances described in clause (i) above, Seller at
its option may at any time during the 60‑day cure period pursuant to clause
(i) (as such period may be extended pursuant to such clause) decline to cure
or correct the applicable defect, at which time the applicable remedies set
forth in Section 4.11 shall apply.

(c) If Buyer and Seller fail to select an Independent Expert within the 15-day
period referred to in Section 4.12(a) above, within three (3) days thereafter,
either Buyer or Seller may request the American Arbitration Association to act
as the appointing authority and choose a third Independent Expert (meeting the
qualifications provided for herein) who alone shall resolve the disputes
between Buyer and Seller. Buyer and Seller shall each bear its own costs and
expenses incurred in connection with any such proceeding and one-half (1/2) of
the costs and expenses of the Independent Expert.

(d) Disputes to be resolved by an Independent Expert shall be resolved in
accordance with mutually agreed procedures and rules and, failing such
agreement, in accordance with the rules and procedures for non-administered
arbitration set forth in the commercial arbitration rules of the American
Arbitration Association. The Independent Expert shall be instructed by the
Parties to resolve such dispute as soon as reasonably practicable in light of
the circumstances using the terms and provisions of this Agreement with
respect to title and environmental matters. The decision and





award of the Independent Expert shall be binding upon the Parties and final
and non-appealable to the maximum extent permitted by Laws or Environmental
Laws, as applicable, and judgment thereon may be entered in a court of
competent jurisdiction and enforced by any Party as a final judgment of such
court.

(e) All proceedings under this Section 4.12 shall be conducted at a mutually
agreed location, or if Buyer and Seller acting reasonably do not mutually
agree upon a location for such proceeding, the proceeding shall be conducted
in Denver, Colorado.

Section 4.13 Limitation of Remedies For Title Benefits, Title Defects, and
Environmental Defects. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement,

(a) if the Title Defect Value for a given Title Defect, or the Title Benefit
Value for a given Title Benefit, in each case as determined pursuant to this
ARTICLE 4, does not exceed Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00), or if the
Environmental Defect Value for a given Environmental Defect, as determined
pursuant to this ARTICLE 4 does not exceed Seventy-five Thousand Dollars
($75,000.00), such Title Defect, Title Benefit, or Environmental Defect shall
not qualify for either a Purchase Price adjustment, cure, or correction of
such Defect. It is understood and agreed that in each such case these dollar
figures are a threshold and not a deductible.

(b) if the aggregate net value of all Title Defects qualifying for adjustment
pursuant to Section 4.13(a) less all Title Benefits qualifying for adjustment
pursuant to Section 4.13(a) does not exceed one and one-half percent (1 ½%) of
the Purchase Price (prior to any adjustments thereto), then no adjustment of
the Purchase Price shall be made therefor, and if the aggregate net value of
all Environmental Defects qualifying for adjustment pursuant to Section
4.13(a) does not exceed one and one-half percent (1 ½%) of the Purchase Price
(prior to any adjustments thereto), then no adjustment of the Purchase Price
shall be made therefor;

(c) if the aggregate net value of all Title Defects qualifying for adjustment
pursuant to Section 4.13(a) less Title Benefits qualifying for adjustment to
Section 4.13(a) exceeds one and one-half percent (1 ½%) of the Purchase Price
(prior to any adjustments thereto), then the Purchase Price shall be adjusted
by just the amount in excess of such aggregate net value, it being understood
that this amount is a deductible and not a threshold, and if the aggregate net
value of all Environmental Defects qualifying for adjustments pursuant to
Section 4.13(a) exceeds one and one-half percent (1 ½%) of the Purchase Price
(prior to any adjustments thereto), then the Purchase Price shall be adjusted
by just the amount in excess of such aggregate net value, it being understood
that this amount is a deductible and not a threshold.

All Title Defects and Environmental Defects asserted by Buyer pursuant to this
ARTICLE 4 after being resolved in accordance with this ARTICLE 4 shall
thereafter constitute Permitted





Encumbrances and Assumed Obligations, whether or not an adjustment to the
Purchase Price is made with respect thereto in accordance with this ARTICLE 4.

ARTICLE 5

by general equitable principles. Upon the execution and delivery by Seller of
the agreements to be executed and delivered by Seller at Closing
(collectively, the "Seller's Closing Documents"), each of Seller's Closing
Documents

Section 5.07 Taxes. During the period of Seller's ownership of the Assets up
to and including the Effective Time, Seller has caused to be timely filed all
material Tax returns relating to the Assets. Seller has paid or caused to be

with their terms. To the knowledge of Seller, no other party to any of the
Material Contracts is in Breach thereof.

Section 5.11 Production Imbalances. Schedule 1.02(i) is a complete description
of Seller's Production Imbalance position as of the Effective Time as to any
of the Interests.

Section 5.12 Payments for Production. Seller is not obligated by virtue of a
take or pay payment, call, advance payment, production payment, or other
similar payment or obligation (other than royalties, overriding royalties, or
similar arrangements that do not cause Seller's Net Revenue Interest to be

from the sale thereof, attributable to the Leases at some future time without
receiving payment therefor at or after the time of delivery at the then market
price, and no take or pay credits must be provided before natural gas can be

operator, received a written proposal to plug and abandon. All of the Wells
drilled and completed by Seller as operator have been drilled and completed
within the boundaries of the Leases or within the limits otherwise permitted
by contract, pooling or unit agreement, and applicable Laws. The locations
described on Schedule 5.14 are the sites of wells previously plugged and
abandoned and of the Prickley Pear 5-19‑1215 well that Seller shall plug and
abandon (and the only sites of such wells) that, require ongoing surface
restoration in compliance with any applicable Laws, the Leases, the Surface
Agreements, the Contracts and any other applicable agreements.

Section 5.15 Equipment. Seller is the owner of the Equipment free and clear of
all liens and encumbrances other than those to be released at Closing. Other

equipment





of similar grade and utility or (b) in connection with normal and customary
prudent operations, the Equipment currently attendant to the Wells was the
equipment historically used by Seller on the Wells to produce the Hydrocarbons
prior to the execution of this Agreement. All Equipment necessary to conduct
normal operations on the Assets is in good working condition, reasonable wear
and tear excepted, and is being maintained in a state adequate to conduct
normal operations, except for such conditions that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.16 No Alienation. Within one hundred eighty (180) days of the
Effective Date, Seller has not voluntarily or involuntarily sold, assigned,
conveyed, or transferred or contracted to sell, assign, convey, or transfer
any right or title to, or interest in, the Assets other than (a) production

produced from the Assets are being received in all respects by Seller in a
timely manner and are not being held in suspense for any reason.

Section 5.18 Area of Mutual Interest and Other Agreements. No Asset is subject
to (or has related to it) any area of mutual interest agreements not disclosed
in the Contracts or any farm-out or farm-in agreement under which any party
thereto is entitled to receive assignments not yet made or could earn
additional assignments after the Effective Time.

Section 5.19 Permits. Seller, during its period of ownership and as to those
Assets it has operated, has all Permits (including permits, licenses, approval
registrations, notifications, exemptions, and any other authorizations
pursuant to Law) necessary or appropriate to own and operate the Assets as

material respects. Seller has not received written notice of any violations in
respect of any of the Permits that remain uncured, except as set forth in
Schedule 5.19.

Section 5.20 No Adverse Change. During the period of Seller's ownership, with
respect to the Assets for which Seller is the operator of record and to
Seller's knowledge as to Assets for which Seller is not the operator, the
Assets have been operated in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practices, and there has been no event or series of events that have
either individually or in combination had a Material Adverse Effect on the
Assets, except as set forth in Section 5.27.

Section 5.21 Information. The information pertaining to revenue and expenses
attributable to the Assets that Seller has furnished to Buyer (the
"Information") is (a) accurate in all material





respects to the extent relating to the period of Seller's ownership of the
Assets and (b) to the knowledge of Seller, accurate in all material respects
to the extent relating to any period of ownership of the Assets prior to the
time owned by Seller reflected in the Information. Except as specifically set
forth in this Section 5.21, Seller makes no representations regarding the
accuracy of any of the Records; provided, however, Seller does represent that
(i) all of the Records are files, or copies thereof, that Seller has used in
the ordinary course of operating and owning the Assets, (ii) Seller has not
intentionally withheld any material information from the Records, and (iii)
Seller has not knowingly misrepresented any material information in the
Records. Except as set forth in this Section 5.21, no representation or
warranty of any kind is made by Seller as to the Information or with respect
to the Assets to which the Information relates and Buyer expressly agrees that
any conclusions drawn therefrom shall be the result of its own independent
review and judgment. The representations and warranties contained in this
paragraph shall apply only to matters of fact, and shall not apply to any
information, data, printouts, extrapolations, projections, forecasts,
documentation, maps, graphs, charts, or tables that reflect, depict, present,

during the period prior to the Closing, operate and administer the Assets in a
manner consistent with its past practices, (ii) make payment of all costs and
expenses attributable to the ownership or operation of the Assets and relating
to the period prior to the transfer of operations to Buyer, and shall carry on
its business with respect to the Assets in substantially the same manner as
before execution of this Agreement, (iii) not, without Buyer's express written

written notice of such action to Buyer, (ix) not elect to become a
non‑consenting party in any operation proposed by any other Person with
respect to the Assets unless requested to do so in writing by Buyer, (x)

to the Assets.

(h) Buyer acknowledges that Seller owns undivided interests in some or all of
the Assets, and Buyer agrees that the acts or omissions of the other working
interests owners shall not constitute a violation of the provisions of this
ARTICLE 7, nor shall any action required by a vote of working





interest owners constitute such a violation so long as Seller has voted its
interests in a manner that complies with the provisions of this ARTICLE 7.
Seller will, without penalty for the failure to do so except to the extent
that the failure to give Buyer such notice would have a Material Adverse
Effect, notify Buyer of the occurrence of such event to the extent of Seller's
knowledge.

Section 7.02 Operating Company's Qualification. At Closing (or upon
termination of the Transition Services Agreement, if utilized), Buyer shall
cause Operating Company to be qualified and meet all requirements, including
the bonding requirements that have been imposed on Seller that are described
on Schedule 5.13, to be designated operator of that portion of the Assets for
which Seller serves as operator. It is understood and agreed that certain
Governmental Authorities may require Operating Company to provide higher
levels of financial security than they required of Seller. Operating Company
shall provide all such additional security in order to meet all requirements

Company shall cooperate with Seller to facilitate the expeditious release by
Governmental Authorities of Seller's bonds described on Schedule 5.13.

Section 7.03 Operation of the Assets after the Closing. If requested by Buyer
prior to Closing, Seller shall continue to operate the Assets after Closing
pursuant to a transition services agreement substantially in the form of the
attached Exhibit F (the "Transition Services Agreement"). Seller shall make
its employees and contractors available to Buyer prior to the Closing as may
be reasonably necessary to assist in the transition if Buyer becomes the
operator. Seller does not warrant or guarantee that Buyer will become the
operator of the Assets or any portion thereof, as such matter will be
controlled by the applicable joint operating agreement(s) and other applicable
agreement(s); provided, however, Seller shall use reasonable efforts to assist
Buyer in becoming successor operator.

Section 7.04 Consent to Assignment of Certain Contracts; Novation of Certain
Contracts.

(e) Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, Seller shall send a
request for consent to assignment to each holder of a consent right set forth
on Schedule 7.04. Should any such holder of a consent right reasonably require
financial, credit or background information concerning Buyer, Buyer covenants
and agrees that it will promptly provide such information.

(f) Among the Contracts described on Schedule 7.04 are gathering, processing
and transportation agreements. Buyer acknowledges that the other party to each
such Contract (herein, each a "Transporter") may require financial security
from Buyer in accordance with the Transporter's tariffs, published standards
or otherwise. Buyer covenants and agrees that it will provide the financial
security required by each Transporter. Buyer further covenants and agrees that
it will fully cooperate with Seller in obtaining from each Transporter the
assignment of each gathering, processing or





transporter Contract, as the case may be, and upon Closing, Buyer shall assume
all of Seller's rights and obligations thereunder, arising from and after the
Effective Time.

(g) It is acknowledged and agreed that the firm transportation Contract with
Wyoming Interstate Gas Company ("WIC") has two components, one related to the
Overthrust portion thereof, and the other related to the Kanda portion
thereof. The Overthrust portion of such Contract is among the Excluded Assets.
The Kanda portion of such Contract is among the Assets being assigned
hereunder and is necessary to facilitate the marketing of Hydrocarbons
produced from the Assets. In order to accomplish the bifurcation of this WIC
Contract and the assignment of the Kanda portion of such Contact, certain
approvals and waivers must be obtained from the FERC. Promptly after the
execution of this Agreement, the Parties shall cooperate in the filing of
appropriate applications with the FERC in order to bifurcate the Overthrust
and Kanda portions of the WIC Contract and provide for the assignment of the
Kanda portion only to Buyer. If FERC approval of such bifurcation of the WIC
Contact and assignment of the Kanda portion thereof is not received by the
Closing Date, the Parties shall proceed with Closing, and Seller shall retain
the entire WIC Contract and the Parties shall execute at Closing a contract
whereby Seller shall purchase from Buyer the Hydrocarbons produced from the
Assets, which contract will terminate upon FERC's approval of the bifurcation
of the WIC Contract and the assignment of the Kanda portion thereof to Buyer.

(h) As provided in Section 1.02(e), the Assets do not include, and it is
acknowledged and agreed that excluded from the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement are, those specific compression-related assets subject to that
certain Master Lease Agreement dated July 23, 2012 (Master Lease Agreement

Capital, LLC, Wells Fargo Equipment Finance, Inc., BMO Harris Equipment
Finance Company, JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., U.S. Bank - Equipment Finance and
Fifth Third Equipment Finance Company, as assignees thereunder (the "Sale-

Leaseback Agreement will be amended to bifurcate the obligations thereunder as
to assets located in Garfield County, Colorado (which Seller shall retain) and
the obligations related to those assets thereunder located in the West
Tavaputs area (which Buyer shall assume). Buyer covenants and agrees that it
will execute and deliver at Closing an instrument that shall provide for the
novation of the Sale-Leaseback Agreement and related assignments whereby (1)
Buyer shall assume all of Seller's rights and obligations thereunder as to
only the assets thereunder in the West Tavaputs area and (2) Seller's
liability for any post-Effective Time obligations thereunder as to assets
located in the West Tavaputs area shall be terminated. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event the amendment and novation of the Sale-Leaseback
Agreement is not accomplished on or before the Closing, the Parties shall
cooperate in accomplishing such novation on or before the termination of the
Transition Services Agreement.

(i) Seller shall have no obligation whatsoever to make any payment, deliver
any other consideration, or retain or assume any obligation in order to obtain
any consent to assignment or





accomplish the assignment and/or novation of any Contract or the novation of
the Sale-Leaseback Agreement.

Section 7.05 Public Announcements. Prior to issuing any press release, a Party
shall provide it to the other Party for approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; however, the foregoing shall
not restrict disclosures by Buyer or Seller that are required by applicable
securities or other Laws or the applicable rules of any stock exchange having
jurisdiction over the disclosing Party or its Affiliates. Following Closing,
the Parties shall issue a press release in form and substance to be agreed
upon by the Parties prior to the Closing, which agreement shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

as it chooses in its sole and absolute discretion, and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to deliver such offers no later than five (5) days prior to

New Employees and their spouses and dependents under Buyer's group health plan
(the "Group Health Plan"). Buyer shall cause each such Group Health Plan, and

otherwise applicable to such New Employees and (ii) waive all limitations as
to pre-existing medical conditions under the Group Health Plan applicable to
New Employees to the extent that such medical conditions would be covered
under the Group Health Plan if they were not pre-existing conditions. Buyer
shall take such actions as are necessary to provide continuation health care
coverage to New Employees and their qualified beneficiaries who incur
qualifying events on or after the Closing Date in accordance with the
continuation health care coverage requirements of Section 4980B of the Code or
any state analogue (collectively "COBRA").

(e) Any New Employees will become eligible to participate in Buyer's incentive
bonus plans effective as of their hire date.

(f) Following the Closing, subject in all events to applicable Laws, Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be accepted by the

participate a rollover of any eligible rollover distribution (within the
meaning of section 402(c) of the Code) of such New Employee's benefit under a
Seller Retirement Plan (including any notes representing participant loans)
provided that Seller provides to Buyer such information as is satisfactory to
Buyer to assure itself that such Seller Retirement Plan satisfies the
qualification requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code.

(g) This Section 7.07 shall not constitute an amendment to any employee
benefit plan maintained by the Seller and its affiliates, or the Buyer and its
affiliates, create any third-party beneficiary rights or inure to the benefit
of or be enforceable by any employee or any person representing the interests
of employees.

(h) Buyer agrees that, for a period of twelve (12) months following Closing,
Buyer will not, in any manner, directly or indirectly, solicit any person who
is an employee of Seller (other than any Business Employee) to apply for or
accept employment with Buyer or any other business entity, or discuss with any

alternative employment with Buyer or any other business entity.

Section 7.08 Updated Exhibits. The Parties agree that Exhibit A-1 is intended
to list all of the Leases and Lands that are intended to be included as part
of the Assets to be conveyed to Buyer hereunder. In the event that between the

Lands that have been inadvertently omitted or incorrectly described.

and Adjustments with appropriate support (the "Settlement Statement"), which
Settlement Statement shall be based upon the then most currently available
data and information in order to make the adjustments as provided in Section
10.02. Any dispute with respect thereto shall be resolved prior to Closing. If
Buyer and Seller cannot resolve any item, the Settlement Statement shall
reflect Seller's calculation of such item.

Section 10.04 Post-Closing Allocations and Adjustments to Purchase Price.

(i) On or before March 10, 2014, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a
revised Settlement Statement ("Final Settlement Statement") setting forth the
actual Purchase Price Allocations and Adjustments. Each Party shall provide
the other such data and information as may be reasonably requested to permit
Seller to prepare the Final Settlement Statement or to permit Buyer to perform
or cause to be performed an audit of the Final Settlement Statement. The Final
Settlement Statement shall become final and binding upon the Parties on the
thirtieth (30th) day following receipt thereof by Buyer (the "Final Settlement
Date") unless Buyer gives written notice of its disagreement (a "Notice of
Disagreement") to Seller prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall
specify in reasonable detail the dollar amount and the nature and basis of any
disagreement so asserted. If a Notice of Disagreement is received by Seller in
a timely manner, then the Parties shall resolve the dispute evidenced by the
Notice of Disagreement by mutual agreement, or otherwise in accordance with
Section 4.12.

(j) If the amount of the adjusted Purchase Price as set forth on the Final
Settlement Statement (or as finally resolved) exceeds the amount of the
estimated Purchase Price previously paid, then Buyer shall pay in immediately
available funds to Seller the amount by which the Purchase Price as set forth
on the Final Settlement Statement (or as finally resolved) exceeds the amount
of the estimated Purchase Price previously paid within five (5) business days
after the Final Settlement Date. If the amount of the adjusted Purchase Price
as set forth on the Final Settlement Statement (or as finally resolved) is
less than the amount of the estimated Purchase Price previously paid, then
Seller shall pay in immediately available funds to Buyer the amount by which
the Purchase Price as set forth on the Final Settlement Statement (or as
finally resolved) is less than the amount of the estimated Purchase Price
previously paid within five (5) business days after the Final Settlement Date.

(k) Pursuant to Section 10.02(b), the Purchase Price is to be reduced by the
value of Hydrocarbons produced during the period from and after the Effective
Time to the Closing Date. If Buyer shall receive any revenues attributable to
such Hydrocarbons for any reason for which Buyer has received a reduction in
the Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 10.04(c), Buyer shall promptly
remit same in immediately available funds to Seller. Likewise, if Seller shall
for any reason





receive any of the proceeds of sale of Hydrocarbons produced and saved from
the Assets and attributable to the period from and after the Closing Date or
any other revenues attributable to the ownership or operation of the Assets
from and after the Effective Time, Seller shall promptly remit same in
immediately available funds to Buyer.

(l) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any costs and expenses,
including Taxes (other than income taxes), relating to the Assets that are not
reflected in the Final Settlement Statement shall be treated as follows:

(i) All costs and expenses relating to the Assets for the period of time prior
to the Effective Time shall be the sole obligation of Seller, and Seller shall
promptly pay, or if paid by Buyer, promptly reimburse Buyer in immediately
available funds for and indemnify, defend, and hold Buyer harmless from and
against the same; and

(ii) All costs and expenses relating to the Assets for the time period after
the Effective Time shall be the sole obligation of Buyer, and Buyer shall
promptly pay, or if paid by Seller, promptly reimburse Seller in immediately
available funds for and indemnify, defend, and hold Seller harmless from and
against the same.

(m) Purchase Price adjustments, if any, with respect to Title Defects or
Environmental Defects the cure or correction of which or a dispute with
respect to the same remains pending on the Final Settlement Date shall be made
on a date mutually agreed by the Parties, both acting reasonably.

Section 10.05 Transfer Taxes. All sales, use, documentary, recording, stamp,
transfer, and other similar taxes (other than taxes on gross income, net
income or gross receipts and franchise taxes) and duties, levies, assessments,
fees, or other governmental charges incurred by or imposed with respect to the
property transfers undertaken pursuant to this Agreement shall be the
responsibility of, and shall be paid by, Buyer. The Parties will reasonably
cooperate to eliminate or reduce the assessment of sales or use taxes to the
extent permitted by applicable Law. If Seller (not Buyer) is required by
applicable Law to appeal or protest the assessment of sales or use taxes,
Seller shall protest the assessment of those taxes if Buyer requests Seller in
writing to make such appeal or protest, and, in such event, Buyer will
reimburse Seller all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Seller in connection
with such appeal or protest. Any penalties, additions to tax or interest
levied or assessed with respect to any failure of Buyer to comply with this
Section 10.05 shall be allocated to, and shall be payable by, Buyer.

Section 10.06 Tax Matters.

(f) All ad valorem, property, production, severance, conservation, and similar
Taxes attributable to any period prior to the Effective Time will be paid by
the Seller. All ad valorem,





property, production, severance, conservation, and similar Taxes attributable
to any period from and after the Effective Time shall be paid by Buyer.

(g) For purposes of determining the allocations described in Section 10.06(a),
(i) Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis pertaining to calendar year
2013 (other than Taxes described in clauses (ii) or (iii) below) shall be
allocated between the portion of such year ending immediately prior to the
Effective Time and the portion of such year beginning at the Effective Time by
prorating each such Tax based on the number of days in 2013 that occur before
Effective Time, on the one hand, and the number of days in 2013 that occur at
or after the Effective Time, on the other hand; (ii) Taxes that are
attributable to the severance or production of hydrocarbons giving rise to
such Taxes occurred; and (iii) Taxes that are imposed on a transactional basis
(other than such Taxes described in clause (ii)) shall be allocated to the
period in which the transaction giving rise to such Taxes occurred. For
purposes of clause (i) of the preceding sentence, the period for such Taxes
with respect to the Assets shall begin on the date on which ownership of the
applicable Assets gives rise to liability for the particular Tax and shall end
on the day before the next such date.

(h) Seller shall file all tax returns and remit all Tax payments with respect
to Asset Taxes due on or prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall file all tax
returns and remit all Tax payments with respect to Taxes or transfer taxes, if
any, that are use Taxes due after the Closing Date. Each Party shall reimburse
the other Party for their portion of such Taxes.

(i) If the payment of any Tax by any Seller has increased the Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 10.02(a)(i), Seller shall not be indemnified or entitled
to reimbursement under this Section 10.06 to the extent such increased
Purchase Price has actually been paid to Seller. If the non-payment of any Tax
by Seller has decreased the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 10.02(b)(ix),
Buyer shall not be indemnified or reimbursed with respect to the amount of
such Tax payment under this Section 10.06(d).

(j) The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of tax returns and
any audit, litigation, or other proceeding with respect to Taxes relating to
the Assets. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon another
Party's request) the provision of records and information that are relevant to
any such tax return or audit, litigation or other proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided under this Agreement. The
Seller and the Buyer agree to retain all books and records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to the Assets relating to any taxable period beginning
before the Effective Time until the expiration of the statute of limitations
of the respective taxable periods and to abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority.





(k) Seller shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes allocable to Seller under
this Section 10.06(f) and Buyer shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes
allocable to Buyer under this Section 10.06(f). The Parties shall reasonably
cooperate with the other Party in connection with obtaining any refund of
Taxes described in this Section 10.06(f), and if a Party receives a refund to
which the other Party is entitled, the Party receiving the refund shall pay it
to the Party entitled to the refund within thirty (30) business days after

or downward adjustment in the Purchase Price as a result of any matter for
which Buyer or Seller is indemnified under this Agreement.

Section 12.07 Buyer's Indemnity. Buyer shall release and indemnify, defend and
hold Seller and its Representatives harmless from and against any and all
Claims caused by, resulting from, or incidental to (i) the Assumed
Obligations, (ii) any breach by Buyer of any of Buyer's representations or
warranties contained herein (subject to the survival periods in Section
12.10), or (iii) any Breach by Buyer of its covenants and agreements set forth
in this Agreement.

Section 12.08 Seller's Indemnity. Subject to Section 12.10, Section 12.11 and
Section 12.12, Seller shall release and indemnify, defend and hold Buyer and
its Representatives harmless from and against any and all Claims caused by,
resulting from, or incidental to (i) the Retained Obligations, (ii) any Breach
by Seller of Seller's representations and warranties contained herein (subject
to the survival periods set forth in Section 12.10), and (iii) any Breach by
Seller of its covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement.

Section 12.09 Notices and Defense of Indemnified Claims. Each Party shall
immediately notify the other Party of any Claim of which it becomes aware and
for which it is entitled to indemnification from the other Party under this
Agreement. The indemnifying Party shall be obligated to defend, at the
indemnifying Party's sole expense, any litigation or other administrative or
adversarial proceeding against the indemnified Party relating to any Claim for
which the indemnifying Party has agreed to release and indemnify and hold the
indemnified Party harmless





under this Agreement; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice
shall not relieve the indemnifying Party from its obligations unless such
failure to give notice actually prejudices the indemnifying Party and so long
as the notice is given within the period set forth in Section 12.10. The
indemnified Party shall have the right to participate with the indemnifying
Party in the defense of any such Claim at its own expense. An indemnified
Party shall use reasonable commercial efforts to pursue, and to cause its
affiliates to pursue, all insurance claims to which it may be entitled in
connection with any Claims for which a claim for indemnification is made, and
the Parties shall cooperate with each other in pursuing insurance claims with
respect to any such Claims or any indemnification obligations from third
parties with respect to any such Claims. An indemnifying Party shall not,
without the prior written consent of the indemnified Party, (i) settle any
Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto which does
not include an unconditional written release of the indemnified Party from all
liability in respect of such Claim or (ii) settle any Claim or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect thereto in any manner that may materially
and adversely affect the indemnified Party (other than as a result of money
damages covered by the indemnity).

Section 12.10 Survival.

(a) The representations and warranties of Seller in ARTICLE 5 (other than the
representations and warranties of Seller in Section 5.01, Section 5.02 and
Section 5.03, which shall survive the Closing without time limit, and the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.04 and Section 5.07,
which survive the Closing by a period equal to the statute of limitations),
shall survive the Closing for a one-year period commencing on the Closing
Date. The representations and warranties of Buyer in ARTICLE 6 (other than the
representations and warranties of Buyer in Section 6.01, Section 6.02 and
Section 6.03, which survive the Closing without time limit, and the
representations and warranties in Section 6.04, which survive the Closing by a
period equal to the statute of limitations) shall survive the Closing for a
one-year period commencing on the Closing Date. Except as expressly provided
in Section 12.10(b), the covenants and agreements of the Parties set forth in
this Agreement shall survive the Closing until such covenants and agreements
(including indemnity obligations) have been fully performed in all respects.
Representations, warranties and covenants shall be of no further force or
effect after the date of their termination.

(b) The indemnity of Seller as provided in Section 12.08 shall survive for a
period of one year from and after the Closing, less and except Seller's
indemnity obligation under (i) Section 12.02(b), Section 12.02(c) and Section
12.02(e), which shall survive for a period equal to the statute of limitations
from and after Closing and (ii) Seller's indemnity obligation for the
litigation described on Schedule 5.06, Part A, which shall survive until a
final non-appealable judgment is entered in each matter described on Schedule
5.06, Part A. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall not
be entitled to make any, and hereby waives, the right to assert, any Claim for
indemnity pursuant to the terms of this Agreement against Seller unless Buyer
seeks indemnification





for such Claim by a written notice received by Seller prior to the expiration
of the applicable time period set forth in the prior sentence.

Section 12.11 Limitations on Seller's Indemnification Obligations. SELLER'S
AGGREGATE LIABILITIES FOR INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS ARTICLE 12
AND ANY CLAIM OF A BREACH BY SELLER OF ANY REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTY SHALL
NOT EXCEED TWENTY PERCENT (20%) OF THE PURCHASE PRICE.

Section 12.12 Representation as to Title and Environmental Matters.
Notwithstanding the survival of certain of Seller's representations and
warranties for a one-year period commencing on the Closing Date pursuant to
Section 12.10, as to any matter that would constitute a Title Defect or an
Environmental Defect that could also result in the Breach of any Seller
representation and warranty in ARTICLE 5, then except for the special warranty
of title set forth in the Assignment, the warranty in the warranty deeds
transferring the Fee Surface Interests and the representations and warranties
set out in Section 5.27 and Section 5.29, Buyer's sole and exclusive remedy
shall be to assert prior to the Notification Date such matter as a Title
Defect or an Environmental Defect, and the matter will be handled pursuant
only to ARTICLE 4. Buyer shall be precluded from asserting any such matter as
a Breach of any representation and warranty other than under the special
warranty of title set forth in the Assignment, the warranty in the warranty
deeds transferring the Fee Surface Interests and the representations and
warranties set out in Section 5.27 and Section 5.29.

Section 12.13 Exclusive Remedy. The terms and provisions of this ARTICLE 12
and those provided in ARTICLE 2, ARTICLE 4, ARTICLE 7, ARTICLE 8, ARTICLE 9,
ARTICLE 10, and ARTICLE 11 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of each of
the Parties indemnified hereunder with respect to the representations,
warranties, covenants, and agreements of the Parties set forth in this
Agreement and the other documents executed and delivered hereunder; provided,
however, that the terms of this Section 12.13 shall not be applicable to the
extent that a Party has committed fraud, securities fraud (where one of the
elements of the cause of action is scienter or knowledge), willful misconduct
or gross negligence.

Section 12.14 Defenses and Counterclaims. Each Party that is required to
assume any obligation or liability of the other Party pursuant to this
Agreement or that is required to release and defend, indemnify or hold the
other Party harmless hereunder shall, notwithstanding any other provision
hereof to the contrary, be entitled to the use and benefit of all defenses
(legal and equitable) and counterclaims of such other Party in defense of
third-party Claims arising out of any such assumption or indemnification.

Section 12.15 Anti-Indemnity Statute, No Insurance; Subrogation. Buyer and
Seller agree that with respect to any statutory limitations now or hereafter
in effect affecting the validity or





enforceability of the indemnities provided for in this Agreement, such
indemnities shall be deemed amended in order to comply with such limitations.
This provision concerning statutory limitations shall not apply to indemnities
for all liabilities of the indemnifying Party that are covered by such Party's
insurance. The indemnification provisions provided in this ARTICLE 12 shall
not be construed as a form of insurance. Buyer and Seller hereby waive for
themselves and their successors and assigns, including their insurers, any
rights to subrogation for Claims for which each of them is respectively liable
or against which each respectively indemnifies the other, and, if required by
applicable policies, Buyer and Seller shall obtain waiver of such subrogation
from their respective insurers.

ASSETS, SHALL BE CONVEYED TO BUYER, AND BUYER SHALL ACCEPT THE SAME, AS IS,
WHERE IS, WITH ALL FAULTS AND IN THEIR PRESENT CONDITION AND STATE OF REPAIR.

MADE, SUCH INSPECTIONS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH ASSETS AS BUYER DEEMS APPROPRIATE.
SELLER AND BUYER AGREE THAT, TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAWS
(INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS) TO BE EFFECTIVE, THE DISCLAIMERS OF THE

AND SELLER MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IN RESPECT
TO THE QUALITY, ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR USEFULNESS OF SUCH SEISMIC OR
OTHERWISE, AND ANY SUCH IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS ARE HEREBY

RESPONSIBILITY, AND BUYER NOR SUCH OTHER PERSONS SHALL HAVE ANY CLAIM AGAINST
SELLER, AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS, AND
BUYER HEREBY RELEASES THE FOREGOING FROM ANY LIABILITY AS A CONSEQUENCE
THEREOF.

Section 13.02 NORM. BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INFORMED THAT OIL AND
GAS PRODUCING FORMATIONS CAN CONTAIN NATURALLY OCCURRING RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL
("NORM"). SCALE FORMATION OR SLUDGE DEPOSITS CAN CONCENTRATE LOW LEVELS OF
NORM ON EQUIPMENT AND OTHER ASSETS. THE ASSETS SUBJECT TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY
HAVE LEVELS OF NORM ABOVE BACKGROUND LEVELS, AND A HEALTH HAZARD MAY EXIST IN
CONNECTION WITH THE ASSETS BY REASON THEREOF. THEREFORE, BUYER MAY NEED TO,
AND SHALL, FOLLOW SAFETY PROCEDURES WHEN HANDLING THE EQUIPMENT AND OTHER
ASSETS.

Section 13.03 Casualty Loss; Condemnation.

(r) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Buyer shall assume all
risk of loss with respect to, and any change in the condition of, the Assets

infiltration of Wells, and the depreciation of personal property.

(s) Prior to the Closing, there shall not have been a material adverse change
in the Assets taken as a whole caused by an event of casualty (a "Casualty"),
including volcanic eruptions, acts of God, fire, explosion, earthquake, wind
storm, flood, drought, condemnation, the exercise of any right of eminent
domain, confiscation, or seizure, but excepting depletion due to normal
production and depreciation or failure of equipment or casing.

(t) If, prior to the Closing, a Casualty occurs (or Casualties occur) that
results in a reduction in the value of the Assets in excess of fifteen percent
(15%) of the Purchase Price ("Casualty





Loss"), this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding
any such Casualty Loss, and, at Seller's sole option, (i) Seller shall retain
such Asset subject to such Casualty and such Asset shall be the subject of an
adjustment to the Purchase Price in the same manner set forth in Section 4.03
hereof, or (ii) at the Closing, Seller shall pay to Buyer all sums paid to
Seller by reason of such Casualty Loss, (provided, however, that the Purchase
Price shall not be adjusted by reason of such payment) and shall assign,
transfer, and set over unto Buyer all of the right, title, and interest of
Seller in and to such Asset and any unpaid awards, other payments or claims
arising out of such Casualty Loss.

(u) For purpose of determining the value of a Casualty Loss, the Parties shall
use the same methodology as applied in determining the value of a Title Defect
as set forth in Section 4.03(a).

Section 13.04 Waiver of Consumer Rights. BUYER HEREBY WAIVES THE PROVISIONS OF
THE TEXAS DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES ACT, CHAPTER 17, SUBSECTION E, SECTIONS
17.41 THROUGH 17.63, INCLUSIVE (OTHER THAN SECTION 17.555, WHICH IS NOT
WAIVED), OF THE TEXAS BUSINESS AND COMMERCE CODE ("DTPA"), A LAW THAT GIVES
CONSUMERS SPECIAL RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS. AFTER CONSULTING WITH AN ATTORNEY OF
ITS OWN SELECTION, BUYER VOLUNTARILY CONSENTS TO THIS WAIVER. TO EVIDENCE ITS
ABILITY TO GRANT SUCH WAIVER, BUYER REPRESENTS TO SELLER THAT (i) IT IS NOT IN
A SIGNIFICANTLY DISPARATE BARGAINING POSITION; (ii) IT IS REPRESENTED BY LEGAL
COUNSEL OF ITS OWN CHOOSING IN ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT; AND (iii) SUCH
LEGAL COUNSEL WAS NOT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IDENTIFIED, SUGGESTED, OR
SELECTED BY SELLER OR AN AGENT OF SELLER.

make the requisite filings with, and provide the requisite notices to, the
appropriate Governmental Authorities to place the title or other indicia or
responsibility of ownership, including operation of the Assets, in a name
other than the name of the Seller, or any variations thereof.

pertaining to the subject matter hereof; provided, however, that this
Agreement does not supersede that certain Confidentiality Agreement dated July

waiver of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by each
of the Parties and specifically referencing this Agreement.

Section 14.05 Waiver. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be
deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof (whether or

only and shall not be considered a part of or affect the construction or

4.08(a) and Section 12.06(a), nothing in this Agreement shall provide any

may assign or delegate any of its rights or duties hereunder to any individual
or entity without the prior written consent of the other Party, and any

Section 14.11 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect and the Parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect their original intent
as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

Section 14.12 Interpretation. This Agreement shall be deemed and considered
for all purposes to have been jointly prepared by the Parties and shall not be
construed against any one Party (nor shall any inference or presumption be
made) on the basis of who drafted this Agreement or any particular provision
hereof, who supplied the form of Agreement, or any other event of the
negotiation, drafting, or execution of this Agreement. Each Party agrees that
this Agreement has been purposefully drawn and correctly reflects its
understanding of the transaction that it contemplates. In construing this
Agreement, the following principles will apply:

(a) A defined term has its defined meaning throughout this Agreement and each
Exhibit and Schedule to this Agreement, regardless of whether it appears
before or after the place where it is defined.

(b) If there is any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of the
main body of this Agreement and the provisions of any Exhibit or Schedule
hereto, the provisions of this Agreement shall take precedence. If there is
any conflict between the provisions of any Assignment or other transaction
documents attached to this Agreement as an Exhibit and the provisions of any
Assignment and other transaction documents actually executed by the Parties,
the provisions of the executed Assignment and other executed transaction
documents shall take precedence.





(c) Schedules and Exhibits referred to herein are hereby incorporated and made
a part of this Agreement for all purposes by such reference.

(d) The omission of certain provisions of this Agreement from the Assignment
does not constitute a conflict or inconsistency between this Agreement and the
Assignment and will not effect a merger of the omitted provisions. To the
fullest extent permitted by Laws, all provisions of this Agreement are hereby
deemed incorporated into the Assignment by reference.

(e) The words "includes" and "including" and their derivatives means
"includes, but not limited to" or "including, but not limited to," and
corresponding derivative meanings.

(f) The Article, Section, Exhibit, and Schedules references in this Agreement
refer to the Articles, Sections, Exhibits, and Schedules of this Agreement.
The headings and titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall
have no significance in interpreting this Agreement.

(g) The term "knowledge" whether or not capitalized, shall mean with respect
to (i) Seller the actual knowledge (after reasonable inquiry) of any of David
R. Macosko (Senior Vice President Accounting), Duane J. Zavadil (Senior Vice
President-Government, Regulatory Affairs), Monty D. Shed (Vice President-
Production), Mike Angus (Operations Manager, Roosevelt, Utah office) and
Dianne Rowston (Senior Landman-Business Development) and (ii) as to Buyer, the
actual knowledge (after reasonable inquiry) of any of Phil C. DeLozier (Sr. VP
Acquisitions), Ken Mariani (President and CEO, EnerVest Operating, L.L.C.) and
Steve McDaniel (Sr. VP and General Manager, EnerVest Operating, L.L.C.).

(h) The adjective "material," whether or not capitalized, shall mean a
situation, circumstance, consequence, or concept whose relevance to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as a whole is of significance and
would not be considered a small or insignificant deviation from the terms of
this Agreement.

(i) The term "Material Adverse Effect" shall mean any defect, condition,
change, or effect (other than with respect to which the Purchase Price has
been adjusted) that when taken together with all other such defects,
conditions, changes, and effects significantly diminishes the value, use,
operations, or development of the Assets taken as a whole. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the following shall not be considered in determining whether a
Material Adverse Effect has occurred:

(i) Fluctuations in commodity prices;

(ii) Changes in Laws or Environmental Laws; or





(iii) Changes in the oil and gas industry that do not have a disproportionate
impact on the ownership and operation of the Assets.

(j) "Breach" shall mean any breach of, or any falsity or inaccuracy in, any
representation or warranty or any breach of, or failure to perform or comply
with, any covenant or obligation, in or of this Agreement or any other
contract, agreement, or instrument contemplated by this Agreement, or any
event that with the passing of time or the giving or notice, or both, would
constitute such a breach, inaccuracy, or failure.

(k) "Tax" means all taxes and any other assessments, duties, fees, levies, or
other charges imposed by a Governmental Authority based on or measured by the
ownership or value of the Assets, the production of Hydrocarbons, the receipt
of proceeds with respect to such Assets or Hydrocarbons, or otherwise related
in any manner or attributable to the Assets or the production of Hydrocarbons,
including any production tax, windfall profits tax, severance tax, personal
property tax, real property tax, ad valorem tax, or excise tax together with
any interest, fine, or penalty thereon, or addition thereto.

(l) The plural shall be deemed to include the singular, and vice versa.

(m) Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, any Law defined or referred to
herein means such Law as from time to time amended, including by succession of
comparable successor Law.

Section 14.13 Time of the Essence. Time shall be of the essence with respect
to all time periods and notice periods set forth in this Agreement.

Section 14.14 Counterpart Execution. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, and each counterpart hereof shall be effective as to
each Party that executes the same whether or not all of such Parties execute
the same counterpart. If counterparts of this Agreement are executed, the
signature pages from various counterparts may be combined into one composite
instrument for all purposes. All counterparts together shall constitute only
one (1) Agreement, but each counterpart shall be considered an original. In
the event that this Agreement is delivered by facsimile transmission or by
e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format date file, such signature shall create a
valid and binding obligation of the Party executing (or on whose behalf such
signature is executed) with the same force and effect as if such facsimile or
".pdf" signature page were an original thereof.

To facilitate the execution and recording of the conveyance of the Assets from
Seller to Buyer, the Parties agree that they may execute multiple assignments
substantially in the form attached as Exhibit D, which contain only that
portion of the Assets that are located in a particular county, and all such
assignments shall constitute a single conveyance of the Assets from Seller to
Buyer.





Section 14.15 Audit Rights. Buyer, at Buyer's expense, may engage an auditing
firm to conduct an audit of the revenues and expenses of Seller attributable
to the Assets for the period of thirty-six (36) months prior to the Effective
Time through the Closing Date. Seller agrees, from the date of this Agreement
until one hundred eighty (180) days after Closing, that Seller will cooperate
and assist such auditors, including making available (at Buyer's sole cost and
expense) books, records and personnel of Seller reasonably requested by such
auditing firm.

Section 14.16 Buyer Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Parties agree that, (a) prior to and at Closing, each
Buyer shall be jointly and severally liable for Buyer's obligations and
liabilities under this Agreement and (b) after Closing, each Buyer shall be
severally, but not jointly, liable (each for its Proportionate Share) for
Buyer's obligations and liabilities under this Agreement (other than the
obligations set out in Section 10.04, for which each Buyer shall remain
jointly and severally liable).
