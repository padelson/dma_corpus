ARTICLE II

  



  

 _Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Corporations;
Exchange of Certificates; Company Stock Options_

  



  

SECTION 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the "
_Company Common Stock_ ") or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

  



  

3   

     
   

  



  

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_.  Any shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock, and any
shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub, shall be
automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

(c) _Conversion of Company Capital Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share
of Company Common Stock together with the associated Series A Preferred Stock
Purchase Rights (the " _Rights_ ") issued under the Rights Agreement, dated
as of February 25, 1999, between the Company and the U.S. Stock Transfer
Corporation, as rights agent, as amended on January 10, 2000 and September
28, 2000 (as amended, the " _Rights Agreement_ ") (other than (i) shares to
be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and (ii) any Dissenting
Shares), shall be converted into the right to receive $12.50 in cash, without
interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such
shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common
Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with
Section 2.2(b), without interest.

  



  

SECTION 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent
for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the
Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive, for the benefit of holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, the aggregate Merger Consideration to which
holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall become entitled pursuant to
Section 2.1(c). Parent shall deposit such aggregate Merger Consideration with
the Paying Agent at or prior to the Effective Time. Such aggregate Merger
Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent shall, pending its disbursement
to such holders, be invested by the Paying Agent in (i) direct obligations of
the United States of America, (ii) obligations for which the full faith and
credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment
of principal and interest, (iii) commercial paper rated the highest quality
by either MoodyÂ’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and PoorÂ’s Ratings
Services or (iv) money market funds investing solely in a combination of the
foregoing,  _provided_ that no such investment shall affect ParentÂ’s
obligation to pay the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement.

  



  

4   

     
   

  



  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form),
(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in
such form and shall have such other customary provisions (including customary
provisions with respect to delivery of an "agentÂ’s message" with respect to
shares held in book-entry form) as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions (and such other customary documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration (less any
applicable excise and withholding Taxes in accordance with Section 2.2(g)
hereof), without interest, for each share of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate
is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (x) the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and (y) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid
or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2,
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated
by this ARTICLE II, without interest.

  



  

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. The
Merger Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock upon
the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of
this ARTICLE II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificates, and at the close of business on the day on
which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time.  From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates that evidenced ownership of shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except as
otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. Subject to the
last sentence of Section 2.2(e), if, at any time after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this ARTICLE II.

  



  

5   

     
   

  



  

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, as
contemplated by this ARTICLE II.

  



  

(e) _Termination of Fund_. At any time following the first anniversary of
the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with
respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and which
have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter
such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) as general
creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration
that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates held by such holders,
as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

  



  

(g) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration
otherwise payable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "
_Code_ "), or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

  



  

SECTION 2.3 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by
a stockholder who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto
in writing) and who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of
such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting_

  



  

6   

     
   

  



  

 _Stockholders_ "), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the
right to receive the Merger Consideration (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), but
instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such
shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (and at
the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holder
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until such holder shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost rights to
appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such holderÂ’s
shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as if they had been
converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the
Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each such share of
Company Common Stock, in accordance with Section 2.1, without any
interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any
written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock,
attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to
stockholdersÂ’ rights of appraisal, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
the DGCL.

  



  

SECTION 2.4 _Company Stock Options_. Effective immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each then-outstanding option to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock, whether or not then vested or exercisable (each, an " _Option_
"), shall constitute only the right to receive a cash amount equal to the
Option Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock then subject to
the Option. As of the Effective Time, any Option with an exercise price
greater than the $12.50 per share of Company Common Stock shall be canceled
without consideration and be of no further force or effect. The Option
Consideration shall be paid as soon after the Effective Time as shall be
practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Company shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the Option Consideration otherwise
payable such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision
of state, local or foreign tax law. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Option Consideration_ " means, with respect to any share of Company Common
Stock issuable under a particular Option, an amount equal to the excess, if
any, of (i) $12.50 per share of Company Common Stock over (ii) the exercise
price payable in respect of such share of Company Common Stock issuable under
such Option. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain all
necessary waivers, consents or releases from holders of Options and take all
other action as may be necessary to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 2.4.

  



  

SECTION 2.5 _Warrants_. The Company shall take all actions necessary to
provide that each outstanding Warrant referred to in Section 3.2 hereof that
represents the right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock shall
be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive a cash amount
equal to the Warrant Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock
then subject to the Warrant, in full satisfaction of all

  



  

7   

     
   

  



  

rights under such Warrant. The Warrant Consideration shall be paid as soon
after the Closing Date as shall be practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent and the Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
Warrant Consideration otherwise payable such amounts as may be required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Warrant Consideration_ " means, with respect to any share
of Company Common Stock issuable under a particular Warrant, an amount equal
to the excess, if any, of (i) $12.50 per share of Company Common Stock over
(ii) the exercise price payable in respect of such share of Company Common
Stock issuable under such Warrant.

  



  

SECTION 2.6 _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all action necessary to (i) establish a final purchase
date under the CompanyÂ’s employee stock purchase plan (" _Company ESPP_ ") as
of a date prior to the Effective Time, and any purchase periods then in
progress shall end on such new final purchase date, (ii) immediately prior to
the Effective Time, accelerate vesting of any unvested shares issuable to
Company employees pursuant to the Company ESPP, and (iii) effect
the termination of the Company ESPP effective as of a time following such new
final purchase date but at or prior to the Effective Time. All outstanding
purchase rights under the Company ESPP shall automatically be exercised on
the new final purchase date, and each share of Company Common Stock purchased
under those exercised rights and all vested shares pursuant to the Company
ESPP shall at the Effective Time be canceled and converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c) of this
Agreement.

  



  

ARTICLE III 
  
  _Representations and Warranties of the Company_

  



  

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that except as
set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent
simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement (the "
_Company Disclosure Schedule_ "), which shall be arranged in sections
corresponding to the numbered sections of this ARTICLE III (it being
understood that any matter set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall
be deemed disclosed with respect to any section of this ARTICLE III to
which the matter relates, to the extent the relevance of such matter to such
section is reasonably apparent on its face):

  



  

SECTION 3.1 _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_.

  



  

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite
corporate power and authority necessary to own or lease all of its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The
Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or
the character or location of the properties and assets owned or

  



  

8   

     
   

  



  

leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where
the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined below)
on the Company (" _Company Material Adverse Effect_ "). For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Material Adverse Effect_ " shall mean, with respect to any
party, any change, event, circumstance, development or occurrence which has,
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on (x) the
results of operations or financial condition of such party and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (y) the ability of the party to consummate
the Transactions; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any adverse change,
event, circumstance, development or occurrence arising out of, resulting from
or attributable to the following shall not be deemed either alone or
in combination to constitute, and none of the following shall be taken
into account in determining whether there has been or will be, a Material
Adverse Effect: (i) changes in conditions in the United States or global
economy or capital or financial markets generally, including changes in
interest or exchange rates, provided that such changes do not affect such
party and its Subsidiaries in a disproportionately adverse manner, (ii)
changes in general legal, regulatory, political, economic or business
conditions or changes in generally accepted accounting principles that, in
each case, generally affect industries in which such party and its
Subsidiaries conduct business, provided that such changes do not affect such
party and its Subsidiaries in a disproportionately adverse manner, (iii) the
negotiation, execution, announcement or performance of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transactions, including the impact thereof on
relationships, contractual or otherwise, with customers, suppliers,
distributors, partners or employees, (iv) any action taken by the Company or
its Subsidiaries as expressly permitted by this Agreement or with ParentÂ’s
prior consent or (v) any decline in the market price, or change in trading
volume, of the capital stock of such party or any failure to meet publicly
announced revenue or earnings projections, _provided_ , _however_ , that the
exception set forth in (v) above shall not in any way prevent or
otherwise affect a determination that any change, event, circumstance,
development or effect underlying such decline or failure has resulted in, or
contributed to, a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(b) Each of the CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization
(or, with respect to the CompanyÂ’s foreign Subsidiaries, similar concepts
under applicable foreign law if applicable) and has all requisite corporate
power and authority necessary to own or lease all of its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of the
CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing (or, with respect to the CompanyÂ’s foreign Subsidiaries, similar
concepts under applicable foreign law if applicable) in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location
of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
All the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in,
each such Subsidiary (except for directorsÂ’ qualifying shares or the like)
are owned directly or indirectly by the Company free and clear of all liens,
pledges, security

  



  

9   

     
   

  



  

interests, transfer restrictions, mortgages, assessments, claims, charges and
other encumbrances of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, " _Liens_
"), except for such transfer restrictions of general applicability as may be
provided under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Securities Act_ "), and other
applicable securities Laws. The Company does not own, directly or indirectly,
any capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, any Person
other than its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(c) The Company has delivered or made available to Parent complete and
correct copies of (i) the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Company, as amended to the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Charter
Documents_ ") and (ii) the minutes of all meetings of the stockholders, the
Board of Directors and each committee of the Boards of Directors of the
Company held since January 1, 2003.

  



  

SECTION 3.2 _Capitalization_.

  



  

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 20,000,000 shares
of Company Common Stock and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value
$0.001 per share (" _Company Preferred Stock_ ").  At the close of business
on July 22, 2005, (i) 9,858,706 shares of Company Common Stock were issued
and outstanding (of which 652,729 shares of Company Common Stock were held by

subject to outstanding Options granted under the Company Stock Plans), (iii)
no shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued or outstanding and (iv)
1,287,000 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon
exercise of the warrants listed in Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure

authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights, and were issued in compliance with all
applicable securities laws. Since March 31, 2005, the Company has not issued
any shares of its capital stock or any securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for any shares of its capital stock, other than
or pursuant to (i) options and Warrants referred to above that are
outstanding as of the date of this Agreement or are hereafter issued without
violation of Section 5.2 hereof or (ii) shares of Company Common Stock
purchased pursuant to the Company ESPP.

  



  

(b) Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete
and accurate list of all holders of Options, indicating with respect to each
Option, the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Option,
the exercise price, the date of grant and the expiration date thereof.
 Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule also sets forth a
complete and accurate list of all holders of Warrants, indicating with
respect to each Warrant, the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Warrant, the exercise price and the date of grant. The Company has
delivered or made available to Parent accurate and complete copies of all

  



  

10   

     
   

  



  

Warrants, Company Stock Plans, the standard forms of stock option agreement
evidencing Options and any stock option agreements evidencing an Option that
deviates in any material manner from the CompanyÂ’s standard forms of stock
option agreement.

  



  

SECTION 3.3 _Authority; Noncontravention; Voting Requirements_.

  



  

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and, subject only to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate
the Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of
this Agreement, and the consummation by it of the Transactions, have been
duly authorized and approved by its Board of Directors, and except
for obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, no other corporate action on
the part of the Company is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery
and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by it
of the Transactions. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
the Company and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by
the other parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation
of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
except that such enforceability (i) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of
general application affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditorsÂ’
rights generally and (ii) is subject to general principles of equity, whether
considered in a proceeding at law or in equity (the " _Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception_ ").

unanimously (i) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the
Transactions, including the Merger, and (ii) resolved, subject to Section 5.3
hereof, to recommend that stockholders of the Company adopt this Agreement

the Company with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i) conflict
with or violate any provision of the Company Charter Documents or the
charter, bylaws, memorandum or articles of association or other
organizational document of any Subsidiary of the Company, or (ii) assuming

and the Company Stockholder Approval are obtained and the filings referred to

benefit) under, require a consent or waiver under, constitute a change of
control under, require the payment of a penalty under or result in the

is in material breach or material default, and no event has occurred that
with notice or lapse of time would constitute a material breach or material
default by the Company or, to the Knowledge of the Company, by any such other

acceleration of any obligation or loss of any material benefit under a
Material Contract.

SECTION 5.3 _Other Offers; Etc._

  



  

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause its and its SubsidiariesÂ’ respective
directors, officers and investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other
advisors or representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, (i)
cease any discussions or negotiations that may be ongoing as of the date of
this Agreement with any Person with respect to a Takeover Proposal and (ii)
request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries previously furnished to
such Person. The Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, or authorize or permit any of its Representatives, directly
or indirectly, to (i) solicit, initiate, induce or knowingly encourage any
inquiries that constitute, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Takeover Proposal or (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in
any discussions or negotiations with any third party regarding, or furnish to
any Person any non-public information or data, or afford access to the
properties, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, with
respect to, any inquiries that constitute, or may reasonably be expected to
lead to, a Takeover Proposal, or otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort to
attempt to make or implement any Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if prior to the Effective Time the Company Board of Directors
receives a Takeover Proposal that was not solicited, initiated, induced or
knowingly encouraged in violation of this Section 5.3 that the Company Board
of Directors (i) determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that failing to take action on such Takeover Proposal
is reasonably likely to cause the Company Board of Directors to violate its
fiduciary duties under applicable Laws, and (ii) determines after
consultation with its financial advisor that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal,
then the Company may (x) furnish any information with respect to the Company
and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal pursuant to
a customary confidentiality agreement (which confidentiality agreement
contains terms that are equivalent to, and in no respect less favorable to
the Company than, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in
Section 5.6 hereof), (y) participate in discussions and negotiations with
such Person regarding that Takeover Proposal and (z) enter into the
confidentiality agreement contemplated by clause (x) of this sentence. A copy
of all of the information provided to such Person shall be delivered or made
available promptly to Parent if it has not been previously furnished or made
available to Parent.

  



  

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.3(b), neither the Company
Board of Directors, nor any committee thereof, shall (i)(A) withdraw or
modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent, the Company Board Recommendation or (B) recommend or propose
publicly to recommend, to the stockholders of the Company the approval or
adoption of any Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i)
being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii)
approve, adopt or propose publicly to approve or adopt, any Takeover
Proposal, or withdraw its approval of the Merger, or propose publicly to
withdraw its approval of the Merger, or (iii) cause,

  



  

28   

     
   

  



  

authorize or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principal,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement, or any similar agreement, with respect to
any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement permitted by
Section 5.3(a) above) (each, a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) the Company Board of Directors may
withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation, or recommend a Takeover
Proposal, if such Board determines in good faith, based on those matters as
it deems appropriate, after consulting with outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action is reasonably likely to cause the Company Board
of Directors to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable law, and (y) if
the Company Board of Directors receives a Takeover Proposal that such Board
determines in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company or its
Subsidiaries may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i)
and concurrently enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal, _provided_ , _that_ , with respect to any termination
pursuant to clause (y), the Company shall have complied with its obligations
under this Section 5.3 since the date of this Agreement and the Company pays
Parent the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.3 hereof concurrent with
(and as a condition of) such termination, and _provided_ , _further_ , that
prior to such termination (A) the Company shall have given Parent written
notice that it intends to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(c)(i), identifying the Takeover Proposal then determined to be a Superior
Proposal and the parties thereto and delivering a summary of the material
terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal and (B) within four business
days after the Company has provided the notice referred to in the previous
clause (A), Parent does not make a binding written offer that the Company
Board of Directors concludes in good faith is more favorable to Company
stockholders than the Takeover Proposal determined to be a Superior Proposal.

  



  

(c) For purposes of this Agreement:

  



  

" _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person
(other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) relating to, in one or any series of
transactions with such Person, any (i) acquisition of assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (including securities of Subsidiaries, but excluding
sales of assets in the ordinary course of business) equal to 15% or more of
the CompanyÂ’s consolidated assets or to which 15% or more of the CompanyÂ’s
revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable, (ii)
acquisition of 15% or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock, (iii)
tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person
beneficially owning 15% or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock or
(iv) merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
the Company; in each case, other than the Transactions.

  



  

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a proposal to acquire, directly or indirectly,
for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, more than 50% of the

the Company and its

  



  

29   

     
   

  



  

Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, made by a third party, and which is
otherwise on terms and conditions which the Company Board of Directors
determines in its good faith and reasonable judgment (after consultation with
a financial advisor of national reputation, taking into account the Person
making the offer, the consideration offered, the likelihood and timing of
consummation (including the legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the
offer), the payment of the Termination Fee, as well as other factors deemed
relevant by the Company Board of Directors) to be more favorable to the
CompanyÂ’s stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger and the
other Transactions.

  



  

(d) Nothing in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit the Company Board of Directors
from taking and disclosing to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or other applicable Law, if such Board
determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to
so disclose such position could constitute a violation of applicable Law. In
addition, it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this Agreement
(including ARTICLE VII), a factually accurate public statement by the Company
that describes the CompanyÂ’s receipt of a Takeover Proposal and the operation
of this Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed a withdrawal or
modification, or proposal by the Company Board of Directors to withdraw
or modify, the Company Board Recommendation, or an approval
or recommendation or neutral position with respect to such Takeover Proposal.

  



  

SECTION 5.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
parties hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best
efforts to promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or
cause to be done, all things, necessary, proper or advisable to cause the
conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable and to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,
the Transactions, including preparing and filing promptly and fully all
documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions,
statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other
documents (including any required or recommended filings under applicable
Antitrust Laws), and (ii) obtain all approvals, consents, registrations,
permits, authorizations and other confirmations from any Governmental
Authority or third party necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Transactions. For purposes hereof, " _Antitrust Laws_ " means the Sherman
Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, all applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws and all
other applicable Laws issued by a Governmental Authority that are designed or
intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition
through merger or acquisition.

  



  

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each party
hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly as
practicable and in any event

  



  

30   

     
   

  



  

within ten business days of the date hereof and to supply as promptly as
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act and, subject to the provisions of Section
5.4(d) below, use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all other actions consistent with this Section 5.4 necessary to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
as soon as practicable; and (ii) the Company and Parent shall each use its
reasonable best efforts to (x) take all action necessary to ensure that no
state takeover statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable to any of the
Transactions and (y) if any state takeover statute or similar Law becomes
applicable to any of the Transactions, take all action necessary to ensure
that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise minimize the effect of
such Law on the Transactions.

  



  

(c) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions
and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a
Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, including any proceeding
initiated by a private party, and (ii) keep the other party informed in all
material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any material
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the
Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice, or any other Governmental Authority and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, in each case regarding any of the Transactions. Subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, each of the parties
hereto shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult the other on, all the information relating to
the other parties and their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that
appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third
party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions.

  



  

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 5.4, each of the parties hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted by a Governmental Authority or other Person with respect to the
Transactions. Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable best
efforts to (i) avoid the entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any
decree, order or judgment that would restrain, prevent or delay the
consummation of the Transactions, on or before the Walk-Away Date, including
by defending through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court
by any Person, and (ii) avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under
any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with
respect to the Transactions so as to enable the consummation of the
Transactions to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event
no later than the Walk-Away Date), _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.4 shall
require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to (x) propose, negotiate for,
commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise,
the sale, divestiture or disposition of any

  



  

31   

     
   

  



  

material assets or businesses of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or any assets or businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries the
sale, divestiture or disposition of which would reasonably be expected to
result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, or (y) otherwise take or commit
to take any actions that limit the freedom of action of Parent and its
Subsidiaries with respect to, or their ability to retain, their material
assets or one or more of their businesses, or the material assets or
businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the
Surviving Corporation.

  



  

SECTION 5.5 _Public Announcements_. Each of Parent and the Company shall
issue a press release with respect to the execution of this Agreement,
_provided_ , _that_ , the prior approval of the press release from the other
party is obtained (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Thereafter, neither the Company nor Parent shall
issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public
announcement (to the extent not previously issued or made in accordance with
this Agreement) with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or the other
Transactions without the prior consent of the other party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may be required by
Law, applicable fiduciary duties or by any applicable listing agreement with
a national securities exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market (in which case such
party shall not issue or cause the publication of such press release or other
public announcement without prior consultation with the other party).

  



  

SECTION 5.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company shall afford to
Parent and ParentÂ’s representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours to the CompanyÂ’s properties, books, contracts, agreements and
records and the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent (i) a copy of each
report, schedule and other document filed by it pursuant to the requirements
of Federal or state securities Laws and (ii) other information concerning its
business and properties as Parent may reasonably request;
_provided, however_ , that the Company shall not be obligated to provide
such access or information if the Company determines, in its reasonable
judgment, that doing so would jeopardize the protection of an attorney-
client privilege. Until the Effective Time, the information provided will be
subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of April 22,
2005, between Parent and the Company (as it may be amended from time to time,
the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

  



  

SECTION 5.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions or from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication or the
failure of such party to obtain such consent could be material to
the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent and (ii) any actions,
suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partyÂ’s
knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the
Transactions.

SECTION 5.8 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Company and the Surviving Corporation to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless
each individual who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the
Effective Time was, a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or
of a Subsidiary of the Company (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively,
the " _Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses,
damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in
settlement or compromise) and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal
counsel) in connection with any claim, suit, action, proceeding or
investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative),
whenever asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or in part, acts or
omissions by an Indemnitee in the IndemniteeÂ’s capacity as a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the
request of the Company or such Subsidiary (including in connection with
serving at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another Person (including any employee benefit
plan)), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time (including in
connection with the Transactions), to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, and (ii) assume all obligations of the Company and such
Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of indemnification and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time as provided in (x) the Company Charter Documents and the organizational
documents of such Subsidiaries as currently in effect and (y) the
indemnification agreements listed on Section 5.8 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, which shall survive the Transactions and continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their respective terms. Without limiting the
foregoing, Parent, from and after the Effective Time, shall cause the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to
contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to
limitation of liabilities of directors and officers and indemnification than
are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the Company Charter
Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
the Indemnitees. In addition, from and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Company and the Surviving Corporation to, pay any
expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) of any Indemnitee
under this Section 5.8 (including in connection with enforcing the indemnity
and other obligations provided for in this Section 5.8) as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, provided that the person to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances to
the extent required by applicable Law.

  



  

(b) For the six-year period commencing immediately after the Effective Time,
Parent shall maintain in effect the CompanyÂ’s current directorsÂ’ and
officersÂ’ liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time with respect to those persons who are currently
(and any additional persons who prior to the Effective Time become) covered
by the CompanyÂ’s directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance policy on terms
with respect to such coverage, and in amount, not less favorable to such
individuals than those of such policy in effect on the

  



  

33   

     
   

  



  

date hereof (or Parent may substitute therefor policies, including a tail
policy, issued by reputable insurers, providing at least the same coverage
with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time);
_provided, however_ , that, if the aggregate annual premiums for such
insurance shall exceed 300% of the current aggregate annual premium, then
Parent shall provide or cause to be provided a policy for the applicable
individuals with the best coverage as shall then be available at an annual
premium of 300% of the current aggregate annual premium.

  



  

(c) The provisions of this Section 5.8 are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such Person may have by contract, agreement or otherwise.  The
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
5.8 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.8 applies unless
(x) such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the
affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such termination or
modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this
Section 5.8 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.8).

  



  

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations thereof set forth in this Section 5.8.

  



  

SECTION 5.9 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as provided in Section 7.3, all fees
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions
shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not
the Transactions are consummated.

  



  

SECTION 5.10 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
and Parent shall take such steps as may be reasonably requested by any party
hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including
derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to
be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance
with that certain No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC
regarding such matters.

  



  

SECTION 5.11 _Employee Matters_. With respect to any individual employed by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at the Closing Date (the " _Company
Employees_ "), Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide such
Company Employee with the following compensation and benefits for the time
during the 12 month period immediately following the Closing Date that such
Company Employee is

  



  

34   

     
   

  



  

employed by the Surviving Corporation (or any of its Subsidiaries): (i) base
salary and annual bonus targets equal to the level of base salary and annual
bonus target amounts for such Company Employees as in effect on the Closing
Date, (ii) employee benefit plans, programs, contracts and arrangements that
are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the employee benefit plans,
programs, contracts and arrangements provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries to Company Employees prior to the Closing Date, as well as, for
any Company Employee who does not have contractual severance benefits,
severance benefits that are consistent with ParentÂ’s severance practices with
employees of Parent that are similarly situated to the affected Company
Employee with respect to skills, responsibilities and job scope, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this Section 5.11 shall be construed as any
guarantee of employment or any obligation of Parent, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation to continue the employment of any Company Employee for
any period of time after the Closing. Parent or one of its affiliates
shall recognize the service of Company Employees with the Company prior to
the Closing Date as service with Parent and its affiliates in connection with
any Tax-qualified pension plan, 401(k) savings plan, cafeteria plan,
welfare benefit plans and policies (including vacations and holiday
policies) maintained by Parent or one of its affiliates which is made
available following the Closing Date by Parent or one of its affiliates for
purposes of any waiting period, vesting, eligibility and benefit entitlement;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that with respect to any defined benefit pension
plan maintained by Parent or one of its affiliates in which such Company
Employee participates following the Closing Date, such service credit shall
be measured from the earliest date that such employee commenced participation
in a Tax-qualified pension or savings plan maintained by the Company or one
of its affiliates.  Parent shall (i) waive, or cause its insurance carriers
to waive, all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, if any, with respect
to participation and coverage requirements applicable to Company Employees
under any welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA)
which is made available to Company Employees following the Closing Date by
Parent or one of its affiliates, and (ii) provide credit to Company Employees
for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such
employees under the employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements of the
Company and its Subsidiaries during the portion of the relevant plan year
including the Closing Date.

  



  

SECTION 5.12 _Delisting_. Parent shall cause the CompanyÂ’s securities to be
de-listed from the Nasdaq Stock Market and de-registered under the Exchange
Act as soon as practicable following the Effective Time.

  



  

SECTION 5.13 _Termination of Plans_. Effective as of no later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date and contingent on the Closing, the
Company shall cause to be terminated any and all Company Plans intended to
include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (each, a " _401(k) Plan_ ") (unless
Parent provides written notice to the Company that such 401(k) Plans shall
not be terminated).  Unless Parent provides such written notice to the
Company no later than five business days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such 401(k) Plan(s) have been
terminated (effective as of the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the

  



  

35   

     
   

  



  

Board of Directors of the Company. The form and substance of such
resolutions shall be subject to prior review of Parent. The Company also shall
take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such 401(k) Plan(s) as
Parent may reasonably request. In the event that termination of a 401(k)
Plan would reasonably be anticipated to trigger liquidation charges,
surrender charges or other fees then the Company shall take such actions as
are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees
and provide such estimate in writing to Parent no later than 15 calendar days
prior to the Closing Date.

be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable;
_provided, however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this

SECTION 8.1 _No Survival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any certificate

shall (i) survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms
and (ii) terminate as of the Effective Time.

  



  

SECTION 8.2 _Amendment or Supplement_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects,
whether before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, by
written agreement of the parties hereto, by action taken by their respective

Company Stockholder Approval, there shall be no amendment or change to the
provisions hereof which by Law would require further approval by the
stockholders of the Company without such stockholder approval.

  



  

SECTION 8.3 _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc_. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, any party may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any
inaccuracies in

  



  

40   

     
   

  



  

the representations and warranties of any other party hereto, (b) extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of any
other party hereto or (c) waive compliance by any other party with any of
the agreements or conditions contained herein.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in
exercising any right hereunder shall impair such right or operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial waiver or extension preclude any
other or further waiver or extension or the exercise of any other right
hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of such party.

  



  

SECTION 8.4 _Assignment_.  Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties.  Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.  Any purported assignment not permitted under this Section
shall be null and void.

  



  

SECTION 8.5 _Counterparts_.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall
become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of
the parties and delivered to the other parties.

  



  

SECTION 8.6 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement, together with the Company Disclosure Schedule and the
Confidentiality Agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede
all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, by or
among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof and (b) except for the provisions of ARTICLE II and Section 5.8
and Section 5.10 are not intended to and shall not confer upon any Person
other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.

  



  

SECTION 8.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the internal laws of the State of Delaware, applicable to contracts executed
in and to be performed entirely within that State without giving effect to
any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether in the state of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws
of any jurisdiction other than the state of Delaware.

  



  

(b) All actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement
shall be heard and determined in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware,
and the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such court (and, in the case of appeals, appropriate
appellate courts therefrom) in any such action or proceeding and irrevocably
waive the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such
action, proceeding or claim. Each party hereto agrees not to

  



  

41   

     
   

  



  

bring any action, proceeding or claim arising out of or relating to this
Agreement in any other Court. The consents to jurisdiction set forth in this
paragraph shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the
State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided
in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person
other than the parties hereto.  The parties hereto agree that a final
judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by applicable law.

  



  

(c) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives any and all rights
to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or related to this
Agreement.

  



  

SECTION 8.8 _Specific Enforcement_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any
and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware, without bond or
other security being required, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

  



  

SECTION 8.9 _Notices_.  All notices, requests and other communications to

SECTION 8.10 _Severability_.  If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other terms, provisions and conditions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect.  Upon such determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto agree that the court making such determination
shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete specific words
or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with
a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event such
court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the
parties hereto agree to negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.
