        (b) As soon as reasonably practicable on the Closing Date, and subject
to the provisions of this Agreement, the Company and Merger Sub will file a
certificate of merger meeting the requirements of the Delaware Law with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Merger shall become effective
at such time as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as the Company and Merger
Sub may agree and specify in the certificate of merger (such time as the Merger
becomes effective, the "Effective Time").

        (c) The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the Delaware Law.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges
and franchises and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities,
restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger Sub, all as provided
under the Delaware Law.

        (d) The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place (i) at
the offices of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP located at One New
York Plaza, New York, New York, as soon as practicable (but in any event no

     Section 2.2 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, pursuant to
this Agreement and by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holders of the Common Stock:

        (a) Each share of Common Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or
owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time, if any, shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no payment or distribution shall be made or delivered with respect
thereto.

        (b) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
newly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation, and the foregoing shall constitute the only outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

Effective Time, other than Common Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section
2.2(a) and, subject to Section 9.2 of this Agreement, Dissenting Shares,
automatically shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, payable to the holder thereof upon surrender of the stock
certificate formerly representing such Common Share in the manner provided in
Section 2.4. Such Common Shares, other than those canceled pursuant to Section
2.2(a), sometimes are referred to herein as the "Merger Shares."



                                       10
<PAGE>

        (d) If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
number of outstanding Common Shares is changed into a different number of shares
or a different class by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or
the like, other than pursuant to the Merger, the amount of Merger Consideration
payable per Common Share shall be correspondingly adjusted.

        (e) The Company Options shall be treated as provided in Section 2.5
below.

     Section 2.3 Escrow Fund. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent, the
Company and the stockholders of the Company who have submitted a letter of
transmittal prior to such time shall enter into an indemnification and escrow
agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the
"Indemnification and Escrow Agreement") with a bank or trust company that is
reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "Escrow Agent"). At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent will cause the Escrow Amount to be deposited with the
Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Indemnification
and Escrow Agreement, which shall represent a portion of the Merger
Consideration payable to each holder of Merger Shares and of the amounts payable
to each holder of Company Options in accordance with this Article II. The Escrow
Amount will be held and disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the Indemnification and Escrow Agreement.

     Section 2.4 Payment of Cash for Merger Shares.

        (a) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company, that is organized and
doing business under the laws of the United States or any state thereof to serve
as the disbursing agent for the Initial Per Share Consideration and payments in
respect of Company Options (the "Disbursing Agent"). At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent will cause to be deposited with the Disbursing Agent cash
in the amount equal to the difference between Aggregate Merger Consideration and
the Escrow Amount. Pending distribution of the cash deposited with the
Disbursing Agent and subject to the completion of the Merger, such cash shall be
held in trust for the benefit of the holders of Merger Shares and such Company
Options and shall not be used for any other purposes; provided however, that
Parent may direct the Disbursing Agent to invest such cash in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America, as long as no such investments have
maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to Section
2.4(b) or Section 2.5 hereof.

        (b) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall send, or cause the Disbursing Agent to send, to each record holder
of Merger Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time a letter of
transmittal and instructions for exchanging their Merger Shares for the Initial
Per Share Consideration payable therefor. The letter of transmittal will be in
customary form (except that it will include an agreement to be bound by the
terms of the Indemnification and Escrow Agreement) and will specify that
delivery of Merger Shares will be effected, and risk of loss and title will
pass, only upon delivery of the stock certificates representing the Merger
Shares to the Disbursing Agent. In addition to the terms and conditions set
forth in this Section 2.4, the letter of transmittal will include other
customary terms and conditions applicable to the surrender of stock certificates
and payment of the Merger Consideration, including, without limitation, as may
be required under the Delaware Law. Upon surrender of such stock certificate or
certificates to the Disbursing Agent together with a properly completed and duly
executed letter of transmittal and any other documentation as the Disbursing
Agent may reasonably require, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to
receive the Initial Per Share Consideration payable in exchange therefor, less
any amounts required to be withheld under any applicable Tax Law. As promptly as
practicable after such surrender to the Disbursing Agent, the Disbursing Agent
shall pay to the record holder thereof complying with the forgoing, the Initial
Per Share Consideration payable in exchange for the Merger Shares so
surrendered, less any amounts required to be withheld under any applicable Tax
Law. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender
of the certificates representing the Merger Shares. Until so surrendered and
exchanged, each such certificate shall, after the Effective Time, be deemed to
represent only the right, subject to Section 2.3, to receive the Merger
Consideration, and until such surrender and exchange, no cash shall be paid to
the holder of such outstanding certificate in respect thereof.



                                       11
<PAGE>

        (c) If payment is to be made to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Merger Shares represented by the certificate or certificates
surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition to such payment that
the certificate or certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall pay to the Parent or Disbursing Agent (as the case may be) any
applicable stock transfer taxes or establish to the satisfaction of the Parent
or Disbursing Agent (as the case may be) that such stock transfer taxes have
been paid or are not payable.

        (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Common Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, certificates representing Merger Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, such shares shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration
provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article
II.

        (e) If any cash deposited with the Disbursing Agent remains unclaimed
six months after the Effective Time, such cash shall be returned to the
Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any such holder who has not surrendered
his Merger Shares certificates for the Initial Per Share Consideration prior to
that time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of
the Merger Consideration, but only as general creditors thereof for payment of
their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to
any holder of Merger Shares for an amount paid to a public official pursuant to
any applicable unclaimed property laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by
holders of Merger Shares two years after the Effective Time (or, if earlier, as
of a date immediately prior to such time that such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority), shall to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

        (f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate for Common Shares.



                                       12
<PAGE>

        (g) From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Common Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Common Shares, other than the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in this Agreement.

        (h) In the event that any Merger Share certificate has been lost, stolen
or destroyed, and upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Merger Share certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, in
addition to the posting by such holder of any bond in such reasonable amount as
the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Merger Share
certificate, the Disbursing Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Merger Share certificate the proper amount of the Initial Per Share
Consideration.

     Section 2.5 Treatment of Options.

        (a) As of the Effective Time, each Company Option will be canceled, and
the holder thereof will receive an amount equal to the Initial Per Option
Consideration times the number of Common Shares subject to the Company Option,
without interest and less any amounts required to be deducted and withheld under
any applicable Tax Law. An amount equal to the Aggregate Option Escrow Amount
shall be held and disbursed in accordance with Section 2.3. All payments of the
Initial Per Option Consideration with respect to canceled Company Options shall
be made by the Disbursing Agent as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no
event more than five Business Days, after the Effective Time from funds
deposited with the Disbursing Agent by or at the direction of Parent to pay such
amounts.

        (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company (i) will cause the
Company's stock option plans to be terminated effective at or prior to the
Effective Time and to otherwise make any amendments permitted by such plans and
the agreements thereunder to the terms of such stock option plans or the grants
made thereunder necessary to effectuate the actions contemplated by this Section
2.5 and (ii) will effectuate the actions contemplated by this Section 2.5. As
soon as reasonably practicable, but not later than five Business Days, after,
and effective as of, the date of this Agreement, the Company will amend the
Company's stock option plans to preclude the grant of any additional stock
options or other awards thereunder.

     Section 2.6 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, but subject to Section 9.2 of this Agreement, Common
Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and which are held by holders of such Common Shares who have properly exercised
appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with Section 262 of the
Delaware Law ("Dissenting Shares") will not be exchangeable for the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting Shares will be
entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Common Shares in
accordance with the provisions of such Section 262 unless and until such holders
fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or lose their rights to appraisal and
payment under the Delaware Law. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder
fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such rights, such Common
Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and to have
become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, subject to Section 2.3, without any interest thereon. The Company
will give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisals of Common Shares prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect
to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

     Section 2.7 Effect of Withholding. To the extent any amounts are required
to be deducted and withheld under any applicable Tax Law pursuant to Section
2.3, Section 2.4(b) or Section 2.5(a), such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes as having been paid to the holder from whose Merger
Consideration or payments with respect to Company Options the amounts were so
deducted and withheld.

        (b) Except as set forth in Section 4.10 of the Disclosure Letter, the
Company and its Subsidiaries have not requested any extension of time within

        (j) Except as set forth in Section 4.10 of the Disclosure Letter, none
of the Company and its Subsidiaries will be required to include any material
item of income in, or exclude any material item of deduction from, taxable

as a result of any: (i) change in method of accounting elected prior to the

Regulations under Section 1502 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar
provision of state, local or foreign income Tax law) accrued prior to the

to the Closing Date; or (v) prepaid amount received prior to the Closing Date.

        (k) Since January 1, 1998 neither the Company nor any of its

     Section 4.11 ERISA.

        (a) Section 4.11(a) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth a list
identifying (i) each material Employee Benefit Plan and (ii) each Material
Employee Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Employee Benefit
Plan" means each employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of
ERISA), whether or not subject to ERISA, and each bonus, stock option, stock
purchase or other equity based, incentive, deferred compensation, supplemental
retirement, health, life, disability or other welfare, dependent care,
severance, change in control, retention, termination and other similar employee
or retiree compensation or benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement
maintained, contributed to or required to be contributed to by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or in respect of which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries may have any material liability, whether absolute or contingent,
direct or indirect.

        (b) Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates sponsors,
maintains, contributes to or has an obligation to contribute to any
multiemployer plan (within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA), whether or
not subject to ERISA, or any plan sponsored by more than one employer within the
meaning of Sections 4063 or 4064 of ERISA or Section 413(c) of the Code, whether
or not subject to ERISA.

        (c) Except as otherwise set forth in Section 4.11(c) of the Disclosure
Letter, each Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has received a determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service regarding its tax qualified status and covering all Tax Laws
prior to the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, and the
Company has no Knowledge that anything has occurred since the date of such most
recent Internal Revenue Service determination letter or condition exists that
could be reasonably expected to adversely affect the tax-qualified status of any
such Plan. Each Employee Benefit Plan intended to qualify for any special tax
treatment under applicable Tax Laws other than the Code meets all requirements
for such treatment and, to the Company's Knowledge, has timely received all
required certificates and approvals of any Governmental Authority. Each Employee
Benefit Plan has been maintained in compliance with its terms and with the
requirements prescribed by any and all Laws that are applicable to such Employee
Benefit Plan, except for any failures to comply that, individually and in the
aggregate, would not have or result in any material liability to the Company and
its Subsidiaries.

<PAGE>

        (d) No Employee Benefit Plan or Employee Agreement provides for the
payment of any amount or benefit and there is no other contract, agreement, plan
or arrangement covering any current or former director, shareholder, officer or
employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates that, individually or
collectively, could give rise to the payment of any amount or benefit that would
not be deductible under Section 280G or 162(m) of the Code or the comparable
provisions of any Tax Law of a jurisdiction other than the United States.

        (e) Except as disclosed in Section 4.11(e) of the Disclosure Letter, no
payment, accrual of additional compensation or benefits, acceleration of any
payments, compensation or benefits, vesting in any compensation or benefits or
funding of any compensation or benefits under any Employee Benefit Plan,
Employee Agreement or similar plan, contract, agreement or arrangement will be
caused, directly or indirectly, by the Company's entering into this Agreement or
by the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either
alone or together with any other event).

        (f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates
has incurred or reasonably expects to incur any material liability pursuant to
Title IV of ERISA or the comparable provisions of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the United States and, to the Company's Knowledge, no event,
transaction or condition exists or has occurred that could reasonably be
expected to result in the incurrence of any such liability. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates has incurred or reasonably
expects to incur any liability pursuant to Title I of ERISA, the penalty or
excise tax provisions of the Code relating to employee benefit plans or the
comparable provisions of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the United
States that remains outstanding that could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Neither the execution of this Agreement
nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will require (i)
notice to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any Governmental Authority
with respect to employee benefits or other matters of any jurisdiction other
than the United States or (ii) consent of any union or works council or other
labor representative.

        (g) All contributions, premiums and expenses required to be paid
pursuant to the terms of any Employee Benefit Plan, Employee Agreement or Law
prior to the date hereof have been timely paid, except where the failure to do
so would not be reasonably expected to result in any material liability to the
Company.

Insurance Policies are in full force and effect and, to the Company's Knowledge,
no event has occurred which, with notice or the lapse of time, would constitute
a breach or default under any Insurance Policy, or which would permit
termination, material modification, or acceleration under any Insurance Policy.
All premiums payable with respect to such Insurance Policies that are due and
payable as of the date hereof have been paid. Except as set forth on in Section
4.17 of the Disclosure Letter, there is no material pending claim (excluding any
workers' compensation claim) under any Insurance Policy. The Company has not
received any written notice indicating that any insurance will not be renewed or
that the issuer of any Insurance Policy is not willing or able to perform its
obligations thereunder. To the Company's Knowledge, the Insurance Policies of
the Company are sufficient for compliance, in all material respects, with all
applicable legal requirements and contracts to which the Company is a party or
by which it is bound.

dates, none of such reports shall contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The audited consolidated financial statements and
unaudited interim financial statements of the Company included in such reports

the approval of the Merger and that appraisal rights are available. The Company
shall take such other steps as are necessary under such Section, including the

will be received by the Company prior to the Effective Time.

                       COVENANTS OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

     Section 7.1 Director and Officer Liability.

        (a) The Surviving Corporation shall, and after the Effective Time Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, comply with all of the Company's and
its respective Subsidiaries' obligations to indemnify and hold harmless
(including any obligations to advance funds for expenses) the present and former
officers and directors thereof in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior
to the Effective Time to the extent provided under the Company's or such
Subsidiaries' respective organizational and governing documents in effect on the
date hereof, and such obligations shall survive the Merger and shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with the terms of the Surviving
Corporation's certificate of incorporation and bylaws from the Effective Time
until the expiration of the applicable statue of limitations with respect to any
claims against such directors or officers arising out of such acts or omissions.
Any determination required to be made with respect to whether the conduct of an
individual seeking indemnification has complied with the standards set forth
under applicable Law shall be made by independent counsel mutually acceptable to
the Surviving Corporation and such individual. For a period of six years after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in
effect the current policies of officers' and directors' liability insurance
maintained by the Company and its respective Subsidiaries (the "Current
Policies"); provided however, that the Surviving Corporation may, and in the
event of the cancellation or termination of such policies the Surviving
Corporation shall, substitute such policies with equally reputable and
financially sound carriers and that are reasonably satisfactory to the covered
persons providing at least the same coverage and amount and containing terms and
conditions that are no less favorable to the covered persons (the "Replacement
Policies") in respect of claims arising from facts or events that existed or
occurred prior to the Effective Time under the Current Policies; provided
further however, that in no event will the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend annually in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently paid by the
Company for such coverage (or to provide more than that amount of coverage as is
available for no more than 300% of such current annual premium); provided
further however, that in lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, with the
consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), the
Company may purchase "tail" insurance coverage that provides coverage no less
favorable than the coverage described above.

        (b) This Section 7.1 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, present or
former directors or officers of the Company or its Subsidiaries, their
respective heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on the
Surviving Corporation, Parent and their respective successors and assigns, and
the agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be
exclusive of any other rights to which any such present or former director or
officer is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise. Nothing in
this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or
impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance claims under any policy
that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors and employees, it being
understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 7.1
is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under any such policies.

        (c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity or (ii) transfers or conveys
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then and in each
case to the extent reasonably necessary, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 7.1.

                            COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES

     The parties hereto agree that:

     Section 8.1 Reasonable Best Efforts. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each party will (and will cause its Affiliates to) use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, to file, or
cause to be filed, all documents and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including but not limited to obtaining all necessary consents,
waivers, approvals, authorizations, Permits or orders from all Governmental
Authorities or other Persons or as required under the terms of the agreements
set forth in Section 4.4(iii) of the Disclosure Letter (other than the Company's
Existing Credit Facilities and the Senior Subordinated Notes); provided that in
no event shall the Company or any of its Affiliates be required to pay prior to
the Effective Time any material fee, penalties or other consideration to any
third party to obtain any consent or approval required for the consummation of
the Merger under any material contracts. Each party shall also (and will cause
its Affiliates to) refrain from knowingly taking, directly or indirectly, any
action (including making acquisitions), that would be reasonably likely to
result in a failure of any of the conditions to the Merger in this Agreement
being satisfied or restrict such party's ability to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts (i) to take all action necessary
so that no takeover, anti-takeover, moratorium, "fair price," "control share" or
other similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any
such Law is or becomes applicable to any of the foregoing, to take all action
necessary so that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

     Section 8.2 Certain Filings.

        (a) The parties shall cooperate with one another (i) in promptly
determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any
Governmental Authority is required, or any actions, consents, approvals, permits
or waivers are required to be or should be obtained from any parties to any
material contracts, in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) in seeking and obtaining any such
actions, consents, approvals, permits or waivers or making any such filings,
furnishing in a timely manner information required in connection therewith;
provided that the conditions to the parties' respective obligations to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby shall be limited to those
conditions specified in Article IX. The parties shall have the right to review
in advance, and to the extent reasonably practicable each will consult the other
on, all the material information relating to the other and each of their
respective Subsidiaries that appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Company
and Parent shall promptly notify and provide a copy to the other party of any
written communication received from any Governmental Authority with respect to
any filing or submission or with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Company and Parent
shall give the other reasonable prior notice of any communication with, and any
proposed understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any Governmental
Authority regarding any such filing or any such transaction. Neither the Company
nor Parent shall, nor shall they permit their respective Representatives to,
participate independently in any meeting or engage in any substantive
conversation with any Governmental Authority in respect of any such filing,
investigation or other inquiry without giving the other party prior notice of
such meeting or conversation and without giving, unless prohibited by such
Governmental Authority, the opportunity of the other party to attend or
participate. The parties to this Agreement will consult and cooperate with one
another in connection with any analyses, appearance, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, arguments, opinions, and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of
any party to this Agreement in connection with proceedings under or related to
the HSR Act or Other Antitrust Laws.

        (b) The parties (i) shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
to take or cause to be taken such actions as may be required to be taken under
the Exchange Act and state securities or applicable Blue Sky laws in connection
with the Merger and (ii) shall promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation, effect all necessary applications, notices, petitions and
filings, and use all reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary consents from
any Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate the Merger (including,
without limitation, any filing under the HSR Act or any applicable Other
Antitrust Law).

        (c) If required, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall take
all action necessary (i) to file as soon as practicable notifications or other
required items under the HSR Act and any applicable Other Antitrust Law, (ii) to
respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries from the Federal Trade
Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice for
additional information or documentation, (iii) to comply with the requirements
of, and respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to all inquiries and
requests for additional information received from any Governmental Authority in
connection with, the HSR Act or Other Antitrust Laws related to the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) to use reasonable
best efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under the HSR Act
or any Other Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority
with respect to the Merger.



                                       38

     Section 8.3 Public Announcements. So long as this Agreement is in effect,
the parties will consult with each other before issuing any press release or
making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and, except for any press release or public statement a
party determines may be required by applicable Law or national securities
exchange, will not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement without the consent of the other parties (not to be unreasonably
delayed, conditioned or withheld).

     Section 8.4 Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any
deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name
and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to
vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any
and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties
or assets of the Company.

     Section 8.5 Notices of Certain Events. Each of the parties hereto shall
reasonably promptly notify the other party of:

        (a) the receipt by such party of any notice or other communication from
any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

        (b) the receipt by such party of any notice or other communication from
any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement;

        (c) its learning of any actions, suits, claims, investigations or
proceedings (or communications indicating that the same may be contemplated)
commenced or threatened against, or affecting such party that, if they were
pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be disclosed
pursuant to this Agreement or which relate to the consummation of the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

        (d) its learning of the occurrence or non-occurrence of any events,
circumstances, developments or facts that would be likely to make any of the
representations and warranties of such party contained in this Agreement untrue
or any of the covenants or conditions contained in this Agreement incapable of
being complied with or satisfied; and

        (e) any event or occurrence that causes, or would reasonably be likely
to cause, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.



                                       39
<PAGE>

The delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 8.5 shall not cure such
breach or non-compliance or limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

     Section 8.6 Disposition of Litigation. The Company will consult with Parent
and Merger Sub with respect to any action by any Third Party to restrain or
prohibit or otherwise oppose the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and will use reasonable best efforts to resist any such effort
to restrain or prohibit or otherwise oppose the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, the Company will not encourage or
cooperate with any Third Party to restrain or prohibit or otherwise oppose the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Company
will reasonably cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub to resist any such effort
to restrain or prohibit or otherwise oppose the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

     Section 8.7 Employee Matters.

        (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to honor all Employee Benefit Plans and all Employee
Agreements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the
Effective Time, as the same may be amended from time to time thereafter in
accordance with such terms. For a period of not less than one year following the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be provided to current employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Company Employees") employee benefits that
are, in the aggregate, substantially comparable to those provided to the Company
Employees immediately before the Effective Time, with the exception of those
changes collectively bargained with authorized union representatives. The
foregoing shall not be construed to prevent (i) the amendment or termination of
any particular Employee Benefit Plan or Employee Agreement to the extent
permitted by, and in accordance with, its terms and the terms of any contract
related thereto, as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, as the same
may be amended from time to time thereafter in accordance with such terms, or
(ii) the termination of employment of any Company Employee.

        (b) For all purposes (other than for purposes of benefit accrual) under
the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to
any Company Employees after the Effective Time (the "New Plans"), except as
would result in a duplication of benefits, each Company Employee shall be
credited with all years of service for which such Company Employee was credited
before the Effective Time under any similar Employee Benefit Plan. In addition
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee
shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time or
satisfaction of any other eligibility requirements, in any and all New Plans to
the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under an Employee
Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the
Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the "Old Plans") and (ii) for purposes
of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision
benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her
eligible dependents to the extent such exclusions or requirements would have
been satisfied or inapplicable to such employee or dependent under the similar
Old Plan in which such employee or dependent was a participant immediately prior
to commencement of participation in such New Plan, and any expenses incurred by
any Company Employee and his or her eligible dependents during the portion of
the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employee's participation
in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New
Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum
out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.



                                       40
<PAGE>

        (c) Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall amend, or shall
cause to be amended, the Sovereign Specialty Chemicals, Inc. 401(k) Retirement
Plan and the Sovereign Specialty Chemicals, Inc. 401(k) Retirement Plan for
Union Employees (collectively, the "401(k) Plans") to provide for full,
accelerated vesting of all Company contributions under the 401(k) Plans made
with respect to an employee participating in either of the 401(k) Plans upon a
termination of the employment of any such employee occurring on or after the
Closing Date and on or prior to December 31, 2005, other than a termination for
cause by the Company or by such employee's resignation other than for good
cause. The Company may amend the 401(k) Plans to effectuate the foregoing prior
to the Effective Time.

        (d) Parent agrees that the Company's Cash Incentive Plan (the "CIP")
shall remain in full force and effect for the year ended December 31, 2004, and
further agrees that payments for participants whose employment terminates, other
than termination by the Company for cause or by the participant's resignation
other than for good reason, (i) on or prior to December 31, 2004, shall be paid,
upon termination, at an amount equal to 150% of such terminated participant's
target bonus, with such amount being prorated to the nearest half-month to the
date of such participant's termination or (ii) after December 31, 2004 and prior
to the payment of the 2004 amounts earned under the CIP, shall be paid, at the
time payments are made to active employees under the CIP for 2004, an amount
equal to the full year bonus earned by such terminated participant for 2004, it
being understood that any payment pursuant to this Section 8.7(d) to a
terminated participant in respect of the CIP shall, to the extent of such
payment, be in satisfaction of any amount to which such participant may
otherwise be entitled in respect of the CIP upon his or her termination of
employment pursuant to the terms of the CIP, any Employee Benefit Plan, Employee
Agreement or other employment or severance agreement or otherwise. Parent also
agrees that the Company's Sales Incentive Plan (the "SIP") shall remain in full
force and effect for the year ended December 31, 2004, and further agrees that
participants whose employment terminates, other than termination by the Company
for cause or by the participant's resignation, will be paid all amounts
projected to be due under the SIP through the last full calendar month in 2004
completed prior to such participant's termination. The Company may amend the CIP
and the SIP to effectuate the foregoing prior to the Effective Time.

     Section 8.8 Confidentiality Agreement.

        (a) The Company and Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause the Confidentiality Agreement to terminate as of the date hereof.
Subsequent to such termination, the Confidentiality Agreement shall be void and
shall have no further effect, and none of the parties thereto shall have any
liability to the other parties thereto or its Affiliates, directors, officers or
employees, except that nothing in this Section 8.8(a) shall relieve any party
from liability for any willful or intentional breach of the Confidentiality
Agreement prior to the date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
obligations contained in paragraph 2 of the Confidentiality Agreement shall
survive until the Effective Date.



                                       41
<PAGE>

        (b) From and after the date hereof, the Company shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates and its and their employees, counsel, financial advisors and
other representatives to, treat as confidential and safeguard any and all
information, knowledge and data of the Parent and its Affiliates that becomes
known to the Company or its Affiliates as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby except as otherwise agreed to by Parent in writing, in each
case by using the standard of care necessary to prevent the unauthorized use,
dissemination or disclosure of such information, knowledge and data.

        (c) From and after the date hereof until the Closing, Parent shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates and its and their employees, counsel, financial
advisors and other representatives to, treat as confidential and safeguard any
and all information, knowledge and data of the Company and its Affiliates that
becomes known to Parent or its Affiliates as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby except as otherwise agreed to by the Company in writing, in
each case by using the standard of care necessary to prevent the unauthorized
use, dissemination or disclosure of such information, knowledge and data.

        (d) Parent and the Company acknowledge that the confidentiality
obligations set forth herein shall not extend to information, knowledge and data
that is publicly available or becomes publicly available other than through an
act or omission of the party owing a duty of confidentiality, or becomes
available on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the party owing a
duty of confidentiality so long as such source is not known by such party to be
bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other obligations of secrecy to the
other party. In the event either Parent or the Company or their respective
Affiliates or employees, counsel, financial advisors or other representatives
(i) is requested or required to disclose information, knowledge or data that is
subject to a duty of confidentiality hereunder in connection with any judicial
or administrative proceedings or (ii) receives an opinion of outside counsel
that disclosure of information, knowledge or data that is subject to a duty of
confidentiality hereunder is necessary to avoid violating applicable Law, then
Parent or the Company, as applicable, shall provide the other party with prompt
notice of such requirement in advance of any such disclosure, and shall
cooperate with such other party to the extent it may seek to limit such
disclosure. In such case, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of
a waiver from the non-disclosing party after a request in writing therefor is
made by the disclosing party, the disclosing party may disclose such
information, knowledge or data without liability hereunder, but such disclosing
party shall disclose only such information as is required to be disclosed and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain a confidentiality order or
undertaking with respect to such information.

        (e) In the event of a breach of the obligations hereunder by Parent or
the Company, the non-breaching party, in addition to all other available
remedies, will be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce the provisions of
this Section 8.8.

        (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything herein or in the
Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, any party to this Agreement (and
their employees, representatives or other agents) may disclose to any and all
persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided however, that this
sentence shall not permit any disclosure that otherwise is prohibited by this
Agreement or any other confidentiality agreement between or among the parties as
of the date hereof or where such disclosure would result in a violation of
federal or state securities Laws or to the extent not related to the tax aspects
of the transactions contemplated hereby. Moreover, nothing in this Agreement
shall be construed to limit in any way any party's ability to consult any tax
advisor regarding the tax treatment or tax structure of the transactions
contemplated hereby, provided that any such advisor agrees to treat such
information confidentially.

                                   TERMINATION

     Section 10.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time (notwithstanding any
prior approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company):

        (a) by mutual written consent of the Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand;

        (b) by any of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, if:

           (i) the Merger has not been consummated by the End Date, provided
that no party may terminate this Agreement prior to the date which is nine
months after the date of this Agreement if any Governmental Antitrust Authority
has not completed its review of the transactions contemplated hereby by such
date; provided further that the failure of the Merger to be consummated by the
End Date (or, if extended in accordance with the preceding proviso, such later
date) is not the result of, or caused by, the failure of the party seeking to
exercise such termination right to fulfill any of its obligations under this
Agreement; or

           (ii) there shall be any Law that makes consummation of the Merger
illegal or otherwise permanently prohibited, provided that, in the case of any
such Law issued by a court, it shall be final and non-appealable; provided
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
10.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to any party whose breach of any provision of
this Agreement results in the application or imposition of such Law;

        (c) by the Company, if a breach of or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger
Sub set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred which would cause any of the
conditions set forth in Sections 9.3(a) or (b) to be unable to be satisfied by
the End Date; provided however, that the Company is not then in material breach
of this Agreement; or

        (d) by Parent or Merger Sub, if a breach of or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set
forth in this Agreement shall have occurred which would cause the condition set
forth in Section 9.2(a) to be unable to be satisfied by the End Date; provided
however, that Parent or Merger Sub is not then in material breach of this
Agreement.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Sections 10.1(b)
through (d) shall give written notice of such termination to the other party in
accordance with Section 11.1 of this Agreement.

     Section 10.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated and the
Merger abandoned pursuant to Section 10.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
null and void, and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates,
except (i) Sections 8.8, 10.2 and Article XI (other than Sections 11.2, 11.9 and
11.10) will survive the termination hereof and (ii) with respect to any
liabilities for damages incurred or suffered by a party as a result of the
willful breach by any other party of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement.

or to such other address or facsimile number as such party may hereafter specify
for by notice to the other parties hereto. Each such notice, request or other
communication shall be effective (i) if given by facsimile, when such telecopy
is transmitted to the telecopy number specified above and the appropriate
facsimile confirmation is received or (ii) if given by any other means, when
delivered at the address specified in this Section 11.1.

     Section 11.2 Survival of Representations and Warranties. The
representations and warranties contained herein and in any certificate or other
writing delivered pursuant hereto shall survive until the date eighteen months
after the date on which the Effective Time occurs, it being understood that in
the event a notice of any claim for indemnification has been given under the
Indemnification and Escrow Agreement within such survival period, the
representations and warranties that are the subject of such indemnification
claim shall survive with respect to such claim until such time as such claim is
finally resolved. This Section 11.2 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of
the parties that by its terms contemplates performance in whole or in part after
the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that the
shareholders of the Company will have no liability to Parent or its Affiliates
with respect to breach of any representation or warranty other than pursuant to
the Indemnification and Escrow Agreement.

     Section 11.3 Amendments No Waivers.

        (a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to
the Effective Time only by amendment or waiver in writing and signed: (i) in the
case of an amendment to this Agreement, by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub or
(ii) in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be
effective; provided however, that after the approval of the Agreement by the
shareholders of the Company any proposed amendment that by Law requires further
approval by the shareholders of the Company shall not be effective without such
further shareholder approval.

        (b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein
provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies
herein provided or available at Law or in equity.

     Section 11.4 Expenses. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense.

     Section 11.5 Transfer Taxes. Subject to Section 2.4(c), all stock transfer,
real estate transfer, documentary, stamp, recording and other similar taxes
(including interest, penalties and additions to any such taxes) ("Transfer
Taxes") incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by either Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation.

     Section 11.6 Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns, provided that no party may assign, delegate
or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement
without the consent of the other parties hereto, and provided further that
Parent or Merger Sub may assign, without consent and in its sole discretion, any
or all of its rights or obligations under this Agreement to any direct, wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent or
Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder if such assignee does not perform such
obligations. Any purported assignment in violation of this provisions shall be
null and void ab initio.

     Section 11.7 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the law of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to the conflicts or choice of law principles thereof.

     Section 11.8 Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries. This
Agreement may be executed by facsimile signatures and in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the
signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement
shall become effective only when actually signed by each party hereto and each
such party has received counterparts hereof signed by all of the other parties
hereto. No provision of this Agreement is intended to or shall confer upon any
Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder or with
respect hereto, except with respect to the matters provided in Section 2.4 and
Section 7.1.

     Section 11.9 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by virtue of any Law, or due
to any public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner so that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

     Section 11.10 Specific Performance. The parties hereby acknowledge and
agree that the failure of any party to perform its agreements and covenants
hereunder, including its failure to take all actions as are necessary on its
part to consummate the Merger, will cause irreparable injury to the other
parties, for which damages, even if available, will not be an adequate remedy.
Accordingly, each party hereby consents to the issuance of injunctive relief by
any court of competent jurisdiction to compel performance of such party's
obligations and to the granting by any court of the remedy of specific
performance of its obligations hereunder, in addition to any other rights or
remedies available hereunder or at law or in equity.

     Section 11.11 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement of the parties hereto with respect to its subject matter and
supersedes all oral or written prior or contemporaneous agreements and
understandings among the parties with respect to such subject matter.



                                       48

     Section 11.12 Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. Except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree that any suit,
action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be brought exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware, County of New Castle or, if such court does not have
jurisdiction over the subject matter of such proceeding or if such jurisdiction
is not available, in the United State District Court for the District of
Delaware, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the exclusive
jurisdiction of those courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom)
in any suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, any objection that such party may now or hereafter have to the
laying of the venue of any suit, action or proceeding in any of those courts or
that any suit, action or proceeding that is brought in any of those courts has
been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any suit, action or proceeding
may be served on any party at the applicable address provided in Section 11.1,
whether within or without the jurisdiction of any of the named courts. Without
limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on it by
notice as provided in Section 11.1 shall be deemed effective service of process.
Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably waives any right it may
have to trial by jury in any court or jurisdiction in respect to any matter
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

     Section 11.13 Authorship. The parties agree that the terms and language of
this Agreement were the result of negotiations between the parties, and as a
result, there shall be no presumption that any ambiguities in this Agreement
shall be resolved against any party. Any controversy over construction of this
Agreement shall be decided without regard to events of authorship.
