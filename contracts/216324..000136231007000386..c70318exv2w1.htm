Corporation, if the Surviving Corporation so directs (such subsidiary, the "

claims for the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Article II_. The
Surviving Corporation shall effect a second notice (the " _Second Notice_ ")
to Nonclaiming Holders not later than the calendar month that is 57 months

gains from the Exchange Fund shall be the property of and payable to Parent.
To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the
Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make

_Section 2.01_ above, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall promptly
replace or restore the portion of the Exchange Fund lost through investments
or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is, at all times
until its termination in accordance with _Section 2.02(d)_ above, sufficient
to make such payments.

escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall not
have been surrendered prior to the time when any cash payable under this
_Article II_ in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any
such cash in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, immediately prior to such time become the property of
Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto.

the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, Warrant or Portside Warrant, as the case may be, subject

exchange and payment for Shares, Warrants or the Portside Warrant, as
applicable, as provided in this _Section 2.02_, the applicable Per Share
Merger Consideration, Warrant Consideration or Portside Warrant

to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any person
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and

payable to a holder of Shares is to be made to a person other than the person
in whose name the applicable Shares are registered, it shall be a condition
of payment that any related Certificate surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the

recapitalization, stock split, split-up, combination or exchange of shares or
a stock dividend or dividend payable in any other securities shall be declared
with a record date within such period, or any similar event shall have
occurred, the Aggregate Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to
take into account the effects of such event; provided that nothing in this
_Section 2.02(i)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take
any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of
this Agreement, including the restrictions contained in _Section 4.01_

and delivery of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub or the consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, other than

(d) _Litigation_. No legal action, suit or proceeding or judicial,
administrative or governmental investigation is pending, or to the Knowledge

(e) _Information Supplied_. The information supplied by Parent specifically
for inclusion in the Proxy Statement shall not, on each relevant filing date,
on the date of mailing to the Company Stockholders and at the time of the
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or

(ii) Each of Parent and Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of
engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby and, prior to the Effective

the " _Financing_ "). Parent has delivered to the Company true, accurate and
complete copies of executed financing letters with respect to the Debt
Financing (the " _Debt Financing Commitments_ ") and equity commitment
letters with respect to the Equity Financing (the " _Equity Financing
Commitments_ " and, together with the Debt Financing Commitments, the "
_Financing Commitments_ "), pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and
conditions thereof, the parties thereto have committed to provide Parent with
the Financing. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(ii) As of the date hereof, none of the Financing Commitments has been amended
or modified in any respect, and none of the Financing Commitments has been
withdrawn or terminated in any respect. Each of the Financing Commitments, in
the form so delivered, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent
and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto. The Financing
Commitments are in full force and effect. There are no conditions precedent
or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of
the Financing on the terms contained in the Financing Commitments, other than
as set forth in, or contemplated by, the Financing Commitments. 

   

(iii) The aggregate proceeds from the Financing, together with cash on hand of
the Company and its Subsidiaries or Alternative Financing (as defined in
_Section 5.13_ below) anticipated to be available at the Effective Time,
constitute all of the financing required to be provided by Parent for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and are sufficient for
the satisfaction of all of Parents and Merger Subs financial obligations
under this Agreement, including, without limitation, (a) to pay (or provide
the funds for the Surviving Corporation to pay) the Aggregate Merger
Consideration, (b) to refinance any indebtedness or other obligation of the
Company or Parent which may become due as a result of this Agreement, the
Merger, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (c) to pay all
related fees and expenses arising out of or associated with this Agreement,
the Merger, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby when due. 

   

(iv) No event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger
Sub under any term or condition of the Financing Commitments, and neither
Parent nor Merger Sub reasonably believes that it will be unable to satisfy
on a timely basis any term or condition of closing to be satisfied by it
contained in the Financing Commitments. Parent and/or Merger Sub have fully
paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the
Financing Commitments to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement.

(i) Immediately after the Effective Time, and after giving effect to the
Merger and the Financing contemplated by this Agreement and any other
transactions contemplated in connection with the Merger, the Surviving
Corporation (i) will not be insolvent (either because the financial condition
is such that the sum of its debts is greater than the fair value of its
assets or because the present fair saleable value of its assets will be
less than the amount required to pay its probable liability on its debts as
they become absolute and matured), (ii) will not have unreasonably small
capital with which to engage in its business, either (A) as presently
conducted or (B) as intended by Parent to be conducted and (iii) will not
have incurred or plan to incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they become
absolute and matured. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(ii) No transfer of property is being made and no obligation is being incurred
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the
intent to hinder, delay or defraud any present or future creditors of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries. 

  

(j) _Completion of Transaction_. Parent has no Knowledge of any fact or
circumstances relating to or affecting Parent or its Subsidiaries that it
reasonably believes would prevent Parent or Merger Sub from fulfilling their
material obligations under this Agreement and completing the transactions
contemplated hereby. 

  

(k) _Due Diligence by Parent_. Parent acknowledges and agrees that it and
Merger Sub have conducted their own independent investigation, review and
analysis of the business, operations, assets, liabilities, and prospects of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, which investigation, review and analysis
was done by Parent and, to the extent Parent deemed appropriate, by Parents
Representatives. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that, should the Closing
occur, Parent will acquire the Company and its properties, assets and
liabilities without any representation or warranty of any kind, express or
implied, except such representations and warranties expressly set forth in
Section 3.01 of this Agreement or in any certificates delivered by the
Company in connection with the Closing. 

  

(l) _No Agreements with Company Stockholders_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub
nor any of their respective Representatives has entered into any agreement,
arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral or written), or
authorized, committed or agreed to enter into any agreement, arrangement or
understanding (in each case, whether oral or written), pursuant to which any
Company Stockholder would be entitled to receive consideration of a different
amount or nature than the Per Share Merger Consideration or, other than the
Support Agreements, pursuant to which a Company Stockholder agrees to vote to
adopt this Agreement or agrees to vote against any Acquisition Proposal. 

  

(m) _No Undisclosed Arrangements with Company Employees_. Neither Parent nor
Merger Sub nor any of their respective Representatives has entered into any
agreement, arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral or
written), or authorized, committed or agreed to enter into any agreement,
arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral or written), with
any officer, director or employee of the Company or any affiliate thereof,
pursuant to which any such person would be employed or compensated by, or
would have any direct or indirect financial interest, in the Surviving
Corporation or its assets, income or business following the Closing that has
not been disclosed by or on behalf of Parent to the Company Board prior to the
date of this Agreement. 

  

(n) _No Vote of Parent Stockholders_. No vote of the stockholders of Parent,
or the holders of any other securities of Parent (equity or otherwise), is
required by any applicable Law, the certificate of formation or the limited
liability company agreement of Parent, in order for Parent to consummate the
Merger or effect the Financing. The vote or consent of Parent as the
sole stockholder of Merger Sub (which shall have occurred prior to the
Effective Time) is the only vote or consent of the holders of any securities
of Merger Sub necessary to approve this Agreement or the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(o) _Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Fee
Guarantee has been executed and delivered to the Company and is in full force
and effect in accordance with its terms. 

  

(p) _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Except for the representations
and warranties contained in this Section 3.02 or in any certificates
delivered by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the
Closing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, any affiliate of Parent or Merger Sub or
any other person makes any representations or warranties, and Parent
hereby disclaims any other representations or warranties, whether made by
Parent, any affiliate of Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their respective
officers, directors, members, managers, stockholders, employees, agents or
other Representatives, with respect to the negotiation, execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure, in writing or orally, to the
Company or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents or
representatives of any documentation or other information.

agreement of any Indemnified Party with the Company or its Subsidiaries.

to be delayed beyond the Outside Date). In the event Parent determines to
make such election, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to take or perform any necessary or advisable steps to enable Parent

(i) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated (A) by the Company
or Parent pursuant to _Section 7.01(b)(i)_ or (B) by Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.01(e)_ (on the basis of a breach of the Companys representations

(B) the sum of Parents and Merger Subs Expenses (not to exceed $1,000,000
of such Expenses in the aggregate) (the sum of (A) and (B), the " _Fiduciary

in any event, within two (2) Business Days following such termination) in the
case of a termination pursuant to _Section 7.01(d)_, by wire transfer
in immediately available funds to an account specified by Parent in writing
to the Company. 

   

(iii) In the event that (A) prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly proposed by any person
(other than Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates) and
not publicly withdrawn by the tenth calendar day prior to the Stockholders
Meeting, (B) thereafter this Agreement is validly terminated by either Parent

(iv) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section 7.02_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, that the damages resulting from the termination of this Agreement
under circumstances where a Termination Fee or Fiduciary Fee are payable are
uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and that the amounts payable
pursuant to _Sections 7.02(b)(i)_,  _(ii)_ and _(iii)_ are reasonable
forecasts of the actual damages which may be incurred and constitute
liquidated damages and not a penalty. The Company further acknowledges that
without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the Termination
Fee and/or the Fiduciary Fee when due in accordance with the applicable
requirements of this _Section 7.02(b)_, and, in order to obtain such
payments Parent commences a suit which results in a judgment against the

pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees)
in connection with such suit.

(v) Subject to _Section 7.02(b)(iii)_ above, upon payment of the Termination
Fee and/or the Fiduciary Fee by the Company in accordance with this _Section
7.02(b)_, the Company and its Representatives shall have no further liability
or obligation relating to, arising out of, or with respect to, this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby. ( _provided_ , that nothing herein
shall release any party from any liability arising from fraud). Nothing
herein shall limit Parents rights to sue for damages (" _Covenant Breach
Damages_ ") resulting from the Companys breach of a covenant hereunder) (
_provided_ , that the Company shall be entitled to introduce the payment of
the Termination Fee by the Company to Parent as evidence in any proceeding to
determine Covenant Breach Damages; _provided_ _further_ , that Parent shall
not be entitled to any Covenant Breach Damages if the Company pays to Parent
the Fiduciary Fee when due in accordance with the applicable requirements of
this _Section 7.02(b)_). 

   

(c) _Business Interruption Fee_. 

   

(i) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated by the Company
pursuant to  _Section 7.01(f)_ (including, without limitation, as a result
of Parent or Merger Sub breaching their respective obligation to effect the
Closing pursuant to Section 1.03 hereof, then Parent shall pay or caused to
be paid to the Company an amount of cash equal to $4,200,000 (the " _Business
Interruption Fee_ "); _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not prevent the
Company from seeking payment of the Business Interruption Fee under the Fee
Guarantee so long as the aggregate amount received by the Company from
Parent pursuant to this Section 7.02(c) and from the Guarantor pursuant to
the Fee Guarantee is not greater than the Business Interruption Fee. Subject
only to _Sections 7.02(c)(ii)_ and  _(iii)_ below, neither Parent nor Merger
Sub shall have any liability under this Agreement other than the payment of
the Business Interruption Fee in the circumstances required by _Section
7.02(c)(i)_. 

   

(ii) Parent acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section 7.02_
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that
the damages resulting from the termination of this Agreement under
circumstances where a Business Interruption Fee is payable are uncertain and
incapable of accurate calculation and that the amount payable pursuant to
_Section 7.02(c)(i)_ is a reasonable forecast of the actual damages which
may be incurred and constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and
that, without these agreements, the Company would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Business Interruption Fee is not promptly paid
when due in accordance with the requirements of _Section 7.02(c)(i)_, and,
in order to obtain such payment the Company commences a suit which results in
a judgment for the Business Interruption Fee, Parent shall pay to the Company
its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) in connection
with such suit. 

   

(iii) Subject _to Section 7.02(c)(ii)_ above, upon payment of the
Business Interruption Fee to the Company in accordance with this _Section
7.02(c)_, none of Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their respective affiliates
or Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation relating
to, arising out of, or with respect to, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby ( _provided_ , that nothing herein shall release Parent
or Merger Sub from liability arising from fraud). 

 

    #####

by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, at any
time before or after obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no
amendment shall be made which by Law requires further approval by such
Company Stockholders without obtaining such further approval of such Company
Stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. 

  

SECTION 7.04 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,

of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party hereto, (ii) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto or (iii) waive compliance with the
agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
party. The failure of any party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder
or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any
reason other than the failure to lawfully serve process, (b) that it or its
property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any
legal process commenced in any such court (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise), and (c) to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in any such court
is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or
