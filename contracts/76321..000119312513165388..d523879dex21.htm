penalties imposed by H.M. Revenue and Customs thereon. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this Clause 14(b) shall entitle any application for loss or
relief to be made which would or could prejudice any other position taken by
the Seller and/or Administrator. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | Any payment to the Seller or Administrators due under Clause
14(b) above shall be made on or before the later of: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | five Business Days after written demand is made by the
Seller or the Administrators for it; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | five Business Days before the due date for payment to H.M.
Revenue and Customs of the underlying corporation tax liability. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) | The Seller shall: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | at least fourteen (14) Business Days prior to filing any
Relevant Tax Return, provide the International Purchaser with a copy of a
substantially final draft of such Relevant Tax Return (including any work
papers relevant to the preparation of such Relevant Tax Return), and, upon
receipt from the International Purchaser of such comments as the International
Purchaser believes are necessary to ensure the Substantial Shareholdings
Exemption applies as agreed in Clause 14(a) (which comments the International
Purchaser shall provide the Seller not later than seven (7) Business Days
prior to the due date of such Relevant Tax Return), timely file with H.M.
Revenue and Customs such Relevant Tax Return, as revised by the International
Purchaser; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | keep the International Purchaser reasonably informed about
the status of any communication with H.M. Revenue and Customs regarding the
application of the Substantial Shareholding Exemption in respect of that
Relevant Tax Return. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | The International Purchaser shall, at its expense, work
together with the Seller and the Administrator to manage and co-ordinate the
defence and settlement of any Tax Contest. From Initial Completion, the
Seller shall (i) notify the International Purchaser within ten (10) Business
Days of receipt of notice of any Tax Contest, (ii) provide the International
Purchaser with copies of all written notices and other documents received
with respect to any Tax Contest, and (iii) reasonably cooperate with the
International Purchaser in conducting the defence of any Tax Contest. In the
event that the International Purchaser and the Seller and/or the
Administrator cannot agree on any issue in relation to a Tax Contest
(including but not limited to any decision by the Seller and/or the
Administrator to discontinue the defence of any Tax Contest), an independent
arbiter shall be appointed to review and determine the issue and the
International Purchaser and the Seller and/or Administrator hereby agree that
such decision shall be final and binding on each of them. For the avoidance of
doubt, in the event that the Seller and/or Administrator decides to
discontinue the defence of any Tax Contest, the International Purchaser shall
not itself be precluded from pursuing such defence so long as the
International Purchaser does not pursue, maintain or otherwise reflect
a position that does or could prejudice any other position taken by the
Seller and/or the Administrator. 
---|---|--- 
 



20 Clause 14, then notwithstanding anything in this agreement, the Purchaser
shall have no obligation to indemnify the Seller or the Administrator
pursuant to Clause 14(b). Notwithstanding anything in this agreement, the
amount the Purchasers shall be required to pay pursuant to Clause 14(b) shall
in no case exceed $3,626,458. 
---|---|--- 
 



   15. | EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY 
---|--- 



     | (a) | It is agreed that the acknowledgements, exclusions and
agreements relating to the sale of the Target Shares which are set out in
Schedule 1 shall take effect as if set out in full in this Clause and take
effect in favour of the Administrators as well as the Seller. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Any claim against either of the Purchasers under this
agreement shall be irrevocably waived unless made in writing by notice to the
International Purchaser or the US Purchaser (as the case may be) not later
than four years after Initial Completion, the first day of such four year
period to be the day after Initial Completion, time being of the essence in
respect of that four year period.  
---|---|--- 



   16. | THIRD PARTY CLAIMS 
---|--- 



   (a) | Save as otherwise expressly provided for in subclause 14(e)
above, the Seller and the Administrators shall have the right to the conduct
of all Third Party Claims. Subject to paragraph (b) below, in the event of a
Third Party Claim, the Seller and the Administrators shall, until such time as
a final compromise, agreement, expert determination or non-appealable decision
of a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction is made in respect of the
Third Party Claim or the Third Party Claim is otherwise finally disposed of: 
---|--- 



     | (i) | consult with the Purchasers, and wherever practical accede
to the reasonable requirements of the Purchasers, in relation to the conduct
of any dispute, defence, compromise or appeal of the Third Party Claim; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | keep the Purchasers promptly informed of the progress of
the Third Party Claim and provide the Purchasers with copies of all relevant
documents and such other information in the Seller or the Administrators
possession as may be requested by the Purchasers; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | shall not cease to defend the Third Party Claim nor make
any admission of liability, agreement or compromise in relation to the Third
Party Claim without prior written consent of the Purchasers. 
---|---|--- 



   (b) | If at any point during the conduct of a Third Party Claim the
Seller or the Administrators obtain an opinion of Counsel (such Counsel being
of six years or more call and experienced in insolvency matters) that the
liability of the Seller or the Administrators in respect of that Third Party
Claim would, on the balance of probabilities, rank as an administration
expense then paragraphs (i) and (iii) above shall not apply in respect of the
conduct of that Third Party Claim and the Administrators will be entitled to
settle, compromise or secure the withdrawal of the Third Party Claim on such
terms as they, in their sole discretion, think fit. 
---|--- 



     | (c) |

The Purchasers shall bear and pay promptly the costs and expenses of each of
the Seller and the Administrators in connection with any Third Party
Claim and any legal costs payable by the Seller or the Administrators (by
court order or otherwise) incurred by any party to the 

---|---|--- 
 



21 the Administrators with such security for payment of all such aforementioned
costs and expenses as the Seller or the Administrators shall reasonably
require and if the Purchasers fail to satisfy the Seller or the Administrators
in this regard within seven days of being requested to do so then, without
prejudice to the rights of the Seller and the Administrators under
this agreement, the Third Party Claim shall, from that time, be treated as
one falling within paragraph (b) above. 
---|--- 



   (d) | The Purchasers shall promptly meet and pay any judgments against
the Seller or the Administrators or either of them in respect of any Third
Party Claim.  
---|--- 



   (e) | Time shall be of the essence as regards any obligations of the
Purchasers under this clause. 
---|--- 
 



   17. | CONFIDENTIALITY 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Any initial press release or public announcement in relation
to the sale and purchase of the Target Shares and any ancillary matter shall
be mutually agreed by the Parties. Any Party may make or issue a press
release or a public announcement in relation to the sale and purchase of the
Target Shares or any ancillary matter if and to the extent required by law or
by any obligation of the Administrators to pass relevant information,
including the amount of the Consideration, to the creditors of the Seller or
to a committee of such creditors but no other press release or public
announcement shall be made without the consent of the other Parties to
this agreement save to the extent required by law or by any regulatory
authority and, to the extent reasonably practicable, such press release or
public announcement shall only be made after prior consultation with the other
Parties.  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Subject to subclauses 17(d) and (e), the Seller and the
Administrators shall treat as confidential and undertakes not to disclose (i)

---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Subject to subclauses 17(d) and (e), each Purchaser shall
treat as confidential and undertakes not to disclose (i) any Confidential
Information before Completion and (ii) any confidential information relating
to any member of the Sellers Group it has obtained in connection with this
agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | Nothing in subclauses 17(b) or (c) prevents any confidential
information from being disclosed or used to the extent: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | it has become publicly available (other than by breach of
this agreement); or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | it has been or is subsequently received from a third party
which is under no confidentiality obligation in respect of that information;
or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | it is independently developed by or on behalf of the
disclosing Party after Completion; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iv) | it is disclosed or used pursuant to a written consent from
the International Purchaser (in the case of disclosure by the Seller or the
Administrators) or the Seller (in the case of disclosure by any Purchaser). 
---|---|--- 
 



22 confidential information from being disclosed where: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | required to do so by law or by any competent regulatory
authority or the rules of any stock exchange; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | the information is required for the purpose of legal
proceedings arising out of this agreement; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | the disclosure is made to a professional advisor of that
Party, to lenders or potential lenders to any member of the Purchasers Group
for the purposes of the transactions under this agreement or to such lenders
or potential lenders professional advisers. 
---|---|--- 



   18. | FURTHER ASSURANCE 
---|--- 



     | (a) | The Seller and the Administrators will, at the Purchasers
expense (including payment by the Purchasers of any legal or other
professional costs incurred by the Seller or the Administrators) for a period
of twelve months from Completion do such acts and/or execute such further
deeds and documents as either of the Purchasers reasonably considers necessary
to effect or record the transfer of or vest the Target Shares, Assets or any
relevant part of them, in each of the Purchasers (as the case may be). The
provisions of Clause 15 (Exclusion of Liability) and Schedule 1 (Exclusions,
etc.) to this agreement will apply to any such further deed or document
entered into. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | The Seller will at the Purchasers expense (including
payment by the Purchasers of any reasonable legal or other professional costs
incurred by the Seller or the Administrators) for a period of twelve months
from Completion use reasonable endeavours to provide any information requested
in writing by the Purchasers as is in the Sellers possession and as is
reasonably necessary in connection with any investigation or enforcement
action brought against a Purchaser or any of its affiliates relating to the
Businesses, by any governmental authority, and to the extent that the Seller
is legally entitled to do so. 
---|---|---

   20. | GUARANTEE 
---|--- 



     | (a) | The Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | guarantees to the Seller and to the Administrators and each
of them prompt performance by the Purchasers of all its obligations under both
this agreement and the Intra Group Sale Agreement; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | undertakes with the Seller and the Administrators and each
of them that whenever the Purchasers do not perform any obligation under or in
connection with either this agreement or the Intra Group Sale Agreement, the
Guarantor shall forthwith on demand perform or procure performance of such
obligation itself. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | This guarantee is a continuing guarantee and will extend to
all obligations of the Purchasers under this agreement, regardless of any
intermediate payment or discharge in whole or in part. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Where any discharge (whether in respect of the obligations
of the Purchasers or any security for those obligations or otherwise) is made
in whole or in part or any arrangement is made on the faith of any payment,
security or other disposition which is avoided or must be restored on
insolvency, liquidation or otherwise without limitation, the liability of the
Guarantor under this Clause shall continue as if the discharge or arrangement
had not occurred. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | The Seller and the Administrators and each of them may
concede or compromise any claim that any payment, security or other
disposition is liable to avoidance or restoration. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | The obligations of the Guarantor under this Clause 20 will
not be affected by any act, omission, matter or thing which, but for this
provision, would reduce, release or prejudice any of its respective
obligations under this Clause or prejudice or diminish those obligations in
whole or in part, including (whether or not known to the Guarantor, the Seller
or the Administrators): 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | any time or waiver granted to, or composition with, the
Purchasers or other person; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | the release of the Purchaser or any other person under the
terms of any composition or arrangement with any creditors of any members of
the Group;  
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | the taking, variation, compromise, exchange, renewal or
release of, or refusal or neglect to perfect, take up or enforce, any rights
against, or security over assets of, the Purchasers or other person or any
non-presentation or non-observance of any formality or other requirement in
respect of any instrument or any failure to realise the full value of any
security; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iv) | any incapacity or lack of powers, authority or legal
personality of or dissolution or change in the members or status of the
Purchasers or any other person;  
---|---|--- 
 



26 agreement or the Intra Group Sale Agreement or any other document or security
so that references to this agreement or the Intra Group Sale Agreement in
this Clause 20 shall include each variation or replacement; 
---|---|--- 



     | (vi) | any unenforceability, illegality or invalidity of any
obligation of the Purchasers or the Guarantor under this agreement or the
Intra Group Sale Agreement or any other document or security, to the intent
that the Guarantors obligations under this Clause 20 shall remain in full
force and its guarantee be construed accordingly, as if there were no
unenforceability, illegality or invalidity; or  
---|---|--- 



     | (vii) | any postponement, discharge, reduction, non-provability or
other similar circumstance affecting any obligation of the Purchasers under
this agreement or the Intra Group Sale Agreement resulting from any
insolvency, liquidation or dissolution proceedings or from any law, regulation
or order so that each such obligation shall for the purposes of the
Guarantors obligations under this Clause be construed as if there were no
such circumstances. 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | The Guarantor waives any right it may have of first
requiring the Seller or the Administrators (or any trustee or agent on their
behalf) to proceed against or enforce any other rights or security or claim
payment from any person before claiming from the Guarantor under this Clause. 
---|---|--- 



     | (g) | Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the
Purchasers under or in connection with this agreement or the Intra Group Sale
Agreement have been irrevocably paid in full, the Seller or the
Administrators (or any trustee or agent on their behalf) may: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | refrain from applying or enforcing any other moneys,
security or rights held or received by the Seller or the Administrators (or
any trustee or agent on their behalf) in respect of those amounts, or apply
and enforce the same in such manner and order as it sees fit (whether against
those amounts or otherwise) and the Guarantor shall not be entitled to the
benefit of the same; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | hold in a suspense account any moneys received from the
Guarantor or on account of the Guarantors liability under this Clause,
without liability to pay interest on those moneys. 
---|---|--- 



     | (h) | Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the
Purchasers under or in connection with this agreement or the Intra Group Sale
Agreement have been irrevocably paid in full, the Guarantor shall not, after
a claim has been made or by virtue of any payment or performance by either or
both of them under this Clause: 
---|---|--- 



      | (i) | be subrogated to any rights, security or moneys held,
received or receivable by the Seller or the Administrators (or any trustee or
agent on their behalf) or be entitled to any right of contribution or
indemnity in respect of any payment made or moneys received on account of the
Guarantors liability under this Clause; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | claim, rank, prove or vote as a creditor of the Purchasers
or its estate in competition with the Seller or the Administrators (or any
trustee or agent on their behalf); or 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) |

receive, claim or have the benefit of any payment, distribution or security
from or on account of the Purchasers, or exercise any right of set-off
as against the Purchasers, 

---|---|--- 
 



27 Guarantor shall hold in trust for and forthwith pay or transfer to the Seller
or the Administrators any payment or distribution or benefit of security
received by it contrary to this subclause or as directed by the Seller or the
Administrators. 
---|--- 



     | (i) | This guarantee is in addition to and is not in any way
prejudiced by any other security now or subsequently held by the Seller or the
Administrators.  
---|---|--- 



   21. | INTEREST 
---|--- 



     | (a) | If either the Purchaser or the Seller defaults in making any
payment when due of any sum payable under this agreement, it shall pay
interest on that sum from (and including) the date on which payment is due
until (but excluding) the date of actual payment (after as well as before
judgment) at an annual rate of two per cent. per annum above the base rate
from time to time of National Westminster Bank plc, which interest shall
accrue from day to day and be compounded monthly. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Any exercise by a Party of its rights under this Clause is
without prejudice to any other rights or remedies available to the Party under
this agreement or otherwise.  
---|---|--- 



   22. | SET-OFF 
---|--- 

Any payments to be made by the Purchasers to the Seller or to the
Administrators under this agreement shall be paid in full without any set-off,
counterclaim, retention or deduction or claim to a lien (whether or not such
set-out, counterclaim, retention, deduction or lien arises under this
agreement), any right to which is expressly waived by the Purchaser.



   23. | SEVERABILITY 
---|--- 

If a provision of this agreement is or becomes illegal, invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction, that shall not affect:



     | (a) | the validity or enforceability in that jurisdiction of any
other provision of this agreement; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | the validity or enforceability in other jurisdictions of any
other provision of this agreement. 
---|---|--- 
 



   24. | COUNTERPARTS 
---|--- 

This agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which,
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement, and any Party
(including any duly authorised representative of a Party) may enter into this
agreement by executing a counterpart. Facsimile signatures shall be valid and
binding to the same extent as the original signatures.



   25. | GENERAL 
---|--- 



   25.1 | Continuation of obligations 
---|--- 

Each of the obligations and undertakings set out in this agreement which is
not fully performed at Completion will continue in force after Completion.

 



28 ---|---

shall pay its own costs and expenses incurred by that Party in connection with
the entering into and performance of this agreement.

 



   25.3 | Taxation 
---|--- 

Except as otherwise provided in this agreement or in the Pakistan Transfer
Agreement or in the Intra Group Sale Agreement, the Purchasers shall be
responsible for the payment of and shall pay any and all transfer taxes
arising solely as a result of the entry into, performance or enforcement of

Agreement. For purposes of this Clause 25.3, "transfer taxes" means any

   25.4 | Fair Provisions 
---|--- 

It is agreed by the Parties that the price being paid by the International
Purchaser, and the other provisions of this agreement, and in particular but
without limitation those in Clause 15 (Exclusion of Liability) and Schedule 1
(Exclusions etc.), are fair and reasonable in the circumstances of the
insolvency of the Seller. This is the case in particular in the light of the
fact that:



     | (a) | the Purchasers have had the opportunity to inspect and
investigate the Target Shares and the Sellers and US HoldCos title to each
of them;  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | the Purchasers are aware of the need to rely on that
opportunity by reason of the absence of usual warranties; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | the Seller is insolvent and faces the constraints of selling
necessarily imposed on it in that circumstance; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) | the knowledge of the Businesses, the Assets and the Target
Shares available to the Administrators and their partners, staff and advisers
is necessarily limited.  
---|---|--- 



   25.5 | No rescission 
---|--- 

The Purchasers shall not be entitled to rescind this agreement after Initial
Completion for any reason.



   25.6 | Terms confidential 
---|--- 



     | (a) | The terms of this agreement shall remain confidential to the
Parties unless all agree otherwise. This restriction shall not apply to any
disclosure required by law, any competent regulatory authority, the rules of
any stock exchange or to the Parties professional or financial advisers or to
lenders or potential lenders to any member of the Purchasers Group for the
purposes of the transactions under this agreement or to such lenders or
potential lenders professional advisers, who are aware of its confidential
nature. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | None of the Purchasers rights or obligations under this
agreement may be assigned or transferred without the prior written consent of
the Administrators. The Seller and/or the Administrators may at any time
assign or transfer any of their respective rights under this agreement to any
party or to any liquidator appointed to the Seller and any such assignee may
assign or transfer any of their respective rights under this agreement to any
party. 
---|---|--- 
 



29 ---|--- 

Time is not of the essence in relation to any obligation under this agreement
unless:



     | (a) | time is expressly stated to be of the essence in relation to
that obligation; or 
---|---|---
