have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall be cancelled and
retired and shall not be exchanged for any portion of the Merger
Consideration, but shall represent only the right to receive payment in
accordance with Section 3.2(g);  _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such
stockholder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or
lose the right to appraisal under such Section 262, then the right of such
stockholder to be paid the fair value of such stockholder's Dissenting Shares
shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted
as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for,
the right to receive the Merger Consideration (without interest thereon) as
provided in Section 2.9(c).

  



  

(c) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than those shares
cancelled pursuant to Section 2.9(a) and Section 2.9(b), which are
hereinafter referred to as " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall be converted into and
become the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $50.00, without
interest, payable to the holder thereof in accordance with Article III (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all such Shares that
have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of any such Shares immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest.

  



  

(d) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Company and
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Company.

Effective Time, automatically become fully vested and free of any forfeiture
restrictions, and, at the Effective Time, the holder thereof shall be entitled
to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to each such Company

offering period shall commence under the Company ESPP following the date

determined by Company that is prior to the Closing Date as the last day of
such offering period (the " _Final Investment Date_ ") and by making such

Company Common Stock for purposes of Section 2.9.

and any holder of Shares or Company Equity Awards, such Shares or Company
Equity Awards shall be contributed to Parent by such holder immediately prior

ARTICLE III

  



  

EXCHANGE OF SHARES AND PAYMENT OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

  



  

Section 3.1 _Payment of Merger Consideration_. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall (a) designate a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the
payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article III and,
in connection therewith, shall prior to the Closing Date enter into an
agreement with the Paying Agent in a customary form reasonably acceptable to
the Company, (b) deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent
in a separate fund (the " _Exchange Fund_ "), for the benefit of Company
Stockholders, an amount in cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration, and (c) instruct the Paying Agent to timely pay the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Agreement. The Merger Consideration
deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 3.1 shall be invested
by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i)
the Paying Agent shall not make any investment other than in (A) interest-
bearing time deposits or short-term negotiable certificates of deposit (with
maturities of 30 days or less) in a commercial bank having a combined capital
and surplus of at least $10,000,000,000 and short-term deposit ratings of at
least P-1 (Moody's) and A-1 (Standard and Poor's), (B) short-term obligations
(with maturities of 90 days or less) of or guaranteed by the United States
Treasury or another government agency or (C) money market funds substantially
all the assets of which consist of cash and securities or other obligations
of the types described in the preceding clauses (A) and (B) and (ii) any such
investment or any payment of earnings from any such investment shall not delay
the receipt by Company Stockholders of any portion of the Merger
Consideration or otherwise impair such Company Stockholders' rights under this
Agreement. Any interest or income produced by such investments shall not be
deemed part of the Exchange Fund and shall be payable to the Surviving
Company. In the event that the funds in the Exchange Fund shall be
insufficient to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.9(c) and Section
2.10, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional
funds with the Paying Agent in an amount equal to such deficiency. No
investment losses resulting from investment of the funds deposited with the
Paying Agent shall diminish the rights of any holder of Company Common Stock
to receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein. The Paying Agent
shall be required to hold the Exchange Fund for the benefit of the Company
Stockholders and promptly make the payments provided for in Article II. The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided
for in this Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the
contrary, each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Company and Parent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any Person pursuant to this Article III such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any
provision of applicable Laws. Amounts so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Tax authority shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to such Person in respect of which the Paying Agent, the
Surviving Company or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding.

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Shares_

  



  

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and
in any event not later than the second Business Day thereafter, Parent shall
instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each registered holder of a Certificate
(i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in
such form and have such other customary provisions (including customary
provisions with respect to delivery of an "agent's message" with respect to
shares held in book-entry form) as the Company and Parent may reasonably
agree prior to the Closing Date) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of such Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration into which the number of Shares previously represented by such
Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement. Upon
proper surrender of Certificate(s) to the Paying Agent for cancellation,
together with a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal
(and such other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the
Paying Agent), the holder of such Certificate(s) shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the amount of the Merger Consideration that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Article II, and the
Certificate(s) so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest shall
be paid or accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

  



  

(b) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to any
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate(s) surrendered in
exchange therefor, it shall be a condition to such payment that the
Certificate(s) so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by
an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate(s) or shall establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this
Article III, without interest.

  



   

-19-

--- 

    



  

(c) The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of
this Article III shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, _subject_ ,
_however_ , to the Surviving Company's obligation to pay any dividends or
make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time
that may have been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company
Common Stock not in violation of the terms of this Agreement or prior to the
date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. As of
the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers in the stock ledgers of the
Company of Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such
shares are presented for transfer to the Paying Agent, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this
Article III.

  



  

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
Company's Securityholders as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time
shall be returned to Parent. All Company Stockholders shall thereafter look
only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration payable to such
Company Stockholder at the Effective Time as determined pursuant to this
Agreement, in each case without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, none of Parent, the Company, the
Paying Agent, Merger Sub or any other Person shall be liable to any former
Company Stockholder for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

  



  

(e) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact, reasonably
acceptable to the Paying Agent, by the Person claiming such Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine is reasonably
necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

(f) Without limiting the other provisions of the Agreement, (i) in
the event that the number of shares of Company Common Stock or
securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time
changes as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse
stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger,
subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, issuance pursuant to the Rights
Plan, or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect such change and (ii) if any Rights (as defined
in the Rights Plan) are exercised or any dividends or distributions are made,
set aside, paid or declared with respect to the Company's Series A Junior
Preferred Participating Stock, then the Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect such change, in each case such that the
aggregate consideration payable (taking into account such stock splits,
combinations, dividends or distributions) to stockholders is the same as
prior to such event.

(g) Except as provided in Section 2.9(b), each Company Stockholder
who has perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL shall otherwise be entitled to receive only the
payment provided by such Section 262 with respect to the Dissenting Shares
owned by such Company Stockholder. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt
notice of any demand for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands,
and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are
received by the Company relating to Company Stockholders' rights of
appraisal, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights (or offers or
attempts to settle the same) under Section 262 of the DGCL. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer or attempt to
settle, any such demand for appraisal, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

  



  

ARTICLE IV

Except (a) as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports, in each case that the
Company has filed with or furnished to the SEC on or after December 31,
2010 and prior to the date of this Agreement (collectively, the " _Filed SEC
Documents_ "), other than information that is contained under the captions
"Risk Factors" or "Forward-Looking Statements," or (b) as disclosed in the
Company Disclosure Letter (it being acknowledged by Parent and Merger Sub that
a disclosure of information in any section of the Company Disclosure Letter
shall be deemed to qualify or apply to each other section in this Article IV

standing under the laws of any other jurisdiction in which the character of
the properties owned, leased or operated by it therein or in which the
transaction of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. True and complete copies of the Company
Charter and the Company By-Laws are included in the Company SEC Reports.

Section 4.2 _Subsidiaries_.

the requisite corporate, limited partnership, limited liability company or
similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure
to have such power and authority would not, individually or in the aggregate,

Subsidiary of the Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is,
to the extent applicable, in good standing in each jurisdiction where the
character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the conduct or
nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary,

expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(b) The Company is, directly or indirectly, the record and
beneficial owner of all of the outstanding shares of capital stock or
other equity interests of each Subsidiary of the Company. All of such shares
and other equity interests so owned by the Company were validly issued and

and are owned by the Company free and clear of all Liens, other than
Permitted Liens. There are no subscriptions, options, warrants, rights, calls,
contracts or other commitments, understandings, restrictions or arrangements
relating to the issuance, acquisition, redemption, repurchase or sale of any

Subsidiary, including any right of conversion or exchange under any
outstanding security, instrument or agreement, any agreements granting any
preemptive rights, subscription rights, anti-dilutive rights, rights of first
refusal or similar rights with respect to any securities of any Subsidiary.
None of the Subsidiaries of the Company has any outstanding equity
compensation plans relating to the capital stock of, or other equity or
voting interests in, any Company Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any obligation to make any payments based on the price

Agreement by the Company Stockholders, have been duly and validly authorized
by all requisite corporate action on behalf of the Company. The affirmative

executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by each of Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and
similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors'
rights or by general equity principles.

that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to the assumptions,
qualifications and limitations set forth therein, the Merger Consideration to
be paid to the holders of Shares pursuant to this Agreement is, as of the date
of such opinion, fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, a

Section 5.6 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, (a)

N.A., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated, Deutsche Bank Trust
Company Americas, Deutsche Bank AG Cayman Islands Branch, Deutsche Bank
Securities Inc., Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Goldman Sachs Lending Partners
LLC (collectively, the "Lenders" and together with their affiliates and their
respective officers, employees, directors, partners, controlling parties,
advisors, agents and representatives, the " _Financing Sources_ "), pursuant
to which the Lenders have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in the Debt Financing Commitment, to lend the amounts set forth therein
for the purposes of financing the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, related fees and expenses to be incurred by Parent and Merger Sub
in connection therewith and for the other purposes set forth therein (the "
_Debt Financing_ ") and (b) the equity commitment letter, dated as of July 14,
2012, from Sponsor (the " _Equity Financing Commitment_ " and, together with
the Debt Financing Commitment, the " _Financing Commitments_ "), pursuant to
which the Person investing thereunder has committed, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth therein, to invest the amount set forth therein (the "
_Equity Financing_ " and, together with the Debt Financing, the " _Financing_
"). As of the date of this Agreement, the Financing Commitments are in full
force and effect and constitute valid, binding and enforceable obligations of
Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto.  As of the
date of this Agreement, none of the Financing Commitments has been amended or
modified since copies thereof were delivered to the Company. As of the date
of this Agreement, the respective commitments contained in the Financing
Commitments have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. There are no
side letters or other agreements, arrangements, contracts or
understandings (except for customary fee letters and engagement letters; true
and complete copies of any such fee letters that include "market flex" or
other provisions affecting the terms or conditions of the Debt Financing have
been provided to the Company, with only the fee amounts and certain other
terms (none of which would reduce the aggregate amount or affect the
conditionality of the Debt Financing) redacted) relating to the Financing to
which Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries are a
party other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments. Parent
has fully paid any and all commitment and other fees in connection with the
Financing Commitments that are due as of the date of this Agreement. Except as
otherwise set forth in or contemplated by the Financing Commitments and
except for the payment of customary fees, there are no conditions precedent
related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing. As of the date of
this Agreement, no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,
or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any of the other parties to the Financing
Commitments under any of the Financing Commitments. Subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions contained in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2
hereof and the commencement and completion of the Marketing Period, as of the
date of this Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments will
not be satisfied or that the Financing will not be made available to Parent
and Merger Sub on the Closing Date. Assuming (i) the satisfaction of the
conditions in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2 hereof and (ii) the Financing is
funded in accordance with its conditions, upon funding of the Financing
Commitments, Parent and Merger Sub will have on the Closing Date, together
with Company cash, funds sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration (and any
repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by this Agreement or the
Financing Commitments) and any other amounts required to be paid in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including all
related fees and expenses.

to approve the consummation of the Merger. The Company shall, upon
reasonable request of Parent, advise Parent on at least a daily basis as
promptly as practicable on each of the seven Business Days prior to the
scheduled date of the Company Stockholder Meeting as to the aggregate tally of
affirmative proxies and the aggregate tally of negative proxies received from

adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

  



  

(f) Nothing in this Section 7.1 shall be deemed to prevent the
Company or the Company Board from taking any action they are permitted or
required to take under, and in compliance with, Section 7.6 or under
applicable Law.

  



  

Section 7.2 _Access to Information_.

  



  

(a) Between the date hereof and the earlier of the Effective Time
and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1,
upon reasonable prior notice and during normal business hours, the Company
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the
Representatives of Parent (and Representatives of Lenders) reasonable access
to their respective properties, books, Contracts and records, and to the
Company's and its Subsidiaries' Representatives, in each case in a manner not
unreasonably disruptive to the operation of the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, make available to Parent (i) a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or
federal or state lending laws and (ii) all other material information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may
reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would, in the reasonable judgment
of the Company after consultation with outside counsel, (A) violate any of
its obligations to third parties with respect to confidentiality agreements,
(B) jeopardize the attorney-client privilege or attorney work product
immunity or (C) contravene any Law, Order, fiduciary duty, including
activities that violate Antitrust Laws with respect to the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries, or Contract (it being agreed that the Company shall
give notice to Parent of the fact that it is withholding such information or
documents pursuant to clauses (A) through (C) above and thereafter the
Company and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause
such information to be provided in a manner that would not reasonably be
expected to waive the applicable privilege or protection or violate the
applicable restriction). All requests for information made pursuant to this
Section 7.2 shall be directed to the executive officer or other Person
designated by the Company.

  



  

(b) All information and materials furnished pursuant to this
Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement, dated April 25, 2012, between Parent and the Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

  



  

Section 7.3 _Further Actions_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate with each other and
shall use (and cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their reasonable
best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be
done, and reasonably assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal
requirements that may be imposed on such Party or its Subsidiaries with
respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article
VIII, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
soon as practicable.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing clause (a),
each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to

information, applications and other filings, and obtain as promptly as
practicable all consents, authorizations, orders, approvals, clearances and
permits of, or exemptions by (collectively, " _Consents_ "), any Governmental

in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (ii) prosecute all such filings and Consents with all appropriate
diligence; (iii) furnish all information required to be furnished in
connection with the Consents of or filings with any Governmental Entity, and
promptly cooperate with and furnish information in connection with any such

Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby; (iv) execute and deliver any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to
fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement; (v) facilitate obtaining any
final Order or Orders approving the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement consistent with this Agreement or to remove any impediment to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; and (vi) defend or
contest in good faith any Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
brought by a third party that could otherwise prevent or impede,
interfere with, hinder or delay in any material respect the consummation of
the Merger, in the case of each of clauses (i) through (vi), other than with
respect to filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions
of information, applications and other documents, approvals, consents,
registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations relating to
Antitrust Laws, which are dealt with in Sections 7.3(c) and (d) below.

  



    

(c) Without limiting any other provision of this Section 7.3, each
of Parent and the Company shall (i) as promptly as practicable (but in
no event later than ten Business Days after the date of this Agreement) make
an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR
Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) as promptly as
practicable make all filings and deliver all notices required under all other
Antitrust Laws applicable to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, (iii) thereafter make all other submissions with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby required under the HSR Act and any other
Antitrust Law and supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the
HSR Act and any other Antitrust Law and (iv) take all other appropriate
actions reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act or to obtain
any Consents required under any other Antitrust Laws as soon as practicable
after the date hereof. Any such filings shall be in substantial compliance
with the requirements of the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Law.
Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall promptly take all actions
necessary to secure the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting
period under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law and resolve any
objections asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under the Federal Trade Commission Act or any other applicable Law
raised by any Governmental Entity, in order to prevent the entry of, or to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned, any Order that would prevent,
prohibit, restrict or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including (i) (A) executing settlements, undertakings, consent
decrees, stipulations or other agreements with any Governmental Entity or
with any other Person; (B) selling, divesting or otherwise conveying or
holding separate particular assets or categories of assets or businesses of
Parent and its Subsidiaries; (C) agreeing to sell, divest or otherwise convey
or hold separate any particular assets or categories of assets or businesses
of the Company and its Subsidiaries contemporaneously with or subsequent to
the Effective Time; (D) permitting the Company to sell, divest or otherwise
convey or hold separate any of the particular assets or categories of assets
or businesses of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time; (E) terminating existing relationships, contractual rights or
obligations of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; (F)
terminating any venture or other arrangement; (G) creating any relationship,
contractual right or obligation of the Company or Parent or their respective
Subsidiaries; or (H) effectuating any other change or restructuring of the
Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries (and, in each case,
entering into agreements or stipulating to the entry of any Order by, or
filing appropriate applications with, the DOJ, the FTC or any other
Governmental Entity in connection with any of the foregoing and, in the case
of actions by or with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or its or
their businesses or assets, by consenting to such action by the Company)
(each a " _Divestiture Action_ ") and (ii) defending through litigation any
claim asserted in court or administrative or other tribunal by any Person
(including any Governmental Entity) in order to avoid entry of, or to have
vacated or terminated, any Order that would prevent the Closing prior to the
End Date. All such efforts shall be unconditional and shall not be qualified
in any manner and no actions taken pursuant to this Section 7.3 shall be
considered for purposes of determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has
occurred with respect to the Company. If any Divestiture Action agreed to by
Parent requires action by or with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries
or its or their businesses or assets, and such action would constitute a
breach of this Agreement, Parent hereby consents to the taking of such action
by the Company. Parent shall respond to and seek to resolve as promptly as
reasonably practicable any objections asserted by any Governmental Entity
with respect to the transactions contemplated under this Agreement. The
Company, Parent and Merger Sub and any of their respective Affiliates shall
not take any action with the intention to, or that could reasonably be
expected to, hinder or delay the expiration or termination of any waiting
period under the HSR Act or the obtaining of approval of the DOJ or FTC as
necessary. Nothing in this Agreement shall require any Party to take or agree
to take any action with respect to its business or operations unless the
effectiveness of such agreement or action is conditioned upon the Closing.

(d) Subject to applicable Laws and the instructions of any
Governmental Entity, Parent and the Company shall each advise the other
promptly of (and shall promptly furnish the other with copies of) any notice
or other communication received by such Party or any of its Affiliates from
the FTC, DOJ, any state attorney general or any other Governmental Entity
regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and of any
understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral or written) such Party
proposes to make or enter into with the FTC, the DOJ, any state attorney
general or any other Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, and each Party shall generally keep the other apprised
of the status of matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Neither the Company nor Parent shall permit
any of its respective Representatives to participate in any meeting or
telephone conversation with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings,
investigation or other inquiry with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it consults with the other
Party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity,
gives the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meeting or conversation. Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) cooperate
in the filing of any substantive memoranda, white papers,
filings, correspondence or other written communications explaining or
defending this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
thereby, articulating any regulatory or competitive argument or responding to
requests or objections made by any Governmental Entity and (ii) furnish the
other Party with copies of all filings, submissions, correspondence and
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it
and its affiliates and their respective Representatives, on the one hand, and
any Governmental Entity or members of any Governmental Entity's staff, on the
other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby.

  



  

(e) The Company shall notify Parent promptly of any effect, event,
development or change between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time that, to the Knowledge of the Company, causes or would
reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions set forth in Section
8.1 or Section 8.2 not to be satisfied. Parent shall notify the Company
promptly of any effect, event, development or change between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time that, to the Knowledge of Parent, causes or
would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions set forth in
Section 8.1 or Section 8.3 not to be satisfied. The delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 7.3(e) shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available to the Party receiving such notice.

  



  

(f) Parent and the Company shall, upon request, furnish each other
with all information concerning themselves, their respective
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any statement,
filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.4 _Employees; Employee Benefit Plans_.

  



  

(a) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries to, give those employees who are, as of the Effective Time,
employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Continuing Employees_ ")
full credit for all purposes, including eligibility, vesting and benefit
accruals under any employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained by
Parent, the Surviving Company or any Subsidiary of Parent or the Surviving
Company (collectively, the " _Parent Plans_ ") for such Continuing
Employees' service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any
predecessor entity) to the same extent recognized by the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
service shall be recognized to the extent such recognition would result in
the duplication of benefits. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts to, (x)
waive, or cause to be waived, all limitations as to preexisting conditions,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the
Continuing Employees under any Parent Plan that is a welfare benefit plan in
which such employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time
to the same extent as such conditions, exclusions, requirements and periods
were waived under a corresponding Company Benefit Plan or were not applicable
to a corresponding Company Benefit Plan; and (y) provide credit under any such
welfare plan for any co-payments, deductibles and similar expenditures made
or incurred in the period prior to the Effective Time for the plan year in
which the Effective Time occurs.

(b) From the Effective Time until the first anniversary thereof,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to,
provide to each Continuing Employee compensation and benefit arrangements
(other than equity-based awards) that are either (i) substantially similar to
the compensation and benefit arrangements to which such Continuing Employee
was entitled immediately prior to the Effective Time or (ii) substantially
similar to the compensation and benefit arrangements to which
Parent's similarly situated employees are entitled, whichever is more
favorable to such Continuing Employee. Without limiting the foregoing and the
terms of any other agreement, from and after the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Company shall keep in full force and effect through the first
anniversary of the Effective Time or, if later, until all obligations
thereunder have been satisfied in accordance with the terms of such plan,
agreement or arrangement, each plan, agreement or arrangement in effect as of
the date of this Agreement and set forth in Section 7.4(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter between or among the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
any of its or their current or former employees; _provided_ that nothing
herein shall prohibit, any amendment or termination of such agreements in
accordance with their terms or applicable Law.

  



  

(c) This Section 7.4 shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to
the benefit of each of the Parties, and nothing in this Section 7.4, express
or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person (including for the
avoidance of doubt any current or former directors, officers, employees,
contractors or consultants of any of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or on or after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries) any rights or remedies of
any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 7.4 or is intended
to be, shall constitute or be construed as (i) prohibiting the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries from amending or terminating
any Company Benefit Plan, or (ii) establishing, amending or modifying any
employee benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement of Parent,
the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any respective Subsidiary thereof.

  



  

Section 7.5 _Indemnification; Directors ' and Officers'
Insurance_.

  



  

(a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and rights
to advancement of expenses) now existing in favor of any Person who is or
prior to the Effective Time becomes, or has been at any time prior to the
date of this Agreement, a director, officer or employee (including as a
fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit plan) of the Company, any of
the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors (each, an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") as provided in the Company Charter, the Company By-
laws, the organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary or any
indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries (i) shall be assumed by the Surviving Company
in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time, (ii) shall
survive the Merger, (iii) shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms with respect to any claims against any such
Indemnified Party arising out of such acts or omissions and (iv) shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party for a period from
the Effective Time through the date as of which a claim for indemnification
(and advancement of expenses) with regard to any such act or omission becomes
barred by the relevant statute of limitations. Parent shall ensure that the
Surviving Company complies with and honors the foregoing obligations.

(b) Without limiting Section 7.5(a) or any rights of any Indemnified
Party pursuant to any indemnification agreement, from and after the
Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Company shall, (i) indemnify
and hold harmless each director or officer of the Company, any of the
Company's Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors (each a " _D andO
Indemnified Party_") with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses,
damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in
settlement or compromise) and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal
counsel) in connection with any claim, suit, action, proceeding or
investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative),
whenever asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or in part, (A) the
fact that a DandO Indemnified Party was a director or officer of the Company or
such Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions by a DandO Indemnified Party in the
DandO Indemnified Party's capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of
the Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the request of the Company or such
Subsidiary (including in connection with serving at the request of the
Company or such Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or
fiduciary of another Person (including any employee benefit plan)), in each
case under (A) or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time
(including any claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation relating in
whole or in part to the Transactions or relating to the enforcement of this
provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of any DandO
Indemnified Party), to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law. In
addition, from the Effective Time Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Company to, advance any expenses (including fees and expenses of
legal counsel) of any DandO Indemnified Party under this Section 7.5 (including
in connection with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations referred to
in this Section 7.5) as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, provided that the individual to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it shall be determined that
such person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 7.5(b).

  



  

(c) Without limiting any of the obligations under paragraph (a) of
this Section 7.5, Parent agrees that all limitations of liability existing in
favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in the Company Charter or the
Company By-Laws or in the corresponding constituent documents of any of the
Company's Subsidiaries as in effect as of the date of this Agreement with
respect to matters occurring on or prior to the Effective Time shall survive
the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect thereafter, without
any amendment thereto that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
such Indemnified Parties for a period of six years after the Effective Time
(including with respect to any claims pending at the end of such six-year
period).

(d) Prior to or at the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain
prepaid (or "tail") directors' and officers' liability and fiduciary
liability insurance policies covering each Indemnified Party for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or
omissions relating to the approval of this Agreement and consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby) for the period beginning at the Effective
Time and ending six years from the Effective Time and containing terms
(including with respect to coverage and amounts) and conditions (including
with respect to deductibles and exclusions) that are, individually and in the
aggregate, no less favorable to any Indemnified Party than those of the
Company's directors' and officers' liability and fiduciary liability
insurance policies in effect on the date of this Agreement (the " _Existing D
andO Policies_"). Parent shall cause such "tail" insurance policies to be
maintained in full force and effect, for their full term, and cause all
obligations thereunder to be honored by it and the Surviving Company.

  



  

(e) In the event that (i) Parent or the Surviving Company or any of
their respective successors or assigns (A) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and is not the continuing or Surviving Company or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (B) transfers or conveys all or a substantial
portion of its properties and other assets to any Person or (ii) Parent or any
of its successors or assigns dissolves the Surviving Company, then, and in
each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
applicable successors and assigns or transferees expressly assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 7.5.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Claim
(whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is brought against
any Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, the provisions of this Section 7.5 shall continue in effect until the
final resolution of such Claim.

  



  

Section 7.6 _Solicitation_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and ending
at 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on August 24, 2012 (such date and time,
the " _No-Shop Period Start Date_ "), the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives shall be entitled to directly or indirectly (i)
initiate, solicit and encourage, whether publicly or otherwise, Acquisition
Proposals, including by providing access to non-public information
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreements; _provided_ that the Company shall promptly (and
in any event within 24 hours) provide to Parent any material non-public
information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to
any Person given such access and that was not previously provided to Parent;
and (ii) enter into, engage in and maintain discussions and negotiations with
respect to Acquisition Proposals, or otherwise cooperate with, assist or
participate in, or facilitate any inquiries, proposals, discussions or

description of the status of any discussions with such Excluded Party and
provide to Parent an unredacted copy of any written (or a written summary of
the material terms of any non-written) Acquisition Proposal, including any
financing commitments (including redacted fee letters) relating thereto.

(b) Except as may relate to any Excluded Party (for so long as such
Person or group is an Excluded Party) until the Cut-off Date or as
expressly permitted by this Section 7.6, on the No-Shop Period Start Date,
the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives to, immediately cease any encouragement,
solicitation, discussion or negotiation with any Person regarding an
Acquisition Proposal that is then ongoing and shall request that any such
Person promptly return or destroy all confidential information concerning the
Company and its Subsidiaries. Except as may relate to any Excluded Party (for
so long as such Person or group is an Excluded Party) until the Cut-off Date
or as expressly permitted by this Section 7.6, from the No-Shop Period
Start Date until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Article 9 and the Effective Time, the Company shall not, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and each of its and its Subsidiaries'
respective Representatives not to, (i) initiate, solicit, facilitate or
knowingly encourage the making of an Acquisition Proposal (or inquiries,
proposals or offers or other efforts that may reasonably be expected to lead
to an Acquisition Proposal), (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate
in any negotiations or discussions concerning, or furnish to any Person any
material information with respect to, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter
into any letter of intent, agreement or agreement in principle with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal or (iv) otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or
attempt to make an Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the commencement of
the obligations of the Company under this Section 7.6(b) on the No-Shop
Period Start Date, the parties hereto agree that the Company and
its Representatives may continue to engage in the activities described in
clause (ii) of Section 7.6(a) with respect to each Excluded Party (for so
long as such Person or group is an Excluded Party) until 11:59 p.m. (New York
City time) on September 13, 2012 (the " _Cut-off Date_ "), including with
respect to any amended or revised proposal submitted by such Excluded
Party on or after the No-Shop Period Start Date. Nothwithstanding the
foregoing, a Person or group shall cease to be an Excluded Party when such
Person or group, as of the No-Shop Period Start Date, ceases to provide
(directly or indirectly) at least 50% of the equity financing (measured by
voting power and value) of such Person or group at any time following the No-
Shop Period Start Date and the Company receives notice or knowledge thereof.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 7.6(b) or any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if at any time on or
after the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to obtaining the Company
Required Vote, the Company or any of its Representatives receives a written
Acquisition Proposal, which Acquisition Proposal was made on or after the No-
Shop Period Start Date and did not result from any breach of this Section
7.6, (i) the Company and its Representatives may contact such Person or group
of Persons making the Acquisition Proposal solely to clarify the terms and
conditions thereof and (ii) if the Company Board or any committee thereof
determines in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, then after such
determination, the Company and its Representatives may (x) enter into an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the Person or group of Persons
making the Acquisition Proposal and furnish pursuant thereto information
(including non-public information) with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person or group of Persons who has made such Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ that the Company shall promptly (and in any event within
24 hours) provide to Parent any material non-public information concerning the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person given such
access which was not previously provided to Parent or its Representatives and
(y) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with
the Person or group of Persons making such Acquisition Proposal;  _provided_
, _further_ , that this Section 7.6(c) shall not apply to Acquisition
Proposals (or amendments or modificiations thereto) made by Excluded Parties
prior to the Cut-off Date.

(d) Following the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall
promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) (i) notify Parent in the event
that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives
receives an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) provide Parent with an unredacted copy
of any such Acquisition Prosposal made in writing to the Company, or a written
summary of the material terms of such Acquistion Proposal not made in
writing, the identity of the Person or group of Persons making such
Acquisition Proposal, any relevant proposed transaction documents and a copy
of any financing commitments (including redacted fee letters) relating
thereto, (iii) keep Parent reasonably informed of any material developments,
modifications, discussions and negotiations with respect to any such
Acquisition Proposal and (iv) upon the request of Parent apprise Parent of the
status of each such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality or similar
agreement with any Person that prohibits the Company from providing to Parent
any of the information required to be provided to Parent under this
Section 7.6 within the time periods contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of
doubt, all information provided to Parent pursuant to this Section 7.6 will
be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

(e) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)
(A) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or
approve, any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Proposal Documentation; (B)
withhold or withdraw (or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Sub), or publicly propose to withhold or withdraw (or modify or qualify
in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the Company Recommendation; (C)

the immediately following sentence; or (D) after the No-Shop Period Start Date
(or after the Cut-off Date with respect to any Excluded Party), fail to
publicly affirm the Company Recommendation in writing within three Business
Days after Parent requests such affirmation with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal that has been publicly announced; provided that Parent may only make
such request once per Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent may also make such a request in respect of any material amendment or
revision to an Acquisition Proposal that has been publicly announced) (any
action described in this clause Section 7.6(e)(i) being referred to as a "
_Change of Recommendation_ ," it being understood that a "stop, look and
listen" communication by the Company Board to the Company's stockholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act shall not
constitute a Change of Recommendation) or (ii) authorize or execute (or cause
or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute) any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement constituting an
Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement pursuant to
Section 7.6(a) or Section 7.6(c)) (any such documentation, " _Acquisition
Proposal Documentation_ ") or (iii) take any actions pursuant to Section
9.1(g). Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to obtaining the Company Required
Vote, the Company Board or any committee thereof may (x) effect a Change of
Recommendation; or (y) if the Company Board receives an Acquisition
Proposal that it or any committee thereof determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal, execute Acquisition Proposal
Documentation with respect to such Superior Proposal if, and only if in the
case of clause (x) or (y):

(A) the Company Board or any committee thereof determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors
that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law;

  



  

(B) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent and Merger Sub,
at least three full Business Days in advance (and shall not take action until
after 12:01 a.m. of the day following such third full Business Day), that it
intends to (1) effect a Change of Recommendation or (2) cause the Company to
enter into any Acquisition Proposal Documentation and terminate this
Agreement, and such notice shall include the basis for the Change of
Recommendation or termination;

  



  

(C) with respect to a Superior Proposal, the Company has provided the
identity of the party making such Superior Proposal, along with
unredacted copies of the Acquisition Proposal, the relevant proposed
transaction agreements and a copy of any financing commitments

(D) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to
negotiate, in good faith with Parent and Merger Sub for the entirety of
such three full Business Day notice period (to the extent Parent wishes to
negotiate) to enable Parent to propose in writing a binding offer to effect
revisions to the terms of this Agreement, the Financing Commitments and the
Guarantee such that it would cause any such Superior Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal or would otherwise obviate the need to take
action pursuant to Section 9.1(g);

  



  

(E) following the end of such notice period, the Company Board or any
committee thereof shall have considered in good faith any proposed
revisions to this Agreement, the Financing Commitments and the Guarantee
proposed by Parent in a manner that would form a binding contract if accepted
by the Company or any other potentially binding offer, and shall have
determined that, as applicable, any such Superior Proposal would continue to
constitute a Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed in such binding offer
were to be given effect or failure to effect a Change of Recommendation would
be inconsistent with the Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and
the Company shall have provided to Parent notice of its continued intent to
terminate or effect a Change of Recommendation; and

  



  

(F) in the event of any material change to the terms of any such Superior
Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent
an additional notice consistent with that described above and the notice and
negotiation period shall have recommenced, except that the notice period
shall be at least two full Business Days (rather than the three full Business
Days otherwise contemplated above);

or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, and to the extent

Recommendation, or (ii) making any disclosure not of the type provided in
clause (i) above to the shareholders of the Company that is required by

Agreement shall prohibit the Company from taking any action that any court of

Section 7.10 _Financing_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of
Parent and Merger Sub shall use, its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing on the
terms and conditions described in the Financing Commitments (subject to any
market flex provisions applicable thereto that have been disclosed in writing
to the Company), including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in
effect the Financing Commitments, (ii) negotiate definitive agreements with
respect thereto on the terms and subject only to the terms and conditions
contemplated by the Financing Commitments (subject to any market flex
provisions applicable thereto that have been disclosed in writing to the
Company) on other terms no less favorable in the aggregate to Parent and
Merger Sub (as determined in the reasonable judgment of the Company) and
(iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger
Sub to obtaining the Financing set forth in the Financing Commitments and the
definitive agreements that are within their respective control. If all
conditions to the Financing Commitments have been satisfied, Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts (including, other than with respect to the
provider of the Equity Financing, through litigation pursued in good faith) to
cause the Lenders and the Person providing the Equity Financing to fund on
the Closing Date, as applicable, the Financing required to consummate the
Merger, respectively. Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Affiliates to, take any action not otherwise required or expressly permitted
under this Agreement that is a breach of, or would result in termination of,
any of the Financing Commitments. If any portion of the Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Financing
Commitments, Parent shall, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event, use its reasonable best efforts to arrange
to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of (i) any default
or material breach (or any event that, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to any default or material
breach) by any party under either of the Financing Commitments or the
definitive agreements relating to the Financing of which Parent or Merger Sub
becomes aware, (ii) any termination of either of the Financing Commitments,
(iii) the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from
any Person party to a Financing Commitment with respect to any (x) actual or
potential default, breach, termination or repudiation of any Financing
Commitment, any definitive agreement relating to the Financing or any
provision of the Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements relating
to the Financing, in each case by any party thereto, or (y) material dispute
or disagreement between or among any parties to any Financing Commitment or
the definitive agreements relating to the Financing, with respect to the
obligation to fund the Financing, including any condition with respect to the
obligation to fund the Financing, or the amount of Financing to be funded at
the Closing Date, and (iv) if for any reason Parent or Merger Sub believes in
good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the
Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing.
As soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event, within two Business Days
after the date the Company delivers to Parent or Merger Sub a written request,
Parent and Merger Sub shall provide any information reasonably requested by
the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (i), (ii),
(iii) or (iv) of the immediately preceding sentence. Parent shall keep the
Company informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing. In the event that Parent is required pursuant to
this Section 7.10(b) to provide any information that is subject to attorney-
client or similar privilege, Parent may withhold disclosure of such
information so long as Parent gives notice to the Company of the fact that it
is withholding such information and thereafter the Company and Parent shall
use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause such information to be
provided in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to waive the
applicable privilege or protection.

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 7.10 or in
any other provision of this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall have the
right from time to time to amend, restate, replace, supplement or otherwise
modify, or waive any of its rights under, the Financing Commitments and/or
substitute other debt or equity financing for all or any portion of the
Financing from the same and/or alternative financing sources; _provided_ ,
that any such amendment, restatement, replacement, supplement or other
modification to or waiver of any provision of the Financing Commitments that
amends the Financing and/or substitution of all or any portion of the
Financing shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, (i)
with respect to the Financing Commitments, reduce (or could reasonably be
expected to have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the Financing
(it being understood that either the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing
may be reduced so long as the Equity Financing or Debt Financing is increased
(including, in the case of the Debt Financing by an increase in revolver
drawings on the Closing Date), no later than the date of such amendment,
restatement, replacement, supplement or other modification or waiver, by a
corresponding amount on substantially the same terms as provided in the
applicable Debt Financing Commitment or Equity Financing Commitment), (ii)
impose new or additional conditions or contingencies or otherwise expand,
amend or modify any of the conditions or contingencies to the Financing
(unless such conditions precedent or contingencies to the Financing would not
be (1) materially adverse to Parent, Merger Sub or the Company and (2)
reasonably expected to prevent or materially hinder or delay the consummation
of the Merger, or materially adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger
Sub to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Financing
Commitments or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing) or (iii)
prevent or materially impede or delay the consummation of the Merger. Parent
shall promptly deliver to the Company true and complete copies of any such
amendment, restatement, replacement, supplement, modification, substitution
or waiver; _provided_ _that_ Parent and Merger Sub may replace, amend,
supplement or modify the Debt Financing Commitment for the purpose of adding
agents, co-agents, lenders, arrangers, joint bookrunners or other Persons that
have not executed the Debt Financing Commitment as of the date hereof, in
each case in accordance with the Debt Financing Commitment as of the date
hereof so long as such replacement, amendment, supplement or modification is
otherwise in compliance with this Section 7.10(c).

(d) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable or
Parent becomes aware of any event or circumstance that would make any portion
of the Debt Financing unavailable, and such portion is required to fund the
Merger Consideration and all fees, expenses and other amounts contemplated to
be paid by Parent pursuant to this Agreement, Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to arrange and obtain, and negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect to, alternative financing from the same
or alternative financial institutions in an amount sufficient to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement upon
terms and conditions no less favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent and the
Company than the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitment, as applicable, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
occurrence of such event. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company true
and complete copies of all agreements pursuant to which any such
alternate source shall have committed to provide Parent and Merger Sub with
any portion of the Financing substantially concurrently with the execution
thereof. Parent and Merger Sub shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a
timely basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing and any material developments relating to the Financing, including
providing to the Company all drafts and copies of definitive agreements with
respect to the Debt Financing and all other material documents related to the
Financing (except in the case of customary fee letters and engagement letters
where fee amounts and certain other terms (none of which would reduce the
aggregate amount or affect the conditionality of any such alternative
financing) may be redacted); provided that fee letters or side letters which
do not contain "market flex" or other provisions which affect the terms or
conditions of the Debt Financing shall not be required to be provided. In the
event that Parent is required pursuant to this Section 7.10(d) to provide any
information that is subject to attorney-client or similar privilege, Parent
may withhold disclosure of such information so long as Parent gives notice to
the Company of the fact that it is withholding such information and
thereafter the Company and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner that would not
reasonably be expected to waive the applicable privilege or protection.

  



  

(e) If any condition or other provision of the Debt Financing
Commitment is amended, modified or waived or if alternative financing
is obtained for any portion of the Debt Financing, in each case, in
accordance with Sections 7.10(c) and (d), then each of Parent and the Company
shall comply with its covenants set forth herein with respect to the Debt
Financing Commitment, as so amended, modified or waived and with respect to
such alternative financing to the same extent that Parent and the Company
would have been obligated to comply with respect to the Debt Financing, as
the case may be. For purposes of the Agreement (other than with respect to
representations made by Parent and Merger Sub as of the date hereof),
references to (x) "Debt Financing" and "Financing" shall include the
financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment as permitted to be amended,
modified, supplemented, restated, replaced or substituted by Sections 7.10(c)
and 7.10(d), any debt securities or other financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment to be issued or incurred in lieu of the bridge facility in the
Debt Commitment on the Closing Date, including any alternative
financing required by Section 7.10(d), (y) "Debt Commitment" shall include
any amendment, modification, restatement, supplement and replacement or
substitution permitted by Section 7.10(c) and any alternative financing
required by Section 7.10(d), and (z) "Lenders" and "Financing Sources" shall
include lenders and other financing sources (including
underwriters, placement agents and initial purchasers) providing the Debt
Financing pursuant to any amendment, modification, restatement,
supplement and replacement permitted by Section 7.10(c) and any alternative
financing required by Section 7.10(d).

efforts, in each case at Parent's sole expense, to provide all cooperation to
Parent and Merger Sub as may be reasonably required in connection with the
Debt Financing, including (i) furnishing Parent and Merger Sub and their
Debt Financing sources (x) the financial statements and pro forma financial

Financing Commitment (as in effect as of the date hereof) and (y) such other

reasonably request (including with respect to acquired entities) in order to
market, syndicate and consummate the Debt Financing (provided that the
Company shall only be required to furnish pro forma financial statements
for purposes of determining whether the Required Information has been
provided (i) if Parent or Merger Sub has provided the Company information
relating to the proposed debt and equity capitalization on or prior to August
21, 2012 and (ii) if Parent or Merger Sub has provided the Company any other
information that the Company shall have reasonably requested on or before
September 3, 2012; further provided that in no event shall the information

obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

ARTICLE IX 
  
 TERMINATION

  



  

Section 9.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and
the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time by action
taken or authorized by the Board of Directors of the terminating Party or
Parties as follows (the effective date of any such termination, the "
_Termination Date_ "):

  



  

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

  



  

(b) by either Parent or the Company if any Governmental Entity of
competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable Order or
enacted a Law that prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Merger
on the terms contemplated hereby; _provided_  that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(b) shall not be available to any
Party if such legal prohibition or the issuance of such final and non-
appealable Order was primarily due to such Party's failure to perform in all
material respects any of its obligations under this Agreement;

  



   

-59-

--- 

    



  

(c) by either Parent or the Company if the Effective Time shall not
have occurred on or before December 21, 2012 (the " _End Date_ "); 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 9.1(c) shall not be available to a Party whose failure to fulfill any
obligation under this Agreement materially contributed to the failure of the
Effective Time to occur on or before such date (other than, in the case of
Parent, its failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement solely as a result of
the Lenders being unwilling or unable to provide the Debt Financing at or
prior to the time the Closing was required to occur pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement in circumstances under which Parent complied with its
obligations under Section 7.10);

  



  

(d) by Parent, so long as it is not then in material breach of its
obligations under this Agreement, if (i) any of the representations or
warranties of the Company herein is or becomes untrue or inaccurate such that
the condition set forth in Section 8.2(a) becomes incapable of being
satisfied, or (ii) there has been a breach on the part of the Company of any
of its covenants or agreements herein such that the condition set forth in
Section 8.2(b) becomes incapable of being satisfied; _provided_ that, in the
case of clauses (i) or (ii) above, as applicable, (x) such breach cannot be
cured by the Company by the day prior to the End Date or (y) if capable of
being cured, shall not have commenced to have been cured (1) within 15
calendar days following receipt of written notice from Parent of such breach
or (2) any shorter period of time that remains between the date Parent
provides written notice of such breach and the day prior to End Date;

  



  

(e) by the Company, so long as it is not then in material breach of
its obligations under this Agreement, if (i) any of the representations or
warranties of either of Parent or Merger Sub herein is or becomes untrue or
inaccurate such that the condition set forth in Section 8.3(a) becomes
incapable of being satisfied, or (ii) there has been a breach on the part of
either of Parent or Merger Sub of any of its covenants or agreements herein,
not including the covenants and agreements set forth in Section 7.10, such
that the condition set forth in Section 8.3(b) becomes incapable of being
satisfied; _provided_ that, in the case of clauses (i) or (ii) above, as
applicable, (x) such breach cannot be cured by Parent or Merger Sub by the day
prior to the End Date or (y) if capable of being cured, shall not have
commenced to have been cured (1) within 15 calendar days following receipt of
written notice from the Company of such breach or (2) any shorter period of
time that remains between the date the Company provides written notice of
such breach and the day prior to the End Date;

  



  

(f) by Parent if the Company Board shall have (i) effected a Change
of Recommendation or (ii) entered into any Acquisition Proposal Documentation;

  



  

(g) by the Company, prior to the receipt of the Company Required
Vote, if the Company Board shall have (i) effected a Change of
Recommendation or (ii) entered into any Acquisition Proposal Documentation;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be entitled to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(g) unless (x) the Company has
complied with the requirements of Section 7.6 that the Company is required to
satisfy before taking action pursuant to this Section 9.1(g) and (y) prior to
or concurrent with such termination the Company pays the fee due under
Section 9.3;

  



   

-60- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(h) by the Company if (i) the Marketing Period has ended and the
conditions set forth in Sections 8.1 and 8.2 (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the
Closing) have been satisfied on the date the Closing should have been
consummated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, (ii) the Company has
irrevocably confirmed by notice to Parent after the end of the Marketing
Period that all conditions set forth in Section 8.3 have been satisfied (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions
taken at the Closing) or that it is willing to waive any unsatisfied
conditions in Section 8.3 and (iii) the Merger shall not have been
consummated on the Business Day following the delivery of such
notice; provided, that notwithstanding anything in Section 9.1(c) to the
contrary, no Party shall be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.1(c) prior to the end of the Business Day following delivery of the
notice referred to in clause (ii) above; or

  



  

(i)  by Parent or the Company if the Merger is not adopted by the
Company Stockholders by the Company Required Vote at the Company
Stockholder Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof.

  



  

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. Subject to Section 9.3, in
the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the Company as
provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have
no effect, and none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, any of their
respective Subsidiaries or any of the Representatives of any of them shall
have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i)
except as otherwise provided herein and subject to Section 10.9(b) (including
the limitation on liability set forth therein), no such termination shall
relieve any Party of any liability for damages to another Party resulting from
a knowing or intentional breach of this Agreement or fraud and (ii) the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Guarantee, the expense reimbursement and
indemnification provisions of Section 7.10(f), the provisions of Section
7.2(b), this Section 9.2, Section 9.3 and Article X shall survive any
termination of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 9.3 _Termination Fees_.

  



  

(a) If this Agreement is terminated:

  



  

(i) pursuant to Section 9.1(f) or Section 9.1(g); or

  



  

(ii) (A) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(c),
provided that the Company Stockholder Meeting shall not have occurred
prior to the End Date, (B) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section
9.1(i), _provided_ that, in the case of termination pursuant to Section
9.1(i) at the time of the stockholder vote, the Financing Commitments shall
not have been terminated, withdrawn or rescinded without being replaced by
alternative financing commitments sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or (C) by Parent pursuant to Section
9.1(d)(i) or (ii) and, in each case, (1) after the date hereof and prior to
the Termination Date, any Third Party shall have publicly made a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal; (2) within twelve months after the Termination Date,
the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal; and (3) the transactions contemplated in such definitive agreement
are thereafter consummated (solely for purposes of this Section 9.3(a), all
references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to "25%" shall be
increased to "50%"),

  



   

-61-

--- 

    



  

then the Company shall pay Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, the sum of $48,000,000 (the " _Company Termination Fee_ "); provided
that, if this Agreement is terminated prior to the Cut-off Date (or, in the
event an Acquisition Proposal is made less than three full Business Days
prior to the Cut-off Date by a Person or group that at such time is an
Excluded Party, terminated promptly following the three (or two) business day
period referred to in Section 7.6(e)) by (x) the Company pursuant to Section
9.1(g) in order to enter into Acquisition Proposal Documentation with a
Person or group that at the time of submitting such Acquisition Proposal
was an Excluded Party, or (y) by Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(f) and the
event giving rise to the termination is the submission of an Acquisition
Proposal by a Person or group that at the time of submitting such Acquisition
Proposal was an Excluded Party, then the Company Termination Fee shall be
equal to $24,000,000. The payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be made
(i) in the case of payment pursuant to Section 9.3(a)(i), (A) if the
Agreement has been terminated pursuant to 9.1(f), within two Business Days
after the termination and (B) if the Agreement has been terminated pursuant to
9.1(g), simultaneously with such termination and (ii) in the case of
termination pursuant to Section 9.3(a)(ii), two Business Days after the
consummation of the Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 9.1(e) or Section 9.1(h), then Parent shall pay to the Company by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, the sum of $119,000,000 (the "
_Parent Termination Fee_ ") as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in
any event, within two Business Days) following the date of termination of this
Agreement.

  



  

(c) In the event that: (i) the Company terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.1(g) or Section 9.1(i); or (ii) Parent terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(d), Section 9.1(f) or Section 9.1(i); then
in any such event, the Company shall pay Parent or its designees by wire
transfer of same day funds, as promptly as possible (but in any event within
two Business Days) following the delivery by Parent of an invoice therefor,
all reasonably documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by Parent,
Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Financing; provided that the Company shall not be required to pay more than
an aggregate of $7 million in fees and expenses pursuant to this Section
9.3(c).

  



  

(d) The Company and Parent agree that the obligations contained in
Section 9.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, that without the Parties' agreement to discharge such obligations,
Parent and the Company would not have entered into this Agreement, and that
each of the Company Termination Fee and the Parent Termination Fee constitutes
liquidated damages incurred by the applicable Party and is not a penalty.
Accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails promptly to
pay the fee due pursuant to Section 9.3, and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent or the Company commences a proceeding that results in an award against
the other Party for such fee, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall
pay to the other Party its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and
expenses) in connection with such proceeding, together with interest on the
amount of the applicable fee from the date such payment was required to be
made until the date of payment at the prime lending rate as published in The
Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made.

 GENERAL PROVISIONS

  



  

Section 10.1 _Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties_. None
of the representations or warranties in this Agreement or in any document or
instrument delivered pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement shall

delivered pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement that by its terms
applies in whole or in part after the Effective Time.

  



  

Section 10.2 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law,
this Agreement may be amended by the Parties, by action taken or authorized by
their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that after receipt of the Company Required Vote,
there may not be any amendment of this Agreement that, by applicable Law or in
accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange, requires further
approval of the Company Stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

Time, the Parties may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for

extension or waiver of this Agreement that decreases the Merger
Consideration or that adversely affects the rights of the Company
Stockholders hereunder without the approval of such Company Stockholders.
Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
Party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance
with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a
waiver of, or estoppels with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

Section 10.8 _Governing Law; Venue_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any
applicable conflicts of law provisions (except to the extent that mandatory
provisions of federal Law apply). Each of the Parties hereby
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Delaware
Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be
unavailable, any court of the State of Delaware or the United States District
Court for the District of the State of Delaware) for the purpose of any Legal
Proceeding arising out of this Agreement, or any of the agreements or
transactions contemplated hereby, brought by or against any other Party
hereto, and hereby irrevocably agrees (a) that all claims in respect of any
such Legal Proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court and (b)
not to commence any Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement in any
other court or before any other Governmental Entity. Each Party irrevocably
and unconditionally waives and agrees not to assert in any such Legal
Proceeding, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
(i) any objection to the laying of venue of any such Legal Proceeding brought
in any such court, (ii) any claim that such Party is not personally subject to
the jurisdiction of any such court, or (iii) any claim that any such Legal
Proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum (if brought in any such
court). Each Party certifies and acknowledges that (A) no Representative of
any other Party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other
Party would not, in the event of litigation under this Section 10.8, seek to
enforce any of the foregoing waivers, (B) it understands and has considered
the implications of such waivers and (C) it makes such waivers voluntarily.
Each Party agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document in
accordance with the provisions of Section 10.5 shall be effective service of
process for any Legal Proceeding brought against such Party in any such court.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party agrees that a final judgment in any
such Legal Proceeding brought in any such court shall be conclusive and
binding upon such Party and may be enforced in any other court to whose
jurisdiction such Party is or may be subject, by suit upon such judgment.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the Parties hereby agrees
that it will not bring or support any Legal Proceeding against the Financing
Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any
forum other than a court of competent jurisdiction located within the Borough
of Manhattan in the City of New York, New York, whether a state or Federal
court, and that the provisions of Section 10.14 relating to the waiver of
jury trial shall apply to any such Legal Proceeding. The Financing Sources are
express third party beneficiaries of this Section 10.8(b).

Section 10.9 _Remedies_.

  



  

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any provision of this Agreement is not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, or any other appropriate form of equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of competent jurisdiction, in each case, in
accordance with Section 10.8, without proof of damages or otherwise (and each
Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled under the terms of this Agreement at law or in
equity, except as otherwise provided in Section 10.9(b). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the right of the Company to obtain an injunction, or other
appropriate form of equitable relief to cause, or to cause Parent and Merger
Sub to cause, the Equity Financing to be funded (but not the right of the
Company to obtain an injunction, or other appropriate form of equitable
relief, for any other reason) at any time shall be subject to the requirement
that (i) the Marketing Period has ended and all the applicable conditions set
forth in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2 would have been satisfied if the Closing
were to have occurred at such time (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing), (ii) the Debt
Financing (or, in the case alternative financing has been obtained in
accordance with Section 7.10, such alternative financing) has been funded
in accordance with the terms thereof or would be funded in accordance with
the terms thereof at the Closing if the Equity Financing were to be funded at
the Closing, and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed to Parent in
writing that if the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing were funded, it
would take such actions that are within its control to cause the Closing to
occur. The Parties agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement
is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor
to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy.
Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges and agrees that (i) each Party
shall be entitled to seek to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of
this Agreement notwithstanding the availability of any monetary remedy set
forth in Sections 9.3 and 10.9(b), (ii) the provisions set forth in Sections
9.3 and 10.9(b) (A) are not intended to and do not adequately compensate for
the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement and (B) shall not
be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Party's right
to specific enforcement, and (iii) the right of specific enforcement is an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into
this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary:

  



  

(i) other than the Company's right to receive specific performance
in accordance with this Section 10.9, the Company's right to receive payment
from Parent of the Parent Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Company and its Subsidiaries and stockholders against Sponsor,
Parent, Merger Sub, the Financing Sources and any of their respective former,
current or future general or limited partners, equityholders, stockholders,
controlling persons, management companies, members, managers,
directors, officers, employees, agents, assignees or Affiliates and any and
all former, current or future heirs, executors, administrators, trustees,
successors or assigns of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Parent Related
Parties_ ") for all losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a
breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such
amount, none of the Parent Related Parties shall have any further liability
or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (except that Parent shall be obligated to the
Company under the provisions of Section 7.2(b), Section 9.3(d) and for any of
its expense reimbursement and indemnification obligations contained in Section
7.10(f));

  



  

(ii) in connection with any loss suffered as a result of any breach
of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the failure of the Merger
to be consummated, or in respect of any oral representation made or alleged to
have been made in connection herewith, in each case, other than in a
circumstance in which the Company is permitted to terminate this Agreement and
receive the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section 9.3, the Company
agrees that the maximum aggregate monetary liability of Parent and Merger Sub
and the Financing Sources, if any, shall be limited to an amount equal to the
amount of the Parent Termination Fee, and in no event shall the Company seek
to recover any money damages in excess of such amount (except that Parent
shall be obligated to the Company under the provisions of Section 7.2(b),
Section 9.3(d) and for any of its expense reimbursement and indemnification
obligations contained in Section 7.10(f)); and

  



   

-67- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(iii) in the event the Company Termination Fee is paid to Parent (or
its designees) in the circumstances in which such fee is payable pursuant to
Section 9.3, payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Parent Related Parties against the Company and its
Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future general or
limited partners, stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers,
employees, agents or Affiliates (collectively, the " _Company Related Parties_
") for all losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach
or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount,
none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (except that the Company shall be obligated to
Parent under the provisions of Section 7.2(b), Section 9.3(c) and Section
9.3(d)).

  



  

For the avoidance of doubt, while the Company may pursue both a grant of
specific performance with regard to the Equity Financing in accordance
with Section 10.9(a) and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee under
Section 9.3, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance with regard to the
Equity Financing of the type contemplated by the third sentence of Section
10.9(a) and monetary damages, including all or any portion of the Parent
Termination Fee. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the fact that the
Parties have agreed to this Section 10.9(b) shall not be deemed to affect any
Party's right to specific enforcement under Section 10.9(a).

  



  

Section 10.10 _Performance Guaranty_. Parent hereby guarantees the
due, prompt and faithful performance and discharge by, and compliance with,
all of the obligations, covenants, terms, conditions and undertakings of
Merger Sub under this agreement in accordance with the terms
hereof, including any such obligations, covenants, terms, conditions and
undertakings that are required to be performed discharged or complied with
following the Effective Time.

  



  

Section 10.11 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this
Agreement that is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability
without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions
of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the
terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction, and if any
provision of this Agreement is determined to be unenforceable as written, the
provision shall be interpreted (and deemed modified) in such a way as to make
it enforceable while preserving as closely as possible the original intent of
the Parties in respect of such provision.

Section 10.12 _Publicity_. Subject to the provisions of Section 7.6,
unless and until a Change of Recommendation has occurred in accordance with
Section 7.6(e), Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall consult with each
other before issuing any press release with respect to the Merger or this
Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement without the prior consent of the other Party, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that a Party may, without the prior consent of the other Party (but after
prior consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances) issue
such press release or make such public statement or SEC filing as may, upon
the advice of outside counsel to such Party, be required by law, the rules
and regulations of any applicable stock exchange (including the NYSE) or
