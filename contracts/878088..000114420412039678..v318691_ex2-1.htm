any provision contained herein to the contrary, each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Company and Parent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article III such amounts as it is required

paid over to the appropriate Tax authority shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person

such court). Each Party certifies and acknowledges that (A) no Representative of any other Party has represented, expressly or

Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance

the terms and provisions hereof in any court of competent jurisdiction, in each case, in accordance with Section 10.8, without
proof of damages or otherwise (and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection
with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under the terms of this Agreement at law
or in equity, except as otherwise provided in Section 10.9(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the right of the Company to obtain
an injunction, or other appropriate form of equitable relief to cause, or to cause Parent and Merger Sub to cause, the Equity Financing

other reason) at any time shall be subject to the requirement that (i) the Marketing Period has ended and all the applicable conditions
set forth in Section 8.1 and Section&nbsp;8.2 would have been satisfied if the Closing were to have occurred at such time (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing), (ii) the Debt Financing (or, in
the case alternative financing has been obtained in accordance with Section 7.10, such alternative financing) has been funded in
accordance with the terms thereof or would be funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing if the Equity Financing
were to be funded at the Closing, and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed to Parent in writing that if the Equity Financing
and the Debt Financing were funded, it would take such actions that are within its control to cause the Closing to occur. The Parties
agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason,
nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges and
agrees that (i)&nbsp;each Party shall be entitled to seek to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement notwithstanding
the availability of any monetary remedy set forth in Sections 9.3 and 10.9(b), (ii) the provisions set forth in Sections 9.3 and
10.9(b) (A) are not intended to and do not adequately compensate for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement
and (B)&nbsp;shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Party&rsquo;s right to specific enforcement,
and (iii) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without
that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.</P>
