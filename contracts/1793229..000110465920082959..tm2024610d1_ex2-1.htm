new shares of Class B Common Stock will, to the extent possible, equal the
proportion of (A) the Closing Share Consideration multiplied by $10.00 to (B)
the Closing Cash Consideration, and (iv) each existing share of Company
Common Stock as of immediately prior to such Permitted Recapitalization will
be exchanged (which may be by merger of a newly formed wholly owned
subsidiary with and into the Company) for such new shares of Company Class A
Common Stock and Company Class B Common Stock (the " _Pre-Closing
Recapitalization_ ").

documents required to be filed by it with the SEC since February 13, 2020
(collectively, as they have been amended since the time of their filing and
including all exhibits thereto, the " _SEC Reports_ "). None of the SEC
Reports, as of their respective dates (or if amended or superseded by a
filing prior to the date of this Agreement or the Closing Date, then on the
date of such filing), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
audited financial statements and unaudited interim financial statements
(including, in each case, the notes and schedules thereto) included in the
SEC Reports complied as to form in all material respects with the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, were prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto and except with
respect to unaudited statements as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and
fairly present (subject, in the case of the unaudited interim financial
statements included therein, to normal year-end adjustments and the absence
of complete footnotes) in all material respects the financial position of
Acquiror as of the respective dates thereof and the results of their
operations and cash flows for the respective periods then ended. No Acquiror
Party has any material off-balance sheet arrangements that are not disclosed
in the SEC Reports.

  



  

(b) Acquiror has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act).
Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material
information relating to Acquiror is made known to Acquiror's principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer, particularly during the
periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are
being prepared. To Acquiror's knowledge, such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective in timely alerting Acquiror's principal executive
officer and principal financial officer to material information required to
be included in Acquiror's periodic reports required under the Exchange Act.

  



  

(c) Acquiror has established and maintained a system of internal
controls. To Acquiror's knowledge, such internal controls are sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of Acquiror's financial
reporting and the preparation of Acquiror's financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP.

  



  

(d) There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit
made by Acquiror to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the
Exchange Act) or director of Acquiror. Acquiror has not taken any action
prohibited by Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  



  

(e) Neither Acquiror (including any employee thereof) nor
Acquiror's independent auditors has identified or been made aware of (i)
any significant deficiency or material weakness in the system of internal
accounting controls utilized by Acquiror, (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves Acquiror's management or other employees who have a
role in the preparation of financial statements or the internal accounting
controls utilized by Acquiror or (iii) any claim or allegation regarding any
of the foregoing.

  



  

(f) To the knowledge of Acquiror, as of the date hereof, there are
no outstanding SEC comments from the SEC with respect to the SEC Reports. To
the knowledge of Acquiror, none of the SEC Reports filed on or prior to the
date hereof is subject to ongoing SEC review or investigation as of the date
hereof.

in the aggregate, material to Acquiror and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole), (ii) that have arisen since the date of Acquiror's
consolidated balance sheet for the three months ended March 31, 2020 in the

Section 6.13 _PIPE Investment_.

  



  

(a) Acquiror has delivered to the Company true, correct and
complete copies of each of the Subscription Agreements entered into by

(i) the Common PIPE Investors have committed to provide equity financing to
Acquiror solely for purposes of consummating the Transactions in the aggregate
amount of $1,300,000,000 (the  " _Common PIPE Investment Amount_ ") and (ii)
the Convertible PIPE Investors have committed to provide convertible debt
financing to Acquiror solely for purposes of consummating the Transactions in
the aggregate amount of $1,300,000,000 (the  " _Convertible PIPE Investment

PIPE Investor, the Subscription Agreement with such PIPE Investor is in full
force and effect and has not been withdrawn or terminated, or otherwise
amended or modified, in any respect, and no withdrawal, termination,
amendment or modification is contemplated by Acquiror. Each Subscription
Agreement is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Acquiror and, to the
knowledge of Acquiror, each PIPE Investor, and neither the execution or
delivery by any party thereto nor the performance of any party's obligations
under any such Subscription Agreement violates any Laws. The Subscription
Agreements provide that the Company is a party thereto and is entitled to
enforce such agreements against the PIPE Investor. There are no other
agreements, side letters, or arrangements between Acquiror and any PIPE
Investor relating to any Subscription Agreement that could affect the
obligation of such PIPE Investors to contribute to Acquiror the applicable
portion of the PIPE Investment Amount set forth in the Subscription Agreement
of such PIPE Investors, and, as of the date hereof, Acquiror does not know of
any facts or circumstances that may reasonably be expected to result in any of
the conditions set forth in any Subscription Agreement not being satisfied,
or the PIPE Investment Amount not being available to Acquiror, on the Closing
Date. No event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Acquiror under any
material term or condition of any Subscription Agreement and, as of the date
hereof, Acquiror has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy
in all material respects on a timely basis any term or condition of closing to
be satisfied by it contained in any Subscription Agreement. The Subscription
Agreements contain all of the conditions precedent (other than the conditions
contained in the other Transaction Agreements) to the obligations of the PIPE
Investors to contribute to Acquiror the applicable portion of the PIPE
Investment Amount set forth in the Subscription Agreements on the terms
therein.

  



  

(b) No fees, consideration or other discounts are payable or have

any party's obligations under, the Sponsor Agreement violates any provision
of, or results in the breach of or default under, or require any filing,
registration or qualification under, any applicable Law. No event has occurred
that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default or breach on the part of Acquiror under any material term or condition
of the Sponsor Agreement.

effect and has not been withdrawn or terminated, or otherwise amended or
modified, in any respect, and no withdrawal, termination, amendment or
modification is contemplated by Acquiror or to the knowledge of Acquiror, any
other party thereto. Each Non-Redemption Agreement is a legal, valid and
binding obligation of Acquiror and, to the knowledge of Acquiror, each other
party thereto, and neither the execution or delivery by any party thereto, nor
the performance of any party's obligations under, any such Non-Redemption
Agreement violates any Laws. The Non-Redemption Agreements,
collectively, shall provide for the subscription of up to 28,979,500 shares
of Acquiror Class A Common Stock, at a price per share of no less than the
"Purchase Price" specified therein, to backstop any breach of any non-
redemption obligations under the Non-Redemption Agreements by the
counterparty thereto and such shares shall be in addition to (and for the
avoidance of doubt, not in lieu of) the shares of Acquiror Class A Common
Stock to be issued by Acquiror in connection with the Common PIPE
Investment and pursuant to the Common Subscription Agreements. No event has
occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Acquiror under any material term
or condition of any Non-Redemption Agreement.

the SEC Reports or in connection with the PIPE Investment, there are no
transactions, Contracts, side letters, arrangements or understandings between

stockholder, warrant holder or Affiliate of such Acquiror Party.

in 31 C.F.R. Part 800.244) will acquire a substantial interest in the Company

Organizational Documents, and the Trust Agreement and understands that
Acquiror has established the Trust Account described therein for the benefit
of Acquiror's public stockholders and that disbursements from the Trust
Account are available only in the limited circumstances set forth in the Trust
Agreement. The Company and Holdings further acknowledges that, if the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or, in the event of a
termination of this Agreement, another Business Combination, are not
consummated by February 19, 2022 or such later date as approved by the
stockholders of Acquiror to complete a Business Combination, Acquiror will be
obligated to return to its stockholders the amounts being held in the Trust

claim of any kind against, and any right to access, the Trust Account or to
collect from the Trust Account any monies that may be owed to them by Acquiror
or any of its Affiliates for any reason whatsoever, and will not seek
recourse against the Trust Account at any time for any reason whatsoever. This

Company's or Holdings' right to pursue a claim against Acquiror or any of its
Affiliates for legal relief against assets held outside the Trust Account
(including from and after the consummation of a Business Combination other
than as contemplated by this Agreement) or pursuant to _Section 12.13_ for
specific performance or other injunctive relief. This _Section 7.04 _shall
survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason.

sheets and consolidated condensed statements of income and comprehensive

Subsidiaries as at and for the three-months ended March 31, 2020 and March 31,

Company shall be available to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to make their officers and employees
available to, in each case, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advanced notice, Acquiror and its counsel in connection with (A)
the drafting of the Proxy Statement and (B) responding in a timely manner to
comments on the Proxy Statement from the SEC. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Company shall reasonably cooperate with Acquiror in
connection with the preparation for inclusion in the Proxy Statement of pro
forma financial statements that comply with the requirements of Regulation
S-X under the rules and regulations of the SEC (as interpreted by the staff
of the SEC).

  



  

(b) From and after the date on which the Proxy Statement is mailed
to Acquiror's stockholders, the Company will give Acquiror prompt written
notice of any action taken or not taken by the Company or its Subsidiaries or
of any development regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries, in any such
case which is or becomes known by the Company, that would cause the Proxy
Statement to contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact necessary in order to make the statements, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ , _that_
, if any such action shall be taken or fail to be taken or such development
shall otherwise occur, Acquiror and the Company shall cooperate fully to cause
an amendment or supplement to be made promptly to the Proxy Statement, such
that the Proxy Statement no longer contains an untrue statement of a material
fact or omits to state to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that no information received
by Acquiror pursuant to this _Section 7.05_ shall operate as a waiver or
otherwise affect any representation, warranty or agreement given or made by
the party who disclosed such information, and no such information shall be
deemed to change, supplement or amend the Schedules.

Section 7.06 _Code Section 280G_. To the extent that any
"disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code
and the regulations thereunder) has the right to receive any payments or
benefits that could be deemed to constitute  "parachute payments" (within the
meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A) of the Code and the regulations
thereunder), then, the Company will: (a) no later than six days prior to the
Closing Date, solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from each
such "disqualified individual" a waiver of such disqualified individual's
rights to some or all of such payments or benefits (the " _Waived 280G
Benefits_ ") so that any remaining payments and/or benefits shall not be
deemed to be "excess parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G
of the Code and the regulations thereunder); and (b) no later than three days
prior to the Closing Date, with respect to each individual who agrees to the
waiver described in clause (a), submit to a vote of holders of the equity
interests of the Company entitled to vote on such matters, in the manner
required under Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, along with adequate disclosure intended to satisfy such
requirements (including QandA 7 of Section 1.280G-1 of such regulations), the
right of any such "disqualified individual" to receive the Waived 280G

such waivers and approval, the Company shall provide drafts of such waivers
and approval materials to Acquiror for its reasonable review and comment, and
the Company shall consider in good faith any changes reasonably requested by
Acquiror. No later than seven days prior to soliciting the waivers, the
Company shall provide Acquiror with the calculations and related
documentation to determine whether and to what extent the vote described in
this _Section 7.06_ is necessary in order to avoid the imposition of Taxes
under Section 4999 of the Code. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver to Acquiror evidence that a vote of the stockholders of the Company
was solicited in accordance with the foregoing and whether the requisite
number of votes of the stockholders of the Company was obtained with respect
to the Waived 280G Benefits or that the vote did not pass and the Waived 280G
Benefits will not be paid or retained.

  



  

Section 7.07 _Certain Transaction Agreements_. Except to the
extent provided in writing by the Acquiror, neither Holdings nor the Company
shall permit any amendment or modification to be made to any Voting and
Support Agreement to the extent that such amendment or modification would
reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the closing of the
Transactions. Holdings and the Company shall take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
to satisfy in all material respects on a timely basis all conditions and
covenants applicable to Holdings and the Company in each Voting and Support
Agreement and otherwise comply with its obligations thereunder and to enforce
its rights under each such agreement, except to the extent that the vote(s)
of the holder(s) of outstanding shares of Acquiror Common Stock entitled to
vote at the Special Meeting party thereto is reasonably determined by
Holdings and the Company not to be required or necessary in order to obtain
approval of the Acquiror Stockholder Matters or to the extent that the failure
of Holdings or the Company to enforce such rights would not reasonable be
expected to materially and adversely affect the closing of the Transactions.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Holdings and the Company
shall give the Acquiror, prompt written notice: (a) of any breach or default
(or any threatened breach or default) by any party to any Voting and Support
Agreement known to Holdings or the Company; or (b) of the receipt of any
written notice or other written communication from any other party to any
Voting and Support Agreement with respect to any actual, potential,

Section 8.02 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

  



  

(a) From and after the First Effective Time, Acquiror agrees that
it shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former
director, manager and officer of the Company and Acquiror and each of their
respective Subsidiaries against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any Action, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the First Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the First Effective Time, to the
fullest extent that the Company, Acquiror or their respective Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, would have been permitted under applicable Law and their
respective certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational
documents in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify such Person
(including the advancing of expenses as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law). Without limiting the foregoing, Acquiror
shall cause the Surviving Entity and each of its Subsidiaries to, (i)
maintain for a period of not less than six years from the First Effective
Time provisions in its certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other
organizational documents concerning the indemnification and exoneration
(including provisions relating to expense advancement) of officers and
directors/managers that are no less favorable to those Persons than the
provisions of such certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other
organizational documents as of the date of this Agreement and (ii) not amend,
repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in any respect that would
adversely affect the rights of those Persons thereunder, in each case, except
as required by Law.

  



  

(b) For a period of six years from the First Effective Time,
Acquiror shall, or shall cause one or more of its Subsidiaries to,
maintain in effect directors' and officers' liability insurance covering
those Persons who are currently covered by the Company's or any of its
Subsidiaries' directors' and officers' liability insurance policies (true,
correct and complete copies of which have been heretofore made available to
Acquiror or its agents or representatives) on terms not less favorable
than the terms of such current insurance coverage, except that in no event
shall Acquiror or its Subsidiaries be required to pay an annual premium for
such insurance in excess of 300% of the aggregate annual premium payable by
the Company and its Subsidiaries for such insurance policy for the year ended
December 31, 2019; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Acquiror may cause
coverage to be extended under the current directors' and officers' liability
insurance by obtaining a six-year  "tail" policy containing terms not
materially less favorable than the terms of such current insurance coverage
with respect to claims existing or occurring at or prior to the First
Effective Time (the " _D andO Tail_") and (ii) if any claim is asserted or made
within such six-year period, any insurance required to be maintained under
this _Section 8.02_ shall be continued in respect of such claim until the
final disposition thereof.

(c) Acquiror and the Company hereby acknowledge (on behalf of
themselves and their respective Subsidiaries) that the indemnified Persons
under this _Section 8.02_ may have certain rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by current stockholders,
members, or other Affiliates of such stockholders or members (" _Indemnitee
Affiliates_ ") separate from the indemnification obligations of the Acquiror,
the Company and their respective Subsidiaries hereunder. The Parties hereby
agree (i) that the Acquiror, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries are
the indemnitors of first resort (i.e., its obligations to the indemnified
Persons under this _Section 8.02_ are primary and any obligation of any
Indemnitee Affiliate to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for
the same expenses or liabilities incurred by the indemnified Persons under
this _Section 8.02_ are secondary), (ii) that the Acquiror, the Company and
their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to advance the full amount of
expenses incurred by the indemnified Persons under this _Section 8.02_ and
shall be liable for the full amount of all expenses, judgments, penalties,
fines and amounts paid in settlement to the extent legally permitted and
required by the Acquiror's, the Company's and their respective Subsidiaries'
governing documents or any director or officer indemnification agreements,
without regard to any rights the indemnified Persons under this  _Section
8.02_ may have against any Indemnitee Affiliate, and (iii) that the Parties
(on behalf of themselves and their respective Subsidiaries) irrevocably
waive, relinquish and release the Indemnitee Affiliates from any and all
claims against the Indemnitee Affiliates for contribution, subrogation or any
other recovery of any kind in respect thereof.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, this _Section 8.02_ shall survive the consummation of the
First Merger indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on
Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Entity and all
successors and assigns of Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation and the
Surviving Entity. In the event that Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or
the Surviving Entity or any of their respective successors or assigns
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or the
Surviving Entity, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set
forth in this _Section 8.02_.

  



  

Section 8.03 _Conduct of Acquiror During the Interim Period_.

  



  

(a) During the Interim Period, except as set forth on _Schedule
8.03_ or as contemplated by this Agreement or as consented to by the Company
in writing (which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld,
delayed or denied, except, in the case of clauses (i), (ii), (iv), (vi) and
(vii) below, as to which the Company's consent may be granted or withheld in
its sole discretion), Acquiror shall not and each shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to:

Organizational Documents or the organizational documents of First Merger

process (including pursuant to the Securities Laws or the rules of any
national securities exchange), in which case Acquiror or the Company, as
applicable, shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain such consent
with respect to such announcement or communication with the other Party, prior

_Section 9.05_, each Party and its Affiliates may make announcements
regarding the status and terms (including price terms) of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby to their respective directors, officers,
employees, direct and indirect current or prospective limited partners and

Section 9.07 _Redemption of Senior PIK Toggle Notes_. The Company
may (or may cause Polaris Intermediate to), to the extent permitted by and in
accordance with the Senior PIK Toggle Notes and the Senior PIK Toggle Notes
Indenture and without breach of this Agreement, prior to or substantially
simultaneously with the First Effective Time, (i) issue or cause to be issued
a conditional notice of optional redemption (which redemption shall be
subject to the satisfaction of the conditions that the Closing has occurred
and that Acquiror has received all or a portion, as applicable, of the
Convertible PIPE Investment Amount) in respect of all, in the case that 100%
of the Convertible PIPE Investment Amount is received by Acquiror at the
First Effective Time, or a portion (as determined below), in the case that
less than 100% of the Convertible PIPE Investment Amount is received by
Acquiror at the Effective Time, of the then-outstanding Senior PIK Toggle
Notes pursuant to the redemption provisions of the Senior PIK Toggle Notes
Indenture, and (ii) take such other actions as it determines to facilitate
redemption of such Senior PIK Toggle Notes pursuant to the redemption and, if
applicable, the satisfaction and discharge provisions of the Senior PIK
Toggle Notes Indenture at or as promptly as possible after the Closing. At the
Closing, in the case that all the then-outstanding Senior PIK Toggle Notes
are required to be redeemed, or prior to the redemption date, in the
case that a portion of the then outstanding Senior PIK Toggle Notes are
required to be redeemed, Acquiror shall deposit (or shall cause to be
deposited) with the trustee under the Senior PIK Toggle Notes Indenture
sufficient funds to effect such redemption and, if applicable, the
satisfaction and discharge of the Senior PIK Toggle Notes (the " _Senior PIK
Toggle Notes Redemption_ "). In the case that a portion of the then-
outstanding Senior PIK Toggle Notes is required to be redeemed pursuant to
this _Section 9.07_, such portion shall be determined by Acquiror and the
Company after taking into account the Convertible PIPE Investment
Amount actually funded as of the First Effective Time and payment of fees and
expenses relating to the Transactions and costs associated with the
redemption of such Senior PIK Toggle Notes, including accrued interest and any
premium. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, reasonably
cooperate with Acquiror in connection with any Senior PIK Toggle Notes
Redemption. Any notice of optional redemption and other related documents
prepared by or on behalf of the Company in connection with the Senior PIK
Toggle Notes Redemption shall be subject to the prior review of, and
opportunity for comment by, Acquiror and its counsel.

a Party under this Agreement (including _Section 8.04_), prior to the
Closing, each Party shall use its respective reasonable best efforts, and
shall cause their respective officers, directors and employees to use their
reasonable best efforts to provide such customary cooperation in connection
with the timely arrangement and implementation of the debt financing
described in the Convertible Subscription Agreement(s) on the terms specified
therein as the other Party may reasonably request from time to time as long
as any such request is timely made so as not to delay the Closing, including:

date hereof and consistent with the Convertible Subscription Agreement(s),
including engaging a trustee and settlement agent (in Acquiror's reasonable
discretion);

  



  

(ii) assisting in the preparation of, and executing and
delivering, definitive financing documents, including documents contemplated
by or related to the Convertible Notes indenture, customary closing
certificates as may be required by the issuance of the Convertible
Notes (none of which shall be a solvency or similar certificate) and other
customary documents as may be reasonably requested by either Party (all of
which in the case of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be subject to the
occurrence of the Closing and none of which require the delivery of a legal
opinion); and

  



  

(iii) cooperating with the other Party, and taking all corporate
actions, subject to the occurrence of the Closing, reasonably requested by the
other Party to permit the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Convertible Subscription Agreement(s).

  



  

(b) Pursuant to one or more Subscription Agreements, one or more
of the PIPE Investors is required to deposit all or a portion of the
Common PIPE Investment and/or Convertible PIPE Investment Amount into an
escrow account two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing. In connection
therewith, Acquiror shall (in Acquiror's reasonable discretion) designate and
appoint one or more United States escrow agents and establish one or more
United States escrow accounts and complete all "know-your-customer"
information as required by such escrow agent as promptly as practicable after
the date hereof to hold prior to the Closing, and disburse to the Acquiror at
or prior to the closing thereof (and in any event prior to the Closing), the
portion of the Common PIPE Investment Amount and/or Convertible PIPE
Investment Amount, as applicable, subject thereto; _provided_ , however, the
Company hereby consents to the designation and appointment of State Street
Bank as United States escrow agent for all or a portion of the
Convertible PIPE Investment Amount.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, it
is understood and agreed that the condition precedent set forth in _Section
10.02(b)_, as applied to Holdings' and the Company's obligations under
_Section 9.08(a)_, shall be deemed to be satisfied unless the Convertible
PIPE Investment has not been obtained as a result of Holdings' or the
Company's intentional breach of its obligations under _Section 9.08(a)_ and
such intentional breach has been noticed at least 15 days prior to, and
remains uncured as of, the date Closing is scheduled to occur as determined in
accordance with _Section 4.01_.

manner permitted by Law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed
against any other Party in any other jurisdiction, in each case, to enforce
judgments obtained in any Action brought pursuant to this _Section 12.12_.
EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

Section 12.13 _Enforcement_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform their
obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take
such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement)
or any Transaction Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i)
the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance, or
other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement or any
Transaction Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
hereof and thereof, without proof of damages, prior to the valid termination
of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 11.01_, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement or any
Transaction Agreement, and (ii) the right of specific enforcement is an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without
that right, none of the Parties would have entered into this Agreement. Each
Party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of specific performance and
other equitable relief on the basis that the other Parties have an adequate
remedy at Law or that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at Law or equity. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that any Party seeking an injunction to prevent breaches of this Agreement or
any Transaction Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
of this Agreement or any Transaction Agreement in accordance with this
_Section 12.13_ shall not be required to provide any bond or other security
in connection with any such injunction. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, or the other provisions of this Agreement, Acquiror
acknowledges and agrees that Holdings or the Company may, without breach of
this Agreement, (a) with respect to any Transaction Agreement to which
Holdings or the Company is a party or a third party beneficiary thereof,
institute or pursue an Action directly against the counterparty(ies) to such
Transaction Agreement seeking, or seek or obtain a court order against the
counterparty(ies) to such Transaction Agreement for, injunctive relief,
specific performance, or other equitable relief with respect to such
Transaction Agreement, (b) with respect to any Transaction Agreement to which
Holdings or the Company is not a party or a third party beneficiary thereof,
be entitled, upon written notice to Acquiror, (I) require Acquiror to
enforce its rights under any such Transaction Agreement through the
initiation and pursuit of litigation (including seeking, or seek or obtain a
court order against the counterparty(ies) to such Transaction Agreement for,
injunctive relief, specific performance, or other equitable relief with
respect to such Transaction Agreement) in the event the counterparty under
such Transaction Agreement is in breach of its obligations thereunder, (II)
have approval rights over Acquiror's selection of counsel for any such
litigation (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), (III) select a separate counsel, which may be or include Counsel,
to participate alongside Acquiror's counsel in any such litigation (at the
expense of Holdings or the Company); _provided_ that such separate counsel
shall not be entitled to control or seek court orders on Acquiror's behalf,
and/or (IV) fund any such litigation and (c) require Acquiror to promptly
execute, and Acquiror hereby agrees to execute and comply with, any and all
documents designed to implement or facilitate the execution of the rights
contemplated in this sentence.

Section 12.14 _Non-Recourse_. Subject in all respect to the last
sentence, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim or cause
of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby may only be brought against, the
entities that are expressly named as Parties and then only with respect to
the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such Party. Except
to the extent a Party (and then only to the extent of the specific obligations
undertaken by such Party in this Agreement), (a) no past, present or future
director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder,
Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or representative or Affiliate of any
Party and (b) no past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney,
advisor or representative or Affiliate of any of the foregoing shall have any
liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more
of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other
obligations or liabilities of any one or more of the Company, Acquiror, First
Merger Sub or Second Merger Sub under this Agreement of or for any claim
based on, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section
12.14_ shall limit, amend or waive any rights or obligations of any party to
any Transaction Agreement.

  



  

Section 12.15 _Nonsurvival of Representations, Warranties and
Covenants_. None of the representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or
other agreements in this Agreement or in any certificate, statement or
instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement, including any rights
arising out of any breach of such representations, warranties, covenants,
obligations, agreements and other provisions, shall survive the Closing and
shall terminate and expire upon the occurrence of the Second Effective Time
(and there shall be no liability after the Closing in respect thereof),
except for (a) those covenants and agreements contained herein that by their
terms expressly apply in whole or in part at or after the Closing and then
only with respect to any breaches occurring at or after the Closing and (b)
this _Article XII_.

Section 12.16 _Acknowledgements_.

  



  

(a) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees (on its own behalf
and on behalf of its respective Affiliates and its and their
respective Representatives) that: (i) it has conducted its own independent
investigation of the financial condition, results of operations, assets,
liabilities, properties and projected operations of the other Parties (and
their respective Subsidiaries) and has been afforded satisfactory access to
the books and records, facilities and personnel of the other Parties (and
their respective Subsidiaries) for purposes of conducting such investigation;
(ii) the Company Representations constitute the sole and exclusive
representations and warranties of the Company in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) the Acquiror Party
Representations constitute the sole and exclusive representations and
warranties of Acquiror, First Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub; (iv)
except for the Company Representations by the Company and the Acquiror Party
Representations by the Acquiror Parties, none of the Parties or any other
Person makes, or has made, any other express or implied representation or
warranty with respect to any Party (or any Party's Subsidiaries), including
any implied warranty or representation as to condition, merchantability,
suitability or fitness for a particular purpose or trade as to any of the
assets of the such Party or its Subsidiaries or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and all other representations and warranties
of any kind or nature expressed or implied (including (x) regarding the
completeness or accuracy of, or any omission to state or to disclose, any
information, including in the estimates, projections or forecasts or any
other information, document or material provided to or made available to any
Party or their respective Affiliates or Representatives in certain "data
rooms," management presentations or in any other form in expectation of the
Transactions, including meetings, calls or correspondence with management of
any Party (or any Party's Subsidiaries), and (y) any relating to the future
or historical business, condition (financial or otherwise), results of
operations, prospects, assets or liabilities of any Party (or its
Subsidiaries), or the quality, quantity or condition of any Party's or its
Subsidiaries' assets) are specifically disclaimed by all Parties and their
respective Subsidiaries and all other Persons (including the
Representatives and Affiliates of any Party or its Subsidiaries); and (v)
each Party and its respective Affiliates are not relying on
any representations and warranties in connection with the Transactions except
the Company Representations by the Company and the Acquiror Party
Representations by the Acquiror Parties. The foregoing does not limit any
rights of any Party pursuant to any other Transaction Agreement against any
other Party pursuant to such Transaction Agreement to which it is a party or
an express third party beneficiary thereof. Except as otherwise expressly set
forth in this Agreement, Acquiror understands and agrees that any assets,
properties and business of the Company and its Subsidiaries are furnished "as
is", "where is" and subject to and except for the Company Representations by
the Company or as provided in any certificate delivered in accordance with
_Section 10.02(c)_, with all faults and without any other representation or
warranty of any nature whatsoever. Nothing in this _Section 12.16(a)_
shall relieve any Party of liability in the case of fraud committed by such
Party.

  



  

(b) Effective upon Closing, each of the Parties waives, on its own
behalf and on behalf of its respective Affiliates and Representatives, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, Actions and
causes of action it may have against any other Party or their respective
Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former Affiliates or
Representatives relating to the operation of any Party or its Subsidiaries or
their respective businesses or relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement, the Schedules, or the Exhibits to this Agreement, whether arising
under or based upon any federal, state, local or foreign statute, Law,
ordinance, rule or regulation or otherwise. Each Party acknowledges and agrees
that it will not assert, institute or maintain any Action, suit,
investigation, or proceeding of any kind whatsoever, including a counterclaim,
cross-claim, or defense, regardless of the legal or equitable theory under
which such liability or obligation may be sought to be imposed, that makes
any claim contrary to the agreements and covenants set forth in this _Section
12.16_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this
_Section 12.16(b)_ shall preclude any Party from seeking any remedy for
actual and intentional fraud by a Party solely and exclusively with respect
to the making of any representation or warranty by it in _Article V_ or
_Article VI_ (as applicable). Each Party shall have the right to enforce this
_Section 12.16_ on behalf of any Person that would be benefitted or
protected by this _Section 12.16_ if they were a party hereto. The
foregoing agreements, acknowledgements, disclaimers and waivers are
irrevocable. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section
12.16_ shall limit, modify, restrict or operate as a waiver with respect to,
any rights any Party may have under any written agreement entered into in
connection with the transactions that are contemplated by this Agreement,
including any other Transaction Agreement.

Section 12.17 _Provisions Respecting Representation of the Company_

  



  

(a) . Each of the Parties hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on
behalf of its directors, managers, members, partners, officers, employees and
Affiliates, that Kirkland and Ellis LLP and Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP
(collectively, " _Counsel_ ") may serve as counsel to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Holdings (individually and collectively,
the " _Seller Group_ "), on the other hand, in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
and that, following consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
Counsel (or any of its respective successors) may serve as counsel to Seller
Group or any director, manager, member, partner, officer, employee or
Affiliate of any member of Seller Group, in connection with any Action or
obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding such representation or any
continued representation of the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries, and
each of the Parties (on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates)
hereby consents thereto and irrevocably waives any conflict of interest
arising therefrom, and each of such parties shall cause any Affiliate thereof
to consent to irrevocably waive any conflict of interest arising from such
representation. The parties agree to take the steps necessary to ensure that
any privilege attaching as a result of Counsel representing the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall remain in effect, _provided_
 that such privilege from and after the Closing shall be controlled by
Holdings on behalf of the Seller Group. As to any privileged attorney-client
communications between Counsel and the Company or Counsel and any of the
Company's Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement prior to the Closing Date (collectively, the " _Privileged
Communications_ "), Acquiror, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries,
together with any of their respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries, successors or
assigns, agree that no such party may use or rely on any of the Privileged
Communications in any action against or involving any of the parties after
the Closing. In addition, if the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, all Privileged Communications
related to such transactions will become the property of (and be controlled
by) Holdings or its direct or indirect equityholders, and none of Acquiror,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates,
Subsidiaries, successors or assigns shall retain any copies of such records or
have any access to them. In the event that Acquiror is legally required or
requested by any Governmental Authority to access or obtain a copy of all or a
portion of the Privileged Communications, Acquiror shall be entitled to
access or obtain a copy of and disclose the Privileged Communications to the
extent necessary to comply with any such legal requirement or request;
_provided_ that Acquiror shall promptly notify Holdings in writing (prior to
the disclosure by Acquiror of any Privileged Communications to the extent
practicable) so that Holdings can seek a protective order, at its sole cost
and expense, and Acquiror agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to
assist therewith.
