occur in the event that the Parties do not perform their obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing
to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement) or any Transaction Agreement in accordance
with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i)&nbsp;the Parties shall
be entitled to an injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement or any Transaction
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof and thereof, without proof of damages, prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;11.01</U>, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled under this Agreement or any Transaction Agreement, and (ii)&nbsp;the right of specific enforcement is an integral
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, none of the Parties would have entered into this
Agreement. Each Party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis
that the other Parties have an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for
any reason at Law or equity. The Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an injunction to prevent breaches of this
Agreement or any Transaction Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement or any Transaction
Agreement in accordance with this <U>Section&nbsp;12.13</U> shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection
with any such injunction. </FONT>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, or the other provisions of this Agreement,
Acquiror acknowledges and agrees that Holdings or the Company may, without breach of this Agreement, (a)&nbsp;with respect to
any Transaction Agreement to which Holdings or the Company is a party or a third party beneficiary thereof, institute or pursue
an Action directly against the counterparty(ies) to such Transaction Agreement seeking, or seek or obtain a court order against
the counterparty(ies) to such Transaction Agreement for, injunctive relief, specific performance, or other equitable relief with
respect to such Transaction Agreement, (b)&nbsp;with respect to any Transaction Agreement to which Holdings or the Company is
not a party or a third party beneficiary thereof, be entitled, upon written notice to Acquiror, (I)&nbsp;require Acquiror to enforce
its rights under any such Transaction Agreement through the initiation and pursuit of litigation (including seeking, or seek or
obtain a court order against the counterparty(ies) to such Transaction Agreement for, injunctive relief, specific performance,
or other equitable relief with respect to such Transaction Agreement) in the event the counterparty under such Transaction Agreement
is in breach of its obligations thereunder, (II)&nbsp;have approval rights over Acquiror&rsquo;s selection of counsel for any
such litigation (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (III)&nbsp;select a separate counsel,
which may be or include Counsel, to participate alongside Acquiror&rsquo;s counsel in any such litigation (at the expense of Holdings
or the Company); <U>provided</U> that such separate counsel shall not be entitled to control or seek court orders on Acquiror&rsquo;s
behalf, and/or (IV)&nbsp;fund any such litigation and (c)&nbsp;require Acquiror to promptly execute, and Acquiror hereby agrees

consents thereto and irrevocably waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each of such parties shall cause any Affiliate
thereof to consent to irrevocably waive any conflict of interest arising from such representation. The parties agree to take the
steps necessary to ensure that any privilege attaching as a result of Counsel representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall remain in effect, <U>provided</U>
that such privilege from and after the Closing shall be controlled by Holdings on behalf of the Seller Group. As to any privileged

Acquiror, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, together with any of their respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries, successors
or assigns, agree that no such party may use or rely on any of the Privileged Communications in any action against or involving
any of the parties after the Closing. In addition, if the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, all Privileged Communications related to such transactions will become the property of (and be controlled by) Holdings
or its direct or indirect equityholders, and none of Acquiror, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Affiliates, Subsidiaries, successors or assigns shall retain any copies of such records or have any access to them. In the event
that Acquiror is legally required or requested by any Governmental Authority to access or obtain a copy of all or a portion of
the Privileged Communications, Acquiror shall be entitled to access or obtain a copy of and disclose the Privileged Communications
to the extent necessary to comply with any such legal requirement or request; <U>provided</U> that Acquiror shall promptly notify
Holdings in writing (prior to the disclosure by Acquiror of any Privileged Communications to the extent practicable) so that Holdings
can seek a protective order, at its sole cost and expense, and Acquiror agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist
therewith.</P>
