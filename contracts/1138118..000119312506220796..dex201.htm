satisfied at Closing) are satisfied or waived by the party or parties
permitted to do so, unless the parties hereto agree to another date and time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and Acquiror shall not be required to
effect the Closing prior to the later of (i) the earlier of (A) a date during
the Marketing Period specified by Parent  



 

11  on no less than three (3) Business Days prior written notice to the Company

date on which the Requested Consents shall have been obtained and the Debt

effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Surviving
Corporations by-laws, in each case until amended in accordance with
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such amendment shall not

time as their successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified), (A)
Acquirors directors at the Effective Time shall be the Surviving
Corporations directors and (B) the Companys officers immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the Surviving Corporations officers.

ARTICLE 3

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES AND RELATED MATTERS

3.1. _Capital Stock of Acquiror_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any Company Share
or Acquiror Share, each Acquiror Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

3.2. _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Acquiror-Owned Shares_. As of the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder of any Company Share or Acquiror Share, each Company Share held by
the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired, and no
payment shall be made or consideration delivered or deliverable in respect
thereof.

3.3. _Conversion of Company Shares_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any Company
Share or Acquiror Share, each Company Share (excluding any Restricted Shares
whose restrictions do not lapse as of the Effective Time) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (a) shares to
be cancelled in accordance with Section 3.2 and (b) Dissenting Shares) shall
be converted into the right to receive in cash, without interest, an amount
equal to $49.51 (the "Merger Consideration").

3.4. _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Acquiror shall appoint a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company as an agent (the "Exchange
Agent") for the benefit of holders of Company Shares for the purpose of
exchanging, pursuant to this Article 3, certificates representing the Company
Shares (the "Certificates") and Company Shares represented by book-entry
("Book-Entry Shares"). On the Closing Date, Parent will, and will cause
Acquiror to, make available to and deposit with the Exchange Agent the
aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of Company Shares
pursuant to this Article 3 (the "Exchange Fund"), and except as contemplated
by Section 3.4(e) or Section 3.4(g) hereof, the Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose. The Exchange Agent shall invest the Merger
Consideration as directed by the Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation. To the extent
that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund
diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments
of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the
Exchange Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that
the Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make
such payments.



 

12 (b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time but not later than
ten (10) Business Days thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall send, or
shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each record holder of Certificates
and each holder of Book-Entry Shares a letter of transmittal and instructions
(which shall be in customary form and specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon
adherence to the procedures set forth in the Letter of Transmittal), for use
in the exchange contemplated by this Section 3.4. Upon surrender of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Share to the Exchange Agent, together with a duly
executed letter of transmittal, the holder shall be entitled to receive, in
exchange therefor, the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article 3 in
respect of the Company Shares represented by the Certificate or the Book-Entry
Share, after giving effect to any required withholding Tax. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 3.4, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration.

(c) All cash paid upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to Company Shares represented thereby.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to Company Shares, except
as otherwise provided herein or by applicable Law. As of the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the Companys stock transfer books or by
book-entry of any Company Shares, other than transfers that occurred before
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall
be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Section 3.4.

(d) If payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of Company Shares is to
be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name a surrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such
payment that the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of such payment in a name other than that of the
registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall
have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent that such Taxes either have been paid or are not payable.

(e) Upon the request of the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent shall
deliver to the Surviving Corporation any portion of the Merger Consideration
made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 3.4 that remains
undistributed to holders of Company Shares six (6) months after the Effective
Time. Holders of Certificates who have not complied with this Section 3.4
prior to the demand by the Surviving Corporation shall thereafter look only to
Parent and the Surviving Corporation for payment of any claim to the Merger
Consideration.

(f) None of Acquiror, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Company Shares (or dividends
or distributions with respect thereto) for any amounts paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

(g) Each of the Surviving Corporation and Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration or amounts otherwise
payable hereunder to any Person (including amounts payable under Article 3)
any amounts that it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to payment
under any applicable provision of federal, state, local or foreign income tax
Law and shall make any required filings with the appropriate tax authorities
with respect to such withholding. To the extent that the Surviving Corporation
or Exchange Agent withholds those amounts, the withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of Company Shares in respect of which deduction and withholding was made by
the Surviving Corporation or Exchange Agent, as the case may be.



 

13 (h) If any Certificate has been or is claimed to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming that a Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to that
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver to such Person in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the proper amount of the Merger
Consideration.

3.5. _Company Stock Options and Other Awards_.

(a) Each outstanding Company Option shall automatically be converted at the
Effective Time, pursuant to the terms thereof, into the right to receive a
cash payment from the Surviving Corporation, payable as soon as practicable
following the vesting and exercise of the Company Option, equal to an amount
per Company Share subject to such Company Option equal to the excess, if any,
of (i) the Merger Consideration over (ii) the exercise price per Company
Share subject to such vested and exercised Company Option, less any applicable
withholding taxes (the "Option Consideration"). Outstanding unvested Company
Options will continue to vest and become exercisable for the Option
Consideration in accordance with the terms of the Contract between the Company
and the holder in effect as of the date hereof evidencing such Company Option.
The Surviving Corporation and Parent shall take all corporate action
necessary to reserve sufficient cash for payment upon the exercise of such
Company Options on or after the Effective Time in accordance with the terms
and conditions thereof. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall notify
the holders of Company Options of the Surviving Corporations withholding
obligations with respect to such Company Options arising on or after the
Effective Time.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary action
under all stock purchase plans in place at the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to Company Shares (including the Trammell Crow Company
Employee Stock Purchase Plan) (collectively, "Purchase Plans") to provide that
(i) all participants rights under all current offering periods shall
terminate at the end of the next payroll date following the date hereof (the
"Stock Plan Suspension Date"), but in no event later than December 31, 2006,
and all accumulated payroll deductions allocated to each participants
account under the Purchase Plans shall thereupon be used to purchase from the
Company whole Company Shares at a price determined under the terms of the
Purchase Plans for the offering period using the Stock Plan Suspension Date

such shares in accordance with Section 262 (or any successor provision) of the
DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided hereunder and shall only
be entitled to such rights and consideration as are granted by Section 262 (or
any successor provision) of the DGCL. Such Persons shall be entitled to
receive payment of the appraised value of such Company Shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262 (or any successor provision) of the DGCL,
except that all Dissenting Shares held by Persons who shall have failed to
perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their right to
appraisal of such shares under Section 262 (or any successor provision) of the
DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.3 hereto as of the
Effective Time or the occurrence of such failure, withdrawal or loss,
whichever occurs later.

(b) The Company shall give Acquiror (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other

with respect to any demands for appraisal or the payment of the fair cash
value of any such shares or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

Except (i) as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed with the SEC after
January 1, 2006 and prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to
information that is reasonably apparent on its face to relate to the

corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character
of the property and assets owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of

Material Adverse Effect. The Company is not in violation of any provision of
its Organizational Documents, and the Company has made available to Parent
true and correct copies of its Organizational Documents.

4.2. _Corporate Authorization_. The execution, delivery and performance by the

resolved to recommend that the Company Stockholders vote their shares in favor
of the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by the Company, and assuming that this Agreement constitutes the
valid and binding obligation of Parent and Acquiror, constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms subject, as to enforceability, to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a proceeding in equity or at law).

4.3. _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the

Governmental Entity, other than (a) the filing of the Certificate of Merger in

made, would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not result in the lapse
of any Permit of the Company or Company Subsidiaries or the breach of any
authorization or right to use any Permit of the Company or Company
Subsidiaries or other right that the Company or any Company Subsidiaries has
from a Governmental Entity, except where such lapses or breaches would not be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (a)
contravene or conflict with the Organizational Documents of the Company, (b)

constitute a breach of or default under (or an event that with notice or lapse
of time or both would be reasonably likely to become a breach or default) or
give rise (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) to a right of
termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration under any Contract
binding upon the Company (including, in the case of any Contract evidencing
Indebtedness or other payment obligation of any Special Purpose Vehicle, any
right to claim against the Company or any Company Subsidiaries other than a
Special Purpose Vehicle all or any portion of the amount of Indebtedness or

aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Section 4.6(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the name of
all Company Subsidiaries and, to the extent applicable, the total number of
authorized, issued and outstanding Equity Interests of each Company Subsidiary
and the amount of the Companys direct or indirect ownership of Equity

to invest in such Project Entity and (ii) the amount of Indebtedness or other
payment obligation of such Project Entity that the Company or any Company

except as would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the

securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (that is not a Special
Purpose Vehicle) convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Equity
Interests in any Company Subsidiary (that is not a Special Purpose Vehicle),
(y) options, warrants or other rights to acquire from the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (that is not a Special Purpose Vehicle), or obligations of

Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue, sell, repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any Equity Interests of any Company Subsidiary (that is not
a Special Purpose Vehicle).

Organizational Documents, other than violations which would not be reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Section 4.6(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists each

and correct copies of the articles or certificate of incorporation or bylaws
or equivalent organizational and governing documents.

Company makes no representation with respect to the Companys or any Company
Subsidiarys ownership of any Company Minority Investment or the business,

Material Adverse Effect.



 

24 (c) The information provided by the Company to Parent and Acquiror in order to
assist Parent in its evaluation and determination as to whether any filings,

the Company Disclosure Schedule) used in or necessary to carry on the
business of the Company and each Company Subsidiary, taken as a whole, as
currently conducted (collectively, the "Company Intellectual Property"),

insurance policies involving general errors and omissions, directors and
officers coverage or environmental liabilities of the Company or any of its

this Agreement, there is no material claim by the Company or any Company

Approval").

Subsidiary would, directly or indirectly, restrict or impair the ability of
Parent to vote, or otherwise to exercise the rights of a stockholder with
respect to, shares of the Company and any Company Subsidiary that may be
acquired or controlled by Parent, as a result of the Merger or otherwise.

(c) Except as provided in Section 4.23(b), no other state takeover statute or

Proxy Statement will comply as to form with the provisions of the Exchange
Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no representation or
warranty with respect to any statements made or incorporated by reference in
the Proxy Statement based on information supplied by Parent or Acquiror in
writing specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has all corporate powers and
authority required to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and
carry on its business as now conducted. Each of Parent and Acquiror is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction where the character of the property owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of its activities makes qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be qualified has not had and would not be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. True and correct copies of the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of Acquiror, and all amendments, modifications or
supplements thereto, have been provided to the Company.

5.2. _Corporate Authorization_. The execution, delivery and performance by
each of Parent and Acquiror of this Agreement and the consummation by each of
Parent and Acquiror of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby are within the corporate powers of each of Parent and Acquiror and have
been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action and no
other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Acquiror are necessary to
authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
each of Parent and Acquiror and assuming that this Agreement constitutes the
valid and binding obligation of the Company, this Agreement constitutes a
valid and binding agreement of each of Parent and Acquiror, enforceable in
accordance with its terms.

5.3. _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery and performance by
each of Parent and Acquiror of this Agreement and the consummation by Parent
and Acquiror of the transactions contemplated hereby will not require any
consent, approval, action, order, authorization, or permit of,
or registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity by
Parent or Acquiror other than (a) those set forth in clauses (a) through (d)
of Section 4.3 and (b) other consents, approvals, actions,
orders, authorizations, permits, registrations, declarations and filings
which, if not obtained or made, would not be reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

5.4. _Non-Contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance by Parent
and Acquiror of this Agreement and the consummation by Parent and Acquiror of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not
(a) contravene or conflict with the Organizational Documents of Parent or
Acquiror, (b) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section
5.3, contravene or conflict with any provision of Law, binding upon or
applicable to Parent or Acquiror or by which any of their respective
properties or assets is bound or affected, (c) constitute a breach or default
under (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both could reasonably
become a breach or default) or give rise (with or without notice or lapse of
time or both) to a right of termination, amendment, cancellation
or acceleration under any Contract binding upon, Parent or Acquiror or their
respective properties or assets, or (d) result in the creation or imposition
of any Lien on any asset of Parent or Acquiror other than, in the case of
clauses (b), (c) and (d) taken together, any such items that have not had and
would not be reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.



 

31 5.5. _Financing_. As of the date of this Agreement, Acquiror has received an
executed commitment letter dated October 30, 2006 (the "Commitment Letter")
from Credit Suisse and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC ("Lender"), pursuant
to which Lender has committed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
therein, to provide to Parent the amount of financing set forth in the
Commitment Letter (the "Financing"), to complete the transactions contemplated
hereby. A true and complete copy of the Commitment Letter has been previously
provided to the Company. Acquiror has fully paid any and all commitment fees
or other fees required by such Commitment Letter to be paid as of the date
hereof. As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letter is valid and in full
force and effect, does not contain any material misrepresentation by Parent
(other than those resulting from inaccurate information, if any, provided by
the Company) and no event has occurred which (with or without notice, lapse
of time or both) would constitute a breach thereunder on the part of Parent
or Acquiror. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related
to the funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than as set forth in
or contemplated by the Commitment Letter. The aggregate proceeds contemplated
by the Commitment Letter, together with available cash of Parent and Acquiror,
will be sufficient for Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration, the aggregate consideration to be paid to
each holder of a Company Option and other awards pursuant to Section 3.5, any
repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated in the Commitment Letter and the
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby. The fee letter between Parent and Lender referred to in the Commitment
Letter does not contain any conditions precedent or other contingencies
related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing or any provisions
that could reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing set forth in the
Commitment Letter or the aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Commitment
Letter. As of the date hereof, none of Parent or Acquiror has any reason to
believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or
that the Financing will not be available to Parent and Acquiror on the Closing
Date.

5.6. _Information to Be Supplied_. The information supplied or to be supplied
by Parent and Acquiror (if any) in writing specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the time of the
mailing thereof and at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading.

5.7.  _Solvency; Surviving Corporation After the Merger_. Neither Parent nor
Acquiror is entering into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with
the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or
future creditors. Assuming that the representations and warranties of the
Company contained in this Agreement are true and correct in all material
respects, and after giving effect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, at and immediately after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation (i) will be solvent (in that both the fair value of its
assets will not be less than the sum of its debts and that the present fair
saleable value of its assets will not be less than the amount required to pay
its probable liability on its recourse debts as they become absolute and
matured); (ii) will have adequate capital and liquidity with which to engage
in its business; and (iii) will not have incurred and does not plan to incur
debts beyond its ability to pay as they become absolute and matured.

5.8. _Vote/Approval Required_. No vote or consent of the holders of any class
or series of capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve this Agreement or
the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby. The vote or consent of
Services, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, as the sole stockholder of
Acquiror is the only vote or consent of the holders of any class or series of
capital stock of Parent or Acquiror necessary to approve this Agreement or the
Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby and Parent will cause such
vote to be obtained on the date of this Agreement.

5.9. _Parent SEC Documents_.

(a) Parent has filed all forms, reports, filings, registration statements and
other documents required to be filed by it with the SEC since December 31,
2004. No Subsidiary of Parent is required to file any form, report,
registration statement or prospectus or other document with the SEC pursuant
to the Exchange Act.



 

32 (b) As of its filing date, each Parent SEC Document complied as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act
and/or the Exchange Act, as the case may be.

(c) No Parent SEC Document filed since December 31, 2004 pursuant to the
Exchange Act contained, as of its filing date, any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. No Parent SEC Document, as amended or
supplemented, if applicable, filed since December 31, 2004 pursuant to the
Securities Act contained, as of the date on which the document or amendment
became effective, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading.

(d) Each of the audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited
consolidated interim financial statements of the Company included in the
Parent SEC Documents were prepared in conformity with GAAP (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) throughout the periods involved, and each
fairly presents, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the date thereof and
their consolidated results of operations and changes in financial position for
the periods then ended (subject to normal year-end adjustments in the case of
any unaudited interim financial statements).

5.10. _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no
Claim pending, or, to the knowledge of Parent or Acquiror, threatened,
against or affecting Parent or Acquiror ("Parent Litigation") or against any
of their respective assets, properties or employees before any arbitrator or
Governmental Entity that would reasonably be expected to materially adversely
affect the ability of Parent or Acquiror to consummate the Merger, and neither
Parent nor Acquiror nor any of their respective properties or assets or, to
the Knowledge of Parent or Acquiror, employees is or are subject to any Order
that would reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the ability
of the Company or Acquiror to consummate the Merger.

5.11. _No Business Conduct; Ownership_. Acquiror was incorporated on October
25, 2006. Since its inception, Acquiror has not engaged in any activity,
other than such actions in connection with (i) its organization and (ii) the

contemplated hereby. Acquiror has not had any operations, has not generated
any revenues and has no liabilities other than those incurred in connection
with the foregoing and in association with the Merger as provided in this
Agreement. All of the Equity Interests of Acquiror are wholly-owned (directly
or indirectly) by Parent.

contained in this Agreement shall give Holding, Parent or Acquiror, directly
or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys or the Company
Subsidiaries operations prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) prior to the
Effective Time, each of the Company, on the one hand, and Holding, Parent and
Acquiror, on the other hand, shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
respective operations. To the extent Parent determines there are any
Exclusivity Arrangements that purport to restrict Parent and its Subsidiaries
(other than the conduct by the Company, Company Subsidiaries and the
Special Purpose Vehicles) following the Closing, or that there will be any
other inconsistent contractual obligations with respect to any Contracts as a
result of the Merger, the Company and Parent will work together in good faith
to seek to develop and implement a plan mutually acceptable to both the
Company and Parent to reconcile such restrictions or inconsistencies, provided
that neither party shall take any action with respect thereto prior to Closing
unless mutually agreed upon by both the Company and Parent.

6.2. _Stockholder Meeting_. The Company shall cause a meeting of
its Stockholders (the "Company Stockholder Meeting") to be duly called and
held as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt of SEC confirmation
that the SEC has no further comments to the Proxy Statement for the purpose
of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval. Subject to Section 6.3 hereto
(including the right of the Companys Board of Directors to amend, withdraw,
modify, change, condition or qualify the Company Recommendation pursuant
to Section 6.3(b)), the Companys Board of Directors shall recommend adoption
by the Company Stockholders of this Agreement and approval by the Company
Stockholders of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger,
and the Company shall take all other reasonable lawful action to solicit and
secure the Company Stockholder Approval. Subject to Section 6.3 hereto
(including the right of the Companys Board of Directors to amend, withdraw,
modify, change, condition or qualify the Company Recommendation pursuant to
Section 6.3(b)), the Company Recommendation, together with a copy of the
opinion referred to in Section 4.16(b), shall be included in the Proxy
Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting
to the extent necessary (i) to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the
Proxy Statement, which is necessary to ensure that the Proxy Statement does
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, is
provided to its Stockholders in advance of a vote to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval or (ii) if as of the time for which the Company
Stockholder Meeting is originally scheduled there is an insufficient number of
Company Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholder Meeting.

6.3. _Acquisition Proposals; Board Recommendation_.

(a) The Company agrees that it shall not, nor shall it permit any Company
Subsidiary to, nor shall it authorize or knowingly permit any officer,
director, employee, investment banker, attorney, accountant, agent or other
advisor or representative (collectively, "Representatives") of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to (i) solicit, initiate or
otherwise knowingly encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
Person any non-public information with respect to or in connection with, or
take any other action knowingly to facilitate any inquiries or the making of
any proposal that constitutes, or that would reasonably be expected to lead
to, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) grant any waiver or release under any
standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class or  



 

39  series of the Companys Equity Interests ( _provided_ that the Company shall
be permitted to grant waivers or releases under any such agreements solely to
permit the counterparty thereto to make an Acquisition Proposal), or (iv)
except for the waivers and releases permitted by the foregoing clause (iii)
and as otherwise permitted or required pursuant to Sections 6.3(d) and
6.3(e), enter into any agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the
Company receives an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party that
constitutes a Superior Proposal or that the Companys Board of Directors
determines in good faith could reasonably be expected to lead to the delivery
of a Superior Proposal from that Third Party, prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company may, subject to compliance with the
provisions of this Section 6.3, furnish information, including non-public
information, to, and engage in discussions and negotiations with, such Third
Party with respect to its Acquisition Proposal and grant a waiver as provided
in clause (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence ("Permitted Actions") if
the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith, after
consultation with its outside financial advisors and legal advisors, that, as
a result of such Acquisition Proposal, the failure to take such Permitted
Action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(b) Except as permitted by this Section 6.3(b), neither the Board of Directors
of the Company nor any committee thereof shall amend, withdraw, modify,
change, condition or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent or Acquiror, the
Company Recommendation (it being understood and agreed that a "stop, look and
listen" communication by the Board of Directors of the Company to the Company
Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, in connection with
the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer by any Person
other than the Company or any Company Subsidiary, shall not be deemed
to constitute an amendment, withdrawal, modification, change, condition or
qualification of the Company Recommendation for all purposes of this
Agreement, including Section 6.2 and Section 10.1(d)(ii), this Section 6.3
and Section 10.1(d)). Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.3 to the
contrary, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of
Directors of the Company may amend, withdraw, modify, change, condition or
qualify the Company Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or Acquiror,
if the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law,
_provided_ that if and only if such amendment, withdrawal, modification,
change, condition or qualification is proposed to be made in response to any
Acquisition Proposal then such amendment, withdrawal, modification, change,
condition or qualification shall not be made (1) unless such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (2) the Company has complied in all
material respects with this Section 6.3, (3) until after the third Business
Day following delivery to Parent by the Company of a Notice of Superior
Proposal and (4) unless either (x) on or before the expiration of the three
(3) Business Day period following the delivery to Parent of the Notice of
Superior Proposal referred to in the foregoing clause (3), Parent does not
make a Matching Bid in response to such Superior Proposal or (y) following
receipt of a Matching Bid within the three (3) Business Day period, the Board
of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisors and after taking into
consideration the Matching Bid, that the Superior Proposal to which the Notice
of Superior Proposal relates continues to be a Superior Proposal. Any action
pursuant to the terms of this Section 6.3(b) shall not constitute a breach of
the Companys representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
in this Agreement.

(c) Unless the Companys Board of Directors has previously withdrawn, or is
concurrently therewith withdrawing, the Company Recommendation in accordance
with this Section 6.3 and otherwise complies with Section 6.3(d), neither the
Companys Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall recommend any
Acquisition Proposal to the Company Stockholders or, except as otherwise
permitted by this Section 6.3, enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, merger, acquisition or similar agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, including this Section 6.3, nothing shall prevent the
Companys Board of Directors from taking or disclosing a position and
complying with Rule 14e-2 and Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal or making any disclosure required by applicable
Law.



 

40 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.3 to the contrary, at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors
of the Company may, in response to a Superior Proposal that did not result
from a breach of this Section 6.3, cause the Company to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(c)(ii) and concurrently with such
termination enter into a definitive agreement providing for the transactions
contemplated by such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(c)(ii),
and any purported termination pursuant to Section 10.1(c)(ii) shall be void
and of no force or effect, unless the Company shall have complied in all
material respects with all the provisions of this Section 6.3, including the
notification provisions in this Section 6.3(d), and with all applicable
requirements of Section 10.2(b)(ii) (including the payment of the Company
Termination Fee prior to or on the date of such termination) in connection
with such Superior Proposal; and _provided further_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.1(c)(ii): (A) until after the third Business Day following
delivery to Parent of written notice from the Company advising Parent that the
Board of Directors of the Company has received a Superior Proposal, specifying
the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal, and identifying
the Person making such Superior Proposal (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") and
stating that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to cause the
Company to exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
10.1(c)(ii) (it being understood and agreed that, prior to any termination
pursuant to Section 10.2(c)(ii) taking effect, any amendment to the price or
any other material term of a Superior Proposal (such amended Superior
Proposal, a "Modified Superior Proposal") shall require a new Notice of
Superior Proposal and a new three (3) Business Day period with respect to such
Modified Superior Proposal) and (B) unless either (x) on or before
the expiration of the three (3) Business Day period following the delivery to
Parent of any Notice of Superior Proposal, Parent does not make a good faith
written proposal (a "Matching Bid") in response to such Superior Proposal
or (y) following receipt of a Matching Bid within the three (3) Business Day
period, the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors and after
taking into consideration the Matching Bid, that the Superior Proposal to
which the Notice of Superior Proposal relates continues to be a Superior
Proposal.

(e) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than the
next Business Day) after receipt by the Company of (i) any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) any request for information relating to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or for access to
the properties, books or records of the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
(iii) any inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal or from any Person seeking to have discussions or negotiations with
the Company relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal or (iv) any request
for a waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement by any
Person that has made, or informs the Board of Directors of the Company or
such Company Subsidiary that it is considering making, an Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to participating in any
discussions or negotiations or furnishing any such information, the Company
shall receive from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement on terms
that are not materially less favorable to the Company than the Confidentiality
Agreement, _provided_ that such confidentiality agreement with such Person
may contain additional provisions that expressly permit the Company to comply
with the provisions of this Section 6.3. The notice shall indicate the
material terms and conditions of the proposal or request and the identity of
the Person making it and shall include a copy of all written materials
provided by or on behalf of such Person in connection with such proposal,
request or inquiry, and the Company will promptly (but in no event later than
the next Business Day from the receipt thereof) notify Parent and Acquiror of
the Companys receipt of any material modification of or material amendment to
any Acquisition Proposal (and the material terms of such modification
or amendment) and provide copies of all written materials subsequently
provided to, by or on behalf of such Person in connection with such proposal,
request or inquiry; provided, however, that without limiting what changes may
be material, any change in the form, amount, timing or other aspects of the
consideration to be paid with respect to the Acquisition Proposal shall be
deemed to be a material modification or a material  



 

41  amendment. The Company shall keep Parent informed in all material respects,
on a reasonably current basis, of the status of any negotiations, discussions
and documents with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry.

(f) The Company shall immediately cease, and shall cause any Person acting on
its behalf to cease, and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or
negotiations with any Third Party conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and shall request any such Third Parties in possession
of confidential information about the Company or any Company Subsidiary that
was furnished by or on behalf of the Company or any such Subsidiary to return
or destroy all such information in the possession of such Third Party or the
agent or advisor of such Third Party.

6.4. _Termination of Credit Agreements_. On or prior to the second Business
Day prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to
deliver to Parent copies of payoff letters (subject to delivery of funds as
arranged by Parent and Acquiror), in reasonable form, from the
administration agents under the Credit Agreements and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to make arrangements for the release of all
mortgages, liens and other security over the Companys and the Company
Subsidiaries properties and assets securing such obligations (subject to
delivery of funds as arranged by Parent and Acquiror, if necessary).

6.5.  _Resignation of Directors_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall deliver to Acquiror evidence satisfactory to Acquiror of the resignation
of all directors of the Company effective at the Effective Time. 

6.6. _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such
steps as may be reasonably necessary to cause dispositions of Equity
Interests of the Company (including derivative securities) pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a
director or officer of the Company to be exempted under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance with that certain No-Action
Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC regarding such matters.

ARTICLE 7

COVENANTS OF PARENT AND ACQUIROR

Each of Parent and Acquiror agrees as set forth below.

7.1. _Director and Officer Liability_.

(a) Parent, Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation agree that the Surviving
Corporation shall adopt on or prior to the Effective Time, in its certificate
of incorporation and by-laws, the same indemnification, limitation of or
exculpation from liability and expense advancement provisions as those set
forth in the Companys certificate of incorporation and by-laws, in each case
as of the date of this Agreement, and that such provisions shall not be
amended, repealed, revoked or otherwise modified for a period of six (6)
years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of the individuals who on or prior to the Effective Time
were directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or are otherwise entitled to the benefit of such provisions, unless
such modification is required after the Effective Time by applicable Law.

(b) Without limiting any additional rights that any Indemnified Party (as
defined below) may have pursuant to any employment agreement, indemnification
agreement or otherwise, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
commencing at the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless, each present (as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time) and former director, officer or
employee of the Company and each Company Subsidiary and their respective
estates, heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns
(collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against all costs and expenses
(including reasonable  



 

42  attorneys and other professionals fees and expenses), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts paid
in connection with any Claim (whether asserted prior to, at or after the
Effective Time) arising out of or pertaining to any action or inaction in
their capacity as director or officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
or their serving at the request of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a
director, officer, employee, agent, trustee, shareholder, partner or fiduciary
of another Person, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise in
each case occurring on or before the Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement). Without limiting the foregoing,
in the event of any Claim, (i) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall,
jointly and severally, (x) periodically advance reasonable fees and expenses
(including attorneys and other professionals fees and expenses) with respect
to the foregoing and pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected
by each Indemnified Party, promptly after statements therefor are received,
provided that the Indemnified Party to whom fees and expenses are advanced or
for which fees and expenses of counsel are paid provides an undertaking to
repay such advances and payments if it is ultimately determined that
such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification, and (y) vigorously
assist each Indemnified Party in such defense, and (ii) subject to the terms
of this Section 7.1, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in
the defense of any matter. If any Claim is commenced as to which an
Indemnified Party desires to receive indemnification, such Indemnified Party
shall notify the Surviving Corporation with reasonable promptness; _provided_
, _however_ , that failure to give reasonably prompt notice to the Surviving
Corporation shall not affect the indemnification obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation hereunder except to the extent that the failure to so
notify has actually and materially prejudiced Parent and the Surviving
Corporation in such Claim. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to
retain counsel of such Indemnified Partys own choice to represent such
Person; and such counsel shall, to the extent consistent with its
professional responsibilities, reasonably cooperate with the Surviving
Corporation and any counsel designated by the Surviving Corporation. Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall be liable only for any settlement of any
Claim against an Indemnified Party made with Parent or Surviving
Corporations written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
not, without the prior written consent of an Indemnified Party, settle or
compromise any Claim, or permit a default or consent to the entry of any
judgment in respect thereof, unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes, as an unconditional term thereof, the giving by the claimant to
such Indemnified Party of an unconditional release from all liability and
obligations (civil or criminal or monetary or otherwise) in respect of such
Claim.

(c) Parent agrees that the Company will cause to be put in place immediately
prior to the Effective Time "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of
at least six years from the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with
respect to directors and officers liability insurance in an amount and
scope no more favorable than the Companys existing policies as in effect as
of the date hereof with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time.

(d) All rights to indemnification and/or advancement of expenses contained in
any agreement with any Indemnified Parties as in effect on the date hereof
with respect to matters occurring on or prior to the Effective Time (including
the transactions contemplated hereby) shall survive the Merger and continue in
full force and effect. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify any Indemnified Party against all reasonable costs and expenses
(including attorneys and other professionals fees and expenses), such amount
to be payable in advance upon request as provided in Section 7.1(b), relating
to the enforcement of such Indemnified Partys rights under this Section 7.1
or under any charter, bylaw or agreement regardless of whether such
Indemnified Party is ultimately determined to be entitled to indemnification
hereunder or thereunder, provided that such Indemnified Party provides an
undertaking to repay any advances of costs and expenses if it is ultimately
determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification
hereunder or thereunder.



 

43 (e) This Section 7.1 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the
Indemnified Parties referred to herein, their heirs and personal
representatives and shall be binding on Parent and the Surviving Corporation
and their successors and assigns and the covenants and agreements contained
herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an
Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise.

(f) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, to the
extent not assumed by operation of law, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.1 and
all rights to indemnification and/or advancement of expenses contained in any
agreement with any Indemnified Parties as in effect on the date hereof with
respect to matters occurring on or prior to the Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated hereby). The provisions of this Section 7.1 are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the
Indemnified Parties and the Surviving Corporation, and his or her or its heirs
and representatives.

(g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its officers, directors or employees, it being understood
and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 7.1 is not
prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

7.2. _Employee Benefits_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.2, for a period of one (1)
year after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide to individuals who are
employees of the Company and each Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time and who subsequently become employees of the Surviving
Corporation (the "Continuing Employees"), with employee benefits (excluding
equity based benefits or awards and any defined benefit retirement plan
benefits) that, in the aggregate, are comparable to the employee benefits
provided by Parent and its Subsidiaries to similarly situated employees of
Parent or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause the employee benefit plans
that such Continuing Employees are or become eligible to participate in to
take into account for purposes of eligibility and vesting thereunder service
by such employees with the Company or any Subsidiary as if such service were
with the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case
may be, to the same extent that such service was credited under any analogous
Company Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Following the Effective
Time, Continuing Employees will retain credit for unused vacation and sick
days which were accrued with the Company or a Subsidiary as of the Effective
Time. In addition, if the Effective Time falls within an annual period of
coverage under any group health plan of the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries, each Continuing Employee shall be given credit for covered
expenses paid by that employee under comparable Company Plans during the
applicable coverage period through the Effective Time toward satisfaction of
any annual deductible limitation and out-of-pocket maximum that may apply
under that group health plan of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.2, nothing herein
shall limit the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries to amend or terminate any of the Company Plans
in accordance with their terms at any time.

(c) Parent agrees to adopt as binding and enforceable policies and continue
after the Effective Time, and to cause the Surviving Corporation to continue,
the Trammell Crow Company 2006 Annual Principal Bonus Plan, Trammell Crow
Company Severance Pay Policy and Trammell Crow Company  



 

44  Retention Plan (the "2006 Plans"), in each case as adopted by the Board of
Directors of the Company prior to the Effective Time and in the form set
forth on, or with respect to the Trammell Crow Company Retention Plan in
accordance with the term sheet set forth on, Section 7.2(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, with respect to Continuing Employees until (i) the
payment of all amounts due and payable under the Trammell Crow Company
Retention Plan and with respect to calendar year 2006 in the case of the
Trammell Crow Company 2006 Annual Principal Bonus Plan and (ii) the one-year
anniversary of the Closing Date in the case of the Trammell Crow Company
Severance Pay Policy.

(d) Effective as of the day immediately preceding the Effective Date, the
Company shall take all corporate actions necessary to effectuate the
termination of the Trammell Crow Company Retirement Savings Plan (the "Company
401(k) Plan"), subject to and conditioned upon the occurrence of
the Effective Time, unless Parent provides notice to the Company at least 15
days prior to the Effective Time that the Company 401(k) Plan shall not be
terminated. The Parent shall receive from the Company evidence that action to
effectuate the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan has been taken pursuant
to a resolution of the Companys Board of Directors (the form and substance of
such resolution shall be subject to review and approval of the Parent, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld).

(e) The provisions of this Section 7.2 are for the sole benefit of the parties
to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or
shall be construed to confer upon or give to any person (including for the
avoidance of doubt any Company Employees or Company Independent Contractors),
other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and
assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (with respect to
the matters provided in this Section 7.2) under any provision of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section
7.2(e) shall in no way limit any legal or equitable or other rights or
remedies of any person (including for the avoidance of doubt any Company
Employees or Company Independent Contractors) under the 2006 Plans or under

respective Subsidiaries shall, subject to the provisions of this Section 8.2,
use all their respective reasonable efforts to seek to lift, reverse or

to Parent and its Subsidiaries (as constituted without giving effect to the

neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall agree without Parents prior
written consent, to take any action or accept any conditions, restrictions,
obligations or requirements with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries

a Company Material Adverse Effect or would result in the sale, divestiture,
other disposition or loss of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the
consolidated revenue of any one or more of the following businesses of the
Company: Property Management, Facilities Management, or Project Management

Subsidiaries will take such lawful actions as reasonably requested by Parent
in connection with obtaining such consents, approvals or waivers.
Notwithstanding Parents rights to lead all proceedings as provided in the

parties contained in this Section 8.2, each party agrees to cooperate and use
all reasonable efforts to assist in any defense by any other party hereto of

such Governmental Entity or such assistance as may be reasonably requested by
the other party hereto in such defense.

forth in Section 9.1(b) and Section 9.1(c) (but solely, in the case of Section
9.1(c), to the extent the order, injunction, judgment or decree referred to in
such Section is issued or brought under applicable Antitrust Laws).

(i) From the date of this Agreement through the date of termination of the
required waiting period under the HSR Act, the Company, Parent and Acquiror
and their respective Subsidiaries shall not take any action that would
reasonably be expected to hinder or delay the obtaining of clearance or the
expiration of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or any other
applicable Antitrust Law.

ten (10) days after execution of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare the

become false or misleading in any material respect to ensure that the Proxy

the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, and
the Company shall take all steps necessary to file with the SEC and have
cleared by the SEC any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement as to
correct the same and to cause the Proxy Statement as so corrected to be
disseminated to the Company Stockholders, in each case to the extent required
by applicable Law.

8.5(a), Parent and Acquiror shall not have access to personnel records of the

also subject to the absence of notes to the financial statements that may be
required by GAAP and subject to the Companys ability to obtain financial
information from Savills plc. If the Company is unable to account for its
investment in Savills plc utilizing the equity method of accounting because

Savills plc to so account for such investment, then the parties agree that for
purposes of this Section 8.8(b) and Section 4.8 the failure to do so in the
Companys financial statements shall not be deemed to render such financial
statements inconsistent, or noncompliant, with GAAP. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the provision of separate financial statements or
other separate financial data regarding Savills plc shall not be required in
order for the Company to comply with its obligations pursuant to this Section
8.8(b) or for Parent and Acquiror to satisfy conditions 3. and 4. set forth
in Annex II of the Commitment Letter.

(c) Parent, Acquiror and the Company shall reasonably cooperate with each

with the Financing or Alternative Financing.

8.9. _Investigation and Agreement by Parent and Acquiror; No Other
Representations or Warranties_.

projections, forecasts, plans and budgets so furnished to them or their
representatives, and that the Company does not make any representations
regarding such estimates, projections, forecasts, plans and budgets except as
provided in Article 4. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provisions
of this Agreement, no information or knowledge obtained in any investigation
conducted by Parent or Acquiror or provided to Parent or Acquiror shall affect
or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained herein or the

transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Each of Parent and Acquiror agrees that, except for the representations
and warranties made by the Company that are expressly set forth in Article 4
of this Agreement, the Company does not make, and has not made, any
representations or warranties in connection with the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Except as expressly set forth herein, no
Person has been authorized by the Company to make any representation or
warranty relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or their respective
businesses, or otherwise in connection with the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby and, if made, such representation or warranty may not be
relied upon as having been authorized by the Company. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Acquiror agrees that, except
as provided in Article 4, neither the Company, any holder of Equity  



 

53  Interests of the Company nor any of their respective Affiliates or
representatives, makes or has made any representation or warranty to Parent
and Acquiror or any of their representatives or Affiliates with respect to

(i) any forward-looking information such as projections, forecasts,
estimates, plans or budgets of future revenues, expenses or expenditures,

hereafter delivered to or made available to Parent and Acquiror or their
respective representatives or Affiliates; or

the Company and contained in Article 4 of this Agreement.

(c) The Company agrees that, except for the representations and warranties
made by Parent and Acquiror that are expressly set forth in Article 5 of this
Agreement, Parent and Acquiror do not make, and have not made, any

committees thereof;

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if 

(i) the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before the May 7, 2007
(the "End Date");  _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 10.1(b)(i) shall not be available to any party
whose breach of or failure to perform any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement has been the principal cause of, or resulted in, the failure of
the Merger to occur on or before  



 

55  the date this Agreement is sought to be terminated pursuant to this clause
(i); provided further, however, that if neither Parent nor Acquiror is in
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein other than the failure of Parent or Acquiror to consummate
the Merger when required to do so pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
solely by reason of a failure to receive the proceeds of the Financing

apply to Parent in such circumstance, provided further, however, that if on
the End Date (as determined before any extension thereof pursuant to this

satisfied (treating such date as if it were the Closing Date) (other than the
Antitrust Conditions and the delivery of the officers
certificates contemplated by Sections 9.2(a) and 9.3(a)), then either the
Company or Parent may extend the End Date to August 6, 2007 by delivery of

prior to the End Date (as so extended, the "End Date");

(ii) if any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have

(A) on the basis that the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby are
violative of any Antitrust Law or (B) for any reason other than as
contemplated by Section 10.1(b)(ii)(A), and, in each case, such order decree,
ruling or action shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate under this Section 10.1(b)(ii) shall
not be available to any party whose material breach of this Agreement has been
the principal cause of such action; or

(iii) the Company Stockholder Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement

(c) by the Company,

(i) if a breach of or failure to perform in any material respect any

by Parent or Acquiror shall have occurred which breach or failure to perform
would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 9.1 or 9.2,

days (but not beyond the End Date) after the receipt of written notice thereof
from the Company, or such breach or failure is not reasonably capable of being
cured within twenty (20) days (but not beyond the End Date) after the receipt

(ii) in response to a Superior Proposal as contemplated by Section 6.3(d),
_provided_ , _however_ , that termination of this Agreement pursuant to this

paid to Acquiror in accordance with Section 10.2(b)(ii); or

(iii) if the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before the date
required pursuant to Section 2.1(d) due to Parent or Acquirors failure to
effect the Closing in breach of this Agreement, and at the time of such
termination (treating such date of termination as if it were the Closing
Date) the conditions set forth in Sections 9.1 and 9.3 (other than the
delivery by the Company of the officers certificate contemplated by Section
9.3(a)) have been satisfied or waived; or

(d) by Parent, if:

(i) a breach of or failure to perform in any material respect any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement by
the Company shall have occurred which breach or failure to perform would give
rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Sections 9.1 or 9.3, and, if
curable, such breach or failure has not been cured within twenty (20) days
(but not  



 

56  beyond the End Date) after the receipt of written notice thereof from
Parent, or such breach or failure is not reasonably capable of being cured
within twenty (20) days (but not beyond the End Date) after receipt of
written notice thereof from Parent; provided that Parent may not terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(d)(i) if it is in material breach
of any of its representations, warranties, covenants and obligations under
this Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 9.1
or 9.2 not to be satisfied; or

(ii) (A) the Board of Directors of the Company or any other duly authorized

Proposal shall then be subject to this Section 10.1(d)(ii)(B)), (y) a new
Notice of Superior Proposal has been delivered with respect to a Modified
Superior Proposal (in which event, such new Notice of Superior Proposal shall

shall forthwith become null and void and there shall be no liability or
obligation on the part of Parent, Acquiror, the Company or any of their
respective Representatives, stockholders or Affiliates, except that, subject
to Sections 10.2(d) and 10.2(g), no such termination shall relieve any party
hereto of any liability or damages resulting from fraud or any breach of this
Agreement prior to such termination; _provided_ , that the provisions of
Sections 8.4, 8.7, 8.9, 10.2, 10.3 and Article 11 of this Agreement and the

designated by Parent) on the next Business Day following such termination a

cash amount equal to the Company Termination Fee; or

(iii) (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(i)
(provided that at the time of such termination (treating such date of
termination as if it were the Closing Date) pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(i),
the conditions precedent in Sections 9.1(b) and 9.1(c) shall have been
satisfied and the principal reason for the Closing not having previously
occurred shall not be the failure to satisfy the condition precedent set forth
in Section 9.2(a) or the failure by Parent and Acquiror to receive the
proceeds of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter), Section
10.1(b)(iii) or Section 10.1(d)(i), (B) prior to such termination, an
Acquisition Proposal (with all percentages included in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal increased to thirty percent  



 

57  (30%) for purposes of this definition) is publicly announced, publicly
disclosed or is consummated, and (C) a transaction contemplated by
the definition of Acquisition Proposal (which need not be the same
Acquisition Proposal and with all percentages included in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal increased to thirty percent (30%) for purposes of this
definition) is completed or an agreement is executed by the parties thereto
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (with all percentages included in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal increased to thirty percent (30%) for
purposes of this definition) prior to or within the twelve (12) months
following the date on which this Agreement is terminated, the Company shall
pay to Parent (in immediately available funds to an account designated by
Parent) on the next Business Day following the earlier of the closing of the
transaction contemplated by such Acquisition Proposal or the Company entering
into a definitive agreement contemplating such Acquisition Proposal, a cash
amount equal to the Company Termination Fee.

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(i) or Section 10.1(b)(ii)(A) and, in each case,
at the time of such termination,

(i) both Parent and the Company have the right, in accordance with the terms
hereof, to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(i) or Section
10.1(b)(ii)(A), as applicable,

(ii) neither Parent nor the Company has the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(ii)(B) (or would have the right to so terminate
assuming that the relevant order, decree, ruling or action referenced in
Section 10.1(b)(ii)(B) has become final and non-appealable at the time of such
termination),

(iii) in the event of such termination pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(i) and
treating such date of termination as if it were the Closing Date, the
conditions set forth in Sections 9.1 (other than the Antitrust Conditions) and
9.3 (other than the delivery by the Company of the officers certificate
contemplated by Section 9.3(a)) have been satisfied, and

(iv) in the event of such termination pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(ii)(A), the
conditions set forth in Section 9.1 (other than the Antitrust Conditions)
shall have been satisfied or waived or are reasonably likely to have
been satisfied by the End Date and (treating such date of termination as if
it were the Closing Date) the conditions set forth in Section 9.3 shall be
satisfied other than the delivery by the Company of the officers certificate
contemplated by Section 9.3(a), then Parent shall pay to the Company (by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Company) on the next Business Day following such termination a cash amount
equal to $100,000,000 (the "Parent Antitrust Termination Fee").

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated

(i) by the Company pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(i), and at the time of such
termination only the Company has the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the provisions of Section 10.1(b)(i);

(ii) by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(i) where, at the
time of such termination, both the Company and Parent have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the provisions of Section 10.1(b)(i) and
Parent and Acquiror have failed to consummate the Merger when required to do
so pursuant to the terms of this Agreement solely by reason of a failure to
receive the proceeds of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter;

(iii) by the Company pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(ii), and at the time of such
termination, only the Company has the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the provisions of Section 10.1(b)(ii);

(iv) by the Company pursuant to Section 10.1(c)(i);

(v) by the Company pursuant to Section 10.1(c)(iii); or,

and Acquiror, jointly and severally, agree to pay to the Company (by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Company) a cash amount equal to $200,000,000 (the "Parent Breach Termination
Fee") on the next Business Day following the date of termination of this
Agreement. The parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in
this Section 10.2(d) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and that the Parent Breach Termination Fee is not a penalty,
but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate
the Company for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
for losses and damages likely to be incurred or suffered as a result of
termination in the circumstances described in clauses (i) through (vi) of the
preceding sentence, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1 under circumstances
where the Parent Breach Termination Fee is payable pursuant to this Section
10.2(d), then subject to the Companys rights pursuant to Section 10.2(e), the
Companys right to receipt of payment of the Parent Breach Termination Fee
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy against Parent, Acquiror and any of
their respective Representatives, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
partners, managers, members, or stockholders (each, a "Parent Party") for any
Company Damages.

(e) The Company, Parent and Acquiror acknowledge and agree that the agreements
contained in Sections 10.2(b), (c), (d) and (g) are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Company, Parent and Acquiror would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly (i) if the Company fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant
to Section 10.2(b) or (ii) Parent or Acquiror fails promptly to pay the amount
due pursuant to Section 10.2(c) or (d), and, in order to obtain such payment,
the Company or Parent, as applicable, commences a suit that results in a
judgment against the Company or Parent for the Parent Antitrust Termination
Fee, Parent Breach Termination Fee or the Company Termination Fee, as
applicable, the Company shall pay to Parent or Parent shall pay to the
Company, as applicable, its costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amount of the Parent Antitrust Termination Fee, Parent
Breach Termination Fee or Company Termination Fee, as applicable, from the
date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the
prime rate of Credit Suisse, in effect on the date such payment was required
to be made.

(f) If more than one provision contained in Section 10.1 is an applicable
basis for termination of this Agreement by the Company or Parent, as
applicable, then the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall be entitled to
assert more than one provision contained in Section 10.1 as the basis for its
termination of this Agreement and the Company or Parent, as applicable,
shall be entitled to receive payment of the highest remedy available pursuant
to this Section 10.2 arising out of such reasons for termination of this
Agreement, _provided_ that the Company shall not be entitled to more than one
recovery of the Parent Antitrust Termination Fee or the Parent Breach
Termination Fee, as applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, under no
circumstances will (i) the Company be entitled to recover both the Parent
Antitrust Termination Fee and the Parent Breach Termination Fee or (ii)
Parent and Acquiror be entitled to more than one recovery of the Company
Termination Fee.

(g) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, subject to
the Companys rights pursuant to Section 10.2(e), the maximum aggregate
liability of Parent and Acquiror in the aggregate for all Company Damages
arising out of or resulting from breaches of this Agreement or any
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement shall equal $200,000,000 _minus_ the amount of any Parent Breach
Termination Fee or Parent Antitrust Termination Fee paid to the Company (the
"Parent Liability Cap"). Subject to the Companys rights pursuant to Section
10.2(e), the Company agrees that in no event shall the Company, any Company
Subsidiaries or  



 

59  any of their Affiliates seek (and the Company shall cause its Affiliates not
to seek) any Company Damages or any other recovery, judgment, or damages of
any kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against any
Parent Party in excess of the Parent Liability Cap or from any Parent Party
other than Parent and Acquiror. The parties hereto acknowledge that the
agreements contained in this Section 10.2(g) are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that Parent and Acquiror would
not have entered into this Agreement without such agreements.

10.3. _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein,
all fees and expenses incurred in connection herewith and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring expenses, whether or
not the Merger is consummated.

the representations and warranties of such party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto. No such extension or waiver shall be
deemed or construed as a continuing extension or waiver on any occasion other
than the one on which such extension or waiver was granted or as an extension
or waiver with respect to any provision of this Agreement not expressly
identified in such extension or waiver on the same or any other occasion. No
failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Law.

11.4. _Successors and Assigns_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns; _provided_ , _however_ , that all or any of
the rights or obligations of Parent or Acquiror may be assigned to any direct
or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of such party (which assignment shall not
relieve such assigning party of its obligations hereunder); _provided_ ,
_further_ , that other than with respect to the foregoing proviso, no party
may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
under this Agreement without the consent of the other parties hereto. Any
purported assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.

11.5. _Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an
original (including any counterpart transmitted by facsimile or other
electronic means of transmission), with the same effect as if the signatures
thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become
effective when each party hereto shall have received counterparts hereof
signed by all of the other parties hereto. Except as provided in Sections 7.1,
no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer upon any Person other
than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.

11.6. _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
AND GOVERNED BY THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE APPLICABLE TO
CONTRACTS EXECUTED AND FULLY PERFORMED WITHIN THE STATE OF DELAWARE.

11.7. _Jurisdiction_. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS
AGREEMENT, THE PARTIES HERETO AGREE THAT ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING
SEEKING TO ENFORCE ANY PROVISION OF, OR BASED ON ANY MATTER ARISING OUT  



 

61  OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY SHALL BE BROUGHT IN THE COURT OF CHANCERY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE
(OR, IN THE CASE OF ANY CLAIM AS TO WHICH THE FEDERAL COURTS HAVE EXCLUSIVE
SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION, THE FEDERAL COURT OF THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA) SITTING IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE, AND EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY
CONSENTS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THOSE COURTS (AND OF THE
APPROPRIATE APPELLATE COURTS THEREFROM) IN ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING AND
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION
WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF THE VENUE OF ANY SUIT,
ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN ANY OF THOSE COURTS OR THAT ANY SUIT, ACTION OR
PROCEEDING WHICH IS BROUGHT IN ANY OF THOSE COURTS HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN
INCONVENIENT FORUM. PROCESS IN ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE SERVED ON
ANY PARTY ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, WHETHER WITHIN OR WITHOUT THE JURISDICTION
OF ANY OF THE NAMED COURTS. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, EACH PARTY AGREES
THAT SERVICE OF PROCESS ON IT BY NOTICE AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 11.1 SHALL BE
DEEMED EFFECTIVE SERVICE OF PROCESS.

11.8. _Enforcement_. The parties recognize and agree that if for any reason
any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and irreparable harm
or injury would be caused for which money damages would not be an adequate
remedy. Accordingly, each party agrees that, prior to any termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1, but subject to the last sentence of this
Section 11.8, the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the
terms hereof. In the event that any action shall be brought in equity to
enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no party shall allege, and each
hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at Law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be entitled to an
injunction to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Parent or Acquiror or to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement if (i) the
Company is in material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) the Merger has not been
consummated due to the reason of a failure of Parent and Acquiror to receive
the proceeds of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter
and neither Parent nor Acquiror is, nor are they collectively, in material
breach of its or their respective representatives, warranties, covenants or
obligations under this Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set
forth in Section 9.1 or 9.2 not to be satisfied (other than due to a breach
consisting of the failure to consummate the Merger due to the failure to
receive the proceeds of the Financing). Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
Parent nor Acquiror shall be entitled to an injunction to prevent breaches of
this Agreement by the Company or to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement if either Parent or Acquiror is, or collectively
are, in material breach of its or their respective representations,
warranties, covenants and obligations under this Agreement so as to cause any
of the conditions set forth in Section 9.1 or 9.2 not to be satisfied.

11.9. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the exhibits and
schedules hereto), the Voting Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof.

11.10. _Authorship; Representation by Counsel_. The parties agree that the
terms and language of this Agreement were the result of negotiations between
the parties and, as a result, there shall be no presumption that any
ambiguities in this Agreement shall be resolved against any party. Any
controversy over construction of this Agreement shall be decided without
regard to events of authorship or negotiation. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges that it has been represented by independent counsel of its choice
throughout all negotiations that have preceded the execution of this
Agreement.

11.11. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall  



 

62  nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner adverse to any party. Upon a determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
extent possible.

11.12. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED UPON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

11.13. _Rules of Construction_.

(a) The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only
and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. In this Agreement (i) words denoting the singular include the
plural and vice versa, (ii) "it" or "its" or words denoting any gender
include all genders, (iii) the word "including" shall mean "including without
limitation," whether or not expressed, (iv) any reference herein to a Section,
Article, Paragraph, Clause or Schedule refers to a Section, Article,
Paragraph or Clause of or a Schedule to this Agreement, unless otherwise
stated, and (v) when calculating the period of time within or following which
any act is to be done or steps taken, the date which is the reference day in
calculating such period shall be excluded and if the last day of such period
is not a Business Day, then the period shall end on the next day which is a
Business Day.

(b) The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule or
Parent and Acquiror Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed an admission or
acknowledgment, in and of itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of such
information in the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent and Acquiror
Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, that such information is required to be
listed in the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent and Acquiror Disclosure
Schedule, as applicable, or that such items are material to the Company,
Parent or Acquiror, as the case may be. The headings, if any, of the
individual sections of each of the Company Disclosure Schedule and Parent and
Acquiror Disclosure Schedule are inserted for convenience only and shall not
be deemed to constitute a part thereof or a part of this Agreement. The
Company Disclosure Schedule and Parent and Acquiror Disclosure Schedule are
arranged in sections corresponding to those contained in Articles IV and V, as
applicable, merely for convenience, and the disclosure of an item in one
section of the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent and Acquiror Disclosure
Schedule as an exception to a particular representation or warranty shall be
deemed adequately disclosed as an exception with respect to all other
representations or warranties to the extent that the relevance of such item to
such representations or warranties is reasonably apparent on the face of such
item, notwithstanding the presence or absence of an appropriate section of the
Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent and Acquiror Disclosure Schedule with
respect to such other representations or warranties or an appropriate cross
reference thereto.

(c) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Company Disclosure
Schedule or Parent and Acquiror Disclosure Schedule is not intended and shall
not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment of the materiality of
such amounts or items, nor shall the same be used in any dispute or
controversy between the parties to determine whether any obligation, item or
matter (whether or not described herein or included in any schedule) is or is
not material for purposes of this Agreement.

(d) The fact that any representation or warranty of the Company is given only
as of the date of this Agreement shall not prevent any event, circumstance or
condition occurring after the date of this Agreement that would otherwise be
within the scope of such representation or warranty from being taken into
account when determining whether the condition set forth in Section 9.3(b)
has been satisfied as of the Closing Date.



 

63 11.14. _Affiliate Liability_. Each of the following is herein referred to as
a "Company Affiliate" or "Parent Affiliate", as applicable: (i) any direct or
indirect holder of equity interests or securities in the Company or Parent, as
applicable, (whether limited or general partners, members, stockholders or
otherwise), and (ii) any director, officer, employee, representative or agent
of (1) the Company or Parent, as applicable, or (2) any Person who controls
the Company or Parent, as applicable. Except to the extent that a Company
Affiliate is an express party thereto, no Company Affiliate shall have any
liability or obligation to Parent or Acquiror of any nature whatsoever in
connection with or under this Agreement, the Voting Agreements or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby as a result of such Persons
status as a Company Affiliate, and Parent and Acquiror hereby waive and
release all claims of any such liability and obligation. Except to the extent
that a Parent Affiliate is an express party thereto, no Parent Affiliate
shall have any liability or obligation to the Company of any nature whatsoever
in connection with or under this Agreement, the Voting Agreements or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby as a result of such Persons
status as a Parent Affiliate, and the Company hereby waives and releases all
claims of any such liability and obligation.
