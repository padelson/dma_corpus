Commitment Letter has been previously provided to the Company. Acquiror has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by such Commitment Letter to be paid as of the date hereof. As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letter is
valid and in full force and effect, does not contain any material misrepresentation by Parent (other than those resulting from inaccurate information, if any, provided by the Company) and no event has occurred which (with or without notice, lapse of

the Commitment Letter. The aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Commitment Letter, together with available cash of Parent and Acquiror, will be sufficient for Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, the
