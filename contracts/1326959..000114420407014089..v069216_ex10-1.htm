**ARTICLE  I**

 

**THE  MERGER**

 

 

1.1 _The  Merger_.  At the  Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3), in
accordance with the Florida  Act and the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Merger Sub shall be merged  with and into the Company. From and
after the Effective Time, the separate  corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease and the Company, as the surviving  entity in the Merger, shall
continue its existence under the Florida Act as  a  wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent. The Company as the surviving entity after  the  Merger is
hereinafter sometimes referred to as the " _Surviving  Entity_."

 

 

1.2 _Closing_.  Unless  this Agreement shall have been terminated and the
transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement abandoned pursuant to the
provisions of Article VIII, and subject  to the satisfaction or waiver, as
the case may be, of the conditions set forth  in Article VI, the closing of
the Merger and other transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement (the "
_Closing_ ")  shall  take place at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time) on a
date to be mutually agreed  upon by the parties (the " _Closing  Date_ "), 
which  date shall be no later than the second Business Day (as defined below)
after  all  the conditions set forth in Article VI (excluding conditions
that, by their  nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing) shall have
been satisfied or  waived in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
unless another time  and/or date is agreed to in writing by the parties. The
Closing shall take  place  at the offices of Mintz Levin Cohn Ferris Glovsky
and Popeo, P.C. in New York,  New York. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Business  Day_ " shall  mean any day on which banks are permitted to be
open in New York, New  York.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

1.3 _Effective  Time_.  Subject  to the provisions of this Agreement, on
the Closing Date or as soon thereafter  as is practicable the parties shall
cause the Merger to become effective by  executing and filing in accordance
with the Florida Act a certificate of merger  with the Secretary of State of
the State of Florida in substantially the form  of  _Exhibit  A_  
attached  hereto (the " _Certificate  of Merger_ "),  the  date and time
of such filing, or such later date and time as may be agreed  upon  by the
parties and specified therein, being hereinafter referred to as the  "
_Effective  Time_."

 

 

1.4 _Effect  of the Merger_.  At the  Effective Time, the Merger shall have
the effects set forth in this Agreement  and in the Florida Act. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and  subject thereto, at the
Effective Time all the assets, properties, rights,  privileges, immunities,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub  shall vest in the
Surviving Entity and all debts, liabilities and duties of  the  Company and
Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the  Surviving
Entity.

 

 

1.5 _Certificate  of Formation and Limited Liability Company Agreement_. 
From  and after the Effective Time and without further action on the part of
the  parties, the Certificate of Formation of the Company immediately prior
to the  Effective Time shall be the Certificate of Formation of the Surviving
Entity  until amended in accordance with the terms thereof. From and after
the Effective  Time, the operating agreement set forth on Exhibit B attached
hereto shall  be  the operating agreement of the Surviving Entity until
amended in accordance  with  terms thereof.

 

 

1.6 Merger  Consideration.

 

 

(a) The  aggregate consideration (the " _Merger  Consideration_ ")  to be 
paid or reserved for issuance by Parent and Merger Sub in the Merger to the 
Members shall be (1) 50,000,000 fully paid and non-assessable shares of
common  stock of Parent, par value $0.001 per share (the " _Parent  Common
Stock_ "),  and  (2) 24,666,666 shares of Parent Common Stock which shall be
deposited in and  subject to the Escrow created and established pursuant to
Section 1.15 provided  that all the transactions contemplated by the Optioned
Property Provider  Agreement (as defined in Section 2.3(a)) have been
completed (in any event,  such  shares to be deposited in the Escrow shall
sometimes be referred to as the  " _Escrow  Shares_ ").  At  the Effective
Time, each Company Membership Interest held by a Member  immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, and  without any action on
the part of such Member, be converted automatically into  and become the
aggregate of the Merger Consideration and shall be allocated  among the
Members as set forth on _Schedule  1.6(a)_   (which  Schedule shall be
amended from time to time to reflect the addition of any  new  Members to
the Company and which final Schedule shall be delivered at least  one  week
prior to Closing). In the event that the transactions contemplated by  the 
Optioned Property Provider Agreement have not closed prior to the Closing
Date,  the first 12,500,000 shares of Parent Common Stock that would have
been Earned  Shares will not be issued and the balance of 12,166,666 shares
of Parent Common  Stock will be issued and deposited in Escrow and constitute
part of the Merger  Consideration and be subject to return to Parent in
accordance with the  provisions of Section 1.19.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) From  and  after the Effective Time, all membership interests of the
Company, (together,  " _Company  Membership Interests_ ")  (other  than
any Company Membership Interests to be canceled and retired pursuant to 
Section 1.7) shall be deemed canceled and shall cease to exist, and each 
holder of a Company Membership Interest shall cease to have any rights with 
respect thereto except as set forth herein or under applicable law. As soon 
as  practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall furnish one or more 
certificates representing the prescribed number of shares of Parent Common 
Stock  to the Members in accordance with Section 1.14 hereof.

 

 

1.7 _Cancellation  of Membership Interests_.  Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each Company Membership Interest owned  by Parent or any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary (as defined in  Section 2.2(a)) of
Parent or the Company, shall be canceled and  extinguished without any
conversion thereof or payment therefor.

 

 

1.8 _No  Further Ownership Rights in Company Membership Interests_.  All 
shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Company  Membership Interests in accordance with the terms of this Article I
shall be  deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to  such  Company Membership Interests under this Article I. If,
after the Effective  Time,  certificates representing Company Membership
Interests are presented to Parent  or Surviving Entity for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as  provided in this Article I.

 

 

1.9 _Membership  Interests of Merger Sub_.  Parent's ownership interest in
Merger Sub (the " _Merger  Sub Membership Interest_ ")  shall  be converted
automatically into a 100% membership interest in the Company. 

 

 

1.10 _Adjustments  to Merger Consideration_.  Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the Merger Consideration  shall be adjusted, at
any time and from time to time, to fully reflect the  effect of any stock
split, reverse split, stock dividend (including, without  limitation, any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent  Common
Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with  respect
to Parent Common Stock, occurring prior to the Closing.

 

 

1.11 _No  Fractional Shares_.  No  certificate or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock  shall  be issued as part of the
Merger Consideration, and such fractional share  interests will not entitle
the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights  of a  stockholder of
Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,  each holder
of Company Membership Interests who would otherwise be entitled  to  receive
a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account  all
Company Membership Interests) shall receive from Parent, in lieu thereof, 
the next highest number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 

 

1.12 _No  Liability_.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, none of the Parent,  Merger Sub or the Surviving Entity shall be
liable to a Member for any shares  of  Parent Common Stock or any amount of
cash properly paid to a public official  pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar  law.

 

 

1.13 _Taking  of Necessary Action; Further Action_.  If, at  any time and
from time to time after the Effective Time, any further action  is 
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to
vest  in the Surviving Entity full right, title and possession of all
assets,  properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company
and Merger  Sub, the officers and directors of the Surviving Entity shall be
and are fully  authorized and directed, in the name of and on behalf of the
Company and Merger  Sub, to take, or cause to be taken, all such lawful and
necessary action as  is  not inconsistent with this Agreement.

 

 

1.14 _Letter  of Transmittal_.  As  promptly as practicable before or after
the Effective Time, Parent (or its  designee or exchange agent) will send to
each Member as set forth on  _Schedule  1.6(a)_   a letter  of transmittal
for use in enabling Parent to issue one or more certificates  representing
the prescribed number of shares of Parent Common Stock to which  such Member
may be entitled as determined in accordance with the provisions  of  this
Agreement. Upon delivery of a duly executed letter of transmittal, such 
Member will be entitled to receive the portion of the Merger Consideration 
to  which such Member may be entitled (as determined in accordance with the 
provisions of this Agreement). It is intended that such letter of
transmittal  will contain provisions requiring each executing Member thereof
to (a)  acknowledge and agree to be bound by Sections 1.6 (Merger
Consideration) and  1.19 (Earn-Out) of this Agreement, (b) make
representations and warranties  with  respect to ownership of the Company
Membership Interests owned or held by such  Member at that time, and (c)
waive all appraisal or dissenter's rights, in each  case, in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and as a condition precedent  to Parent's
obligation to issue shares of Parent Common Stock to such Member. If  any
certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock are to be issued  in
a  name other than that as set forth in _Schedule  1.6(a)_ ,  it  shall be
a condition that the person requesting such shall deliver to Parent  (or 
its designee) all documents necessary to evidence and effect such transfer 
and  pay to Parent (or its designee) any transfer or other taxes required by
reason  of such issuance or establish to the satisfaction of Parent (or its
designee)  that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.

 

 

1.15 _Escrow_.  (a) To  provide for the indemnity obligations set forth in
Article VII and to provide  for the return of certain shares of Parent Common
Stock in the event that  certain performance criteria set forth in Section
1.19 are not met, the  Escrow Shares shall be deposited in escrow (the "
_Escrow_ ").   The Escrow Shares shall be subject to the terms and conditions
provided  herein and the Escrow Agreement to be entered into at the Closing
between  Parent, F. Dave Clark Irrevocable Trust under Agreement dated August
31, 2004  (the "Clark Trust"), David Schwarz and Continental Stock Transfer
and Trust  Company (" _Continental_ ")  (or  another escrow agent
acceptable to the parties), as Escrow Agent, in  substantially the form
annexed hereto as _Exhibit  C_   (the " _Escrow  Agreement_ ").  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Any  Escrow Shares that become Forfeited Shares pursuant to the operation
of Section  1.19 (due to the failure to satisfy certain performance targets
provided  therein) shall be removed from the Escrow, shall cease to be
Escrowed Shares  and  shall be returned to Parent, at such time such shares
shall be retired by  Parent.

 

 

(c) Except  as  provided in subsection (d) hereof (providing for certain
Earned Shares to be  set  aside to cover the indemnification obligations of
the Members as set forth  in  Article VII), any Escrow Shares that become
Earned Shares pursuant to the  operation of Section 1.19 (due to the
satisfaction of certain performance  targets provided therein) shall be
released from the Escrow and the Escrow  Agent  shall deliver the Escrow
Shares to the Clark Trust and David Schwarz, pro rata  among them in
accordance with the distribution of the Merger Consideration  as  set forth
on Schedule 1.6(a).

 

 

(d) Until  the  date that is twelve (12) months subsequent to the Closing
Date, the first  10,000,000 Earned Shares shall be retained in the Escrow and
treated as  deposited into a separate account for the purpose of setting
aside certain  Earned Shares for the possible satisfaction of the
indemnification obligations  of the Clark Trust and David Schwarz pursuant to
Article VII (such account  shall  be referred to herein as the " _Earned 
Shares Indemnity Escrow Account_ ").  On  the date that is twelve (12)
months and one day subsequent to the Closing Date,  only 5,000,000 Earned
Shares, shall be retained in the Earned Shares Indemnity  Escrow Account and
the excess Earned Shares shall be released from the Escrow  and the Escrow
Agent shall deliver such excess Escrow Shares to the Clark Trust  and David
Schwarz, pro rata among them in accordance with the distribution  of  the
Merger Consideration as set forth on Schedule 1.6(a). On the date that  is 
eighteen (18) months subsequent to the Closing Date, pursuant to Article
VII,  the indemnity obligation of the Clark Trust and David Schwarz shall
terminate  under this Agreement and any shares remaining in the Earned Shares
Indemnity  Escrow Account shall be released from the Escrow and the Escrow
Agent shall  deliver the Escrow Shares to the Clark Trust and David Schwarz,
pro rata among  them in accordance with the distribution of the Merger
Consideration as set  forth on Schedule 1.6(a). Any Earned Shares that are
deposited in the Earned  Shares Indemnity Escrow Account and are used to
satisfy an indemnification  obligation pursuant to Article VII shall be
removed from the Escrow, shall  cease  to be Escrowed Shares and shall be
returned to Parent, at such time such shares  shall be retired by Parent.
Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Section  1.15(d), the
indemnification provisions of Article VII, and specifically Section  7.4, and
the Escrow Agreement shall control any releases of Earned Shares from  the
Earned Shares Indemnity Escrow Account to satisfy the Article VII 
indemnification obligations and the general operation and maintenance of
such  Account.

 

 

(e) Escrow  Shares shall be issued and outstanding on the balance sheet of
Parent and it  is  the intention of the parties hereto that such shares be
legally outstanding  under Delaware law. All dividends payable on the Escrow
Shares shall be  distributed to the Clark Trust and David Schwarz pro rata
among them in  accordance with the distribution of the Merger Consideration
as set forth on  Schedule 1.6(a). The Clark Trust and David Schwarz shall be
entitled to vote  the  Escrow Shares. .

 

 

1.16 _Rule  145_.  All  shares of Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to
this Agreement to "affiliates" of the Company listed on _Schedule  1.16_  
will be  subject to  certain resale restrictions under Rule 145 promulgated
under the Securities  Act  of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities  Act_
")  and  all certificates representing such shares shall bear an appropriate
restrictive  legend. At the Closing, Parent and the Members shall execute and
deliver a  Registration Rights Agreement in the form annexed hereto as
_Exhibit  D_   with  respect to registration of the shares of Parent Common
Stock under the  Securities Act (the " _Registration  Rights Agreement_ ").

1.17 _Member  Matters_. Each  Member, for itself only, represents and
warrants as follows: (i) all Parent  Common Stock to be acquired by such
Member pursuant to this Agreement will  be  acquired for his, her or its
account and not with a view towards distribution  thereof other than, with
respect to Members that are entities, transfers to  its  stockholders,
partners or members; (ii) it understands that he, she or it must  bear the
economic risk of the investment in the Parent Common Stock, which  cannot be
sold by he, she or it unless it is registered under the Securities  Act, or
an exemption therefrom is available thereunder; (iii) he, she or it  has 
had both the opportunity to ask questions and receive answers from the
officers  and directors of Parent and all persons acting on Parent's behalf
concerning the  business and operations of Parent and to obtain any
additional information  to  the extent Parent possesses or may possess such
information or can acquire  it  without unreasonable effort or expense
necessary to verify the accuracy of  such  information; and (iv) he, she or
it has had access to the Parent SEC Reports  filed prior to the date of this
Agreement. Each Member acknowledges, as to  himself, herself or itself only,
that (v) he, she or it is either (A) an "accredited investor" as such term is
defined in Rule 501(a) promulgated under  the Securities Act, or (B) a person
possessing sufficient knowledge and  experience in financial and business
matters to enable it to evaluate the merits  and risks of an investment in
Parent; and (vi) he, she or it understands that  the certificates
representing the Parent Common Stock to be received by he,  she  or it may
bear legends to the effect that the Parent Common Stock may not be 
transferred except upon compliance with (C) the registration requirements of 
the  Securities Act (or an exemption therefrom), and (D) the provisions of
this  Agreement. Each Member that is an entity, for itself, represents,
warrants  and  acknowledges, with respect to each holder of its equity
interests, to the same  effect as the foregoing provisions of this Section
1.17(a).

 

 

(b) Each  Member, for himself, herself or itself, represents and warrants
that the  execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Member does not,
and the  performance of his, her or its obligations hereunder will not,
require any  consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or
notification  to, any court, administrative agency, commission, governmental
or regulatory  authority, domestic or foreign (a " _Governmental  Entity_
"),  except (i) for applicable requirements, if any, of the Securities Act,
the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (" _Exchange  Act_ "), 
state  securities laws (" _Blue  Sky Laws_ "),  and  the rules and
regulations thereunder, and (ii) where  the  failure to obtain such
consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to  make such filings or
notifications, would not, individually or in the aggregate,  reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on such Member or  the  Company
or, after the Closing, the Parent, or prevent consummation of the Merger  or
otherwise prevent the parties hereto from performing their obligations under 
this Agreement.

 

 

1.18 _Committee  for Purposes of Agreement_.  Prior  to the Closing, the
Board of Directors of Parent shall appoint a committee  consisting of one of
its then members to act on behalf of Parent to take all  necessary actions
and make all decisions pursuant to the Escrow Agreement  regarding Parent's
right to indemnification pursuant to Article VII hereof. In  the event of a
vacancy in such committee, the Board of Directors of Parent  shall  appoint
as a successor a Person who was a director of Parent prior to the  Closing
Date or some other Person who would qualify as an "independent" director  of
Parent and who has not had any relationship with the Company prior to the 
Closing. Such committee is intended to be the " _Committee_ "  referred to in
Article VII hereof and the Escrow Agreement.

1.19 _Return of  Escrow Shares for Failure to Meet Performance Measures_

 

 

(a) As  promptly as practicable after the end of the twelve (12) month period
commencing  on January 1, 2007 and ending on December 31, 2007 and the twelve
(12) month  period commencing on January 1, 2008 and ending on December 31,
2008 (each,  a " _Performance  Period_ ")  but in  no event later than 90
days thereafter, Parent will deliver or cause to be  delivered to the Clark
Trust and David Schwarz a statement for the  applicable Performance Period
(the " _Net  Income Statement_ ")  setting forth the calculation of the net
income (after taxes) of the Company  for such Performance Period. The Net
Income Statement shall  be prepared using the audited financial statements of
Parent and shall  be final and binding on the parties. In order to facilitate
the calculation  of any Escrow Shares that shall be returned to the Company
pursuant to  this Section  1.19 and retired by the Company (" _Forfeited 
Shares_ "),  Parent shall account for the Company and its Subsidiaries
separately from other  assets held and businesses conducted by Parent and
its  Affiliates during the applicable  Performance Period.

 

 

(b) Escrow  Shares shall become Forfeited Shares, in which case such
Forfeited Shares shall  be taken from the Clark Trust and David Schwarz (pro
rata among them in  accordance with the distribution of the Merger
Consideration as set forth on  Schedule 1.6(a)) within fifteen (15) Business
Days following the delivery  of the applicable Net Income Statement, as
provided in Schedule 1.19  hereto. For the 2007 Performance Period, the
difference  between 12,333,333 shares less the Forfeited Shares for the 2007
Performance  Period shall become Earned Shares pursuant to this Section 
1.19. For the 2008 Performance Period, difference  between 12,333,333 shares
less the Forfeited Shares for the 2008 Performance  Period shall become
Earned Shares pursuant to this Section  1.19.

 

 

(c) The  Net  Income targets set forth on Schedule 1.19 shall be
appropriately adjusted  pro rata to reflect any stock issuances on a time-
weighted basis (for example,  an issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock
(excluding the Escrow Shares  and shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon
exercise of options and warrants)  on January 1, 2008 representing 5% of the
issued and outstanding shares of  capital stock of Parent on a fully-diluted
basis shall increase targeted Net  Income by 5% and an issuance of shares of
Parent Common Stock (excluding  the Escrow Shares and shares of Parent Common
Stock issued upon exercise of  options and warrants) on July 1, 2008
representing 5% of the issued and  outstanding shares of capital stock of
Parent on a fully-diluted basis shall  increase targeted Net Income by 2.5%).
Similarly, the number of Escrow  Shares that become Forfeited Shares under
this Section 1.19 and the  target stock prices used above shall be
appropriately adjusted for any stock  splits, stock dividends,
reorganizations and similar events.

 

 

1.20 _Outstanding  Company Derivative Securities_.  The  Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, arrange that the holders  of  all
outstanding options, warrants and other derivative securities of the Company 
or any Subsidiary exercise such securities prior to the Effective Time. Such 
exercise may be made contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing and no
Person  shall have any right to acquire any ownership or other equity
interest in the  Company or any Subsidiary (other than Parent at Closing).

Except  as  set forth in the disclosure schedule provided by the Company to

hereof should  any  fact or condition require a change thereto (the "
_Company  Disclosure Schedule_ "),  the  Company represents and warrants to
Parent that the statements contained in  this  Article II are true, complete
and correct as of the date hereof and as of the  Closing Date unless such

limitation, intangible assets), financial condition, results of operations 
of  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. A " _Project 
Material Adverse Effect_ " shall  mean any change, event or effect that is
materially adverse to the business,  assets (including without limitation
intangible assets) financial condition  or  results of operations of any
individual Material Project. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, " _Company 
Material Adverse Effect_ " and  " _Project  Material Adverse Effect_
" shall  not include events caused by general economic conditions (but shall
include  economic conditions applicable solely or principally to the
hospitality or  resort industries or to locations in which the Company and
its Subsidiaries  operate). The following projects shall constitute "
_Material  Projects_ ":  Orlando, Sandpiper, Bayshore, Crested Butte, Boca

other  section of the Company Disclosure Schedules where it is reasonably
apparent  that  such exception is applicable.

 

 

2.1 _Organization  and Qualification_.  (a) The  Company is a limited
liability company duly organized, validly existing and  in  good standing
under the laws of the State of Florida, and is qualified to do  business in
Florida and all other jurisdictions where the character of the  properties
and other assets owned, leased or operated by it, or the nature  of  its
activities, makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where 
the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing, individually 
or in  the aggregate, has not had and would not be expected to have a Company
Material  Adverse Effect. The Company is in possession of all franchises,
grants,  authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, consents,
certificates, approvals  and orders (" _Approvals_ ")  necessary to own,
lease and operate the properties it purports to own, operate  or lease and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except  where  the
failure to have such Approvals could not, individually or in the aggregate, 
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The 
Company has delivered to Parent true, complete and correct copies of its 
Certificate of Formation and operating agreement of the Company (the "
_Operating  Agreement_ "),  each  as amended to date. The Company is not in
default under or in violation of  any  provision of its Certificate of
Formation or Operating Agreement.

Subsidiary of the Company and of  all  jurisdictions in which the Company or
any such Subsidiary is qualified or  licensed to do business. Attached to
_Schedule  2.2(a)_   is an  organizational chart of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. For purposes of this  Agreement, the term " _Subsidiary_
" means,  with respect to any Person, any corporation or other organization,
whether  incorporated or unincorporated, of which: (i) such Person (or any

with respect to such corporation or other  organization, is directly or

Subsidiaries, or by such Person and one or more of its  Subsidiaries. Except
for the Subsidiaries set forth on _Schedule  2.2(a)_ ,  the  Company does
not own, directly or indirectly, any ownership, equity, profits  or  voting
interest in any Person or have any agreement or commitment to purchase  any
such interest, and has not agreed and is not obligated to make nor is bound 
by any written, oral or other agreement, contract, subcontract, lease,
binding  understanding, instrument, note, option, warranty, purchase order,
license,  sublicense, insurance policy, benefit plan, commitment or
undertaking of any  nature, as of the date hereof or as may hereafter be in
effect under which  it  may become obligated to make, any future investment
in or capital contribution  to any other entity.

 

 

(b) Each  Subsidiary that is a corporation is duly incorporated, validly
existing and  in  good standing under the laws of its state of
incorporation  (as listed on _Schedule  2.2(a)_ )  and has  the requisite
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its assets  and
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being or currently 
planned by the Company to be conducted. Each Subsidiary that is a limited 
liability company is duly organized or formed, validly existing and in good 
standing under the laws of its state of organization or formation (as listed 
on  _Schedule  2.2(a)_ )  and has  the requisite power and authority to
own, lease and operate its assets and  properties and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted by the  Company. Each Subsidiary is in
possession of all Approvals necessary to own,  lease and operate the
properties it purports to own, operate or lease and to  carry on its business
as it is now being or currently planned by the Company  to  be conducted,
except where the failure to have such Approvals could not,  individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material  Adverse Effect
on the Company or such Subsidiary. Complete and correct copies  of  the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or other comparable governing 
instruments with different names) (collectively referred to herein as "
_Charter  Documents_ ")  of  each Subsidiary, as amended and currently in
effect, have been heretofore  delivered or made available to Parent or

foreign corporation  or foreign limited liability company and is in good
standing in each  jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned,
leased or operated  by  it or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification or licensing  necessary, except for such failures to be so duly
qualified or licensed and  in  good standing that could not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably  be  expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company or such Subsidiary.  Each jurisdiction in which each
Subsidiary is so qualified or licensed is listed  in _Schedule  2.2(a)_.

 

 

(d) The  minute books of each Subsidiary contain true, complete and accurate

2.23 _Insurance_.  _Schedule  2.23_   sets  forth a list of all material
insurance policies covering the properties and  activities of the Company,
its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses.  All  such policies are in
full force and effect and shall be kept in full force  and  effect in the
ordinary course of business. Neither the Company nor any  Subsidiary of the
Company have received any written notice of cancellation  or  non-renewal
with respect to such policies. Neither the Company nor any  Subsidiary of the
Company have received written notice, nor does the Company  have Knowledge
that it is in default with respect to its obligations under  such  insurance
policies. Except as set forth on _Schedule  2.23_ ,  neither  the Company
nor any Subsidiary of the Company has been refused any insurance  coverage
obtained for the purpose of protecting and insuring against any  material

insurance  policies provide adequate coverage for all normal risks incident
to the business  of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
properties and assets,  including construction projects. _Schedule  2.23_  
identifies those pending (or threatened) Actions with respect to which an 
insurance carrier has denied coverage or has advised the Company or the
relevant  Subsidiary that it is defending such claim under reservation of
rights and  which, if determined or resolved adversely to the Company or its
Subsidiaries,  could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a  Material Adverse Effect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries or a Project  Material Adverse Effect.

case of unaudited statements, do not contain  footnotes as permitted by Form
10-QSB of the Exchange Act) and each fairly  presents or will fairly present
in all material respects the financial position  of Parent at the respective
dates thereof and the results of its operations  and  cash flows for the

Parent, except (i) liabilities provided for in or otherwise  disclosed in
Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, and (ii)  liabilities
incurred since September 30, 2006 in the ordinary course of  business, none

consistent with past practice,  or any granting by Parent of any increase in
severance or termination pay or  any  entry by Parent into any currently
effective employment, severance, termination  or indemnification agreement or

3.10 _Litigation_.  There  are no claims, suits, actions or proceedings
pending or to Parent's Knowledge,  threatened against Parent, before any
court, governmental  department, commission, agency, instrumentality or
authority, or any arbitrator  that seeks to restrain or enjoin the
consummation of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement or which
could reasonably be expected, either  singularly or in the aggregate with all
such claims, actions or proceedings,  to  have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent or have a Material Adverse Effect  on  the ability of the parties
hereto to consummate the Merger. There  has  not been, and to the Knowledge
of the Parent, there is not pending or  contemplated, any investigation by
the SEC or any state or other regulatory  body  involving the Parent or any
current or former director or officer of the Parent.  The SEC has not issued
any stop order or other order suspending the  effectiveness of any
registration statement filed by the Parent under the  Exchange Act or the
Securities Act.

 

 

3.11 _Restrictions  on Business Activities_.  Except  as set forth in the
Parent Charter Documents, there is no agreement, commitment,  judgment,
injunction, order or decree binding upon Parent or to which Parent  is  a
party which has or could reasonably be expected to have the effect of 
prohibiting or materially impairing any business practice of Parent, any 
acquisition of property by Parent or the conduct of business by Parent as 
currently conducted other than such effects, individually or in the
aggregate,  which have not had and could not reasonably be expected to have,
a Material  Adverse Effect on Parent.

36  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a) Parent  has timely filed all Returns required to be filed by Parent with

shown  on any Return) have been paid. The Parent is not the beneficiary of

there any  material Tax deficiency outstanding, assessed, or proposed by any
Tax authority  based on personal contact by the Parent or any officers or

Parent executed any unexpired waiver of any statute of limitations extending 
or  waiving the period for the assessment or collection of any Tax.

to Parent or any director  or officer of Parent.

 

 

(f) Parent  has no liability for any material unpaid Taxes which have not
been accrued  for  or reserved on Parent's balance sheets included in the
audited financial  statements for the most recent fiscal year ended, whether
asserted or  unasserted, contingent or otherwise, which would constitute a
Parent Material  Adverse Effect, other than any liability for unpaid Taxes
that may have accrued  since the end of the most recent fiscal year in
connection with the operation  of  the business of Parent in the ordinary
course of business.

 

 

(g) Parent,  the directors and officers of Parent, or any of its Affiliates
do not have  Knowledge of any fact and have not taken or agreed to take any

that could prevent  the  transactions contemplated hereby from qualifying as
a tax-free contribution  governed by Section 351(a) of the Code.

 

 

(h) Parent  is  not a party or bound to any tax allocation or sharing
agreement. Parent (i)  has  not been a member of an Affiliated Group filing
a consolidated federal Income  Tax Return (other than a group the common
parent of which was the Parent),  or  (ii) has no liability for the Taxes of
any Person (other than the Parent or  any  of its Subsidiaries) under Treas.
Reg. 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of  local, state or foreign law), as
a transferee or successor, by contract or  otherwise.

 

 

(i) Parent  has not distributed stock of another Person, or has had its stock
distributed  by  another Person, in a transaction that was purported or
intended to be governed  in whole or in part by Sections 355 or 361 of the

37  

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.13 _Brokers_.  Except  as set forth on _Schedule  3.13_ ,  Parent  has

3.14 _Agreements,  Contracts and Commitments_. 

 

 

(a) Except  as  set forth in the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date
of this Agreement,  there are no contracts, agreements, leases, mortgages,
indentures, notes, bonds,  liens, licenses, permits, franchises, purchase
orders, sales orders or other  understandings, commitments or obligations
(including without limitation  outstanding offers or proposals) of any kind,
whether written or oral, to which  Parent is a party or by or to which any of
the properties or assets of Parent  may be bound, subject or affected, which
either (i) creates or imposes a  liability greater than $25,000, or (ii) may
not be cancelled by Parent on less  than 30 days' or less prior notice ("
_Parent  Contracts_ ").  All  Parent Contracts are set forth in _Schedule 
3.14_   other  than those that are exhibits to the Parent SEC Reports.

 

 

(b) Each  Parent Contract was entered into at arms' length and in the
ordinary course, is  in full force and effect and is valid and binding upon
and  enforceable against each of the parties thereto. True, correct and
complete  copies of all Parent Contracts (or written summaries in the case of
oral Parent  Contracts) and of all outstanding offers or proposals of Parent
have been  heretofore delivered to the Company.

 

 

(c) Neither  Parent nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto
is in breach  of  or in default under, and no event has occurred which with
notice or lapse of  time or both would become a breach of or default under,
any Parent Contract,  and  no party to any Parent Contract has given any
written notice of any claim of  any  such breach, default or event, which,
individually or in the aggregate, are  reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent. Each agreement,  contract or commitment to which
Parent is a party or by which it is bound that  has not expired by its terms
is in full force  and  effect, except where such failure to be in full force
and effect is not  reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.

 

 

3.15 _Insurance_.  Except  for directors' and officers' liability insurance,
Parent does not maintain any  insurance policies.

 

 

3.16 _Interested  Party Transactions_.  Except  as set forth in the Parent
SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this  Agreement, no employee, officer,
director or stockholder of Parent or a member  of his or her immediate family
is indebted to Parent nor is Parent indebted  (or  committed to make loans
or extend or guarantee credit) to any of them, other  than reimbursement for
reasonable expenses incurred on behalf of Parent. To  Parent's knowledge,
none of such individuals has any direct or indirect  ownership interest in
any Person with whom Parent is affiliated or with whom  Parent has a material
contractual relationship, or any Person that competes  with  Parent, except
that each employee, stockholder, officer or director of Parent  and members
of their respective immediate families may own less than 5% of  the 
outstanding stock in publicly traded companies that may compete with Parent. 
To  Parent's knowledge, no officer, director or stockholder or any member of
their  immediate families is, directly or indirectly, interested in any
material  contract with Parent (other than such contracts as relate to any
such individual  ownership of capital stock or other securities of Parent).

3.18 _Over-the-Counter  Bulletin Board Quotation_.  Parent  Common Stock is
quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (" _OTC  BB_ ").  There  is
no action or proceeding pending or, to Parent's Knowledge, threatened
against  Parent by NASDAQ or NASD, Inc. (" _NASD_ ")  with  respect to any
intention by such entities to prohibit or terminate the quotation  of Parent
Common Stock on the OTC BB.

 

 

3.19 _Board  Approval_.  The  Board of Directors of Parent (including any
required committee or subgroup  of  the Board of Directors of Parent) has,
as of the date of this Agreement,  unanimously (i) declared the advisability
of the Merger and approved this  Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) determined that the  Merger is in the best interests of the
stockholders of Parent, and (iii)  determined that the fair market value of
the Company is equal to at least 80%  of  Parent's net assets.

has and will have no less than  $48,700,000 invested in United States
Government securities or in money market  funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the  Investment Company Act of 1940 in a
trust account administered by Continental  Stock Transfer and Trust Company
(the " _Trust  Fund_ "),  less  such amounts, if any, as Parent is required
to pay to stockholders who elect  to  have their shares converted to cash in
accordance with the provisions of  Parent's Charter Documents.

 

 

3.21 _Governmental  Filings_.  Except  as set forth in _Schedule  3.21_
,  Parent  has been granted and holds, and has made, all filings necessary
with  Governmental Entities to  the  conduct by Parent of its business (as
presently conducted) or used or held  for  use by Parent, and true, complete
and correct copies of which have heretofore  been delivered to the Company.
Each such filing is in full force and effect  and  will not expire prior to
December 31, 2007, and Parent is in compliance  with all of its obligations
with respect thereto. No event has occurred and  is  continuing which
requires or permits, or after notice or lapse of time or both  would require
or permit, and consummation of the transactions contemplated  by  this
Agreement or any ancillary documents will not require or permit (with  or 
without notice or lapse of time, or both), any modification or termination 
of  any such filings except such events which, either individually or in
the  aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect upon Parent.

 

 

3.22 _Sarbanes-Oxley;  Internal Accounting Controls_.  The  Parent is in
material compliance with all provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley  Act  of 2002
which are applicable to it as of the Closing Date. The  Parent's  certifying
officers have evaluated the effectiveness of the Parent's  disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by the 
Parent's  most  recently filed periodic report under the Exchange Act (such
date, the "Evaluation Date"). The Parent  presented  in its most recently
filed periodic report under the Exchange Act the  conclusions of the
certifying officers about the effectiveness of the disclosure  controls and
procedures based on their evaluations as of the Evaluation  Date.

 

 

3.23 Private  Placement. Assuming the accuracy of the Members'
representations and warranties  set forth in Section 1.17, no registration
under the Securities Act is required  for the offer and sale of the Parent
Common Stock by the Parent to the Members  as contemplated hereby. The
issuance and sale of the Parent Common Stock  hereunder does not contravene
the rules and regulations of the OTC  BB.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39

registered pursuant  to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and the Parent has
taken no action  designed to, or which is likely to have the effect of,
terminating the  registration of the Common Stock under the Exchange Act nor
has the Parent  received any notification that the SEC is contemplating
terminating such  registration. The Parent has not, in the 12 months
preceding the date hereof,  received notice from the OTC BB to the effect
that the Parent is not in  compliance with the listing or maintenance
requirements of the OTC BB. The  Parent is, and has no reason to believe that
it will not in the foreseeable  future continue to be, in compliance with all
such listing and maintenance  requirements.

 

 

3.26 Application  of Takeover Protections. The Parent and its Board of
Directors have taken all  necessary action, if any, in order to render
inapplicable any control share  acquisition, business combination, poison
pill (including any distribution  under  a rights agreement) or other
similar anti-takeover provision under the Parent's  Certificate of
Incorporation (or similar charter documents) or the laws of  its  state of
incorporation that is or could become applicable to the Members as  a 
result of the Merger, including without limitation as a result of the
Parent's  issuance of the Parent Common Stock and the Members' ownership of
the Parent  Common Stock.

 

 

3.27 No  Integrated Offering. Assuming the accuracy of the Members'
representations and  warranties set forth in Section 1.17, neither the
Parent, nor any of its  affiliates, nor any Person acting on its or their
behalf has, directly or  indirectly, made any offers or sales of any security
or solicited any offers  to  buy any security, under circumstances that
would cause this offering of the  Parent Common Stock to be integrated with
prior offerings by the Parent for  purposes of the Securities Act or any
applicable shareholder approval provisions  of the OTC BB on which any of the
securities of the Parent are listed or  designated.

 

 

3.28 Manipulation  of Price. The Parent has not, and to its Knowledge no one
acting on its  behalf has, (i) taken, directly or indirectly, any action
designed to cause  or  to result in the stabilization or manipulation of the
price of any security  of  the Parent to facilitate the sale or resale of
any of its Common Stock, (ii)  sold, bid for, purchased, or paid any
compensation for soliciting purchases  of,  any of the securities of the
Parent, or (iii) paid or agreed to pay to any  person any compensation for
soliciting another to purchase any other securities  of the Parent.

 

 

3.29 Representations  and Warranties Complete.  The  representations and
warranties of Parent included in this Agreement, as modified  by the Parent
Schedules, are true and complete in all material respects and  do  not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material 
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
contained  therein not misleading, under the circumstance under which they
were made.  Except for the representations and warranties made by the Parent
and the Merger  Sub in this Agreement, neither the Parent nor any other
Person makes any  representation or warranty with respect to the Parent or
the Merger Sub or  their  respective business, operations, assets,
liabilities, condition (financial  or  otherwise) or prospects,
notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to the  Company or any of its
Affiliates or representatives of any documentation,  forecasts, projections
or other information with respect to any one or more  of  the foregoing.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40

and warranties of Parent set forth in this Agreement shall  not  survive the
Closing.

distributed to the holders of Parent Common Stock, and  as of  the date of

statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, 
not  misleading (provided that Parent shall not be responsible for the
accuracy  or  completeness of any information relating to the Company or any
other information  furnished by the Company for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement). The Company  represents and warrants that the information
relating to the Company supplied  by  the Company for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement will not as of the date of  its  distribution to the holders of
Parent Common Stock (or any amendment or  supplement thereto) or at the time
of the Parent Stockholders' Meeting contain  any statement which, at such
time and in light of the circumstances under which  it is made, is false or
misleading with respect to any material fact, or omits  to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order  to make the
statement therein not false or misleading.

requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange  Act, as the case may be,
and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder  applicable to such
Parent SEC Reports, and (ii) will not at the time they are  filed (and if
amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this  Agreement then
on the date of such filing or as so amended or superseded)  contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material  fact 
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements 
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not 
misleading. Except to the extent set forth in the preceding sentence, Parent 
makes no representation or warranty whatsoever concerning the Parent SEC
Reports  as of any time other than the time they were filed. At least five
(5) days  prior  to Closing, Parent shall prepare a draft Form 8-K

other information that may be  required to be disclosed with respect to the
Merger in any report or form to  be  filed with the SEC (" _Merger  Form

their  respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all 
actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or
advisable  on its part under this Agreement and applicable laws to consummate

to obtain as soon as  practicable all consents, registrations, approvals,
permits and authorizations  necessary or advisable to be obtained from any
third party (including the  respective independent accountants of the Company
and Parent) and/or any  Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger
or any of the other  transactions contemplated hereby. This obligation shall
include, on the part  of  Parent, sending a termination letter to
Continental in substantially the form  of  _Exhibit  A_   attached  to
the Investment Management Trust Agreement by and between Parent and 
Continental. Subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of
information  and the preservation of any applicable attorney-client
privilege, work-product  doctrine, self-audit privilege or other similar
privilege, each of the Company  and Parent shall have the right to review and
comment on in advance, and to  the  extent practicable each will consult the
other on, all the information relating  to such party that appears in any
filing made with, or written materials  submitted to, any third party and/or

transactions contemplated hereby. In exercising the  foregoing right, each of
the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as  promptly as practicable.

directors, officers  and stockholders  (including the directors of Parent
and the Company to be elected effective  as of  the Closing pursuant to
Section 5.2 hereof) and such other matters as may be  reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Merger, or any other  statement, filing,
notice or application made by or on behalf of the Company  and  Parent to
any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with  the 
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Each party warrants 
and  represents to the other party that all such information shall be true
and  correct in all material respects and will not contain any untrue
statement  of a  material fact or omit to state a material fact required to
be stated therein  or  necessary to make the statements contained therein,
in light of the  circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 

 

5.6 _Confidentiality;  Access to Information_. 

 

 

(a) _Confidentiality_.  Any  confidentiality agreement previously executed
by the parties shall be superseded  in its entirety by the provisions of this
Agreement. Each party agrees to  maintain in confidence any non-public
information received from the other party,  and to use such non-public
information only for purposes of consummating the  transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Such confidentiality obligations  will not apply to (i)
information which was known to the one party or their  respective agents
prior to receipt from the other party; (ii) information which  is or becomes
generally known; (iii) information acquired by a party or their  respective
agents from a third party who was not bound to an obligation of 
confidentiality; and (iv) disclosure required by law. In the event this 
Agreement is terminated as provided in Article VIII hereof, each party (x) 
will  return or cause to be returned to the other all documents and other
material  obtained from the other in connection with the Merger contemplated
hereby,  and  (y) will use its reasonable best efforts to delete from its
computer systems  all  documents and other material obtained from the other
in connection with the  Merger contemplated hereby.

financial advisors, accountants, counsel  and  other representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours, upon  reasonable notice, to
the properties, books, records and personnel of the  Company during the
period  prior to the Closing to obtain all information concerning the
business,  including the status of product development efforts, properties,
results of  operations and personnel of the Company, as Parent may reasonably
request.  No  information or knowledge obtained by Parent in any
investigation pursuant to  this Section 5.6 will affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or  warranty contained herein or the conditions to
the obligations of the parties  to  consummate the Merger.

 

 

(ii) Parent  will afford the Company and its financial advisors,
underwriters, accountants,  counsel and other representatives reasonable
access during normal business  hours, upon reasonable notice, to the
properties, books, records and personnel  of Parent during the period prior
to the Closing to obtain all information  concerning the business, including
the status of product development efforts,  properties, results of operations
and personnel of Parent, as the Company may  reasonably request.  No 
information or knowledge obtained by Parent in any investigation pursuant to 
this Section 5.6 will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or 
warranty contained herein or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties  to  consummate the Merger.

 

 

(iii) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained herein, each party
(" _Subject  Party_ ")  hereby  agrees that by proceeding with the
Closing,  it shall be conclusively deemed to have waived for all purposes
hereunder any  inaccuracy of representation or breach of warranty by another
party which is  actually known by the Subject Party prior to the Closing.

 

 

5.7 _Charter  Protections; Directors ' and Officers' Liability Insurance_. 

 

 

(a) All  rights to indemnification for acts or omissions occurring through
the Closing  Date now existing in favor of the current directors and
officers  of Parent as provided in the Charter Documents of Parent or in
any  indemnification agreements shall survive the Merger and shall continue
in full  force and effect in accordance with their terms.

 

 

(b) For  a  period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, Parent shall
cause to be  maintained in effect the current policies of directors' and
officers'  liability insurance maintained by Parent (or policies of at least
the same  coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no
less  advantageous) with respect to claims arising from facts and events that
occurred  prior to the Closing Date.

 

 

(c) If  Parent  or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any  other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving 
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or 
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each 
such  case, to the extent necessary, proper provisions shall be made so that
the  successors and assigns of Parent assume the obligations set forth in
this  Section 5.7.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) The  provisions of this Section 5.7 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall  be enforceable by, each Person who will have been a director 
or officer of Parent for all periods ending on or before the Closing Date
and  may not be changed without the consent of Committee referred to in
Section  1.18.

 

 

5.8 _Public  Disclosure_.  From  the date of this Agreement until Closing
or termination, the parties shall  cooperate in good faith to jointly prepare
all press  releases and public announcements pertaining to this Agreement and
the  transactions governed by it, and no party shall issue or otherwise make
any  public announcement or communication pertaining to this Agreement or
the  transaction without the prior consent of Parent  (in the case of the
Company and the Members) or the Company (in the case of  Parent), except as
required by any legal requirement or by the rules and  regulations of, or
pursuant to any agreement of a stock exchange or trading  system. Each party
will not unreasonably withhold approval from the others  with  respect to
any press release or public announcement. If any party determines  with the
advice of counsel that it is required to make this Agreement and the  terms
of the transaction public or otherwise issue a press release or make  public
disclosure with respect thereto, it shall, at a reasonable time before 
making any public disclosure, consult with the other party regarding such 
disclosure, seek such confidential treatment for such terms or portions of 
this  Agreement or the transaction as may be reasonably requested by the
other party  and disclose only such information as is legally compelled to be
disclosed.  This  provision will not apply to communications by any party to
its counsel,  accountants and other professional advisors. Notwithstanding
the foregoing,  the  parties hereto agree that promptly as practicable after
the execution of this  Agreement, Parent will file with the SEC a Current
Report on Form 8-K pursuant  to the Exchange Act to report the execution of
this Agreement, with respect to  which Parent shall consult with the Company.
Parent shall provide to Company  for  review and comment a draft of the
Current Report on Form 8-K prior to filing  with the SEC; provided that
unless objected to by the Company by written notice  given to Parent within
two (2) days after delivery to the Company specifying  the  language to
which reasonable objection is taken, any language included in such  Current
Report shall be deemed to have been approved by the Company and may  be 
filed with the SEC and used in other filings made by Parent with the  SEC.

 

 

5.9 _Reasonable  Efforts_.  Upon  the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, each of  the  parties agrees to use its
commercially reasonable  efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to  be  done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
parties in doing, all things  necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
and make effective, in the most  expeditious manner practicable, the Merger
and the other transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, including using
commercially reasonable efforts  to accomplish the following: (i) the taking
of all reasonable acts necessary  to  cause the conditions precedent set
forth in Article VI to be satisfied, (ii)  the  obtaining of all necessary
actions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and  authorizations from
Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary  registrations,
declarations and filings (including registrations, declarations  and filings
with Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable  steps
as may be necessary to avoid any suit, claim, action, investigation or 
proceeding by any Governmental Entity, (iii) the obtaining of all consents, 
approvals or waivers from third parties required as a result of the
transactions  contemplated in this Agreement, (iv) the defending of any
suits, claims,  actions, investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative,  challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated  hereby, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order  entered by any court or other Governmental
Entity vacated or reversed and (v)  the execution or delivery of any
additional instruments reasonably necessary  to  consummate the transactions
contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes  of, this Agreement. In
connection with and without limiting the foregoing,  Parent and its board of
directors and the Company and its board of directors  shall, if any state
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or  becomes applicable
to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the transactions  contemplated by
this Agreement, use its commercially reasonable efforts to  enable the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement  to  be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this 
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this 
Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or the Company to agree to any 
divestiture by itself or any of its affiliates of shares of capital stock or 
of  any business, assets or property, or the imposition of any material
limitation  on the ability of any of them to conduct their business or to own
or exercise  control of such assets, properties and stock.

he, she or it shall not, prior to the day that is six (6) months after the

Merger other  than as permitted pursuant to the Lock-Up Agreement in
substantially the form  of  _Exhibit  F_   hereto  executed by such
Person prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, Dave Clark
(and the Clark Trust) and David Schwarz may pledge (or  engage in any
hedging, straddling or other strategies with respect to) up to  a  maximum

Company and its directors, officers,  employees and agents, from any and all
rights, claims, demands, judgments,  obligations, liabilities and damages,
whether accrued or unaccrued, asserted  or  unasserted, and whether known or
unknown arising out of or resulting from such  Member's (i) status as a
holder of an equity interest in the Company; and (ii)  employment, service,
consulting or other similar agreement entered into with  the  Company prior
to Closing, to the extent that the bases for claims under any  such 
agreement that survives the Closing arise prior to the Closing, provided, 
however, the foregoing shall not release any obligations of Parent set forth 
in  this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

 

 

5.13 _No  Securities Transactions_.  Neither  the Company nor any Member or
any of their affiliates, directly or indirectly,  shall engage in any
transactions involving the securities of Parent prior to  the  time of the
making of a public announcement of the transactions contemplated  by  this
Agreement. The Company shall use its best efforts to require each of its 
officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives to comply with
the  foregoing requirement. Neither the Parent nor its officers or directors,
nor  any  of their respective affiliates, directly or indirectly, shall take
any action  described in Section 3.28 prior to the Closing Date.

 

 

5.14 _No  Claim Against Trust Fund_.  The  Company and the Members
acknowledge that, if the transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement are
not consummated by Parent by October 20, 2007, Parent will  be  obligated to
return to its stockholders the amounts being held in the Trust  Fund.
Accordingly, the Company and the Members hereby waive all rights against 
Parent to collect from the Trust Fund any monies that may be owed to them by 
Parent for any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to a breach of 
this  Agreement by Parent or any negotiations, agreements or understandings
with  Parent (other than as a result of the Merger, pursuant to which the
Company  would have the right to collect the monies in the Trust Fund), and
will not  seek  recourse against the Trust Fund for any reason whatsoever.

 

 

5.15 _Disclosure  of Certain Matters_.  Each of  Parent and the Company
will provide the other with prompt written notice of  any  event,
development or condition that (a) would cause any of such party's 
representations and warranties to become untrue or misleading or which may 
affect its ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement, (b) had it existed or been known on the date hereof would have
been  required to be disclosed under this Agreement, (c) gives such party any
reason  to believe that any of the conditions set forth in Article VI will
not be  satisfied, (d) is of a nature that is or may be materially adverse to
the  operations, prospects or condition (financial or otherwise) of Parent or

Company Schedules and Parent Schedules (the " _Disclosure  Schedules_ ")

**ARTICLE  VII**

 

**INDEMNIFICATION**

 

 

7.1 _Indemnification  of Parent and Company_.  (a)  Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Article VII (including without  limitation the
limitations set forth in Section 7.4), Parent and the Company  and  their
respective representatives, successors and permitted assigns (the " _Parent 
Indemnitees_ ")  shall  be indemnified, defended and held harmless,
severally by the Clark Trust and  David Schwarz pro rata in accordance with
the distribution of the Merger  Consideration issued to them, from and
against all Losses asserted against,  resulting to, imposed upon, or incurred
by any Parent Indemnitee by reason  of,  arising out of or resulting from:

 

 

(i) the  inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty of the
Company contained  in this Agreement, or  any  certificate delivered by the
Company to Parent pursuant to this Agreement with  respect hereto or thereto
in connection with the Closing; and

 

 

(ii) the  non-fulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement of the
Company contained  in this Agreement.

 

 

(b) As  used  in this Article VII, the term " _Losses_ " shall  include
all losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, orders, penalties, 
settlements, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, interest, 
penalties, court costs and reasonable legal fees and expenses) including
those  arising from any demands, claims, suits, actions, costs of
investigation,  notices of violation or noncompliance, causes of action,
proceedings and  assessments whether or not made by third parties or whether
or not ultimately  determined to be valid. Solely for the purpose of
determining the amount of  any  Losses (and not for determining any breach)
for which any party may be entitled  to indemnification pursuant to Article
VII, any representation or warranty  contained in this Agreement that is
qualified by a term or terms such as "material," "materially," or "Material
Adverse Effect" shall be deemed made or  given without such qualification and
without giving effect to such  words.

 

 

7.2 _Indemnification  of Third Party Claims_.  The  indemnification
obligations and liabilities under this Article VII with respect  to actions,
proceedings, lawsuits, investigations, demands or other claims  brought
against Parent by a Person other than the Company (a " _Third  Party Claim_
")  shall  be subject to the following terms and conditions:

 

 

(a) _Notice  of Claim_.  Parent,  acting through the Committee, will give
the Members prompt written notice after  receiving written notice of any
Third Party Claim or discovering the liability,  obligation or facts giving
rise to such Third Party Claim (a " _Notice  of Claim_ ")  which  Notice of
Third Party Claim shall set forth (i) a brief description of the  nature of
the Third Party Claim, (ii) the total amount of the actual  out-of-pocket
Loss or the anticipated potential Loss (including any costs or  expenses
which have been or may be reasonably incurred in connection therewith),  and
(iii) whether such Loss may be covered (in whole or in part) under any 
insurance and the estimated amount of such Loss which may be covered under 
such  insurance, and the Representative shall be entitled to participate in
the  defense of Third Party Claim at its expense.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) _Defense_.  The  Members shall have the right, at their option (subject
to the limitations set  forth in subsection 7.2(c) below) at their own
expense, by written  notice to Parent, to assume the entire control of,
subject to the right of  Parent to participate (at its expense and with
counsel of its choice) in, the  defense, compromise or settlement of the
Third Party Claim as to which such  Notice of Claim has been given, and shall
be entitled to appoint a recognized  and reputable counsel reasonably
acceptable to Parent to be the lead counsel  in  connection with such
defense. If the Members are permitted and elect to assume  the defense of a
Third Party Claim:

 

 

(i) the  Members shall diligently and in good faith defend such Third Party
Claim and  shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status of such
defense; provided,  however, that in the case of any settlement providing for
remedies other than  monetary damages for which indemnification is provided,
Parent shall have the  right to approve the settlement, which approval will
not be unreasonably  withheld; and

 

 

(ii) Parent  shall cooperate fully in all respects with the Members in any
such defense,  compromise or settlement thereof, including, without
limitation, the selection  of counsel, and Parent shall make available to the
Members all pertinent  information and  documents under its control.

 

 

(c) _Limitations  of Right to Assume Defense_.  The  Members shall not be
entitled to assume control of such defense if (i) the  Third  Party Claim
relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding,  action,
indictment, allegation or investigation; (ii) the Third Party Claim  seeks an
injunction or equitable relief against Parent; or (iii) there is a 
reasonable probability that a Third Party Claim may materially and adversely 
affect Parent other than as a result of money damages or other money 
payments.

 

 

(d) _Other  Limitations_.  Failure  to give prompt Notice of Claim or to
provide copies of relevant available  documents or to furnish relevant
available data shall not affect the Members'  duty or  obligations under
this Article VII, except to the extent (and only to the extent  that) such
failure shall have adversely affected the ability of the Members  to 
defend  against or reduce the Members' liability or caused or increased such
liability  or otherwise caused the damages for which the Members are
obligated to be  greater than such damages would have been had Parent given
the Members  prompt  notice hereunder. So long as the Members  are 
defending any such action actively and in good faith, Parent shall not
settle  such action. Parent shall make available to the Members  all 
relevant records and other relevant materials required by them and in the 
possession or under the control of Parent, for the use of the Members  in 
defending any such action, and shall in other respects give reasonable 
cooperation in such defense.

 

 

(e) _Failure  to Defend_.  If the  Members, promptly after receiving a
Notice of Claim, fail to defend such Third  Party Claim actively and in good
faith, Parent will (upon further written  notice) have the right to undertake
the defense, compromise or settlement of  such Third Party Claim as it may
determine in its reasonable discretion,  provided that the Members  shall 
have the right to approve any settlement, which approval will not be 
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

 

(f) _Parent 's  Rights_.  Anything in this Section 7.2 to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Members shall  not, without the written consent of
Parent, settle or compromise any action  or  consent to the entry of any
judgment which does not include as an unconditional  term thereof the giving
by the claimant or the plaintiff to Parent of a full  and  unconditional
release from all liability and obligation in respect of such  action without
any payment by Parent.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

59  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(g) _Members  Consent_.  Unless  the Members have consented to a settlement
of a Third Party Claim, the amount  of  the settlement shall not be a
binding determination of the amount of the Loss  and, if applicable, such
amount shall be determined in accordance with the  provisions of the Escrow
Agreement.

 

 

7.3 _Insurance  Effect_.  To the  extent that any Losses that are subject
to indemnification pursuant to this  Article VII are covered by insurance,
Parent shall  use  commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the maximum
recovery under such  insurance; provided that Parent shall nevertheless be
entitled to bring a claim  for indemnification under this Article VII in
respect of such Losses and the  time limitations set forth in Section 7.4
hereof for bringing a claim of  indemnification under this Agreement shall be
tolled during the pendency of  such  insurance claim. The existence of a
claim by Parent for monies from an insurer  or against a third party in
respect of any Loss shall not, however, delay any  payment pursuant to the
indemnification provisions contained herein and  otherwise determined to be
due and owing. If Parent has received the payment  required by this Agreement
from the Members in respect of any Loss and later  receives proceeds from
insurance or other amounts in respect of such Loss,  then  it shall hold
such proceeds or other amounts in trust for the benefit of the  Members and
shall pay to the Members, as promptly as practicable after receipt,  a sum
equal to the amount of such proceeds or other amount received, up to  the 
aggregate amount of any payments received hereunder or from the Escrow
Account,  as applicable, pursuant to this Agreement in respect of such
Loss.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, it is the
intention  of  the parties that no insurer or any other third party shall be
(i) entitled  to a  benefit it would not be entitled to receive in the
absence of the foregoing  indemnification provisions, or (ii) relieved of the
responsibility to pay any  claims for which it is obligated.

 

 

7.4 _Limitations  on Indemnification._

 

 

(a) _Survival:  Time Limitation_.  The  representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in this Agreement or  in  any writing delivered by
the Company to Parent in connection with this Agreement  (including the
certificate  required to be delivered by the Company pursuant to Section
6.3(a)) shall  survive the Closing until 18 months after the Closing Date
(the " _Survival  Period_ ").  The  indemnification and other obligations
under this Article VII shall survive  for  the same Survival Period and
shall terminate with the expiration of such  Survival Period, except that:
(i) any claims for breach of representation or  warranty made by a party
hereunder by filing a demand for arbitration under  Section 10.12 shall be
preserved until final resolution thereof despite the  subsequent expiration
of the Survival Period and (ii) any claims set forth  in a  Notice of Claim
sent prior to the expiration of such Survival Period shall  survive until
final resolution thereof. Except as set forth in clause (ii)  above, no claim
for indemnification under this Article VII shall be brought  after the end of
the applicable Survival Period.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

60  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) _Deductible_.  No  amount shall be payable under Article VII unless and
until the aggregate amount  of all indemnifiable Losses otherwise payable
exceeds $500,000 in the aggregate  (the " _Deductible_ "),  and  no  claim
shall be made pursuant to this Article VII until such time as the  aggregate
of such Losses exceeds $500,000.  For the  avoidance of doubt, Losses in the
amount of $500,000  shall  function as a "deductible," and only those
amounts in excess of $500,000  shall  be  recoverable pursuant to this
Article VII. Notwithstanding  anything contained herein to the contrary, the
Deductible will not be applicable  to claims arising from fraud, willful
misrepresentation or willful misconduct. 

 

 

(c) _Aggregate  Amount Limitation_. 

 

 

(i) The  aggregate liability for Losses pursuant to Section 7.1 during the
first 12  months from the Closing Date (the " _First  Indemnity Period_
"),  shall  not in any event exceed the greater of (A) $10,000,000 in cash
if 10,000,0000  shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Tranche  One Escrow
Shares_ ")  are  not deposited by the Escrow Agent in the Earned Shares
Indemnity Escrow Account  pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.15 hereof,
or, (B) if applicable, the  Tranche One Escrow Shares. If at any time during
the First Indemnity Period,  the  number of Tranche One Escrow Shares in the
Earned Shares Indemnity Escrow  Account is equal to 10,000,000 shares, then
the $10,000,000 cash indemnity  obligation of the  Clark  Trust and David
W. Schwarz (the  " _Indemnifying  Parties_ ")  shall  terminate and the
sole liability for indemnification shall be against the  Tranche One Escrow
Shares.

 

 

(ii) The  aggregate liability for Losses pursuant to Section 7.1 during the
period  beginning 12 months and one day from the Closing Date until 18 months
from  the  Closing Date (the " _Second  Indemnity Period_ "),  shall  not
in any event exceed the greater of (A) $10,000,000 in cash if less than 
5,000,0000 shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Tranche  Two Escrow Shares_
")  are in  the Earned Shares Indemnity Escrow Account pursuant to the
provisions of Section  1.15 hereof at the beginning of the Second Indemnity
Period (to the extent  not  exhausted or terminated during the First
Indemnity Period), or, (B) if  applicable, the Tranche Two Escrow Shares. If
at any time during the Second  Indemnity Period, the number of Tranche Two
Escrow Shares in the Earned Shares  Indemnity Escrow Account is equal to
5,000,000 shares, then the $10,000,000  cash  indemnity obligation of the
Indemnifying Parties, if not already exhausted,  shall terminate and the sole
liability for indemnification shall be against  the  Tranche Two Escrow
Shares.

 

 

(iii) Notwithstanding  the terms of Section 7.4(c), in no event shall the
cash portion of any liability  for Losses during the First Indemnity Period
and the Second Indemnity Period,  collectively, exceed a total aggregate
amount equal to $10,000,000 and in no  event shall the total aggregate
liability of the Indemnified Parties ever exceed  a total value of
$75,000,000.

 

 

(iv) Notwithstanding  the foregoing, the Aggregate Amount Limitation shall
not apply in the case  of  claims arising from fraud, willful
misrepresentation or willful misconduct  but  in no event shall the total
liability for Losses to any Indemnifying Party  exceed the Merger
Consideration received by the Clark Trust and David W. Schwarz  less any
taxes paid by them.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

61  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(v) To  the  extent that there is an indemnifiable Claim, the Claim shall be
satisfied in  the  following order of priority: (A) during the First
Indemnity Period, first,  from  the Tranche One Escrow Shares until such
time as the Earned Shares Indemnity  Escrow Account is reduced to zero and
second, if less than 10,000,000 shares  of  Parent Common Stock were in the
Earned Shares Indemnity Escrow Account, from  the  $10,000,000 by the
Indemnifying Members and (B) during the Second Indemnity  Period, first, from
the Tranche Two Escrow Shares until such time as the Earned  Shares Indemnity
Escrow Account is reduced to zero and second, if less than  5,000,000 shares
of Parent Common Stock were in the Earned Shares Indemnity  Escrow Account,
from the $10,000,000 by the Indemnifying Members.

 

 

(vi) For  purposes of this Article VII, each share of Parent Common Stock
included as  Tranche One Escrow Shares and Tranche  Two Escrow Shares shall
at all times have a value equal to $7.50 notwithstanding  the market price
for the Parent Common Stock as reported on the OTC BB or any  other
applicable exchange or automated quotation system at the time any Claim  is 
made hereunder.

 

 

(vii)   If  additional shares are required to be deposited in the Earned 
Shares Indemnity Escrow Account in accordance with Section 1.15 during
either  the First Indemnity Period or the Second Indemnity Period, and any
amount of  the  Uncovered Claim continues to be unsatisfied, then the first
shares of Parent  Common Stock scheduled to be placed in the Earned Shares
Indemnity Escrow  Account shall be applied to the unsatisfied portion of the
Uncovered Claim  and  the remaining shares to be  deposited in the Earned 
Shares Indemnity Escrow Account shall be reduced by the quotient of: (1) the 
amount of cash paid by the Indemnifying Parties in connection with the
Uncovered  Claim divided by (2) $7.50. For the purposes of this Agreement,
"Uncovered  Claim" shall mean a Claim where the total value of such Claim
exceeds the value  of the Parent Common Stock then contained in the Earned
Shares Indemnity Escrow  Account during the relevant indemnity period.

 



 

_For  example:_

 



 

_During  the First Indemnity Period, if there are 3,000,000 shares of Parent
Common  Stock  in the Earned Shares Indemnity Escrow Account and an
Uncovered Claim for an  amount equal to $40,000,000 is made, then, those
3,000,000 shares are applied  to  that Uncovered Claim on a $7.50 valuation.
The Indemnifying Parties still have  a  $10 million cash obligation because
there are less than the total Tranche One  Escrow Shares in the Earned Shares
Indemnity Escrow Account. Thus, because  the  shares in the Earned Shares
Indemnity Escrow Account are worth only $22,500,000  (3,000,000 x $7.50),
then the Indemnifying Parties would have to pay up to  $10  million in cash
during the First Indemnity Period for a total indemnification  payment of
$32,500,000. If 5,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock are  subsequently
scheduled to be placed in the Earned Shares Indemnity Escrow  Account, then
the first shares of Parent Common Stock scheduled to be placed  in  the
Earned Shares Indemnity Escrow Account shall be applied to the remaining 
$7,500,000 of outstanding liability from the Uncovered Claim and the
remaining  shares to_ _be  deposited in the_ _Earned  Shares Indemnity
Escrow Account shall be reduced by 1,333,000 shares of Parent  Common Stock
($10,000,000 divided by $7.50)._

7.5 _Exclusive  Remedy_.  Parent  hereby acknowledges and agrees that, from
and after the Closing, its sole and  exclusive remedy with respect to any and
all claims, whether direct, third  party  or otherwise, for money damages 
arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be pursuant and subject 
to  the requirements of the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Article  VII. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing contained in this
Article  VII  shall in any way impair, modify or otherwise limit Parent's or
Company's right  to bring any claim, demand or suit against the other party
based upon such  other  party's actual fraud or intentional or willful
misrepresentation or omission, it  being understood that a mere breach of a
representation and warranty, without  intentional or willful
misrepresentation or omission, does not constitute  fraud.

 

 

7.6 _Damages;  No Adjustment to Merger Consideration_.  Amounts  paid for
indemnification under Article VII shall constitute damages paid by  the 
Members for breach of contract and not as an adjustment to the value of the 
shares of Parent Common Stock issued by Parent as a result of the Merger. 

 

 

7.7 _Application  of Escrow Shares_.  The  parties acknowledge that all
actions to be taken by Parent pursuant to this  Article VII shall be taken on
its behalf by the Committee in accordance with  the  provisions of the
Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent, pursuant to the Escrow  Agreement after
the Closing, may apply all or a portion of the Escrow Shares  to  satisfy
any claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article VII. The Escrow  Agent
will hold the remaining portion of the Escrow Shares until final  resolution
of all claims for indemnification or disputes relating  thereto.

Company may not terminate  this Agreement under this Section 8.1(d) for
thirty (30) days after delivery  of  written notice from the Company to
Parent of such breach, provided Parent  continues to exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to cure such breach (it  being understood that the Company

time such representation  or  warranty shall have become untrue, provided,

thirty (30) days after delivery of  written notice from Parent to the Company
of such breach, provided the Company  continues to exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to cure such breach (it  being understood that Parent may
not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  Section 8.1(e) if it shall
have materially breached this Agreement or if such  breach by the Company is
cured during such thirty (30)-day period);

 

 

(f) by  either  Parent or the Company, if, at the Parent Stockholders'
Meeting (including any  adjournments thereof), this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated  thereby shall fail to be approved and adopted by
the affirmative vote of the  holders of Parent Common Stock required under
Parent's certificate of  incorporation, or the holders of 20% or more of the
number of shares of Parent  Common Stock issued in Parent's initial public
offering and outstanding as of  the date of the record date of the Parent
Stockholders' Meeting exercise their  rights to convert the shares of Parent
Common Stock held by them into cash  in  accordance with Parent's

written notice of the terminating party to the other parties  hereto. In the
event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section  8.1, this
Agreement shall be of no further force or effect and the Merger shall  be
abandoned, except for and subject to the following: (i) Sections 5.6, 5.14, 
8.2 and 8.3 and Article X (General Provisions) shall survive the termination 
of  this Agreement. The sole remedy of any party hereto for breach of this
Agreement  occurring prior to Closing by any other party hereto shall be
limited to  termination of this Agreement, and no party shall have any claim
against the  other for damages of equitable relief for breach of this
Agreement occurring  prior to the Closing.

 

 

8.3 _Fees  and Expenses_.  Whether  or not the Merger is consummated and
except as otherwise provided herein, all  fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Merger including, without  limitation, all legal,
accounting, financial advisory, consulting and all other  fees and expenses

10.3 _Counterparts;  Facsimile Signatures_.  This  Agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be  considered one
and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or  more
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to  the 
other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same 
counterpart. Delivery by facsimile or by email delivery of a ".pdf" format
data  file to counsel for the other party of a counterpart executed by a

10.4 _Entire  Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_.  This  Agreement and
the documents and instruments and other agreements among the  parties hereto
as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Exhibits  and
Schedules hereto (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties 
with  respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements
and  understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to

terms  between Parent and the Company dated February 23, 2007 is hereby
terminated  in  its entirety and shall be of no further force and effect;
and (b) are not  intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies hereunder  (except as specifically provided in this Agreement). The
representations and  warranties contained in this Agreement and made by the
parties hereto were  made  to and solely for the benefit of each other.

 



 

10.5 _Severability_.  In the  event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, becomes  or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or  unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force  and  effect and the application of
such provision to other Persons or circumstances  will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto.  The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of  this Agreement with
a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to  the  extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or 
unenforceable provision.

 

 

10.6 _Other  Remedies; Specific Performance_.  Except  as otherwise
provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred  upon a
party will be deemed  cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or  by  law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by
a party of any one remedy  will not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy. The parties hereto agree  that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions  of  this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or  were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be  entitled to seek an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this  Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any  court of the United
States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in  addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in  equity.

 

 

10.7 _Governing  Law_.  This  Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the law of  the  State of Delaware regardless of the law
that might  otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of
law  thereof.

 

 

10.8 _Rules  of Construction_.  The  parties hereto agree that they have
been represented by counsel during the  negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and, therefore, waive the  application of any law, regulation,
holding or rule of construction providing  that ambiguities in an agreement
or other document will be construed against  the  party drafting such
agreement or document.

benefit of the parties  hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

any time by execution of  an  instrument in writing signed on behalf of each
of the parties.

hereto, (ii) waive any  inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
made to such party contained  herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto and (iii) waive compliance  with any of the agreements or conditions
for the benefit of such party contained  herein. Any agreement on the part of
a party hereto to any such extension or  waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed  on  behalf of such party. Delay in
exercising any right under this Agreement shall  not constitute a waiver of
such right.

 

 

10.12 _Jurisdiction  and Venue_.  Any  civil action or legal proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement  shall be brought in the federal
and state courts located in the State of  Delaware. Each party consents to
the jurisdiction of such Delaware court in  any  such civil action or legal
proceeding and waives any objection to the laying  of  venue of any such
civil action or legal proceeding in such Delaware court.  Service of any
court paper may be effected on such party by mail, as provided  in  this
Agreement, or in such other manner as may be provided under applicable  laws,
rules of procedure or local rules.

AGREEMENT, ANY AND  ALL  TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, THE
