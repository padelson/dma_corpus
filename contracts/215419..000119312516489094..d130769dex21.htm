EXPLANATORY NOTE TO THIS EXHIBIT

The representations and warranties included in this Agreement and Plan of
Merger (the "Merger Agreement") were made by the parties to the Merger
Agreement for their respective contractual benefit. These representations and
warranties are made as of specific dates, only for purposes of the Merger
Agreement and for the benefit of the parties thereto. These representations
and warranties are subject to important exceptions and limitations agreed upon
by the parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures, made
for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties rather
than establishing these matters as facts, and were made subject to a
contractual standard of materiality that may differ from the standard
generally applicable under federal securities laws. The Merger Agreement is
filed with this report only to provide investors with information regarding
its terms and conditions, and not to provide any other factual information
regarding the Company or its business. Information concerning the subject
matter of the representations and warranties may have changed, and may
continue to change, since the date of the Merger Agreement, and such
subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Companys
public reports. Investors should not rely on the representations and
warranties contained in the Merger Agreement or any description thereof as
characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the Company,
its subsidiaries or affiliates. The information in the Merger Agreement should
be considered together with the Companys public reports filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The schedules to the Merger Agreement have
been omitted. The Company agrees to furnish supplementally a copy of any
omitted schedule to the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission upon
request.

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Parent and Merger Sub have each
unanimously (i) determined that it is in the best interests of their
respective shareholders for Parent to acquire the Company and (ii) approved
and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger, in each case on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ")

contemplated hereby, including the Merger, on the terms and subject to the

resolved to recommend that the holders of Shares (collectively, the " _Company
Shareholders_ ") adopt this Agreement on the terms and subject to the

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in
this Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties hereby
agree as follows:

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the PBCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company (the " _Merger_ ") and, as a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "),
and the separate corporate existence of the Company shall continue unaffected
by the Merger, except as set forth in  _Section 1.5_.

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place on a day that is a Business Day (a) at the office of Latham and
Watkins LLP, 885 Third Avenue, New York, NY 10022, at 10:00 a.m., Eastern
time, no later than the second (2nd) Business Day following the satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions that
are waived in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) or (b) at such
other place, time and/or date as the Parties may otherwise agree. The date
upon which the Closing actually occurs is referred to herein as the "
_Closing Date_ ".

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ , and in accordance with

Merger_ ") with respect to the Merger to be executed, acknowledged and filed
with the Department of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (the "
_Department of State_ ") in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
PBCL and shall make all other filings or recordings as may be necessary or
required under the PBCL. The Merger shall become effective on the Closing Date
at the time the Statement of Merger shall have been duly filed with
the Department of State (or such other date and time as is agreed upon by the
Parties and specified in the Statement of Merger), such date and time are
referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_ ".

 



1 Section 1.4 _Effect of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of Section 336 of the
PBCL.

Section 1.5 _Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws_. At the Effective Time and
without any further action on the part of the Company or Merger Sub, (a) the
Company Articles of Incorporation as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be amended and restated in their entirety by virtue of
the Merger to read identically to the articles of incorporation of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that the name of the Surviving
Corporation shall be "Checkpoint Systems, Inc."), and, as so amended, shall
be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law and (b)
the Company Bylaws as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be amended and restated in their entirety by virtue of the Merger to read
identically to the bylaws of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time (except that the bylaws shall be amended to reflect that the name of the
Surviving Corporation is "Checkpoint Systems, Inc."), and, as so amended,
shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended as provided by the articles of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation or by applicable Law.

 

Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers_. The Parties shall take all actions
necessary so that (a) the directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time
shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation until their successors shall have been duly elected or appointed
and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation, and (b) the officers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall,
from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation until their successors shall have been duly elected or appointed
and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Securities_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or their respective shareholders:

(i) _Conversion Generally_. Each share of common stock of the Company, par
value $0.10 per share (" _Company Common Stock_ ") (which shares of Company
Common Stock are referred to herein as the " _Shares_ "), issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Shares to
be cancelled pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(ii)_) shall be converted, subject
to _Section 2.1(b)_, into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
$10.15 (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable to the holder thereof,
without interest, upon surrender of the Certificates in accordance with
_Section 2.2(b)_. At the Effective Time, all such Shares shall cease to be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each Certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such Shares shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration therefor.

 

(ii) _Cancellation of Certain Shares_. Each Share held in the treasury of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof and no payment shall be made with
respect thereto.

 

(iii) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, no par value per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be cancelled and converted into one (1) newly and validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Change in Shares_. The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities

 



2  convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to Company Common Stock, occurring or with a record date, on or after
the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, and such adjustment to the
Merger Consideration shall provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action.

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably
satisfactory to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the
holders of Shares, for exchange in accordance with this _Article II_ , cash in
U.S. dollars in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of the
Merger Consideration payable in connection with the Merger (such cash, the "
_Exchange Fund_ ") pursuant to _Section 2.1_ in exchange for outstanding
Shares. The Paying Agent shall, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to,
deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid pursuant to _Section
2.1_ out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the
Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that: (i) no
such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration
payable to the holders of Shares; and (ii) such investments shall be in
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or
instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated P-1 or A-1 or better
by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are
then publicly available). Any net profit resulting from, or interest or
income produced by, such investments shall be payable to Parent, and any
amounts in excess of the amounts payable pursuant to _Section 2.1_ shall be
promptly returned to Parent. In the event that the Exchange Fund shall be
insufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable in connection
with the Merger, Parent shall promptly deposit or cause to be deposited
additional funds in the amount of such insufficiency. The Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any other purpose.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time (but in no
event later than five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time), Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate
or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_ ," it being understood that any
references herein to " _Certificates_ " shall be deemed to include references
to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of Shares) and
whose Shares have been converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1_ (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall include customary
provisions with respect to delivery of an "agents message" with respect
to Shares held in book-entry form) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together
with such letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and
such other customary documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such
instructions (or, if such shares are held in book-entry or other
uncertificated form, upon the entry through a book-entry transfer agent of
the surrender of such shares on a book-entry account statement), the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the
Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on any Merger Consideration payable to holders of Certificates. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of Shares which is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be issued to a transferee
if the Certificate representing such Shares is presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and by evidence that any stock transfer Taxes applicable to such
transfer have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
2.2_, each Certificate shall be deemed at

 



3  any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
upon such surrender the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this
Agreement, without interest thereon.

 

(c) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
Paying Agent will, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to, issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon.

(d) _Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger Consideration paid in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares.

(e) _No Further Dividends_. No dividends or other distributions with respect
to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificates.

 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for twelve (12)
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and
any holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with
this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger
Consideration without any interest thereon.

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation
shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any cash from the Exchange Fund
delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Company
Common Stock immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise
escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Entity shall become, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear
of any claims of interest or any Person previously entitled thereto.

Section 2.3 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed (after giving effect to the items
contemplated by this _Article II_ ) and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect
to such Shares except to receive the Merger Consideration therefor and as
otherwise provided herein or by Law.

 

Section 2.4 _Treatment of Equity Awards; Company Stock Plans; Company Deferred
Compensation Plans_.

 

(a) _Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option,
whether vested or unvested, shall be, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, the Company, the holder of that Company Option
or any other Person, cancelled and converted into the right to receive from
Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as soon as practicable after the
Effective Time but no later than the next regularly scheduled payroll pay date
following the Effective Time, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to
the product of (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option, multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the
per share Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price under such
Company Option; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the amount that could
have been obtained upon the exercise of the Company Option is equal to or
less than zero, then the Company Option will be terminated without payment.

 

(b) _Company Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding
Company Restricted Stock Unit shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries, as
applicable, to pay to each former holder of any such cancelled Company
Restricted Stock Unit (whether or not such Company Restricted Stock Unit was
vested or unvested at the time of cancellation) a cash amount determined by
multiplying (i) the per share Merger Consideration by (ii) the

 



4  number of Shares covered by such Company Restricted Stock Unit. Such cash
payment shall be subject to all applicable Tax withholdings and will be paid
as soon practicable after the Effective Time and in no event later than the
next regularly scheduled payroll pay date following the Effective Time.

(c) _Company Performance Shares_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding
Company Performance Share shall, in accordance with the terms thereof, be
deemed earned at the target level and shall be cancelled and, in exchange
therefor, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries,
as applicable, to pay to each former holder of any such cancelled Company
Performance Share (whether or not such Company Performance Share was vested or
unvested at the time of cancellation) a cash amount determined by multiplying
(i) the per share Merger Consideration by (ii) the target number of Shares
subject to the applicable award of Company Performance Shares. Such cash
payment shall be subject to all applicable Tax withholdings and will be paid
as soon practicable after the Effective Time and in no event later than the
next regularly scheduled payroll pay date following the Effective Time.

 

(d) _Company Deferred Shares_. The Company shall take such action as may be
necessary to provide that (i) the final contributions to and investment under
the Company Deferred Compensation Plans will be made using the deferrals, if
any, for the portion of the calendar quarter in which the Closing occurs
through the Closing Date (which deferrals (and any corresponding matching
contributions) shall be credited to participant accounts prior to the
Effective Time), and (ii) the Company Deferred Compensation Plans will be
terminated as of the Effective Time and no additional contributions will
be made following the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the outstanding
Company Deferred Shares shall be converted into a cash balance amount (the "
_Deferred Share Cash Balance_ "), determined by multiplying the number of
Shares subject to the outstanding Company Deferred Shares immediately prior
to the Effective Time by the per share Merger Consideration, rounded up to the
nearest whole cent, and such cash amounts will be paid as soon as practicable
after the Effective Time and in no event later than the next regularly
scheduled payroll pay date following the Effective Time, subject to all
applicable Tax withholdings, pursuant to Treas. Reg. § 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B).

 

(e) _Assumption of Obligations_. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall assume
all of the obligations of the Company under the Company Stock Plans and
Company Deferred Compensation Plans.

Section 2.5 _Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The Company shall
take such action as may be necessary to (i) establish a New Exercise Date (as
defined under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan) on the last day of the payroll
period ending immediately prior to the Purchase Date (as defined under the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan) with respect to the Offering Period (as defined
in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan) ending March 31, 2016 (the " _Final
Exercise Date_ "); (ii) provide that no further Offering Periods
shall commence under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan on or following the

(i) provide information or data in response to a request therefor to a Person
who has made a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal after the date of this
Agreement (which Acquisition Proposal does not arise out of any material
breach of this _Section 5.2_) if and only if, prior to providing such
information and data, the Company has received from the Person so requesting
such information an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, _provided_
that the Company shall promptly make available to Parent any information and
data concerning the Company or any Company Subsidiary that is provided to any
Person making such Acquisition Proposal that is given such access and that was
not previously made available to Parent or its Representatives; and

 

(ii) engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with any Person who
has made such a written Acquisition Proposal; 

_provided_ that, prior to taking any action described in _Section 5.2(b)(i)_
or _Section 5.2(b)(ii)_ above, the Company Board shall have determined in
good faith, based on the information then available and after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition
Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably
be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal.

(c) Except as expressly provided by _Section 5.2(d)_, at any time after the

fail to publicly recommend a rejection of any tender offer or exchange offer

promptly as reasonably practicable in the case of any Acquisition Proposal
received within three (3) Business Days of the date of the Company
Shareholders Meeting), or (E) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly
propose to adopt, approve or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal (each of the
actions described in this clause (i), a " _Company Adverse Recommendation
Change_ "), _provided_ that for the avoidance of doubt, neither the approval
or delivery of a Determination Notice or public disclosure thereof (to the
extent required by Law or regulations applicable to the Company) shall be
deemed a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; or

(ii) cause or permit the Company or any Company Subsidiary to enter into any
acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive Contract with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal (other than any Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement entered into in accordance with  _Section 5.2(b)_) (an "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ").

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time prior to receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval:

(i) if the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
(which Acquisition Proposal did not arise out of any material breach of this
_Section 5.2_) from any Person after the date of this Agreement (or that was
made prior to the date of this Agreement and remade after the date of this
Agreement) and that has not been withdrawn and that the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal, (x) the Company Board
may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such
Superior Proposal, and (y) the Company may terminate this Agreement to enter
into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal, if and only if:

 



26 (A) the Company shall have provided prior written notice (a " _Determination
Notice_ ") to Parent of at least four (4) Business Days with respect to such
Superior Proposal (such period, the " _Notice Period_ "), to the effect that
the Company Board has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
(which Acquisition Proposal did not arise out of any material breach of this
_Section 5.2_) that the Company Board has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel,
constitutes a Superior Proposal and, absent any revision to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board has determined to effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this  _Section 5.2(d)_, which Determination Notice shall specify
the identity of the Person or group of Persons making the Superior Proposal
and the material terms and conditions thereof, and shall have
contemporaneously provided to Parent a copy of the proposed agreement
governing such Superior Proposal (which shall be updated on a prompt basis);

(B) prior to effecting such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
termination, the Company shall, and shall direct its financial and legal
advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent and the Parent
Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to
make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, so that
such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal;

 

(C) at or following the end of the Notice Period, the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, and taking into account in good faith any revisions to this
Agreement made or irrevocably committed to in writing by Parent, that such
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal if such
revisions were to be given effect;

(D) in the event of any material revisions to an Acquisition Proposal that
could have an impact, influence, or other effect on the Company Boards
decision or discussion with respect to whether such proposal is a Superior
Proposal, the Company shall deliver a new written notice to Parent pursuant to
the foregoing clause (A) and again comply with the requirements of this
_Section 5.2(d)_ with respect to such new written notice (but only on three
(3) additional occasions); _provided_ that the Notice Period shall be deemed
to be a two (2) Business Day period; and

(E) in the case of any action contemplated by clause (y) of this  _Section
5.2(d)_, the Company shall have terminated this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 7.1(e)(ii)_, including the payment of the Company Termination Fee in
accordance with _Section 7.3(a)(i)_; or

 

(ii) other than in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board may
effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening
Event if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with
the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Laws, if and only if:

(A) the Company shall have provided a Determination Notice to Parent for at
least the Notice Period to the effect that the Company Board has determined
to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, which notice shall specify
the Intervening Event, that the Company Board has determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Laws, and the basis for such
determinations in reasonable detail;

 

(B) prior to effecting such Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company
shall, and shall direct its financial and legal advisors to, during the
Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for the Company Board
to effect such Company Adverse Recommendation Change; and

 



27 (C) at or following the end of such Notice Period, the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that failure to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Laws (after
taking into account any revisions to this Agreement made or irrevocably
committed to in writing by Parent during such Notice Period if such revisions
were to be given effect).

 

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.2_ shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company or the Company Board or any committee thereof from complying with its
disclosure obligations under applicable U.S. federal or state Law, including
making any disclosure to the Company Shareholders if the Company Board has
determined in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel
that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that the taking of any action pursuant
to this _Section 5.2(e)_ shall in no way limit or modify the rights of
Parent under _Article VII_.

(f) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the receipt
of the Company Shareholder Approval and the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 7.1_, the Company agrees that it shall promptly
(and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days of the Companys Knowledge of
any such event) notify Parent if (i) any proposals or offers with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal are received by, (ii) in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal, any non-public information is requested from or (iii) in
connection with the submission of an Acquisition Proposal, any discussions or
negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or any Company Representative indicating, in connection
with such notice, the material terms and conditions of any proposals or
offers and the nature of any non-public information so requested and
thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of any
material developments or modifications to the terms of any such proposals or
offers and the status of any such material discussions or negotiations;
_provided_ that, subject to _Section 5.2(d)(i)(A)_, the Company shall not be
required to disclose the name or other identifying information of the Person
or group of Persons making the Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company shall provide to Parent, as soon as
practicable and in any event within two (2) Business Days after receipt or
delivery thereof, copies of all draft agreements (and any other written
material relating to any Acquisition Proposal) sent by or provided to the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Company Representative in connection
with any Acquisition Proposal;  _provided_ that, subject to _Section
5.2(d)(i)(A)_, the Company may redact the name and other identifying
information of the Person or group of Persons making the Acquisition Proposal.
The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any
confidentiality or other agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of
this Agreement which would prohibit the Company from providing any information
to Parent in accordance with this _Section 5.2_.

 

Section 5.3 _Company Shareholders  Meeting; Proxy Statement_.

Business Days following the Proxy Statement Clearance Date), the Company
shall (i) acting through the Company Board, in accordance with applicable Law
and the Company Articles of Incorporation and the Company Bylaws, establish a
record date for and give notice of a meeting of the Company Shareholders
for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement in accordance
with the PBCL (the " _Company Shareholders  Meeting_"), and (ii) in
accordance with applicable Law, cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated
to the Company Shareholders (the date of such dissemination, the " _Proxy
Date_ "). The Company shall duly call, convene and hold the Company
Shareholders Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
Proxy Date;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may postpone, recess
or adjourn the Company Shareholders Meeting (A) with the consent of Parent,
(B) for the absence of a quorum, (C) to solicit additional proxies for
the purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval or (D) to allow
reasonable additional time for the filing and distribution of any supplemental
or amended disclosure which the Company Board has determined in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) is necessary under
applicable Laws and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated to and reviewed by the Company Shareholders prior to the Company
Shareholders Meeting; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that any such postponement
or adjournment by the Company shall be for at least

 



28  three (3) Business Days (but in any event no later than the End Date and no
longer than ten (10) Business Days unless otherwise agreed to in writing by
Parent). Unless the Company Board shall have effected a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to (i)
solicit from the Company Shareholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and approval of the Merger in accordance with the PBCL and (ii)
secure the vote or consent of the holders of Company Common Stock required by
applicable Law to obtain such approval. The Company shall keep Parent and
Merger Sub updated with respect to proxy solicitation results as reasonably
requested by Parent or Merger Sub.

(b) In connection with the Company Shareholders Meeting, as soon as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, but in no event
later than twenty (20) days following the date hereof, prepare and file with
the SEC a proxy statement, letter to shareholders, notice of meeting and form
of proxy accompanying the proxy statement that will be provided to the
Company Shareholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies for use at
the Company Shareholders Meeting, and any schedules required to be filed with
the SEC in connection therewith (collectively, as amended or supplemented,
the " _Proxy Statement_ "). The Company, Parent and Merger Sub, as the case
may be, shall furnish all information concerning the Company or Parent and
Merger Sub as the other Party or Parties hereto, as the case may be, may
reasonably request in connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC
of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and their
counsel reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement
and all other materials used in connection with the Company Shareholders
Meeting that (i) constitute "proxy materials" or "solicitation materials" as
those terms are used in Rules 14a-1 through 14a-17 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) are otherwise used for the "solicitation" of "proxies" as
those terms are defined in Rule 14a-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act, in
each case prior to the filing thereof with the SEC or the dissemination
thereof to Company Shareholders (which comments shall be reasonably considered
by the Company). The Company shall advise Parent, promptly after it receives
notice thereof, of any request by the SEC or its staff for an amendment or
revisions to the Proxy Statement, or comments thereon and responses thereto,
or requests by the SEC or its staff for additional information in connection
therewith. The Company agrees to consult with Parent prior to responding to
SEC comments with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve, and each Party agrees to consult and
cooperate with the other Party in resolving, all SEC comments with respect to
the Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof and to
cause the Proxy Statement in definitive form to be cleared by the SEC and
mailed to the Company Shareholders as promptly as practicable following filing
with the SEC. If at any time prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting, any
information relating to the Company or Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their
respective directors, officers or Affiliates, should be discovered by the
Company or Parent or Merger Sub which should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other Party or Parties, as the case may
be, and an appropriate amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement
describing such information shall be promptly prepared and filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the Company
Shareholders. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to comply as to form
and substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Exchange Act and the NYSE.

(c) Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to  _Section 7.1_
and to the extent that the Company Board Recommendation has not been withheld,
withdrawn, qualified or modified in accordance with _Section 5.2_, the
Company shall include in the Proxy Statement the Company
Board Recommendation.

covered by, the Confidentiality Agreement or a similar agreement with the
Company with respect to such information or (B) provide access to or furnish
any information if doing so would violate any applicable Law or Contract, or
where such access to information would involve the waiver or loss of an
attorney-client or work product privilege so long as the Company has
reasonably cooperated with Parent to permit such inspection of, or to
disclose such, information on a basis that does not compromise or waive such
privilege with respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that such access and
information shall be disclosed or granted, as applicable, to external counsel
for Parent to the extent reasonably required for the purpose of complying with
applicable Antitrust Laws subject to prior execution of a common interest or
joint defense agreement in customary form.

reasonably be expected to hinder or delay the obtaining of clearance or any

the other Partys reasonable comments in connection with any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments and proposals made or
submitted to any Governmental Entity regarding the Merger or any of the other

the Company shall have the right to determine whether to enter into any
agreement with any applicable Governmental Entity extending additional time
for the review of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the
HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law.

(d) Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts and
cooperate with each other to ensure the satisfaction of the conditions in
_Section 6.1(b)_, _Section 6.1(c)_ and _Section 6.1(d)_ as promptly as
practicable, and in the event that any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental
Entity or private party challenging the Merger or any other transaction

counsels expenses), and if Parent defers its efforts, Parents sole
obligation pursuant to this _Section 5.5(d)_ with respect to any Antitrust
Proceeding or Antitrust Order will be to reasonably cooperate with the Company
if the Company opts to lead such efforts and Parent shall have no obligation
with respect to any Antitrust Proceeding or Antitrust Order if the Company
opts not to lead such efforts) to contest, resist, prevent, oppose or remove
any such Antitrust Proceeding, including by extending additional time for the
review of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act
or any other Antitrust Law, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any Order that prevents, restrains, restricts or otherwise
prohibits consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated

Material Adverse Effect. Furthermore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, Parent shall not be required to take any action described
in subsection _(i)_ above that is not related to the Relevant Business or in
subsection _(ii)_ above, including to offer or agree to any divestiture, that
is not limited in scope to the Relevant Business.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this _Section 5.5_ shall limit a Partys right to terminate this

announcements (including conference calls with investors and analysts) with
respect to the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement.
No Party shall issue any such press release or make any such
public announcements prior to such consultation, except to the extent the
disclosing Party determines, based on advice of outside legal counsel, that it
is required to do so by applicable Law or any listing agreement with a
securities exchange, in which case such Party shall use reasonable best
efforts to consult with the other Party before issuing or making any such
press release or public announcement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
connection with any action by the Company or the Company Board permitted by
_Section 5.2_, no Party shall be required to consult with any other Party
prior to issuing any press release or otherwise making public announcements
with respect to such actions, the reasons for such actions or any additional

shall be deemed to expand or modify the Companys rights and obligations under
_Section 5.2_.

 

Section 5.7 _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall promptly advise Parent
of any Action commenced after the date hereof against the Company or any of
its directors (in their capacity as such) by any Company Shareholders (on
their own behalf or on behalf of the Company) relating to this Agreement or

reasonably informed regarding any such Action. The Company shall give Parent
the opportunity to consult with the Company regarding the defense or
settlement of any such Action and shall consider Parents views with respect

(b) Without limiting paragraph (a) of this _Section 5.8_, Parent shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, honor, in accordance with its terms, each
Company Plan and all obligations thereunder including any rights or benefits
arising as a result of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement
(either alone or in combination with any other event, including
termination of employment), and Parent hereby agrees and acknowledges that
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
constitutes a "change of control" or a "change in control" or similar term, as
the case may be, for all purposes under each Company Plan.

(c) With respect to any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3)
of ERISA maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, excluding both any
retiree healthcare plans or programs maintained by Parent or

 



32  any of its Subsidiaries and any equity compensation arrangements maintained
by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, " _Parent Benefit Plans_
") in which any Continuing Employees will participate effective as of the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
recognize all service of the Continuing Employees with the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, as the case may be as if such service were with Parent, for
vesting and eligibility purposes (but not for benefit accrual purposes, except
for vacation, if applicable) in any Parent Benefit Plan in which such
Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time;
_provided_ that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that (i)
such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or (ii) such
service was not recognized under the corresponding Company Plan.

 

(d) For purposes of determining the number of vacation days and other paid
time off to which each Continuing Employee is entitled during the calendar
year in which the Effective Time occurs, Parent will assume and honor all
vacation and other paid time off days accrued or earned but not yet taken by
such Continuing Employee as of the Effective Time.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.8_ to the contrary but
consistent with this _Section 5.8_, nothing contained herein, whether
express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of
any employee benefit plan of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or shall limit the right of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any employee benefit plan
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries
or Affiliates following the Effective Time.

(f) The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this  _Section 5.8_ are included for the sole benefit of the Parties hereto,
and that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall create
any third-party beneficiary or other rights (i) in any other Person, including
any employees or former employees of the Company or any Affiliate of the
Company, any Continuing Employee, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof or
(ii) to continued employment with Parent or any of its Affiliates. With
respect to matters described in this _Section 5.8_, the Company will not
send any written notices or other written communication materials to Company
employees without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), provided that nothing in
this _Section 5.8(f)_ shall limit the Companys right to accurately
communicate the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including this
_Section 5.8_) to Company employees.

Section 5.9 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights of indemnification,
advancement of expenses, exculpation and limitation of liabilities existing

request of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a director, officer,
trustee, partner, fiduciary, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or
enterprise (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in the Company Articles
of Incorporation and the Company Bylaws or similar organizational documents
of any Company Subsidiary or under any indemnification, employment or other
similar agreements between any Indemnified Party and the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement
with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, shall survive
the Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
respective terms. From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be jointly and severally liable to pay and perform in a
timely manner such obligations. For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment or
change to the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
or any similar organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary following
the Effective Time shall in any way limit or modify Parents and Merger Subs
obligations under this _Section 5.9(a)_.

 

(b) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity

 



33  of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, or if Parent
dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and in each such case, Parent
shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this
_Section 5.9_.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for a non-cancellable extension (or
"tail") of the directors and officers liability insurance coverage of the
Companys existing directors and officers insurance policies and the
Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, " _D
andO Insurance_"), in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of
six (6) years from and after the Effective Time (such period, the " _Tail
Period_ ") with respect to any claim related to any period or time at or prior
to the Effective Time with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the
Companys existing policies and covering each Person currently covered by the
Companys existing policies; _provided_ that (i) such "tail" insurance
policies shall not require the payment of an aggregate annual premiums in
excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate annual premium most
recently paid by the Company prior to the date hereof (the " _Maximum Amount_
") to maintain the DandO Insurance (and if the annual premium of such insurance
coverage exceeds such amount, the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall
be obligated to (and as of the Effective Time Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to) obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding such amount) and (ii) prior to the Closing, the Company
shall not enter into any Contract for a "tail" policy without the prior
written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain such "tail" policies in full force and effect through
such six (6) year period. If the Company or the Surviving Corporation for any
reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective
Time, then from the Effective Time through the end of the Tail Period, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect the
Companys current DandO Insurance covering each Person currently covered by the
Companys DandO Insurance for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time with respect to any matter claimed against such Person by reason of him
or her serving in the applicable capacity on terms with respect to such
coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of such DandO Insurance
policies in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that in no
event shall the aggregate costs of such DandO Insurance policies exceed the
Maximum Amount, it being understood that Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage during the Tail
Period as may be obtained for the Maximum Amount; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that Parent or the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor DandO Insurance
policies of any nationally recognized reputable insurance company with a same
or better credit rating than the Companys current insurance carrier with
respect to DandO Insurance.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ shall (i) survive the consummation
of the Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their respective heirs and
Representatives and (iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may
have by Contract or otherwise. From and after the Effective Time, the
provisions of this _Section 5.9_ may not be amended in any manner adverse to
any Indemnified Party without his or her consent.

Section 5.10 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted under
applicable Laws) to cause any dispositions of Shares (including derivative

respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

 

Section 5.11 _Stock Exchange De-listing_. Prior to the Closing Date, the

(including the rules and regulations of the NYSE) to cause the delisting of
the Company Common Stock from the NYSE and the deregistration of the

 



34  Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time, and in any event no more than ten (10) days thereafter.

 

Section 5.12 _Anti-Takeover Statutes_. So long as (and only so long as) the
representations and warranties made by Parent and Merger Sub in _Section
4.8_ are true and correct in all respects and continue to be true and correct
in all respects at all times prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and
shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, take all actions necessary so that no Anti-Takeover
Statute becomes applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
If any Anti-Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, then each Party shall take such actions as
are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to render such Anti-Takeover Statute
inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that
the Company shall not be required to take any such actions if the
representations and warranties made by Parent and Merger Sub in  _Section
4.8_ are not true and correct in all respects as of the date hereof and at all
times prior to the Closing. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall not,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and "affiliates" and "associates"
(as defined in Section 2552 of the PBCL) to not, become the "beneficial owner"
(as defined in Section 2552 of the PBCL), directly or indirectly, of any
Shares or other Equity Interests in the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
any options, warrants or other rights to acquire Company Common Stock or other

other economic interest through derivative securities or otherwise in
the Company or any Company Subsidiary) prior to the Effective Time.

Section 5.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Unless prohibited by
applicable Law, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent
shall give prompt notice to the Company, upon receiving Knowledge of any
material change, effect, development or circumstance that would reasonably be
expected to give rise to a failure of a condition precedent in _Section 6.2_
(in the case of the Company) and _Section 6.3_ (in the case of Parent);
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parties or
the conditions to the obligations of the Parties hereunder and any failure to
make such notification (in and of itself) shall not be taken into account in
determining whether the conditions set forth in _Section 6.2_ (in the case
of the Company) and _Section 6.3_ (in the case of Parent) have been satisfied
or give rise to any right of termination to any party hereto under _Article
VII_.

 

Section 5.14 _Intercompany Loan Restructuring_.

 

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this _Section 5.14_, the Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, such actions as
reasonably requested in writing by Parent to effect the reorganization or
restructuring of intercompany loans among the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (all matters contemplated by this _Section 5.14(a)_ together
with those matters set forth on _Section 5.14(a)_ of the of the Company
Disclosure Letter, the " _Loan Restructuring_ ").

 

(b) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the Company and its
Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives shall not have any
responsibility for (other than the obligation to comply with the terms of
_Section 5.14(a)_), or incur any liability to any Person in connection with,
any Loan Restructuring and that Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a joint
and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Affiliates
and its and their respective Representatives (the " _Loan Restructuring
Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses (including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation), interest, awards, judgments, penalties, taxes or changes in
tax attributes suffered or incurred, directly or indirectly, by the Loan
Restructuring Indemnitees in connection with the Loan Restructuring. Parent
shall promptly reimburse the Company for any out-of-pocket expenses and costs
(including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by any Loan Restructuring
Indemnitee in connection with any Loan Restructuring. This _Section 5.14(b)_

of the Companys representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any
instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective
Time. None of the covenants or agreements of the Parties in this Agreement

contained in this _Article IX_ , the agreements of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company in _Article II_ ( _Conversion of Securities; Exchange of Certificates_
), _Section 5.9_ ( _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_ ) and
_Section 5.14(b)_ (Loan Restructuring Indemnitees), and (b) those other
covenants and agreements contained herein that by their terms apply, or that
are to be performed in whole or in part, after the Effective Time, which
shall survive the consummation of the Merger until fully performed. The
Confidentiality Agreement will (i) survive termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms and (ii) terminate as of the Effective Time.

 

Section 9.2 _Amendment_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by the Parties by action taken by or on behalf of
their respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time,

_however_ , that after the Company Shareholder Approval (a) there shall be no
amendment that decreases the Merger Consideration or to _Section 5.9_, and

This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed
by Parent and the Company.

approval by such Company Shareholders may be made without such Company
Shareholder approval. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed by such Party. The failure or delay of any Party to assert any of its
rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
those rights, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right under

such Person to each of the other Parties in accordance with this _Section
9.4_.

Section 9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties
(whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of the other Parties. No assignment by any Party shall relieve such Party of
any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement
will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

Section 9.6 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement,
or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so
as reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties hereto. The Parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

Section 9.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits,
Parent Disclosure Letter, Company Disclosure Letter and the other documents
delivered pursuant hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement of the Parties and supersede all prior agreements

Section 9.8 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) This Agreement and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract,
tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related
to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement
or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), shall be construed,
performed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania without giving effect to its principles or rules of conflict of
laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or permit the
application of the Laws of another jurisdiction; _provided_ , _however_ ,
without limiting the general discretion of a court contemplated by _Section
9.8(b)_ below to consider the Laws of the State of Delaware as it would in
the ordinary course, with respect to the interpretation of Company Material
Adverse Effect (including with respect to _Section 6.2_) and _Section 7.4_
of this Agreement, the Laws of the State of Delaware shall apply without
giving effect to its principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent
such principles or rules would require or permit the application of the Laws
of another jurisdiction.

 

(b) Any Action between the Parties, arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought solely and
exclusively in any state court located in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, or
in any direct appellate court therefrom; _provided_ that if (and only after)
such courts determine that they lack subject matter jurisdiction over
any such Action, such Action shall be brought solely and exclusively in the
Federal courts of the United States located in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, or in any direct appellate court therefrom. Each of the Parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment (subject to any appeals therefrom) in any
such Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each Party hereby
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in respect
of any Action between the Parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively
do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue
of any Action between the Parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby in any such court in accordance with
the provisions of this _Section 9.8_. Each of the Parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Action in any such court. Each
of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably and

 



51  unconditionally consents to service of process in the manner provided for
notices in _Section 9.4_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of
any Party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by
Law.

Section 9.9 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH
PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.9_.

 

Section 9.10 _Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby,
or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Subject to 
_Section 7.3(c)_, the Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if
