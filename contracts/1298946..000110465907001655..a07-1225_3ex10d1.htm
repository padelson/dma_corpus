Allocation of Purchase Price. Seller and Buyer agree that the Purchase Price
will be allocated to the assets acquired by Purchaser for all purposes as set

cure period under Section 8.1 or 8.2, and, in connection with any such
termination made in accordance with this Section 3, the Seller and Buyer
shall be released from further obligation or liability hereunder (except for
those obligations and liabilities which, pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, survive such termination), and the Escrow Deposit shall be
disposed of in accordance with Section 8. The "Closing" (as hereinafter
defined) shall constitute approval by each party of all matters to which such
party has a right of approval and a waiver of all conditions precedent; and,
in the case of Buyer, a waiver of any breaches of SellerÂ’s representations
and warranties contained herein known to Buyer as set forth in Section
9.2.3(b); except that there shall be no waiver for a breach of the SellerÂ’s
representations and warranties contained herein not known to Buyer as set

Title Matters.

  

### 1.1.2 _Title Report/Survey_. Buyer has received SellerÂ’s existing title
policies dated June 8, 2004 (the " **Existing Policies** ") issued by
Fidelity National Title Insurance Company as Policy Nos. 5312-996058 and
5312-996059 and has ordered title insurance commitments for the Land dated
on or after the date hereof (the " **Commitment** ") from First American
Title Insurance Company or such other national title insurance company as
Buyer selects (which company, in its capacity as title insurer hereunder, is
herein called the " **Title Company** "). In addition, Seller has delivered
and Buyer has received the surveys of the Land in SellerÂ’s possession (the "
**Surveys** "). Seller shall cooperate reasonably with Buyer to facilitate
BuyerÂ’s obtaining the Commitment and any updates to the Surveys or new
surveys. If Buyer shall fail to deliver the Termination Notice as hereinafter
defined on or before the end of the Due Diligence Period (as hereinafter
defined), Buyer shall be deemed to have approved the exceptions to title
shown on the Commitments and the matters disclosed on the Surveys (other than
Existing Loan Documents or other Seller Mortgage Liens) and such other title
or survey matters as are disclosed to Buyer during the Due Diligence Period.

  

### 1.1.3 _Additional Post Due Diligence Title Matters_. Approval by Buyer of
any, in BuyerÂ’s reasonable opinion, material additional exceptions to title
or survey matters first arising after the end of the Due Diligence Period ("
**Additional Title Matters** ") shall

     

   



  

### be a condition precedent to BuyerÂ’s obligations to purchase the Property
(Buyer hereby agreeing that its approval of Additional Title Matters shall
not be unreasonably withheld). Unless Buyer gives written notice (" **Title
Disapproval Notice** ") that it disapproves any Additional Title Matters,
stating the Additional Title Matters so disapproved, before the sooner to
occur of the Closing or ten (10) days after receipt of written notice of such
Additional Title Matters, Buyer shall be deemed to have approved such
Additional Title Matters. Seller shall have up to a thirty (30) day period
after its receipt of any Title Disapproval Notice within which to remove the
disapproved Additional Title Matters set forth therein from title or obtain
from Title Company a commitment to issue an endorsement
affirmatively insuring against such items in a form reasonably acceptable to
Buyer at no cost or expense to Buyer (Seller having the right but not the
obligation to do so), and the Closing Date shall be extended, at SellerÂ’s
option, to allow for such thirty (30) day period. In the event Seller
determines at any time that it is unable or unwilling to remove any one or
more of such disapproved Additional Title Matters, Seller may give written
notice to Buyer to such effect; in such event, Buyer may, at its option,
terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Seller (whereupon the Escrow
Deposit shall be returned to Buyer) but only if given prior to the sooner to
occur of the Closing or ten (10) days after Buyer receives SellerÂ’s notice.
If Buyer fails to give such termination notice by such date, Buyer shall be
deemed to have waived its objection to, and approved, the matters set forth
in SellerÂ’s notice.

  

### 1.1.4 _Seller Mortgage Liens_. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions
of this _Section 3.1.3_ , Seller shall be obligated to take such actions as
may be required by the Title Company so that the Title Company is willing to
issue title insurance to Buyer without exception for any Existing Loan
Documents or other Seller Mortgage Liens. Such actions shall include
obtaining a pay-off letter and leaving a portion of the Purchase Price in
escrow to satisfy the Seller Mortgage Liens; provided, however, that SellerÂ’s
obligations under this _Section 3.1.3_ with respect to mechanics liens,
attachments, or the like, not voluntarily imposed by or otherwise in the
control of Seller shall be limited to the expenditure or escrow of not more
than $250,000.00 in the aggregate.

  

### 1.1.5 _Exceptions to Title_. Buyer shall be obligated to accept title to
the Property, subject to the Permitted Exceptions. Conclusive evidence of the
availability of such title shall be the willingness of Title Company to issue
to Buyer on the Closing Date an ownerÂ’s title insurance policy in the
standard form issued in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the " **Owner Â’s
Policy**"), in the face amount of the Purchase Price, which policy shall
show (i) title to the Land vested of record in BuyerÂ’s designee, and (ii)
the Permitted Exceptions to be the only exceptions to title.

  

### 1.1.6 _Endorsements to Owner Â’s Policies_. It is understood that Buyer
may request a number of endorsements to the OwnerÂ’s Policies. Buyer shall
satisfy itself during the Due Diligence Period that the Title Company will
issue such additional endorsements in connection with the OwnerÂ’s Policies at
Closing. However, the issuance of such endorsements shall not be a condition
to Closing and in no event shall Seller be obligated to provide any indemnity
or other document in order to issue such endorsements except as otherwise
provided in and subject to _Section 4.2.1(y)_.

  

Due Diligence Reviews. Except for title and survey matters (which shall be
governed by the provisions of Section 3.1 above), and subject to the
provisions hereinafter set

     

   



  

forth, Buyer shall have until 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time) on January
18, 2007, (the period beginning on the date hereof and ending on such date
and time being herein called the " **Due Diligence Period** ") within which
to perform and complete all of BuyerÂ’s due diligence examinations, reviews
and inspections of all matters pertaining to the purchase of the Property,
including all permits, licenses, management agreements, leases, service
contracts, and all physical, environmental and compliance matters
(including, without limitation, compliance with any off-site mitigation
requirements) and conditions respecting the Property. Seller shall provide
Buyer with reasonable access to the Property (subject to this Section 3.2)
upon reasonable advance notice and shall also make available to Buyer (to the
extent in SellerÂ’s possession or control) and shall instruct Manager to make
available to Buyer such leases, service contracts and other information
relating to the operation of the Property as Buyer shall reasonably request,
all upon reasonable advance notice. By not later than January 10, 2007,
Seller shall prepare and submit to Purchaser Exhibits setting forth a list of
all Service Agreements and Equipment Leases in effect as well as copies of
all such listed Service Agreements and Equipment Leases, whereupon the
parties shall execute an amendment to the Agreement providing for the
attachment of such Exhibits as Exhibits hereto. In no event, however, shall
Seller be obligated to make available any attorney-client work product or
privileged documents or documents in breach of confidentiality agreements or
any internal memoranda, correspondence, analyses, documents or reports
prepared by or for Seller for its internal use in connection with this
Agreement, the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, the acquisition of
the Property by Seller (other than any property condition, compliance,
engineering, third party inspection or environmental reports pertaining to
the Property), and appraisals or other valuations of the Property in the
possession or control of Seller. Buyer shall promptly commence, and shall
diligently and in good faith pursue, its due diligence review hereunder.
Seller acknowledges and agrees that Buyer shall have the continued right to
access the Property in accordance with this Section 3.2 at all times prior to
Closing, it being understood that Buyer shall only have the right to
terminate this Agreement set forth in Section 3.2.2 below on or before the
expiration of the Due Diligence Period.

  

### 1.1.7 _Review Standards_. Buyer shall at all times conduct its review,
inspections and examinations in a manner so as to not cause liability,
damage, lien, loss, cost or expense to Seller or the Property and so as to
not unreasonably interfere with or disturb Manager, any guest or any tenant
at the Property, and Buyer will indemnify, defend, and hold Seller and the
Property harmless from and against any such liability, damage, lien, loss,
cost or expense (the foregoing obligation surviving any termination of this
Agreement). Prior to entry upon the Property, Buyer shall provide Seller with
copies of certificates of insurance evidencing comprehensive
general liability insurance policies (naming Seller as an additional insured)
which shall be maintained by Buyer in connection with its investigations upon
the Property prior to the date of entry upon the Property, with limits,
coverages and insurers under such policies reasonably satisfactory to Seller
which insurance policies must have limits for bodily injury and death of not
less than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) for any one occurrence and not
less than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) for property damage liability for
any one occurrence. Without limitation on the foregoing, in no event shall
Buyer: (a) make any intrusive physical testing (environmental, structural or
otherwise) at the Property (such as soil borings, water samplings or the
like) without SellerÂ’s express written consent which may be withheld in
SellerÂ’s sole and absolute discretion (and Buyer shall in all events promptly
return the Property to their prior condition and repair thereafter) and which
may be further conditioned upon, among other things, SellerÂ’s reasonable
approval of the following:  (i) the insurance coverage of the contractor who

     

   



  

### will be conducting such testing; and (ii) the scope and nature of such
testing to be performed by such contractor; (b) contact the Manager or any of
the ManagerÂ’s employees without SellerÂ’s express written consent and approval
of the text, scope, context and/or agenda for any proposed communication
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed in the case of any
proposed contact with ManagerÂ’s senior executives); (c) contact
any governmental authority having jurisdiction over the Property or any
tenant of the Property without SellerÂ’s express written consent and approval
of the text, scope, context and/or agenda for any proposed communication
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed in the case of any
proposed contact with senior officials in any particular authority);
provided, that Buyer or BuyerÂ’s attorneys may with SellerÂ’s prior consent and
approval (not to be unreasonably withheld) of the text, scope, context and/or
agenda for any proposed communication, perform a zoning and permit review or
retain a third party firm engaged in the business of zoning and permit
reviews to perform such a review with respect to determining SellerÂ’s and the
PropertyÂ’s compliance with applicable zoning and building code requirements,
and may contact governmental authorities to cause the transfer or issuance of
all applicable licenses and permits (including liquor licenses) necessary for
the continued normal operation of the Property following the Closing. Seller
shall deliver to Buyer promptly after the date hereof copies of any zoning or
permitting opinions which Seller has delivered to the Existing Indebtedness
Lenders. Seller shall have the right, at its option, to cause a
representative of Seller to be present at all inspections, interviews,
reviews and examinations conducted hereunder, including, without limitation,
any communications with Manager, any employees or any governmental
authorities. Seller agrees that its representative(s) shall be reasonably
available to Buyer on reasonable advance notice for purposes of the
immediately preceding sentence (including, without limitation, making its
representatives reasonably available to discuss issues raised by Buyer with
respect to the entitlement of the Land). To the extent in SellerÂ’s possession
(or in its attorneysÂ’ possession), Seller shall cause the materials listed on
_Schedule 3.2.1_ attached hereto to be delivered to Buyer on or before the
date set forth therefor on _Schedule 3.2.1_. Seller will cooperate with Buyer
at BuyerÂ’s request by using reasonable efforts to arrange a meeting for Buyer
during the Due Diligence Period with a senior official having jurisdiction of
the PILOT Agreement and real estate taxation matters in order that Buyer may
attempt to ascertain the effect consummation of the transaction will have on
the PILOT Agreement and on real estate taxes. At SellerÂ’s written request, at
no expense to and without representation, warranty by or liability to Buyer,
and provided Buyer has the right to do so, Buyer shall promptly deliver to
Seller true and complete copies of any written reports relating to the
Property prepared for or on behalf of Buyer by any third party. In the event
of any termination of this Agreement, Buyer shall return all documents and
other materials furnished by Seller. Prior to Closing and subject to _Section
9.14_ hereof, Buyer shall keep all non-public information or data received or
discovered in connection with any of BuyerÂ’s inspections, reviews or
examinations strictly confidential, except for disclosures required to comply
with applicable law and disclosures to representatives, investors, lenders,
counsel and agents, provided such disclosures are on an as needed basis for
BuyerÂ’s acquisition of the Property, and such persons are instructed to keep
the information strictly confidential. The provisions of this _Section 3.2.1_
shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

     

   



  

### 1.1.8 _Termination Rights_.

  

#### (a) If, on or before the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, Buyer
shall determine in its sole discretion that it no longer intends to acquire
the Property, then Buyer shall promptly (but in all events prior to the
expiration of the Due Diligence Period) notify Seller of such determination
in writing (such notice being herein called the " **Termination Notice**
"), whereupon this Agreement, and the obligations of the parties hereunder,
shall terminate (and no party hereto shall have any further obligation in
connection herewith except under those provisions that expressly survive a
termination of this Agreement). In such event, subject to _Section 2.1.1(a)_
above, the Escrow Deposit shall be released to Buyer by Escrow Holder. In the
event that Buyer shall fail to have delivered the Termination Notice to
Seller before the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, Buyer shall have no
further right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 3.2.2(a)_
, and the Escrow Deposit shall not be refundable to Buyer for any reason
whatsoever, except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement. If Buyer obtains
a written recommendation from a licensed engineer that it conduct any
invasive testing or sampling, then so long as Buyer requests SellerÂ’s consent
to such testing by written notice to Seller not later than January 10, 2007
(accompanied by a copy of the engineerÂ’s recommendation), Seller shall
respond on or before January 12, 2007. If Seller fails to so respond, such
failure shall be deemed a refusal of BuyerÂ’s request.

  

#### (b) Buyer may elect to terminate the Agreement by written notice
(including, without limitation, via email) to Seller on or before 12:00 pm
(Eastern Standard Time) on January 19, 2007 (the "Feasibility Date") if Buyer
has not obtained and executed a firm commitment to underwrite a public
offering of equity in an amount not less than One Hundred Sixty Five Million
Dollars ($165,000,000.00). If Buyer terminates the Agreement in accordance
with the immediately preceding sentence, Three Million Dollars
($3,000,000.00) of the Escrow Deposit shall be released and paid to Seller as
SellerÂ’s property and the remainder of the Escrow Deposit shall be released
and paid to Buyer and this Agreement shall be void, excepting those
provisions which expressly survive termination.

  

Performance by Seller. The accuracy of SellerÂ’s representations and
warranties in all material respects and the performance and observance, in
all material respects, by Seller of all covenants and agreements of this
Agreement to be performed or observed by Seller prior to or on the Closing
Date shall be a condition precedent to BuyerÂ’s obligation to acquire the
Property. Without limitation on the foregoing, in the event that the Seller
Closing Certificate shall disclose any material inaccuracies or material
adverse changes in the representations and warranties of Seller which are not
otherwise permitted or contemplated by the terms of this Agreement or known
to Buyer during the Due Diligence Period, then Buyer shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement. For purposes only of determining whether or not a
failure of condition has occurred under this Section 3.3, or whether a
materiality threshold under Section 8.1 has been reached, a breach,
inaccuracy, or adverse change shall not be considered "material" unless the
loss, cost or damage arising on account thereof is reasonably expected to be
$250,000 or more.

  

Performance by Buyer. The accuracy of BuyerÂ’s representations and warranties
in all material respects and the performance and observance, in all material
respects, by Buyer of all covenants and agreements of this Agreement to be
performed or observed by it prior to or on the Closing Date shall be a
condition precedent to SellerÂ’s obligation to sell the Property.

     

   



  

Without limitation on the foregoing, in the event that the Buyer Closing
Certificate shall disclose any material inaccuracies or material adverse
changes in the representations and warranties of Buyer contained in Section
6.2 which are not permitted or contemplated by the terms of this Agreement,
then Seller shall have the right to terminate this Agreement.

  

Management Agreement. Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree that the
Management Agreement will be assigned by Seller to Buyer (or BuyerÂ’s
designee) and that Buyer (or BuyerÂ’s designee) will assume the obligations of
Seller under the Management Agreement as of the Closing Date pursuant to the
Assignment and Assumption of Management Agreement. Seller shall cause Manager
to recognize that all amounts held by Manager in the Fund (as defined in the
Management Agreement) are held in accordance with the terms of the Management
Agreement for the benefit of Buyer from and after Closing. Seller hereby
represents and warrants to Buyer that, to its knowledge, the Manager is not
currently holding any amounts in the Fund, although the Management Agreement
may require the same to have been paid.

  

Liquor Licenses. Buyer acknowledges that there may be various liquor licenses
associated with the operation of the Hotel. As soon as is reasonably
practicable after the Feasibility Date, Buyer shall file an application with
the required state and local agencies for the issuance of such licenses (the
" **Required Liquor Licenses** ") as are necessary for the continued service
of alcoholic beverages at the Property. Buyer shall diligently pursue the
obtaining of the Required Liquor Licenses at BuyerÂ’s sole cost and
expense. Seller shall cooperate and instruct Manager to cooperate reasonably
with Buyer in its efforts to obtain the Required Liquor Licenses. The
issuance of the Required Liquor Licenses shall not be a condition to BuyerÂ’s
obligations to close the sale contemplated hereby;  provided, however, that
if such Required Liquor Licenses have not issued by Closing, Seller and Buyer
shall enter into an Interim Beverage Services Agreement in the form of
Exhibit G attached hereto for use of SellerÂ’s liquor licenses until the
earlier of the 180th day after Closing or the date on which the Required
Liquor Licenses are issued. In such event, Buyer shall maintain
liquor liability insurance with coverage in the amount of at least Twenty-
Five Million and No/100 Dollars ($25,000,000.00) naming Seller as additional
insured, and further agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Seller harmless
from and against any liability, cost or expense arising out of SellerÂ’s
cooperation with Buyer during such interim period. Seller shall provide Buyer
with a list of and copies of the Liquor Licenses and all other material
permits and approvals related to the Property by not later than January 10,
2007.

  

Audit. Buyer shall have the right to obtain from a third-party certified
public accountant (at BuyerÂ’s sole cost and expense) audits with respect to
the Property providing all disclosures required by generally accepted
accounting principles and Securities and Exchange Commission regulations,
specifically in accordance with Section 3.05 of Regulation S-X and all
related rules and regulations thereof. Seller, at no cost or expense to
Seller, shall, and shall use reasonable efforts to cause Manager and the
predecessor owner(s) and manager(s) of the Property to, cooperate in a
commercially reasonable manner in connection with the performance of such
audits and to provide information reasonably requested by such accountants.
In connection with such audits, Seller, at no cost or expense to Seller,
shall and shall use reasonable efforts to cause Manager and the
predecessor owner(s) and manager(s) to provide the accountants performing
such audits with representation letters conforming to American Institute

     

   



  

of Certified Public Accountants professional standards. Buyer completing the
preparation of any such audited financial statements shall not be a condition
to Closing and the failure to obtain same will not permit Buyer to terminate
this Agreement.

  

Ground Lessor Estoppels. It shall be condition to BuyersÂ’ obligation to close
that Seller shall have obtained Ground LessorÂ’s consent to the transaction
contemplated hereunder and shall have obtained and delivered to Buyer (i) an

(i) that the Ground Lessor has complied with all transportation mitigation
required in connection with the BCEC Project and/or that there are no
outstanding obligations for such mitigation which would be imposed upon the

Seller shall have obtained and delivered to Buyer an amendment and

respects in substance as set forth on _Exhibit U_ duly executed by the City

### 1.1.13 Seller shall have obtained and delivered to Buyer fully executed
originals of such amendments to the Notices of Lease of record with respect
to the Retail Ground Lease and the Hotel Ground Lease and to the May 27, 2004
Reciprocal Easement Agreement as are made necessary by virtue of the Hotel
Ground Lease Amendment and the Retail Ground Lease Amendment; and

  

### 1.1.14 Seller shall have obtained and delivered to Buyer a form of
financeable Hotel Sublease (as defined in the Retail Ground Lease Amendment)
to accommodate hotel uses on the ground floor of the Retail Parcel
containing the following terms:

  

#### (a) _Rent_. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.1(g), Section
4.5 and Section 8.3(f) of the Retail Lease, the rent payable by Hotel Tenant
to Retail Tenant for all Hotel Sublease Areas (as defined in the Retail
Ground Lease Amendment) shall be a nominal rent, and all Hotel Subleased
Areas shall be excluded from the Leased Square Footage (as defined in the
Retail Ground Lease) of the Premises for the purpose of calculating Minimum
Rent (as defined in the Retail Ground Lease) pursuant to Section 4.2 of the
Retail Lease;

  

#### (b) _Term_. The term of the Hotel Sublease shall expire on the date that
is ten (10) years from the effective date of Retail Ground Lease Amendment;
_provided_ , _that_ , the subtenant under the Hotel Sublease shall have the
right to terminate the Hotel Sublease at any time upon ninety (90) days prior
written notice.

  

#### (c) _Use_. The use of the premises demised under the Hotel Sublease
shall be limited to meeting and conference room facilities, pre-function
space, banquet preparation and service, audio-visual display space
(regardless of the technology used), exhibition space, hallways, restrooms
and any other activities related to the foregoing or otherwise related to
providing services to groups of individuals staying at the Hotel or otherwise
paying to use the HotelÂ’s facilities.

  

The form and substance of the Hotel Sublease shall otherwise be reasonably
acceptable to Buyer (it being understood that Buyer requires a form of Hotel
Sublease under which the Hotel and the Hotel Sublease Areas may be financed
and transferred as a single integrated asset) and shall have been approved in
writing by the Ground Lessor in accordance with the terms of the Hotel Ground
Lease and the Retail Ground Lease. The parties shall use all commercially
reasonable best efforts (not including the payment of money for a favorable
outcome or the initiation of any legal proceeding) to agree on a form as soon
as is reasonably practicable.

  

Seller agrees to cooperate with Buyer by providing Buyer with drafts of
documents to be produced by Seller under this Section 3.13 prior to
submission to a governmental authority and to allow Buyer and BuyerÂ’s counsel
a reasonable period for review and comment and to consult with Buyer with
regard to any comments or questions that Buyer may have. No failure of
condition under this Section 3.13 shall arise, however, solely on account of
SellerÂ’s failure to adopt any of BuyerÂ’s suggestions.

     

   



  

Closing Procedure. Subject to Section 4.1, the closing (the " **Closing**
") of the transaction contemplated herein shall occur at 12:00 p.m. on the
Closing Date. The Closing shall be accomplished pursuant to customary
escrow instructions (the " **Escrow Instructions** ") to be executed by and
among Buyer, Seller and the Escrow Holder.

  

Retail Closing.

  

### 1.1.15 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the
event that the Retail Special Conditions Precedent are not satisfied (or
waived in writing by Buyer) on or before the Closing Date (a " **Retail
Conditions Failure** "), at BuyerÂ’s option, the assignment of the Retail
Ground Lease shall not occur at the scheduled closing of the assignment of
the Hotel Ground Lease and the Option Agreement (the " **Hotel and Option
Closing** "), but shall instead occur at the Retail Closing referred to in
Section 4.1.2 below. If Buyer does not waive a Retail Conditions Failure, the
Hotel and Option Closing shall proceed as scheduled and the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the amount allocated to the Retail Ground Lease on
Schedule 2.2 attached hereto (the " **Retail Allocation** ," i.e.
$20,000,000.00) and SellerÂ’s obligation to sell, and BuyerÂ’s obligation to
buy, the Retail Ground Lease as contemplated by this Agreement shall be
deferred in accordance with and subject to the provisions of _Section 4.1.2_
below. For purposes of clarification, in the event of a Retail Conditions
Failure not waived by Buyer, Seller shall remain obligated to sell, and Buyer
shall remain obligated to buy, the balance of the Property (excluding the
Retail Ground Lease) on the Hotel and Option Closing Date in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement.

  

### 1.1.16 At 12:00 p.m. on the date (the " **Retail Closing Date** ") that is
ten (10) days after the date that the Retail Special Conditions Precedent are
satisfied (or waived in writing by Buyer), Buyer shall be obligated to buy,
and Seller shall be obligated to sell, the Retail Ground Lease (the **** "
**Retail Closing** ") pursuant to the terms of this Agreement as though the
Retail Ground Lease had not been excluded from the transaction contemplated
by this Agreement under Section 4.1.1. The purchase price for the Retail
Ground Lease (the **"Retail Purchase Price** ") shall be an amount equal to
the Retail Allocation. In the event that the Retail Special Conditions
Precedent have not been satisfied or waived on or before December 31, 2007,
Seller shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, whereupon the Retail
Escrow Deposit shall be returned to Buyer and neither party shall have any
further obligation hereunder except for those obligations which expressly
survive a termination of this Agreement.

  

### 1.1.17 The terms "Closing" and "Closing Date" as used in this Agreement
shall refer to the Hotel and Option Closing and/or the Retail Closing and the
Retail Closing Date, respectively, as the case may be. The parties agree that
they shall respectively cause all relevant deliverables set forth in Section
4.2 below with respect to either Closing to be delivered to the Escrow Holder
prior to the Hotel and Option Closing Date and the Retail Closing Date,
respectively, to the full extent such deliverables are applicable to the
relevant Closing.

Prorations. The following provisions shall govern the adjustments and
prorations that shall be made at Closing and the allocation of income and
expenses from the Property between Seller and Buyer. Except as expressly
provided in this Section 4.4, all items of operating revenue and operating
expense of the Property, with respect to the period prior to 12:00:01 a.m.
(the " **Cut-Off Time** ") local time at the Hotel on the Closing Date, shall
be for the account of and paid by Seller and all items of operating revenue
and operating expense of the Property with respect to the period after the
Cut-Off Time, shall be for the account of and paid by Buyer.

  

#### (c) _Taxes_.

  

(i) All real estate taxes or payments in lieu thereof, personal property
taxes and other assessments on the Property shall be prorated at Closing.
Seller shall be responsible for all real property taxes or payments in lieu
thereof and personal property taxes and other assessments for the tax periods
prior to the Closing Date, and Buyer shall be responsible for all real
property taxes or payments in lieu thereof and personal property taxes and
other assessments for the tax periods from and after the Closing Date;
however if any special improvement assessments on the Property are payable in
installments, then the installments (including the current installment) shall
be prorated as of the Cut-Off Time (with Buyer assuming the obligation to pay
any installments payable after the Closing). If the real property tax rate or
payments in lieu thereof, personal property tax rate or any assessment has
not been set for the tax year in which the Closing occurs, then the proration
of such real property tax or payments in lieu thereof, personal property tax
or assessment shall be based on the previous tax bill for the preceding tax
year for such tax or assessment which has not been set for the tax year in
which the Closing occurs, and such proration shall be adjusted between Seller
and Buyer upon presentation of written evidence that the actual taxes or
payments in lieu thereof or assessment paid (determined as of the date such
taxes or payments in lieu thereof or assessment are actually paid) for the
tax year in which the Closing occurs differ from the amounts used at Closing
and in accordance with _Section 4.4.2_. Seller shall consult with Buyer
regarding any assessment for real property taxes for the 2007 tax year.

  

(ii) The parties acknowledge that certain taxes accrue and are payable to the
various local governments by any business entity operating a hotel and its
related facilities. Included in those taxes may be business and occupation
taxes, retail sales and use taxes, gross receipts taxes, and other special
lodging or hotel taxes. For purpose of this Agreement, all of such taxes
(expressly excluding taxes and assessments covered by _Section 4.4.1(a)(i)_
above, corporate franchise taxes, and federal, state, and local income
taxes) (hereinafter referred to as " **Operational Taxes** ") shall be
allocated between Seller and Buyer such that those attributable to the period
prior to the Cut-Off Time shall be allocable to Seller and those attributable
to the period from and after the Cut-Off Time shall be to Buyer (with the
attribution of such taxes hereunder to be done in a manner consistent with
the attribution under this Agreement of the applicable revenues on which such
taxes may be based). Buyer shall receive a credit for any Operational Taxes
attributable to the period prior to the Cut-Off Time which Seller has not
paid. Except for the Operational Taxes for which (and in the amount for
which) Buyer has received a credit under this _Section 4.4(a)(ii)_ , Seller
shall be solely responsible for payment of the Operational Taxes with respect
to the period prior to the Cut-Off Time, and Buyer shall be solely

   

21   

 

  

responsible for payment of such Operational Taxes with respect to the period
after the Cut-Off Time (and those for which and in the amount for which it
receives a credit).

  

#### (d) _Lease and Rental Expenses_. Collected rents and other charges from
the Tenants shall be prorated between Seller and Buyer as of 11:59 P.M. on
the day prior to the Closing Date. If on the Closing Date there are past due
rents or charges owed by Tenants, collection of such amounts shall be
prorated when received.  If any payments of rent or other fixed charges
received by Seller or Buyer on or after the Closing Date are payable to the
other party by reason of this allocation, the appropriate sum shall be
promptly paid to the other party. Seller is responsible, at its cost, to
direct Manager to collect all past due amounts prior to Closing. If any Lease
contains obligations on the part of the Tenant for tax, escalation,
percentage, or overage payments (" **Additional Rent** ") and such Additional
Rent is not yet payable as of the Closing Date, then if SellerÂ’s portion of
such additional rent is collected by Buyer from the Tenant, Buyer shall remit
such amounts to Seller. Buyer will make reasonable efforts to collect all
past due rents, if any, for SellerÂ’s account, but Buyer shall not be
obligated to commence dispossession or other legal proceedings.

  

#### (e) _Hotel Reservations and Revenues_.

  

(i) _Reservations_. On the Closing Date, Seller shall request that Manager
provide Buyer with its schedule of confirmed reservations for dates
subsequent to the Closing Date (the "Bookings"), which schedule shall list
the party for whose benefit the reservation was made, the amount of deposit
thereunder, the amount of any room rental deposits, and the amount of any
other deposits made for advance reservations, banquets or future services to
be provided after the Closing Date.  Buyer will honor (or cause its manager
to honor), for its account, all pre-Closing Date reservations as so confirmed
by Seller for dates subsequent to the Closing Date at the rate or price
previously agreed to by Seller (so long as such rates conform to customary
rates charged by Seller). Seller shall pay or credit to Buyer the amount of
all unforfeited prepayments or deposits disclosed in such schedule.

  

(ii) _Guest Revenues_. Seller shall receive a credit for, and Buyer shall
purchase from Seller, the Guest Ledger. Such credit shall equal the amount of
the accounts receivable (or 50% thereof in the case of the final nightÂ’s
room revenue, including any sales taxes, room taxes and other taxes charged
to guests in such rooms, all parking charges, sales from mini-bars, in-room
food and beverage, telephone, facsimile and data communications, in-room
movie, laundry, and other service charges allocated to such rooms with
respect to the night), less credit card charges, travel company charges and
similar commissions. Revenues from guest rooms in the Hotel occupied on the
night containing the Cut-Off Time, including any sales taxes, room taxes and
other taxes charged to guests in such rooms, all parking charges, sales from
mini bars, in room food and beverage, telephone, facsimile and data
communications, in room movie, laundry, and other service charges allocated
to such rooms with respect to the night containing the Cut-Off Time shall be
divided equally between Seller and Buyer; provided, however, that to the
extent the times at which food and beverage sales, telephone, facsimile or
data communication, in room movie, laundry, and other services are ordered by
guests can be determined, the same shall be allocated between Seller and
Buyer based on when orders for the same were received, with orders
originating prior to Cut-Off Time being allocable to Seller, and
orders originating from

     

   

and after the Cut-Off Time being allocable to Buyer.  All other revenues
from restaurants, lounges, and other service operations conducted at the
Property shall be allocated based on whether the same accrued before or from
and after the Cut-Off Time as described in the preceding sentence, and Seller
shall instruct the Manager, and Buyer shall instruct its manager, to
separately record sales occurring before and from and after the Cut-Off Time.
The foregoing amounts are referred to collectively as "Guest Revenues".

  

(iii) _Banquet and Meeting Room Revenues_. Revenues from conferences,
receptions, meetings, and other functions occurring in any conference,
banquet or meeting rooms in the Hotel, including usage charges and related
taxes, food and beverage sales, valet parking charges, equipment rentals,
and telecommunications charges, shall be allocated between Seller and Buyer,
based on when the function therein commenced, with (i) one-day functions
commencing prior to the Cut-Off Time being allocable to Seller; (ii) one day
functions commencing from and after the Cut-Off Time being allocable to
Buyer; and (iii) multi day functions that include periods both before and
after the Cut-Off Time being prorated between Seller and Buyer according to
the period of time before and from and after the Cut-Off Time. The foregoing
amounts are referred to collectively as " **Conference Revenues**."

  

(iv) _Unredeemed Gift Certificates and Vouchers_.  Buyer shall receive a
credit against the Purchase Price at Closing in the amount actually received
by Seller on account of all redeemable, but unredeemed vouchers, gift
certificates and other promotional materials (together, the " **Vouchers** ")
which may be used as full or partial payment for any Hotel service including,
room rentals, food and beverage service, or any other item either borne
directly by the owner of the Hotel or which is reimbursable by the owner of
the Hotel (i.e., if a gift certificate can be used to pay for items in the
Hotel gift shop). The parties also agree that no credit shall be given for
any complimentary Vouchers. Seller shall request that Manager deliver to
Buyer one (1) business day prior to the Closing Date a list of all such
Vouchers.

  

#### (f) _Utilities and Insurance_. Buyer shall be responsible for all
dealings with utility service providers with respect to any actions to change
over accounts to Buyer as of the Closing Date. All charges for utilities
shall be prorated as of the Closing Date. In the event the actual amounts for
such charges for utilities or telephone calls are not known as of the Closing
Date or cannot be billed separately to the responsible party, such charges
shall be prorated between the parties as of the Closing Date once the actual
amounts thereof become known. If necessary, at the request of Buyer, Seller
shall complete the customary forms required by any telephone company or
telephone company service provider to assign the PropertyÂ’s existing
telephone numbers to Buyer. Any fees payable by the owner of the Hotel in
respect of the insurance policies maintained by Manager for the Property
shall be prorated as of the Closing Date. The parties shall request
that Manager add Buyer as an additional named insured on any such insurance
policies as of the Closing Date.

  

#### (g) _Permits_. Permit and license fees of assignable permits and
licenses, if any, shall be prorated as of the Closing Date.

  

#### (h) _Service Agreements_. Fees and other amounts, including
accrued employee expenses, payable and/or accrued under the Management
Agreement and

     

   

#### payments due under the other Service Agreements shall be prorated as
of the Closing Date. Seller shall be required to pay or cause to be paid (or
reimbursed to Manager) or credit to Buyer at the Closing any accrued or
earned wages, vacation pay, sick pay, bonuses, pension, profit-sharing and
welfare benefits and other compensation and fringe benefits of all persons
employed at the Property on or before the Closing Date, including any
employment taxes or other fees or assessments attributable thereto; it being
understood, however, that Seller shall not be required to pay any withdrawal
liability with respect to any union employees. The parties further
agree that with respect to sick pay, at the end of the calendar year in which
the Closing occurs, Buyer shall reimburse Seller for all unused sick pay
credited to Buyer at Closing which did not carry over to the following
calendar year.

  

### 1.1.21 _Calculation_. The Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a
preliminary closing statement (the " **Preliminary Closing Statement** ")
which shall show the net amount due either to Seller or Buyer as a result
thereof, and such net amount will be added to, or subtracted from the payment
of the Purchase Price to be paid to Seller pursuant to the terms hereof. If
any of the prorations or credits cannot be calculated based on actual
figures, then they shall be calculated based on SellerÂ’s good faith estimates
thereof. Within one hundred and twenty (120) days following the Closing Date,
Buyer shall prepare and submit to Seller a recalculation of the prorations
and credits, reflecting actual figures and not estimates. Such recalculation
shall be binding on Buyer and Seller unless Seller delivers to Buyer, within
thirty (30) days after Seller has received such recalculation, a notice ("
**Audit Notice** ") stating Seller does not agree with such calculations,
and, if such notice is given, a nationally recognized accounting firm
selected by Seller and reasonably approved by Buyer shall be engaged to make
the final determination of such prorations and credits (the accounting firm
engaged to make such determination herein called the " **Accounting Firm**
"). If Buyer notifies Seller after receipt of the Audit notice that it does
not approve Walter and Shuffain, P.C. as the Accounting Firm (which Audit
Notice shall request such approval or disapproval), then Buyer shall be
deemed to approve either Price Waterhouse Coopers or Ernst and Young as the
Accounting Firm unless within thirty (30) days after the delivery of an Audit
Notice, Seller shall provide notice to Buyer of another Big Four accounting
firm selected by Seller; if Buyer reasonably objects to the accounting firm
so selected by Seller, Buyer shall give notice of disapproval within fifteen
(15) days after the delivery of the notice from Seller of SellerÂ’s selection
(and if Buyer fails to give a notice of such disapproval within such fifteen
(15) day period, Buyer will be deemed to have approved SellerÂ’s selection).
 If Buyer reasonably objects to the firm so selected by Seller within such
fifteen (15) day period, Seller shall nominate another accounting firm, which
shall be subject to BuyerÂ’s reasonable approval using the same procedure as
provided in the preceding sentence.  The fees and costs of the Accounting
Firm in making such determination shall be borne as follows: if the
net amount of the prorations and credits determined by the Accounting Firm
is within 2% of the net amount as determined by Buyer, Seller shall bear
the entire fees and costs of the Accounting Firm in making such
determination; and if the net amount of the prorations and credits determined
by the Accounting Firm is greater than 2% of the net amount as determined by
Buyer, Buyer shall bear the entire fees and costs of the Accounting Firm in
making such determination. Each of Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in good
faith and act reasonably after Closing to assist Manager and Accounting Firm
in their determinations

     

   

### 1.1.22 _Accounts Receivable_. Accounts Receivable shall be identified as
of the Cut-Off Time. Seller shall receive a credit for, and Buyer shall
purchase from Seller, all accounts receivable (other than the Guest Ledger)
that are less than ninety (90) days past due. Such credit shall equal the
amount of the accounts receivable, less (i) credit card charges, travel
company charges and similar commissions and (ii) on all accounts receivable
other than credit card receivables, a percentage discount for uncollectible
amounts for past due receivables as mutually agreed upon by the parties prior
to Closing not to exceed three percent (3%).  Subject to the following
sentence, all accounts receivable and credit card claims for goods and
services furnished prior to the Cut-Off Time that are not so purchased by
Buyer shall remain the property of Seller and, to the extent Buyer receives
any payments on account thereof after Closing (A) if the applicable account
debtor who makes such payment then owes payment on one of SellerÂ’s accounts
receivable and no accounts receivable of Buyer, then Buyer shall immediately
remit such amount (net of travel agent commissions or credit card company
charges for payment of such claims) to Seller, and (B) if the applicable
account debtor who makes such payment then owes payment on
accounts receivable owing to Buyer and to Seller, such payments (net of
travel agent commissions or credit card company charges for payment of such

Condemnation or Destruction of Property.

  

Condemnation. Seller agrees to give Buyer prompt notice of any notice it
receives of any taking by condemnation (actual, pending or threatened) of any
part of or rights appurtenant to the Property. Buyer shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement in the event of an actual, pending or threatened
condemnation or temporary condemnation of longer than six (6) months that has
or reasonably would be expected to have a material adverse impact on the
operations of the Property, in which event the Escrow Deposit shall be
returned to Buyer. If Buyer does not so elect to terminate this Agreement,
then the Closing shall take place as provided herein, and Seller shall assign
to Buyer at the Closing all of SellerÂ’s interest in any condemnation award
which may be payable to Seller on account of any such condemnation and, at
Closing, Seller shall credit to the amount of the Purchase Price payable by
Buyer the amount, if any, of condemnation proceeds received by Seller between
the date of this Agreement and Closing less any amounts which are reasonably
allocated to lost earnings reasonably allocated or attributed to the period
of time prior to Closing or which are used to repair or restore
the applicable property prior to Closing.  Provided Buyer has not exercised
its right to terminate this Agreement, Seller shall notify Buyer in advance
regarding any proceeding or negotiation with respect to the condemnation and
Buyer shall have the right, at its own cost and expense, to appear and
participate in any such proceeding or negotiation.

  

Fire or Other Casualty. Seller shall give Buyer prompt notice of any fire or
other casualty to the Property costing more than $100,000.00 to repair and
occurring between the date of this Agreement and the Closing. If, prior to
Closing, the Property is damaged by fire or other casualty which is insured
(without regard to deductibles) to an extent as would not cost (as to the
damaged property) more than $8,000,000.00 and would not take longer than six
(6) months to repair, and if the holders of the existing loans to Seller
permit insurance proceeds to be used to repair and restore the Property, then
the Closing shall take place without abatement of the Purchase Price, but
Seller shall assign to Buyer at Closing all of SellerÂ’s interest in any
insurance proceeds (except only, rent loss and business interruption
insurance, and any similar insurance attributable to the period preceding the
Closing Date) that may be payable to Seller on account of any such fire or
other casualty, plus Seller shall credit the amount of any deductibles under
any policies related to such proceeds to the Purchase Price to the extent
such deductibles or insurance proceeds have not been previously expended or
are otherwise required to reimburse Seller for actual expenditures of
restoration. If any such damage due to fire or other casualty is insured and
is to such an extent as would cost more than $8,000,000.00 or would take
longer than six (6) months to repair, or if such holders will not permit
insurance proceeds to be used to repair and restore the Property then, at
BuyerÂ’s option, Buyer may terminate this Agreement and the Escrow Deposit
shall be returned to Buyer. Should Buyer nevertheless elect to proceed to

     

   

Closing, the Closing shall take place without abatement of the Purchase Price
and at Closing Seller shall assign to Buyer all of SellerÂ’s interest in any
insurance proceeds (except only, rent loss and business interruption
insurance, and any similar insurance, in each case, attributable to the
period preceding the Closing Date) that may be payable to Seller on account
of any such fire or other casualty, and Seller shall grant to Buyer a credit
against the Purchase Price equal to the amount of the applicable deductible,
to the extent such deductibles or insurance proceeds have not been previously
expended or are otherwise required to reimburse Owner for actual expenditures
of restoration. If, prior to Closing, the Property is damaged by fire or
other casualty which is uninsured and would cost more than $8,000,000.00 to
repair or would take longer than six (6) months to repair, then, at BuyerÂ’s
option, Buyer may terminate this Agreement and the Escrow Deposit shall be
returned to Buyer. If Buyer does not elect to terminate this Agreement with
respect to such uninsured casualty in the immediately preceding sentence, or
if any uninsured casualty would not cost more than $8,000,000.00 to repair
and would not take longer than six (6) months to repair, then the Closing
shall take place as provided herein, and the Purchase Price shall be reduced
by the estimated amount to repair casualty not to exceed such $8,000,000.00.

### 1.1.65 _RELEASE_. BUYER RELEASES SELLER AND ALL SELLER RELATED PARTIES
FROM ALL CLAIMS WHICH ANY BUYER OR ANY PARTY RELATED TO OR AFFILIATED WITH
BUYER (A " **BUYER RELATED PARTY** ") HAS OR MAY HAVE ARISING FROM OR RELATED
TO ANY MATTER OR THING RELATED TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROPERTY
INCLUDING THE DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION REFERRED TO HEREIN, THE MANAGEMENT
AGREEMENT, THE LEASES AND THE TENANTS THEREUNDER, ANY CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS,
ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN THE DESIGN OR CONSTRUCTION AND ANY ENVIRONMENTAL
CONDITIONS, AND BUYER SHALL NOT LOOK TO ANY SELLER RELATED PARTIES IN
CONNECTION WITH THE FOREGOING FOR ANY REDRESS OR RELIEF. THIS RELEASE SHALL BE
GIVEN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT ACCORDING TO EACH OF ITS EXPRESSED TERMS AND
PROVISIONS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO UNKNOWN AND UNSUSPECTED CLAIMS,
DAMAGES AND CAUSES OF ACTION. HOWEVER, THE FOREGOING PROVISIONS OF THIS
_SECTION 7.1_ SHALL NOT AFFECT, APPLY OR LIMIT SELLERÂ’S EXPRESS OBLIGATIONS
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND THE DOCUMENTS EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH.

  

SURVIVAL. THIS SECTION SHALL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT AND
THE CLOSING.

  

Disposition Of Escrow Deposit.

  

Default by Seller. If the Closing fails to occur by reason of SellerÂ’s
default under this Agreement in a material respect or the failure of
satisfaction of conditions benefiting Buyer under Section 3, which is not
cured or satisfied on or before thirty (30) days after written notice thereof
by Buyer to Seller, then the Escrow Deposit shall be returned to Buyer, and
neither party shall have any further obligation or liability to the
other (other than those obligations that expressly survive a termination of
this Agreement); provided, however, if the transactions hereunder shall fail
to close solely by reason of SellerÂ’s default, in a material respect, which
is not cured within the thirty (30) day period set forth above in this
Section 8.1, and Buyer is not in default in any material respect, then Buyer
shall be entitled to (i) specifically enforce this Agreement as its sole and
exclusive remedy or (ii) terminate this Agreement, in which event the Escrow
Deposit shall be returned to Buyer and neither party shall have any further
rights or obligations hereunder, excepting those which survive termination.
As provided above in the

     

   

immediately preceding clause, the Closing Date shall be extended for a period
of time, up to thirty (30) days, as necessary to enable Seller to cure and,
if at of the end of such period Seller has not cured such default and Buyer
chooses to specifically enforce this Agreement, the Closing Date for such
purpose (and for any obligation to tender performance by Buyer as a condition
to seeking specific performance) shall be agreed to be as of the last day of
such thirty (30) day period.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Buyer elects
to terminate this Agreement as a result of SellerÂ’s default in a material
respect or as a result of a representation and warranty that was not true in
a material respect as of the date when made and was not known by Buyer prior
to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period to be untrue in a material
respect, or which became materially untrue after the date when made as a
result of SellerÂ’s actions or omissions, Seller shall reimburse Buyer for its
documented, reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Buyer in connection
with this transaction up to a maximum aggregate of $500,000. If as a result
of any extension of the Closing Date under this Section 8.1, Buyer incurs
or suffers any additional out-of-pocket expense on account of any rate
lock, commitment extension or the like, Seller will at Closing reimburse
Buyer therefor up to a maximum aggregate of $500,000.

  

Default By Buyer. In the event that Buyer shall fail in breach of this
Agreement to pay the Purchase Price and accept the Property on the Closing
Date, then the Escrow Deposit shall be delivered to Seller as full
compensation and liquidated damages under this Agreement for such failure to
close. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Buyer consummates
the purchase of all but the Retail Ground Lease on the Hotel and Option
Closing Date and fails in breach of this Agreement to pay the Retail Purchase
Price and accept the Retail Ground Lease on the Retail Closing Date, the
Seller may at its option elect to (a) enforce specific performance of this
Agreement or (b) receive payment of the Retail Escrow Deposit (hereinafter
defined) as full compensation and liquidated damages under the Agreement for
such failure to close. In connection with the foregoing, the
parties recognize that Seller will incur expense in connection with the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement and that the Property will be
removed from the market; further, in the case of the Retail Ground Lease,
that the Seller will have no adequate remedy at law in the event of BuyerÂ’s
breach; and further, that it is extremely difficult and impracticable to
ascertain the extent of detriment to Seller caused by the breach by Buyer
under this Agreement and the failure of the consummation of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement or the amount of compensation Seller should
receive as a result of BuyerÂ’s breach or default. The foregoing provisions
of this Section 8.2 shall not limit or affect BuyerÂ’s liability to Seller
under any of BuyerÂ’s indemnities which survive Closing or termination of the
Agreement, with respect to which Seller shall have available to it
all remedies at law or in equity.

  

Closing. In the event the transaction herein provided shall close, the Escrow
Deposit shall be applied as a partial payment of the Purchase Price.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a Retail Conditions Failure
occurs and the Hotel and Option Closing takes place prior to the Retail
Closing, (a) Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00) of the Escrow Deposit (the "
**Retail Escrow Deposit** ") shall be retained by the Escrow Agent on the
Hotel and Option Closing Date in accordance with the terms of the Interim
Deposit Agreement and (b) the balance of the Escrow Deposit shall be applied
as a partial payment of the Purchase Price at the Hotel and Option Closing.
In such event, the Retail Escrow Deposit shall be treated for all purposes in
accordance with the provisions of Section 8.1 and 8.2 above, provided that
all references to the "Escrow Deposit", the "Closing" and the "Closing Date"
shall be deemed references to the "Retail Escrow Deposit," the "Retail
Closing" and the "Retail Closing Date," as

     

   

the case may be.  In the event that the Retail Closing occurs, the Retail
Escrow Deposit shall be applied as a partial payment of the Retail Purchase
Price, and in the event the Retail Closing does not occur the Retail Escrow
Deposit shall be paid to the party entitled thereto pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement and in accordance with Sections 8.1 and 8.2 hereof.

  

Miscellaneous.

  

Brokers.

  

### 1.1.66 Except as provided in _Section 9.1.2_ below, Seller represents and
warrants to Buyer, and Buyer represents and warrants to Seller, that no
broker or finder has been engaged by it, respectively, in connection with the
sale contemplated by this Agreement. In the event of a claim for brokerÂ’s or
finderÂ’s fee or commissions in connection with the sale contemplated by this
Agreement, then Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer from
the same if it shall be based upon any statement or agreement alleged to have
been made by Seller, and Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Seller from the same if it shall be based upon any statement or agreement
alleged to have been made by Buyer.  The provisions of this _Section 9.1_
shall survive the Closing and shall not be subject to the limitations on
survival in _Section 6.3_ or the limitations on liability in _Section 9.2_.

  

### 1.1.67 If and only if the sale contemplated herein closes, Seller has
agreed to pay a brokerage commission to Broker pursuant to a separate written
agreement between Seller and Broker.

  

Limitation of Liability.

  

### 1.1.68 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if the
Closing of the transactions hereunder shall have occurred:  (1) Seller shall
have no liability (and Buyer shall make no claim against Seller) for
indemnity or for breach of any representation or warranty under this
Agreement unless the valid claims for indemnity and all such breaches
collectively aggregate (taking into account claims relating to both the Hotel
and Option Closing and the Retail Closing, in the aggregate) to more
than $250,000, (2) the liability of the Seller under this Agreement
for indemnity and all breaches of representations and warranties under
this Agreement shall not exceed, in the aggregate (i) with respect to
claims relating only to the Hotel and Option Closing an amount equal to
$7,000,000.00, and (ii) with respect to claims relating only to the Retail
Closing, an amount equal to $500,000.00. In no event shall Seller be liable
for any consequential or punitive damages. As used herein, the term "
**Maximum Liability Amount** " shall refer, if there is no separate Retail
Closing, to the sum of $7,500,000.00, or, if there is a separate Retail
Closing to the sum of $7,000,000.00 or the sum of $500,000.00 (as applicable
as set forth above in this _Section 9.7._ 1) Seller covenants that it will
retain and not distribute sales proceeds equal to the Maximum Liability
Amount until the expiration of the applicable Survival Period, whereupon it
may distribute the same, less the amount of any then pending claims.

  

### 1.1.69 Except in accordance with the joinder attached hereto (the "
**Joinder** "), no constituent member or partner in or agent of Seller, nor
any advisor, trustee, director, officer, employee, beneficiary, shareholder,
member, partner, participant, representative

     

   

### or agent of any partnership, limited liability company,
corporation, trust or other entity that has or acquires a direct or indirect
interest in Seller, shall have any personal liability, directly or
indirectly, under or in connection with this Agreement or any agreement made
or entered into under or pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, or any
amendment or amendments to any of the foregoing made at any time or times,
heretofore or hereafter, and Buyer and its successors and assigns and,
without limitation, all other persons and entities, shall look solely to
SellerÂ’s assets for the payment of any claim or for any performance, and
Buyer, on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, hereby waives any
and all such personal liability. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, neither the negative capital account of
any constituent member or partner in Seller (or in any other constituent
member or partner of Seller), nor any obligation of any constituent member or
partner in Seller (or in any other constituent member or partner of Seller)
to restore a negative capital account or to contribute capital to Seller (or
to any other constituent member or partner of Seller), shall at any time be
deemed to be the property or an asset of Seller or any such other constituent
member or partner (and neither Buyer nor any of its successors or assigns
shall have any right to collect, enforce or proceed against or with respect
to any such negative capital account or a memberÂ’s or partnerÂ’s obligation to
restore or contribute) but shall have the right to pursue any distribution of
the Purchase Price to such members in violation of the Joinder.

  

### 1.1.70 The foregoing shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of,
any further limitation of liability that might otherwise apply (whether by
reason of BuyerÂ’s waiver, relinquishment or release of any applicable rights
or otherwise). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the liability
of each party hereto resulting from the breach or default by either party
shall be limited to actual damages incurred by the injured party and the
parties hereto hereby waive their rights to recover from the other party
consequential, punitive, exemplary, and speculative damages. The
representations and warranties of Seller are also subject to the following
express limitations:

  

### (a) The amendment, expiration or termination of any Lease, Equipment
Lease, Rooms Agreement, Booking or Service Agreement or the entering into of
any new such agreement occurring in compliance with the terms of this
Agreement that does not materially adversely affect the operation of the
Hotel and the Property shall not affect the obligations of Buyer hereunder or
render any representation or warranty of Seller untrue.

  

### (b) To the extent that Buyer actually knows prior to the Closing Date
that any of SellerÂ’s representations and warranties are inaccurate, untrue or
incorrect in any way, and Buyer nevertheless elects to proceed to Closing,
such representations and warranties shall be deemed modified to reflect
BuyerÂ’s actual knowledge.

  

### 1.1.71 The provisions of this _Section 9.2_ shall survive the Closing.

  

Exhibits; Entire Agreement; Modification. All exhibits attached and referred
to in this Agreement are hereby incorporated herein as if fully set forth in
(and shall be deemed to be a part of) this Agreement. This Agreement contains
the entire agreement between the parties respecting the matters herein set
forth and supersedes all prior agreements between the parties hereto
respecting such matters; provided, however, that the existing Confidentiality
Agreement

     

   

between the parties shall remain in effect and be binding upon the parties
until Closing.  This Agreement may not be modified or amended except by
written agreement signed by both parties.

  

Time of the Essence. Time is of the essence of this Agreement. However,
whenever action must be taken (including the giving of notice or the delivery
of documents) under this Agreement during a certain period of time (or by
a particular date) that ends (or occurs) on a non business day, then such
period (or date) shall be extended until the immediately following business
day. As used herein, "business day" means any day other than a Saturday,
Sunday, a federal holiday, or a state holiday in Massachusetts.

  

Interpretation. Section headings shall not be used in construing this
Agreement. Each party acknowledges that such party and its counsel, after
negotiation and consultation, have reviewed and revised this Agreement. As
such, the terms of this Agreement shall be fairly construed and the usual
rule of construction, to the effect that any ambiguities herein should be
resolved against the drafting party, shall not be employed in the
interpretation of this Agreement or any amendments, modifications or exhibits
hereto or thereto.  The words "herein", "hereof", "hereunder", "hereby",
"this Agreement" and other similar references shall be construed to mean and
include this Agreement and all amendments and supplements hereto unless the
context shall clearly indicate or require otherwise.  Whenever the words
"including", "include" or "includes" are used in this Agreement, they shall
be interpreted in a non-exclusive manner. Except as otherwise indicated, all
Exhibit and Section references in this Agreement shall be deemed to refer to
the Exhibits and Sections in this Agreement.

  

Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance
with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

  

Successors and Assigns. Buyer may not assign or transfer its rights or
obligations under this Agreement or nominate any other Person to accept
SellerÂ’s performance without the prior written consent of Seller either
directly or indirectly (whether by outright transfer, transfer of ownership
interests or otherwise); provided, however, so long as the same has already
received the consent of Ground Lessor and Manager, if and to the
extent required under the Retail Ground Lease, the Hotel Ground Lease, the
Option Agreement and/or the Management Agreement, as applicable, Buyer may
assign its interest in this Agreement on or before the Closing Date to, or
may nominate, an entity in which Buyer has direct or indirect control and has
more than a 50% direct or indirect ownership interest so long as Buyer and
the assignee execute and deliver an assignment and assumption agreement in
form reasonably satisfactory to Seller. In the event of a transfer, the
transferee shall assume in writing all of the transferorÂ’s obligations
hereunder, but such transferor shall not be released from its obligations
hereunder unless and until the Closing occurs. No consent given by Seller to
any transfer or assignment of BuyerÂ’s rights or obligations hereunder shall
be construed as a consent to any other transfer or assignment of BuyerÂ’s
rights or obligations hereunder. No transfer or assignment in violation of
the provisions hereof shall be valid or enforceable. Subject to the foregoing,
this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof shall inure to the benefit
of and be binding upon the successors and assigns of the parties.  Seller
acknowledges that certain items of tangible and/or intangible personal
property may need to be assigned to BuyerÂ’s operating lessee and
the applicable closing documents shall be modified accordingly as requested
by Buyer including through the use of separate bills of sale and assignments
or otherwise as reasonably requested by Buyer.  

     

   

Notwithstanding the foregoing, transfers of publicly traded interests in
entities which are listed on a nationally recognized exchange shall not be
considered assignments or transfers for purposes of this Section 9.7. Either
party may upon notice to the other elect to arrange the sale or acquisition
of the Property as a like-kind exchange (" **LKE** ") pursuant to 26 U.S.C.
Â§1031 and the Treasury.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Section 9.7, in structuring the transaction as an LKE, so long as all
requisite third party consents have been obtained (which Seller shall use
reasonable efforts, not including the payment of money or the bringing of any
law suit, to cooperate in obtaining), either party shall have the right to
assign to a qualified intermediary all of its rights (but not its duties and
obligations) under this Agreement. Neither party shall be required to take
title to any other property or to incur any out-of-pocket cost on account of
the LKE. The party proposing an LKE shall indemnify and hold the other party
harmless from and against any liability, loss, claim, cost or damage the
other party may suffer arising out of the LKE.

shall be in writing and may be sent by personal delivery, by mail (either [i]

postage prepaid, or [ii] by Federal Express or similar generally recognized
overnight carrier regularly providing proof of delivery or by telecopy (with

Third Parties. Nothing in this Agreement, whether expressed or implied, is
intended to confer any rights or remedies under or by reason of this
Agreement on any person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, nor is anything in this Agreement intended to relieve
or discharge the obligation or liability of any third persons to any party to
this Agreement, nor shall any provision give any third parties any right of
subrogation or action over or against any party to this Agreement. This
Agreement is not intended to and does not create any third party beneficiary
rights whatsoever.

  

Legal Costs. The parties hereto agree that they shall pay directly any and
all legal costs which they have incurred on their own behalf in the
preparation of this Agreement, all deeds and other agreements pertaining to
this transaction and that such legal costs shall not be part of the Closing
costs. In addition, if either Buyer or Seller brings any suit or other
proceeding, including an arbitration proceeding, with respect to the subject
matter or the enforcement of this Agreement, the prevailing party (as
determined by the court, agency, arbitrator or other authority before which
such suit or proceeding is commenced), in addition to such other relief as
may be awarded, shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees,
expenses and costs of investigation actually incurred. The foregoing
includes attorneysÂ’ fees, expenses and costs of investigation (including
those incurred in appellate proceedings), costs incurred in establishing the
right to indemnification, or in any action or participation in, or in
connection with, any case or proceeding under Chapter 7, 11 or 13 of the
Bankruptcy Code (11 United States Code Sections 101 et seq.), or
any successor statutes. The provisions of this Section 9.10 shall survive
the Closing and any termination of this Agreement.

     

   

No Recordation. Except on or after Closing with respect to instruments
expressly intended to be recorded on or after Closing, in no event shall this
Agreement or any document or other memorandum related to the subject matter
of this Agreement (other than a lis pendens giving notice of an arbitration
or legal proceeding to specifically enforce SellerÂ’s obligations under this
Agreement) be recorded without the consent of Seller.

  

Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which shall constitute
one and the same document.  Delivery by facsimile, or e-mail of a PDF copy,
of a counterpart of this Agreement executed by a party shall constitute
delivery by such party of such partyÂ’s executed counterpart of this
Agreement.

  

Effectiveness. In no event shall any draft of this Agreement create any
obligation or liability, it being understood that this Agreement shall be
effective and binding only when a counterpart hereof has been executed and
delivered by each party hereto.

  

Press Releases or other Disclosure. Seller and Buyer agree not to disclose
or make any public announcements with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement or the existence of this Agreement without the consent of the other
party. If either party desires to issue a press release or other public
announcement regarding this Agreement or the transaction set forth herein,
subject to the immediately preceding sentence, such party shall obtain the
approval of the other party, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such disclosure shall
be made by either party, nor shall any such consent be sought by either
party, prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period;
provided, however, that at any time any one or more of Joseph Fallon, Stephen
R. Karp or Steven S. Fischman may communicate with senior governmental
officials and senior executives of Manager for purposes of alerting them to
the transaction and preparing them for the requests that will be made of them
in accordance with the terms hereof. On or after January 10, 2007 Buyer may
publicly disclose the transaction in connection with its efforts to
underwrite a public offering of equity in connection with the financing of
the transaction and Buyer may communicate at any time with its accountants,
legal counsel, prospective underwriters and prospective underwriterÂ’s counsel
so long as it instructs such parties to keep any such communication
confidential. The provisions of this Section 9.14 shall survive the closing
and any termination of this Agreement.

  

Indemnities.

  

### 1.1.72 _Agreement to Indemnify_. (i) Seller shall indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer and any partner, member, manager officer, director, trustee,
beneficiary, employee or agent of Buyer (collectively, the " **Buyer
Indemnitees** ") from and against any and all obligations, claims, losses,
damages, liabilities, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneysÂ’ and accountantsÂ’ fees and disbursements (collectively, "
**Damages** ") to the extent arising out of (A) any loss or damage to
property or injury to or death of any person occurring on or about or in
connection with the Property or any portion thereof at any time or times
prior to the applicable Closing Date (other than as to and excluding Damages
of or to a governmental authority arising out of the physical or
environmental condition of the Property prior to the applicable Closing Date
and other than as to Damages for remediation pertaining to

     

   

### the physical or environmental condition of the Property prior to the
applicable Closing Date), (B) subject to the limitations set forth herein, a
breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller hereunder or in
any certificate delivered by Seller hereunder, or (C) obligations and
liabilities of Seller accruing or arising prior to the applicable Closing
under any of the Hotel Ground Lease, the Retail Ground Lease, the Option
Agreement, the PILOT Agreement, the License Agreement, the Management
Agreement or the matters assigned under the Other Assignment and Assumption
Agreement (collectively, the " **Assigned Matters** ") and (ii) Buyer shall
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and any partner, member, manager, officer,
director, trustee, beneficiary, employee or agent of Seller (collectively,
the " **Seller Indemnitees** ") from and against any and all Damages to the
extent arising out of (A) any loss or damage to property or injury to or
death of any person occurring on or about the Property or any portion thereof
on or at any time or times after the applicable Closing Date (other than as
to and excluding Damages of or to a Governmental Authority arising out of or
resulting from or relating to the physical or environmental condition of the
Property prior to the applicable Closing Date and other than as to Damages
for remediation pertaining to the physical or environmental condition of the
Property prior to the applicable Closing Date), (B) a breach of any
representation or warranty made by Buyer hereunder or in any certificate
delivered by Buyer hereunder or a breach of BuyerÂ’s covenant to use
commercially reasonable best efforts to agree on a form of Hotel Sublease to
the extent set forth in _Section 3.13.6_ above, or (C) obligations or
liabilities of Buyer accruing or arising on or after the applicable Closing
under any of the Assigned Matters. The provisions of this _Section 9.15.1_
 shall survive the Closing and the termination of this Agreement. SellerÂ’s
liabilities under this _Section 9.15_ shall not extend the applicable
Survival Period stated in _Section 6.3_ hereof or exceed the Maximum
Liability Amount provided in _Section 9.2.1_  hereof, to the extent not
covered by insurance.

  

### 1.1.73 _Indemnification Procedure for Third Party Claims_. In the case
of any claim asserted by a third party which claim is subject
to indemnification by either party hereunder, ( a " **Third-Party Claim** "),
the party seeking indemnification (the " **Indemnitee** ") shall notify the
other party (the " **Indemnitor** ") promptly after has actual knowledge of
any such Third-Party Claim as to which indemnity may be sought (provided that
failure to so notify shall not affect the IndemnitorÂ’s obligations hereunder
except to the extent materially prejudiced by such failure), and Indemnitee
shall permit the Indemnitor, at its sole expense, to assume the defense of
any such Third-Party Claim, provided that Indemnitee may participate in such
defense or administration at IndemniteeÂ’s sole expense (provided, however,
that if a conflict of interest exists such that separate counsel must be
engaged by Indemnitee and the Indemnitor, the Indemnitor shall be responsible
for the reasonable fees and costs for such counsel for Indemnitee bug only
for one separate counsel for all Indemnitees).  The Indemnitor, in the
defense of any such Third-Party Claim, shall not, except with the consent of
Indemnitee, which Indemnitee agrees will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed with respect to a monetary settlement, judgment or
relief, (a) consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
that provides for injunctive or other non-monetary relief against Indemnitee
or (b) pursue any course of defense of any such Third-Party Claim subject to
indemnification hereunder if Indemnitee shall reasonably and in good faith
determine that the conduct of such defense could be expected to adversely
affect in any material respect Indemnitee, its direct or indirect owners, the
use of the Property to which the Third-Party Claim relates. In addition, if
the Indemnitor obtains and desires to accept from a party to any such Third-
Party Claim an offer to settle the Third-Party Claim solely for an amount
certain, then Indemnitee agrees that if requested by the

     

   

### Indemnitor, Indemnitee will, at its sole expense, assume defense of such
Third-Party Claim and thereafter the IndemnitorÂ’s obligation with respect to
such Third-Party Claim shall not exceed the costs of defense then
incurred and the dollar amount of the settlement the Indemnitor proposed to
accept immediately prior to such assumption by Indemnitee, it being agreed
between Indemnitee and the Indemnitor that Indemnitee will pay any greater
amounts owing and bear any other impositions in excess of those contemplated
in the proposed settlement arrangement. In the event that the Indemnitor
does not accept the defense of any matter as above provided, Indemnitee shall
have the full right to defend against any such Third-Party Claim or demand
and shall be entitled to settle or agree to pay in full such Third-Party
Claim or demand, in its sole discretion. In any event, the Indemnitor and
Indemnitee shall cooperate in the defense of any action or claim subject to
this Agreement and each agrees to make its records available to the other
with respect to such defense as reasonably requested and to the extent doing
so does not compromise any claim of privilege or any other defense available
to it. Acceptance of the defense of any Third-Party Claim or of the
administration of any Third-Party Claim by the Indemnitor shall be without
prejudice to the IndemnitorÂ’s right to assert at any time before or after
accepting such defense or administration that it is not obligated to provide
an indemnity, either in whole or in part, with respect to such Third-Party
Claim. In the event that the Indemnitor asserts that it is not obligated to
provide an indemnity to Indemnitee with respect to a Third-Party Claim,
Indemnitee shall have the right to defend such Third-Party Claim, and if the
Indemnitor is adjudicated liable for indemnifying Indemnitee, the Indemnitor
shall reimburse Indemnitee for its out-of-pocket expenses in defending such
Third-Party Claim and all settlements and judgments reasonably incurred as a
result of such Third-Party Claim.

 _JOINDER_

  

Joseph Fallon, Stephen R. Karp and Steven S. Fischman (each a " _Principal_ "
and collectively, the " _Principals_ "), hereby join in the foregoing
Purchase Agreement (the " _Purchase Agreement_ ") for the purpose of
guaranteeing, and do hereby agree to be liable for, as a primary obligor, the
full and faithful payment and performance (and not merely collection) of the
Obligations (as hereinafter defined). Any capitalized term not defined herein
shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in the Purchase Agreement.

  

1. The following paragraphs (a) and (b) are referred to herein as the " _Obligations_.":

  

(a) Principals covenant and guarantee to Buyer that as of the date of the
applicable Closing (i.e. the Hotel and Option Closing and/or the Retail
Closing) through the end of the applicable Survival Period (and, if a claim
is made by Buyer under the Purchase Agreement during the applicable Survival
Period, then until such claim is resolved), Principals shall (a) cause Hotel
Seller and Retail Seller to have, in the aggregate, a tangible aggregate net
worth of, and no less than, the applicable Maximum Liability Amount (less the
aggregate amount actually paid to Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to _Section
9.15._ 1 of the Purchase Agreement) in unrestricted cash or cash equivalents
on hand, such sums to be held in unblocked accounts owned solely by Hotel
Seller and Retail Seller, as applicable, which sums shall be not be
encumbered by any liens, security interests or other third-party interests
(the " _Minimum Cash Requirement_ "). Principals covenant and guarantee to
Buyer that each Principal will not, and will not cause Hotel Seller or Retail
Seller to (1) engage in any activities that will materially decrease the
Minimum Cash Requirement held by Hotel Seller and Retail Seller, or (2)
without just cause to do so based upon a defense to payment or performance,
delay or otherwise hinder or impair BuyerÂ’s ability to recover from Seller
under the Purchase Agreement or from Principals under this Joinder. From time
to time, promptly upon BuyerÂ’s request, Principals shall provide
documentation reasonably acceptable to Buyer demonstrating that Seller is in
compliance with the provisions of this paragraph.

  

(b) To the extent the Hotel Seller and the Retail Seller do not maintain,
through the applicable Survival Period (or, if a claim is made by Buyer under
the Purchase Agreement during the applicable Survival Period, until such
claim is resolved), the Minimum Cash Requirement, the Principals hereby
guarantee, and do hereby agree to be liable for, jointly and severally, the
payment and performance of each and all of the obligations of Seller under
the Purchase Agreement up to the amount by which the Minimum Cash Requirement
exceeds the amount of unrestricted cash or cash equivalent on hand held by
Seller.

  

2. Buyer shall have the right from time to time to demand payment from Principals of such sums for which Principals may become liable hereunder, which demand shall be in writing and which payment shall be in lawful money of the United States.

  

3. The obligations of Principals hereunder are independent of the obligations of Seller, or the obligations of any other person who may be liable to Buyer, in whole or in part for the Obligations, or any part thereof, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against Principals whether or not an action is brought against Seller and whether or not Seller is joined in such action or actions.

     

   

4. Principals authorize Buyer and Seller, without notice or consent and without affecting, impairing or discharging PrincipalsÂ’ liability hereunder, to from time to time (a) renew, modify, amend, extend or discharge any other term contained within the Purchase Agreement, (b) exercise or refrain from exercising any of their rights or obligations under the Purchase Agreement, at law or in equity, or (c) release in whole or in part Seller or any member in Seller from liability.  Buyer may not assign its interest under this Joinder, except to an entity to which Buyer expressly is permitted under the Purchase Agreement to assign its interest in the Purchase Agreement.  Principals may not assign their obligations under the Joinder.

  

4. This Joinder shall not be affected in any way by (a) the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Purchase Agreement, (b) any change in the existence or structure of Seller, (c) the actual or purported assignment by Principals of any of their obligations, covenants and agreements contained in this Joinder, or (d) by any other circumstance (other than by complete, irrevocable payment) that might otherwise discharge the Obligations or might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor.

  

5. Buyer may, without notice or demand and without affecting PrincipalsÂ’ liability hereunder waive compliance with, or any default under, or grant any other indulgences with respect to, the Purchase Agreement and/or the Obligations or deal in all respects with Seller as if this Joinder were not in effect.

  

6. Principals, to the extent permitted by law, waive any right to require Buyer to (a) proceed with or exhaust remedies against any other party, including Seller, or (b) pursue any other remedy whatsoever to which Seller may be entitled.  Principals waives any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of Seller or by reason of the cessation or modification from any cause whatsoever of the liability of Seller. Without limiting the preceding sentence, the obligations of Principals shall remain in full force and effect without regard to, and shall not be affected or impaired by, the following, nor shall the following create a defense by Principals with respect to such obligations, or give Principals any recourse or right of action against Buyer: any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, dissolution, liquidation, moratorium or other like proceeding relating to Seller, any member or affiliate of Seller, or any action taken with respect to this Joinder or the Purchase Agreement by any trustee, owner in possession, receiver or court, in or pursuant to any such proceeding. The Principal are fully aware of the financial condition, business and prospects of Seller and assume full responsibility for obtaining any additional information now or hereafter related thereto. Principals waive diligence, all presentments and demands for performance, required to be given by Buyer under the Purchase Agreement or applicable laws, notices of non-performance or default, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this Joinder, and all other notices of every and any kind.

  

7. Each party agrees to pay, upon demand therefor, reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees and all other costs and expenses that may be incurred by the other party (if such other party is the prevailing party) in the enforcement of this Joinder and/or the Purchase Agreement and all attorneysÂ’ fees and other costs and expenses incurred by such other prevailing party in pursuing or enforcing rights under this Joinder, or with respect to the Obligations or this Joinder, whether in litigation, or in administrative, bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings.

     

   

8. Each Principal represents and warrants to Buyer that the Principals own, directly or indirectly, a majority of the direct and indirect ownership interests in Seller and the Principals have the right to control Seller.
