circumstance, or condition that operates to (i) increase the Net Revenue

3.5 Environmental Assessment; Environmental Defects.

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement, Acquiror shall have the right
to conduct, or cause a reputable environmental consulting or engineering firm
(the "Environmental Consultant"), to conduct, an environmental review of
Assets as provided in this Section 3.5 (the "Environmental Review").
Contributor shall have the right to have a representative of Contributor
accompany the Acquiror during any such Environmental Review.

(b) Except as expressly provided in this Section 3.5, Acquiror's Environmental
Review shall be limited to conducting a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment
in accordance with the American Society for Testing and Materials (A.S.T.M.)
Standard Practice Environmental Site Assessments: Phase I Environmental Site
Assessment Process ASTM E1527-13, or a similar visual evaluation of the Assets
that does not involve the sampling of any environmental media or the operation
of any equipment, and an environmental compliance review (each, a "Site
Assessment") and shall not include any sampling, boring, operation of
Equipment, or other invasive activity ("Invasive Activity") without the prior
written consent of Contributor, which consent may be withheld in Contributor's
sole discretion, and that of any applicable third Person operator. In the
event that Acquiror's Site Assessment identifies actual or potential
"recognized environmental conditions" with respect to any Assets which are
operated or solely owned by a Company Group Member and Acquiror reasonably
believes that sampling of environmental media is necessary to prove that an
Environmental Defect exists or to establish the Environmental Defect Amount,
then Acquiror may request in writing Contributor's and or the Company Group
Members' permission to conduct a Phase II Environmental Assessment to further
assess such conditions (each a "Phase II Request"). Each Phase II Request will
state with reasonable specificity (i) the actual or potential "recognized
environmental conditions" that require further investigation in order to prove
that an Environmental Defect exists or to establish the Environmental Defect
Amount and (ii) the proposed scope of the Phase II Environmental Assessment
and Phase II Environmental Assessment plan, including a description of the
activities to be conducted, and a description of the approximate location and
expected timing of such activities. Contributor may, in its sole discretion,
approve or deny any Phase II Request, in whole or in part, and Acquiror shall
not have the right to conduct any activities identified in such Phase II
Request unless and until such time that Contributor has approved such Phase II
Request in writing. If Contributor denies any Phase II Request in writing,
either Party shall have the right to exclude any Property identified in such
Phase II Request, and its directly associated Assets, from the Assets conveyed
pursuant to this Agreement, in which case (i) the Unadjusted Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such excluded Assets, (ii) such
Property shall be deemed to be deleted from Exhibit A and or Exhibit B, as
applicable, attached hereto and added to Exhibit F attached hereto and (iii)
such Property and its directly associated Assets shall constitute "Excluded
Assets" for all purposes hereunder. If Contributor consents to any Phase II
Request, all Invasive Activities performed by Acquiror or Acquiror's
representatives thereunder shall be subject to the Phase II Guidelines.

(c) Contributor shall, and shall cause the Company Group, to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain permission from the operator of each Property for
Acquiror or the Environmental Consultant to conduct the Environmental Review.
If obtained prior to Closing, Acquiror shall provide copies of any final
environmental reports generated by the Environmental



Consultant to Contributor promptly after receipt thereby by Acquiror. Except
(i) as may be necessary for, or permitted pursuant to, the exercise of the
rights and fulfillment of the obligations of a Party under this Agreement,
(ii) as may be required by applicable Laws, or (iii) for information which is
or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the Person against whom this
sentence is sought to be enforced, Acquiror and Contributor and their
respective Affiliates shall maintain, and shall cause their respective
officers, directors, employees, contractors, consultants (including the
Environmental Consultant), and other advisors to maintain, all information,
reports (whether interim, draft, final, or otherwise), data, work product, and
other matters obtained or generated from or attributable to the Environmental
Review (the "Environmental Information") strictly confidential, and shall not
disclose all or any portion of the Environmental Information to any third
Person without the consent of Acquiror or Contributor, as applicable, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Each Party
shall be responsible for the compliance of its Affiliates, and its and their
respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, consultants (including
the Environmental Consultant), and other advisors with the immediately
preceding sentence.

(d) As used in this Agreement, the term "Environmental Defect" with respect to
the Assets means any event, condition, matter, obligation or circumstance (in
each case, whether or not disclosed to Acquirer prior to the date of this
Agreement) with respect to the air, soil, subsurface, surface waters, ground
waters and/or sediments or any violation of any Environmental Laws that (i)
presently requires restoration, remediation, or resolution under applicable
Environmental Laws or pursuant to any Leases, Contracts or applicable
Environmental Permit or (ii) if known by a Governmental Authority, would
require restoration, remediation, or resolution under applicable Environmental
Laws.

3.6 Notice of Title Defects, Environmental Defects and Title Benefits.

Title Defect shall be limited to those claims asserted by Acquiror pursuant to

(c) To assert a claim for or with respect to an Environmental Defect, Acquiror
must deliver a defect claim notice or notices to Contributor on or before 5:00
p.m. local time in Houston, Texas on December 1, 2018 in the case of
Environmental Defects (the "Environmental Defect Claim Date"). Each such
notice shall be in writing and shall include:

(i) a description of the alleged Environmental Defect(s);

(ii) the Property or Properties affected (each, an "Environmental Defect
Property");

(iii) such supporting documentation as is reasonably available to Acquiror and
is reasonably necessary for Contributor (as well as any attorney or examiner
hired by Contributor) to verify the existence of the alleged Environmental
Defect(s); and

(iv) Acquiror's good faith estimate of the Environmental Defect Amount for
each alleged Environmental Defect and the computations and information upon
which Acquiror's estimate is based.

SUBJECT TO THE RIGHTS OF ACQUIROR PURSUANT TO THIS Article 3 AND UNDER (OR
WITH RESPECT TO) Article 4, Article 6, Article 11, UNDER THE CERTIFICATE TO BE
DELIVERED BY CONTRIBUTOR AT CLOSING PURSUANT TO SECTION 8.2(c) AND THE DEFECT
ESCROW AGREEMENT, ACQUIROR SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED AND RELEASED ANY AND
ALL ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECTS WITH RESPECT TO THE PROPERTIES FOR WHICH CONTRIBUTOR
HAS NOT RECEIVED, ON OR BEFORE THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECT CLAIM DATE, A VALID
ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECT CLAIM NOTICE THAT SATISFIES ALL OF THE CONDITIONS AND
REQUIREMENTS IN THIS SECTION 3.6(c).

(d) Acquiror agrees to use reasonable good-faith efforts to provide
Contributor with periodic (but in no event less frequently than before 5:00
p.m. local time in Houston, Texas on Friday of each week prior to the
Environmental Defect Claim Date) updates concerning the progress of Acquiror's
environmental due diligence prior to the Environmental Defect Claim Date
(including any potential Environmental Defects discovered by Acquiror), which
updates shall be in writing and shall be preliminary in nature; provided,
however, the failure to provide updates shall not affect the Acquiror's
ability to claim Environmental Defects.

3.7 Cure.

(a) Contributor shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at
Contributor's sole cost, risk, and expense, to cure or remove, on or before
one hundred and twenty (120) days after the Closing Date (the "Cure Date"),
any alleged Title Defects or Environmental Defects of which Contributor has
been advised by Acquiror pursuant to the Title Defect Notice or



Section 3.6(c) if Contributor provides written notice to Acquiror on or before
the Closing Date of its intent to cure such alleged Title Defects or
Environmental Defects. With respect to any Title Defect or Environmental
Defect that Contributor has elected to cure pursuant to this Section 3.7(a),
the Title Defect Amounts or Environmental Defect Amounts with respect to such
Title Defects and Environmental Defects shall be addressed as provided in
Section 3.8(e) for purposes of Closing and thereafter any adjustment required
under Section 3.8(a) with respect thereto shall be made pursuant to Section
3.8(g) and Section 3.8(h). The election by Contributor to cure one or more
such alleged Title Defects or Environmental Defects shall not affect the
rights and obligations of the Parties under Section 3.10 with respect to
dispute resolution. Contributor's election to cure an alleged Title Defect or
Environmental Defect shall not constitute a waiver of any of the rights of
Contributor pursuant to this Article 3, including Contributor's right to
dispute the existence, nature, or value of such Title Defect or Environmental
Defect.

(b) With respect to any alleged Title Defect or Environmental Defect which
Contributor has elected to cure pursuant to Section 3.7(a) above, subject to
the determination by the Title Arbitrator or Environmental Arbitrator, as
applicable, of the existence or Title Defect Amount or Environmental Defect
Amount with respect to such a Title Defect or Environmental Defect, as
applicable, to the extent any such Title Defect or Environmental Defect is
cured by Contributor on or before the Cure Date, the amount of any previous
deduction from the Unadjusted Purchase Price for such Title Defect or
Environmental Defect shall be addressed as provided in Section 3.8(e)(ii) and
Section 3.8(h).

(c) Any dispute relating to whether and to what extent a Title Defect or
Environmental Defect has been cured shall be resolved as set forth in Section
3.11, except that any such matter shall be submitted to the Title Arbitrator
or Environmental Arbitrator, as applicable, on or before ten (10) Business
Days after the Cure Date; provided, however, that any prior or concurrent
determination by a Title Arbitrator or Environmental Arbitrator with respect
to Title Defects or Environmental Defects (or factual or legal matters
relating thereto, even if determined in connection with the resolution of an
otherwise unrelated dispute) which Contributor has elected to cure pursuant to
this Section 3.7 shall be binding on the Parties with respect to such Title
Defect or Environmental Defect (or factual or legal matters relating thereto,
even if determined in connection with the resolution of an otherwise unrelated
dispute).

3.8 Adjustment for Title Defects, Title Benefits and Environmental Defects.

(a) Without limitation of the Parties' rights to exclude Assets as set forth
in Section 3.5(b) or Section 3.9(c)(v), with respect to each Property affected
by Title Defects or Environmental Defects reported under the Title Defect
Notice or Section 3.6(c), the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by
(i) in the case of a Title Defect, an amount (the "Title Defect Amount") equal
to the reduction in the Allocated Value for the Properties affected thereby
caused by such Title Defect, as determined pursuant to Section 3.9(a), and
(ii) in the case of an Environmental Defect, an amount (the "Environmental
Defect Amount") determined pursuant to Section 3.9(c).

(b) With respect to each Property affected by Title Benefits reported under
Section 3.6(b), the amount by which the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be
reduced on account of



Title Defects shall be offset by an amount (the "Title Benefit Amount") equal
to the increase in the Allocated Value for such Property caused by such Title
Benefit, as determined pursuant to Section 3.9(b).

(c) Contributor and Acquiror shall attempt to agree in writing upon all the
existence of any Title Defects, Title Benefits or Environmental Defects
reported pursuant to the Title Defect Notice, Section 3.6(b) or Section 3.6(c)
above, as applicable, and any corresponding Title Defect Amounts, Title
Benefit Amounts and Environmental Defect Amounts on or before the Closing
Date. If Contributor and Acquiror are unable to agree in writing by the
Closing Date, then, subject to Section 3.7, the Title Defects, Title Benefits
and Environmental Defects reported pursuant to the Title Defect Notice,
Section 3.6(b) and Section 3.6(c), as applicable, and any corresponding Title
Defect Amounts, Title Benefit Amounts and Environmental Defect Amounts which
are then in dispute (each a "Disputed Matter") shall be exclusively and
finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to Section 3.11.

(d) At Closing, the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted by reducing
the Cash Purchase Price (i) in accordance with Section 3.8(a) with respect to
any Title Defects or Environmental Defects which (A) Contributor has not
elected to cure pursuant to Section 3.7(a) and (B) which are not Disputed
Matters and (ii) in accordance with Section 3.8(b) with respect to any Title
Benefits which are not Disputed Matters.

(e) At Closing:

(i) the Cash Closing Payment shall be reduced by an amount equal to seventy-
five percent (75%) of the Net Defect Amount (the "Defect Escrow Amount"). At
the Closing, Acquiror shall deposit the Defect Escrow Amount into an escrow
account established with the Escrow Agent (the "Defect Escrow Account"),
unless otherwise agreed by the Parties. The Acquiror and Contributor shall
agree on a mutually acceptable form of escrow agreement which shall govern the
Defect Escrow Account (the "Defect Escrow Agreement") with the Escrow Agent,
which shall contain terms and provisions consistent with this Section 3.8. The
Defect Escrow Amount shall be held and disbursed in accordance with the terms
of this Article 3 and the Defect Escrow Agreement pending the curing or
resolution of the applicable Title Defects, Environmental Defects or Title
Benefits; and

(ii) the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to
twenty-five percent (25%) of the Net Defect Amount (the "Defect Holdback
Amount").

(f) As used herein, "Final Defect Amount" means an amount equal to, after
giving effect to the limitations provided in Section 3.9, (i) the sum of the
Title Defect Amounts associated with (A) those Title Defects which Contributor
elected to cure pursuant to Section 3.7(a) which are not Disputed Matters and
which are not fully cured as provided in Section 3.7 (provided, however, if
curative efforts by Contributor mitigated an uncured Title Defect, the Title
Defect Amount associated with such Title Defect shall be adjusted pursuant to
Section 3.9(a) to take into account such curative efforts) and (B) any
Disputed Title Matters determined in favor of Acquiror by the applicable Title
Arbitrator under Section 3.11, less (ii) any offsetting Title Benefits which
are Disputed Title Matters and are determined in favor of Contributor by the
Title Arbitrator under



Section 3.11 plus (iii) the sum of the Environmental Defect Amounts associated
with (A) those Environmental Defects which Contributor elected to cure
pursuant to Section 3.7(a) which are not Disputed Matters and which are not
fully cured as provided in Section 3.7 (provided, however, if curative efforts
by Contributor mitigated an uncured Environmental Defect, the Environmental
Defect Amount associated with such Environmental Defect shall be adjusted
pursuant to Section 3.9(c) to take into account such curative efforts) and (B)
any Disputed Environmental Matters, determined in favor of Acquiror by the
applicable Environmental Arbitrator under Section 3.11.

(g) If the Final Defect Amount is less than or equal to the Defect Holdback
Amount (including if the Final Defect Amount is zero), then within ten (10)
Business Days after the latter of the Cure Date or the determination of all
Disputed Matters submitted to a Title Arbitrator or Environmental Arbitrator
pursuant to Section 3.11(a) or Section 3.11(b), as applicable, (i) the Parties
shall execute joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing it to
deliver to Contributor the entire Defect Escrow Amount and (ii) Acquiror shall
pay to Contributor a cash amount equal to (A) the Defect Holdback Amount minus
(B) the Final Defect Amount. The remainder of the Defect Holdback Amount (if
any) shall be retained by Acquiror. The Parties shall treat for Tax purposes,
any amounts paid pursuant to this Section 3.8(g) as an adjustment to the
Unadjusted Purchase Price.

(h) If the Final Defect Amount is greater than the Defect Holdback Amount,
then within ten (10) Business Days after the latter of the Cure Date or the
determination of all Disputed Matters submitted to a Title Arbitrator or
Environmental Arbitrator pursuant to Section 3.11(a) or Section 3.11(b), as
applicable, the Parties shall execute joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent instructing it to (i) deliver to Acquiror an amount equal to (A) the
Final Defect Amount minus (B) the Defect Holdback Amount and (ii) to deliver
to Contributor the remainder of the Defect Escrow Amount. The entirety of the
Defect Holdback Amount shall be retained by Acquiror. The Parties shall treat
for Tax purposes, any amounts paid pursuant to this Section 3.8(h) as an
adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price.

3.9 Calculation of Title Defect Amounts, Title Benefit Amounts and
Environmental Defect Amounts.

(a) The Title Defect Amount resulting from a Title Defect shall be determined
as follows:

(i) if Acquiror and Contributor agree in writing upon the Title Defect Amount,
then that amount shall be the Title Defect Amount;

(ii) if the Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge which secures
the payment of an undisputed liquidated amount, then the Title Defect Amount
shall be the amount necessary to be paid to unconditionally remove the Title
Defect from the Title Defect Property;

(iii) if the Title Defect solely represents a discrepancy between (A) the Net
Revenue Interest of the Company Group for any Well that is a Title Defect
Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest stated therefor on Exhibit B, and
there is no discrepancy with respect to



the Company Group's Working Interest in such Well and the Working Interest
stated therefor on Exhibit B, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the
product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the absolute amount of such Net Revenue
Interest decrease and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest
stated on Exhibit B for such Title Defect Property; provided, however, if the
Title Defect does not affect a Title Defect Property throughout its entire
productive life, the Title Defect Amount determined under this Section
3.9(a)(iii) shall be reduced to take into account the applicable time period
only;

(iv) if the Title Defect solely represents a discrepancy between (A) the Net
Acres of the Company Group for any Title Defect Property in any of the Target
Zones, and (B) the Net Acres stated therefor on Exhibit A, and there is no
discrepancy with respect to the Company Group's Net Revenue Interest in such
Title Defect Property and the Net Revenue Interest stated therefor on Exhibit
A, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of
such Title Defect Property with respect to the applicable Target Zone,
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the absolute value of the
Net Acre decrease and the denominator of which is the Net Acres stated on
Exhibit A for such Title Defect Property;

(v) if the Title Defect is not of the type described in clauses (i) through
(iv) above, the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account
the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property, the portion of the Title
Defect Property affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title
Defect, the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the
Title Defect Property, the values placed on such Title Defect by Contributor
and Acquiror and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a
proper evaluation;

(vi) if the Title Defect results from Net Acres and Net Revenue Interests of
the Company Group stated on Exhibit A not covering or including all Target
Zones set forth on Exhibit A, the Allocated Value attributable to such Defect
Title Property shall be reduced for each unincluded Target Zone (or portion
thereof) as set forth on Schedule 3.4;

(vii) if a Title Defect is reasonably capable of being cured, the Title Defect
Amount shall not be greater than the reasonable cost and expense of curing
such Title Defect;

(viii) the Title Defect Amount with respect to each Title Defect Property
shall be determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in
another Title Defect Amount hereunder; and

(ix) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement:

(A) an individual claim for a Title Defect asserted under the Title Defect
Notice shall only generate an adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price
under this Article 3 if the Title Defect Amount with respect to each Title
Defect Property affected thereby individually exceeds One Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($100,000) and then to the full extent;

(B) except for Title Defects of the type noted in Section 3.9(a)(ii), the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects upon any given Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such
Property; and



(C) there shall be no adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price for Title
Defects unless and until the aggregate of (w) all Title Defect Amounts which
would generate an adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to
Section 3.9(a)(ix)(A), less (x) all Title Benefit Amounts that would generate
an offset to Title Defect Amounts pursuant to Section 3.9(b)(vi), plus (y) all
Environmental Defect Amounts which would generate an adjustment to the
Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.9(c)(iv)(A), exceeds two
percent (2.0%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price, and then only to the extent
that such aggregate amount exceeds two percent (2.0%) of the Unadjusted
Purchase Price.

(b) The Title Benefit Amount resulting from a Title Benefit shall be
determined as follows:

(i) if Acquiror and Contributor agree in writing upon the Title Benefit
Amount, then that amount shall be the Title Benefit Amount;

(ii) if the Title Benefit solely results from (A) the Net Acres of the Company
Group for any Title Benefit Property in in any of the Target Zones, throughout
the productive life of the affected Lease being greater than (B) the Net Acres
stated therefor on Exhibit A, and there is no discrepancy with respect to the
Company Group's Net Revenue Interest in such Title Benefit Property and the
Net Revenue Interest stated therefor on Exhibit A, then the Title Benefit
Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Benefit
Property with respect to the applicable Target Zone, multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the amount of the Net Acres increase and the
denominator of which is the Net Acres stated on Exhibit A for such Title
Benefit Property;

(iii) if the Title Benefit solely results from (A) the Net Revenue Interest of
the Company Group for any Well that is a Title Benefit Property being greater
than (B) the Net Revenue Interest stated therefor on Exhibit B throughout the
duration of the productive life of the affected Well, and there is no
discrepancy with respect to the Company Group's Working Interest in such Well
and the Working Interest stated therefor on Exhibit B, then the Title Benefit
Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect
Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of
such Net Revenue Interest increase and the denominator of which is the Net
Revenue Interest stated on Exhibit B for such Title Benefit Property; and

(iv) if the Title Benefit is not of the type described in clauses (i) through
(iii) above, the Title Benefit Amount shall be determined by taking into
account the Allocated Value of the Title Benefit Property, the portion of the
Title Benefit Property affected by the Title Benefit, the legal effect of the
Title Benefit, the potential discounted economic effect of the Title Benefit
over the life of the Title Benefit Property, the values placed upon the Title
Benefit Property by Acquiror and Contributor and such other reasonable factors
as are necessary to make a proper evaluation;

(v) the Title Benefit Amount with respect to a Title Benefit shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Benefit Amount or adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price; and



(vi) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 3, an individual
claim for a Title Benefit shall only generate an offset to the amount by which
the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced on account of Title Defects
pursuant to Section 3.8(b) if the Title Benefit Amount with respect to each
Title Benefit Property affected thereby individually exceeds One Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($100,000) and then to the full extent.

(c) The Environmental Defect Amount resulting from an Environmental Defect
shall be determined as follows:

(i) if Acquiror and Contributor agree on the Environmental Defect Amount, that
amount shall be the Environmental Defect Amount;

(ii) the Environmental Defect Amount shall include the amount required to
Remediate the Environmental Defect or otherwise bring the affected Asset into
compliance with Environmental Laws in the most cost-effective manner
reasonably available;

(iii) the Environmental Defect Amount with respect to an Environmental Defect
shall be determined on an individual Asset-by-Asset basis without duplication
of any costs or losses included in another Environmental Defect Amount or
adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price; and

(iv) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 3:

(A) an individual claim for an Environmental Defect shall only generate an
adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price if the Environmental Defect Amount
with respect to each Environmental Defect Property affected thereby
individually exceeds One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) and then to the
full extent;

(B) there shall be no adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price for
Environmental Defects unless and until the aggregate of (w) all Title Defect
Amounts which would generate an adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 3.9(a)(ix)(A), less (x) all Title Benefit Amounts that
would generate an offset to Title Defect Amounts pursuant to Section
3.9(b)(vi), plus (y) all Environmental Defect Amounts which would generate an
adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.9(c)(iv)(A),
exceeds two percent (2.0%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price, and then only to
the extent that such aggregate amount exceeds two percent (2.0%) of the
Unadjusted Purchase Price; and

(v) if the Environmental Defect Amount with respect to any Environmental
Defect exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the Allocated Value of the Asset
affected thereby, either Party may, by written notice to the other Parties
prior to Closing, cause the affected Asset to be excluded from this Agreement,
in which case, such Asset shall become an Excluded Asset and shall be deemed
to be listed on Exhibit F and prior to Closing, Contributor shall have the
obligation to cause the Company Group to assign to Contributor or its
designees all of the Company Group's right, title and interest in and to, as
well as all of Company Group's responsibility and obligations for, such Asset
which are excluded pursuant to this Section 3.9(c)(v), and at Closing



the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be decreased by the Allocated Value of all
Properties excluded pursuant to this Section 3.9(c)(v).

3.10 Casualty Loss .

(a) Prior to Closing, if any portion of an Asset is destroyed by fire,
explosion or other casualty or if a portion of an Asset is taken or threatened
to be taken in condemnation or under the right of eminent domain ("Casualty
Loss"), and the Net Casualty Loss exceeds Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($500,000.00), at the option of Acquiror (a) such Asset shall be excluded from
this Agreement and the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
Allocated Value of the Asset, or if there is no Allocated Value, the fair
market value and such Asset shall thereafter be treated as an Excluded Asset
or (b) the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by the estimated cost to
repair such Asset (with equipment of similar utility), which amount shall not
exceed the Allocated Value of the Asset (this adjustment to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price, whether from excluding the Asset or agreement upon an
appropriated adjustment, is herein called the "Net Casualty Loss") and
Contributor shall retain all insurance proceeds and all claims against third
parties with respect to the Casualty Loss. Contributor, upon consent of
Acquiror, may elect to cure such Casualty Loss to the reasonable satisfaction
of Acquiror. If Contributor elects to cure such Casualty Loss, Contributor may
replace any personal property that is the subject of a Casualty Loss with
equipment of similar grade and utility, or replace any real property with real
property of similar nature and kind if such real property is acceptable to
Acquiror in its sole discretion. If Contributor elects to cure the Casualty
Loss and does in fact cure the Casualty Loss to the reasonable satisfaction of
Acquiror, the affected Asset shall be included in the Assets and transferred
to Acquiror at the Closing with no adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase
Price. Nothing in this Section 3.10 abrogates Contributor's obligations or
Acquiror's rights under Article 8 or Section 7.2.

(b) Prior to Closing, if any portion of an Asset is affected by a Casualty
Loss, and the Net Casualty Loss is equal to or less than Five Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($500,000.00), then Acquiror shall nevertheless be required to close.
In such event, Contributor, at the Closing, shall pay to Acquiror all sums
paid to Contributor by non-Affiliate third Persons by reason of such Casualty
Loss insofar as with respect to the Assets. Contributor shall also assign,
transfer and set over to Acquiror or subrogate Acquiror to all of
Contributor's right, title and interest (if any) in insurance claims, unpaid
awards and other rights against non-Affiliate third Persons (excluding any
Damages, other than insurance claims, of or against any member of the
Contributor Group) arising out of such Casualty Loss insofar as with respect
to the Assets. Contributor shall reserve and retain (and Acquiror shall assign
to Contributor) all rights, title, interests and claims against third Persons
who are not Affiliates of Contributor for the recovery of Contributor's costs
and expenses incurred prior to the Closing in pursuing or asserting any such
insurance claims or other rights against such third Persons with respect to
any such Casualty Loss.

3.11 Dispute Resolution.

(a) Except as provided in Section 3.7(c), with respect to any Disputed Matter
concerning Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts and Title
Benefit Amounts ("Disputed Title Matters"), on or before a date that is ten
(10) Business Days following the Closing Date, Contributor shall submit all
remaining Disputed Title Matters to a title attorney with at least ten



(10) years' experience in oil and gas titles in the state of Texas, as
selected by mutual written agreement of Acquiror and Contributor (the "Title
Arbitrator"). If Acquiror and Contributor have not agreed upon a Person to
serve as Title Arbitrator during such ten (10) Business Day period,
Contributor shall, within ten (10) Business Days after the end of such initial
ten (10) Business Day period, formally apply to the Houston, Texas office of
the American Arbitration Association to choose the Title Arbitrator. The Title
Arbitrator shall not have worked as an employee or outside counsel for any
Party or its Affiliates during the five (5) year period preceding the
arbitration or have any financial interest in the dispute (other than the
payment of its fees as provided in this Agreement). If Contributor has not
submitted such Disputed Title Matters to the Title Arbitrator or the Houston,
Texas office of the American Arbitration Association, as applicable, within
the relevant time period set forth above (or, with respect to Disputed Title
Matters concerning Title Defects Contributor has elected to cure pursuant to
Section 3.7(a), the date set forth in Section 3.7(c)), Contributor shall be
deemed to have waived its dispute of such Disputed Title Matters.

(b) Except as provided in Section 3.7(c), with respect to any Disputed Matter
concerning Environmental Defects and Environmental Defect Amounts ("Disputed
Environmental Matters"), on or before a date that is ten (10) Business Days
following the Closing Date, Contributor shall submit all remaining Disputed
Environmental Matters to a reputable environmental consultant or engineer with
at least ten (10) years' experience in corrective environmental action
regarding oil and gas properties in the state of Texas, as selected by mutual
agreement of Acquiror and Contributor (the "Environmental Arbitrator"). If
Acquiror and Contributor have not agreed upon a Person to serve as
Environmental Arbitrator during such ten (10) Business Day period, Contributor
shall, within ten (10) Business Days after the end of such initial ten (10)
Business Day period, formally apply to the Houston, Texas office of the
American Arbitration Association to choose the Environmental Arbitrator. The
Environmental Arbitrator shall not have worked as an employee, consultant, or
outside counsel for any Party or its Affiliates during the five (5) year
period preceding the arbitration or have any financial interest in the dispute
(other than the payment of its fees as provided in this Agreement). If
Contributor has not submitted such Disputed Environmental Matters to the
Environmental Arbitrator or the Houston, Texas office of the American
Arbitration Association, as applicable, within the relevant time period set
forth above (or, with respect to Disputed Environmental Matters concerning
Environmental Defects Contributor has elected to attempt to cure pursuant to
Section 3.7(a), the date set forth in Section 3.7(c)), Contributor shall be
deemed to have waived its dispute of such Disputed Environmental Matters.

(c) The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Houston, Texas and shall be
conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the
terms of this Section 3.11. The Title Arbitrator's or Environmental
Arbitrator's determination shall be made within forty-five (45) days after
submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon the
Parties, without right of appeal. In making its determination, the Title
Arbitrator or Environmental Arbitrator, as applicable, shall be bound by the
provisions of this Article 3 and may consider such other matters as in the
opinion of the Title Arbitrator or Environmental Arbitrator, as applicable are
necessary or helpful to make a proper determination. The Title Arbitrator and
Environmental Arbitrator may consult with and engage disinterested third
Persons to advise the arbitrator, including petroleum engineers. The Title
Arbitrator or Environmental Arbitrator, as applicable, is only authorized to
rule



in favor of Contributor or Acquiror with respect to each Disputed Matter. The
Title Arbitrator or Environmental Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the
limited purpose of determining the specific Disputed Matter, as applicable,
submitted by any Party and may not award damages, interest, or penalties to
any Party with respect to any matter. Contributor and Acquiror shall each bear
their own legal fees and other costs of presenting their respective cases.
Acquiror and Contributor shall each bear one-half of the costs and expenses of
the Title Arbitrator and Environmental Arbitrator.

3.12 Notice to Holders of Consents and Preferential Purchase Rights. Within
three (3) Business Days after the Execution Date, Contributor shall prepare
and send (a) notices to the holders of any consents to assignment that are set
forth on Schedule 4.7 requesting consents to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (b) notices to the holders of any preferential purchase
rights, rights of first offer, rights of first refusal or similar rights
applicable to any of the Assets that are required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (each, a "Preferential Purchase
Right") that are set forth on Schedule 4.7 in compliance with the terms of
such rights and requesting waivers of such rights. Acquiror shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Contributor in seeking to
obtain such consents, approvals, permissions, and waivers. Contributor shall
not be obligated to make any payments or incur any liabilities in connection
with obtaining such consents or such waivers.

3.13 Preferential Purchase Rights.

(a) Any Preferential Purchase Right must be exercised subject to all terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, including the successful Closing of
this Agreement pursuant to Article 8 on the dates certain set forth herein.
The consideration payable under this Agreement for any particular Asset for
purposes of Preferential Purchase Right notices shall be the Allocated Value
for such Asset, adjusted as set forth in this Agreement.

(b) If any Preferential Purchase Right to purchase any Asset is validly
exercised, whether validly or otherwise, prior to Closing, (i) Contributor
shall have the right to cause the Company Group to convey such Asset to the
exercising party prior to or simultaneously with the Closing on the terms and
provisions set out in the applicable Preferential Purchase Right provision and
there shall be an adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price on account
thereof for the consideration received or to be received by Contributor and
the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be further adjusted if the purchase price
received for such Asset is less than the Allocated Value for the Asset as
provided in Section 3.4 and (ii) if such Asset is not conveyed prior to or
simultaneously with the Closing through no fault or lack of timely performance
by the Contributor or Company Group, Acquiror shall cause the Company Group to
convey such Asset to the exercising party after the Closing on the terms and
provisions set out in the applicable Preferential Purchase Right provision and
shall be entitled to the consideration paid by such holder; provided that in
addition, if the Asset is transferred pursuant to the Preferential Purchase
Right after Closing because of the Contributor's or Company Group's fault or
lack of timely performance, Acquiror shall be entitled to receive from the
Contributor notwithstanding anything in Article 11 to the contrary, the amount
by which the Allocated Value for such Asset exceeds the purchase price
received by the Acquiror; provided, further, the Contributor shall reimburse
the Acquiror for any Income Tax, Transfer Tax and/or Asset Tax incurred as a
result of the conveyance.



(c) Should a third Person fail to exercise or waive its Preferential Purchase
Right to purchase as to any portion of the Assets prior to Closing, and the
time for exercise or waiver has not yet expired by Closing or the validity of
the exercise is being contested by Contributor or Acquiror, then there shall
be no adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price on account thereof and, if
Closing occurs, Acquiror shall then cause the Company Group to comply with the
terms and provisions set out in the applicable Preferential Purchase Right
provision and shall be entitled to the consideration paid by such holder.

3.14 Limitations on Applicability. Subject to the rights of Acquiror pursuant
to this Article 3 and under (or with respect to) Article 4, Article 6, Article
11, under the certificate to be delivered by Contributor at Closing pursuant
to Section 8.2(c), and pursuant to the Defect Escrow Agreement, Acquiror's

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF CONTRIBUTOR

through 4.29.

4.1 Contributor; No Conflicts.

(a) Contributor is a limited liability company duly organized, validly
existing, and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Sabalo
Energy is a corporation duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing
under the laws of the State of Delaware. Contributor is qualified to conduct
business in each state in which the business it is conducting, or the
operation, ownership or leasing of its properties, makes such qualification
necessary, other than where the failure to so qualify or be in good standing
has not had and would not be reasonably expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Group Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Contributor has the power and authority to enter into and perform its
obligations under this Agreement and each other Transaction Agreement to which
it is party and to consummate the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and such other Transaction Agreements.

(c) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement (and each other
Transaction Agreement to which Contributor is a party), and the consummation
of the Transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, have been duly and
validly authorized by all necessary action on the part of Contributor. No vote
or consent of the holders of any Interests in Contributor that has not been
affirmatively taken or obtained is required under the limited liability
company agreement of Contributor or the Delaware LLC Act for the execution,
delivery or performance by Contributor of this Agreement or the consummation
of the Transactions contemplated hereby, and the holders



of the Interests of the Contributor have agreed to not withdraw their approval
of the Transactions and this Agreement. The Board of Managers of Contributor,
in accordance with its limited liability company agreement and the Delaware
LLC Act, has approved the Transactions and this Agreement. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by Contributor and constitutes, and each
other agreement, instrument or document executed or to be executed by
Contributor in connection with the Transactions has been, or when executed
will be, duly executed and delivered by Contributor and constitutes, or when
executed and delivered will constitute, a valid and legally binding obligation
of Contributor enforceable against Contributor in accordance with its
respective terms, except that such enforceability may be limited by (i)
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws
affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) equitable principles which may
limit the availability of certain equitable remedies (such as specific
performance) in certain instances.

(d) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Contributor,
and the consummation of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, do
not and will not (%4) violate any provision of the Organizational Documents of
any Contributor Group Member or any Company Group Member, (%4) result in a
breach of or default (with due notice or lapse of time or both) or the
creation of any lien or encumbrance or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation, or acceleration under any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, or
other financing instrument or any Contract or other contract or agreement to
which any Contributor Group Member or any Company Group Member is a party or
by which any of them is bound or to which any of their assets or properties is
subject, (%4) violate any judgment, order, ruling, or decree applicable to any
Contributor Group Member or any Company Group Member as a party in interest,
or (%4) violate any Laws applicable to any Contributor Group Member or any
Company Group Member, except in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) for
those items which, individually or in the aggregate, would not prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the ability of the parties to
consummation the Transactions.

(e) There are no bankruptcy, reorganization, or receivership proceedings
pending, being contemplated by, or, to the knowledge of Contributor,

entering into this Agreement with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud
any creditor. Immediately prior to, and immediately subsequent to, the
Closing, (i) Contributor will not have incurred, nor does it intend to or
believe that it will incur, debts (including contingent obligations) beyond
its ability to pay such debts as such debts mature or come due (taking into
account the timing and amounts of cash to be received from any source, and
amounts to be payable on or in respect of debts), (ii) the amount of cash
available to Contributor after taking into account all other anticipated uses
of funds will be sufficient to pay all such amounts on or in respect of debts,
when such amounts are required to be paid, and (iii) Contributor will have
sufficient capital with which to conduct its business.

(f) Each of Contributor and Sabalo Energy is the record and beneficial owner
of, and have good and valid title to, the Company Group Interests set forth
opposite such entity's name on Schedule 4.1 (which constitute all of the
issued and outstanding Interests in the Company



Group), free and clear of all Encumbrances, other than restrictions on
transfer that may be imposed by state or federal securities Laws or the
Organizational Documents of the Company Group. At the Closing, the delivery by
Contributor to Acquiror of the Assignment Agreement will vest Acquiror with
good and valid title to all of the Company Group Interests free and clear of
all Encumbrances, other than restrictions on transfer that may be imposed by
state or federal securities Laws or the Organizational Documents of the
Company Group and Encumbrances arising exclusively by, through or under
Acquiror or its Affiliates.

168(g)(1)(D) of the Code;

Tax Periods (in the case of Income Taxes) and Pre-Effective Date Periods (in
the case of all Asset Taxes and Other Taxes).

matters, and except as disclosed on Schedule 4.4, (a) the Company Group and

4.5 Contracts. Schedule 4.5 lists all Material Contracts as of the Execution
Date. Neither the Company Group, nor, to the knowledge of Contributor, any
other Person, is in default under such Material Contract, or, with the passage

proceeds from the sale thereof, attributable to the Company Group's interest
in the Properties at some future time without receiving payment therefor at or
after the time of delivery. Schedule 4.6 lists all production, transportation,
plant, or other imbalances with respect to production from the Properties. No
imbalance constitutes all of the Company Group's (or its Affiliate's) share of

Group has not elected not to participate in any operation or activity proposed
with respect to the Properties which could result in any of the Company

or activity. Schedule 4.10 contains a complete and accurate list of the status

Hazardous Materials at, on, under or from the Assets or operations thereof

operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted,

expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Group Material
Adverse Effect.

Acquiror's approval of any action restricted by this Section 6.4 shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed and shall be considered granted in full
within five (5) Business Days of Contributor's notice to Acquiror in
accordance with this Section 6.4 requesting such consent, unless Acquiror
notifies Contributor to the contrary during that period. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 6.4, in the event of an emergency,
Contributor may take such action as reasonably necessary and shall notify
Acquiror of such action promptly thereafter. Acquiror acknowledges that each
Company Group Member may own undivided interests in certain of the Assets, and
Acquiror agrees that the acts or omissions of third Persons (including any
applicable operator) who are not affiliated with Contributor shall not
constitute a violation of the provisions of this Section 6.4, nor shall any
action required by a vote of Working Interest owners constitute such a
violation so long as each Company Group Member (and any applicable Affiliate)
has voted its interests in a manner consistent with the provisions of this
Section 6.4.

6.5 Indemnity Regarding Access. Acquiror's access to the Assets and its (and
its Affiliates' and representatives') examinations and inspections, pursuant
to this Agreement or otherwise, shall be at Acquiror's sole risk, cost, and
expense, and Acquiror WAIVES AND RELEASES ALL CLAIMS AGAINST CONTRIBUTOR, ITS
AFFILIATES, AND ITS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE PARTNERS, MEMBERS, OFFICERS,
DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, ATTORNEYS, CONTRACTORS, AGENTS, OR OTHER
REPRESENTATIVES, ARISING IN ANY WAY THEREFROM, OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED
THEREWITH, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT ARISING FROM, OR RELATING TO, THE GROSS
NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY SUCH PERSON. Acquiror agrees to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Contributor and its Affiliates, the other
owners of interests in the Properties, and all such Persons' directors,
officers, employees, agents, and representatives from and against any and all
claims, liabilities, losses, costs, and expenses (including court costs and
reasonable attorneys' fees), including claims, liabilities, losses, costs, and
expenses attributable to personal injury, death, or property damage, directly
arising out of access to the Assets prior to the Closing by Acquiror, its
Affiliates, or its or their respective



directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives, EVEN IF CAUSED IN
WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT), STRICT
LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PERSON, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT
ARISING FROM, OR RELATING TO THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY
SUCH PERSON.

6.6 Enforcement of Third Party Provisions. To the extent pertaining to the
Company Group, the Company Group Interests or the Assets and the period of
time from and after the Effective Date, Contributor shall, at Acquiror
Parties' request, use reasonable efforts to cause the Company Group to
enforce, for the benefit of Acquiror Parties, at Acquiror Parties' cost and
expense, all of Company Group's rights against third Persons under any
warranties, guarantees, or indemnities given by such third Persons.

(a) Contributor and the Acquiror Parties shall each in a timely manner (i)
make (or cause their applicable Affiliates to make) all required filings, and
prepare applications to, and conduct negotiations with, obtain consents,
approvals or actions of, and give all notices to each Governmental Authority
or any other Person as to which such filings, applications, negotiations,
consents, approvals, actions or notices are necessary or appropriate in the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) provide such
information as the other may reasonably request in order to make such filings,

Authority with respect to such filings, applications, or negotiations, or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, it shall give the other Party
reasonable prior notice of, and an opportunity to participate in, such meeting
or discussion. Acquiror shall bear one-half and Contributor shall bear one-
half of the cost of all filing or application fees payable to any Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
regardless of whether Acquiror, Contributor, or any Affiliate of any of them
is required to make the payment. Each Party shall provide prompt notice to the
other Party when any such filings, application, negotiation, consent,
approval, action or notice referred to above in this Section 6.7(a) is
obtained, taken, made or given, as applicable, and will advise such other
Party of any communications (and, unless precluded by Law, provide copies of
any such written communications) with any Governmental Authority or other
Person relating therewith.

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.7(a), as soon as practicable
following the date of this Agreement and in any event within fifteen (15)
Business Days after the date hereof, the Parties shall make such filings as

including requests for additional information concerning such transactions, so
that the waiting period specified in the HSR Act will expire or be terminated
as soon as reasonably possible after the date of this Agreement. Each Party
shall cause its counsel to furnish each of the other Parties such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as such other Parties may reasonably
request in connection with the Parties' preparation of necessary filings or
submissions under the provisions of the HSR Act.

their Affiliates and their respective agents and representatives in connection
with compliance with Acquiror Parties' and their Affiliates' Tax, financial,
or other reporting requirements and audits, including (%4) any filings with
any Governmental Authority and (%4) any filings that may be required by the
Commission, under securities Laws applicable to the Acquiror Parties and their
Affiliates, including the filing by the Acquiror Parties with the Commission
of one or more registration statements to register any securities of the
Acquiror Parties under the Securities Act, or of any report required to be

"Securities Laws") (any such filings described in clause (ii), the "Filings").
Further, from and after the Execution Date, Contributor shall, and shall use
their reasonable efforts to cause their Affiliates to, make available to the
Acquiror Parties and their Affiliates and their agents and representatives any
and all books, records, information and documents that are attributable to the
Company Group, the Assets or the Shad Assets in Contributor's or its
Affiliates' possession or control reasonably required by the Acquiror Parties,
their Affiliates and their agents and representatives, in order for the
Acquiror Parties or their Affiliates to prepare, if required to comply with
the requirements of the Securities Laws in connection with such Filings,
financial statements relating to the Company Group meeting the requirements of
Regulation S-X under the Securities Act.

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.8(a), from and after the
Execution Date, Contributor shall, and shall use its reasonable efforts to
cause its Affiliates to, cooperate on a timely basis with the independent

with any audit by Acquiror's Auditor of any financial statements of the
Company Group that the Acquiror Parties or any of their Affiliates require to
comply with the requirements of the Securities Laws. Such cooperation will
include (i) reasonable access to Contributor Group's and the Company Group's
officers, managers, employees, agents and representatives who were responsible
for preparing or maintaining the financial records and work papers and other
supporting documents used in the preparation of such financial statements as
may be required by Acquiror's Auditor to perform an audit or conduct a review
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards or to otherwise
verify such financial statements, (ii) delivery of one or more customary
representation letters from Contributor Group or the Company Group to
Acquiror's Auditor that are reasonably requested by the Acquiror Parties to
allow such auditors to complete an audit (or review of any financial
statements) and to issue an opinion with respect to an audit of those
financial statements required pursuant to this Section 6.8(b), (iii) using



reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of the independent auditor(s) of the
Company Group that conducted any audit of such financial statements to be
named as an expert in any Filing or offering memorandum for any equity or debt
financing of the Acquiror Parties, and (iv) using reasonable efforts to cause
the independent auditor(s) of the Company Group that conducted any audit of
such financial statements to provide customary "comfort letters" to any
underwriter or purchaser in connection with any equity or debt financing of
the Acquiror Parties. Promptly upon the Contributor's request, all reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by Contributor or its Affiliates
in connection with complying with the provisions of Section 6.8(a) and this
Section 6.8(b) shall be paid by Acquiror Parent. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing herein shall expand Contributor's representations,
warranties, covenants, or agreements set forth in this Agreement or give the
Acquiror Parties, their Affiliates, or any third Person any rights to which it
is not entitled hereunder.

Agreement to complete the Transactions;

(b) repurchase or otherwise acquire any shares of its capital stock for less
than fair market value (other than (i) the repurchase, redemption or other

to any director or employee equity subscription agreement or plan, stock
option agreement or similar agreement or plan, (ii) in connection with the
exercise of stock options or stock appreciation rights by way of cashless

Parent shall issue the Unit Purchase Price and Class B Common Stock,
respectively, issuable pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with all
applicable securities Laws and the rules and policies of the NYSE. Without

reasonably necessary for the Class A Common Stock to be issued upon the
exchange of the Acquiror Units comprising the Unit Purchase Price to be
accepted by the NYSE for issuance and approved for listing thereon from and
after the time of Closing, subject to official notice of issuance. If Acquiror
Parent applies to have its Class A Common Stock or other securities traded on
any principal stock exchange or market other than the NYSE, it shall include
in such application the Class A Common Stock to be issued upon the exchange of
the Acquiror Units comprising the Unit Purchase Price and will take such other
action as is necessary to cause such Class A Common Stock to be issued upon
the exchange of the Acquiror Units comprising the Unit Purchase Price to be so

provisions contained in Schedule 6.11 attached hereto.

Statement cleared for use under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable
after such filing. Acquiror Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Acquiror Parent Stockholders as
promptly as practicable after the clearance is received from the Commission.
If at any time prior to the Closing Date any information relating to the
Acquiror Group or the Contributor Group, or any of their respective
Affiliates, directors or officers, is discovered by any Party that should be
set forth in an amendment or



supplement to the Proxy Statement so that it would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other Parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the
Commission and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the
Acquiror Parent Stockholders. Acquiror Parent shall notify Contributor of the
receipt of any comments from the Commission and of any request by the
Commission for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for
additional information.

duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of the Acquiror
Parent Stockholders (the "Stockholders Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining
the Stockholder Approval and (ii) through the Acquiror Parent Board or the
Special Committee, as applicable, recommend to the Acquiror Parent
Stockholders (A) the adoption of the AandR Certificate of Incorporation; and (B)
the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Transactions
(collectively, the "Acquiror Parent Board Recommendation"). The Proxy
Statement shall include a copy of the Fairness Opinion and (subject to Section

Contributor, other than (A) to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of
obtaining the Stockholder Approval, (B) for the absence of quorum or (C) to
allow reasonable additional time for the filing and/or mailing of any
supplemental or amended disclosure that Acquiror Parent has determined after
consultation with outside legal counsel is necessary under applicable Law and
for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by
the Acquiror Parent Stockholders prior to the Stockholders Meeting. Without
limiting the foregoing, Acquiror Parent agrees that its obligation to hold the
Stockholder Meeting shall not be affected unless and until this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with Section 10.1(b)(iii).

6.17 Non-Compete .

(a) As a material inducement to Acquiror Parties to enter into this Agreement,
from the Closing Date until the six (6) month anniversary of the Closing Date,
Contributor covenants and agrees that it will, and will cause its Affiliates

Group and the Company Group) and the Persons set forth on Schedule 6.17
(collectively, the "Restricted Persons") to, refrain from partially or fully
acquiring for its own account or for any Third Party (other than the
Acquiror), any interest in any Restricted Opportunity within the Designated
Area, excluding, however, the Excluded Assets (subject to such exclusion,
collectively, the "Non-Compete Assets"). Notwithstanding any provision of this
Section 6.17 to the contrary, this Section 6.17 shall not apply to, limit or
restrict in any way, any direct or indirect investment made by any Restricted
Person (i) in any debt or equity securities of any Person (including without
limitation any options, warrants or derivatives relating thereto) listed on a
national securities exchange or actively trading in the public over-the-
counter market to the extent such investment constitutes a passive investment,
(ii) in any non-convertible debt (including without limitation any options,
warrants or derivatives relating thereto) of any Person listed on a national
securities



exchange or actively traded in the public over-the-counter market, or (iii)
the acquisition of any Restricted Opportunity by descent or devise.

(b) As used herein "Restricted Opportunity" means any opportunity for the
leasing, acquisition, farm-in, exploration, development, production, or any
combination of the foregoing, of oil, gas or other Hydrocarbon leases in the
Designated Area. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Restricted Opportunity shall
not include any transaction where the assets involved that are located in the
Designated Area include (i) less than fifteen percent (15%) of the assets
involved (either as to the number of acres or wells subject thereto or the
value of such assets) in the transaction, and any assets in the area described
above that are acquired as described in this provision shall be exempted from
the restrictions in this Section 6.17 or (ii) any overriding royalty
interests, non-participating royalty interests, or any mineral fee interests
in Hydrocarbons, including rights to royalties on production and rights to
shut-in royalties, executive rights to lease, rights to produce, rights to
delay rentals, rights to bonus payments, rights of reversion and any and all
other rights relating to the ownership of mineral fee interests (collectively,
"Designated Area Mineral Interests") to the extent, and only to the extent,
such Designated Area Mineral Interests (A) are offered to any of the

Closing Date) to be acquired by any Restricted Person after the Closing Date
and Acquiror Parties have received written notice of such contemplated
acquisition from Contributor prior to or on the Closing Date.

(c) To the extent Contributor breaches this Section 6.17, as the Acquiror
Parties' sole and exclusive remedy for such breach, Contributor shall be
obligated to, or to cause the applicable Restricted Person to, immediately
offer to Acquiror any acquired Non-Compete Assets, and Acquiror shall have the
right, but not the obligation, to acquire such Non-Compete Assets under the
same terms and conditions as agreed to by such Restricted Person, and for the
same consideration paid by such Restricted Person, together with any out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by such Restricted Person in acquiring such Non-
Compete Asset. Upon receipt of Acquiror's wire transfer of such amount,
Contributor shall cause such Restricted Person to assign to Acquiror such Non-
Compete Assets, pursuant to an assignment and bill of sale in a form to be
mutually agreed upon between Acquiror and such Restricted Person.

6.18 No Solicitation by Acquiror Parent; Etc.

(a) Except as otherwise permitted by this Section 6.18, (i) Acquiror Parent
shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any discussion or negotiation with any Person (other than

Alternative Proposal (or any inquiry, discussions, negotiations, offer or
request that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative Proposal),
demand that any Person (other than Contributor and its Representatives) or
Representative in possession of confidential information return or destroy
such information, and prohibit access by any Person (other than Contributor

proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative
Proposal), and (ii) Acquiror Parent shall not, and shall cause its
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly: (A) solicit, initiate,

exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement relating to an
Alternative Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Alternative Proposal (an "Acquisition Agreement"), or
(C) withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withhold,
withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Contributor, the Acquiror
Parent Board Recommendation or publicly recommend the approval or adoption of,
or approve or adopt, or propose to publicly recommend, approve or adopt, any
Alternative Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that
any violation of the foregoing restrictions by Acquiror Parent's
Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.18 by
Acquiror Parent.

has received a written Alternative Proposal that the Special Committee

consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, determines
in good faith that failure to consider such Alternative Proposal likely would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (iv) such
Alternative Proposal did not result from a breach of this Section 6.18, then
Acquiror Parent may (A) furnish information, including confidential
information, with respect to Acquiror Parent and Acquiror to the Person making
such Alternative Proposal, and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations
regarding such Alternative Proposal; provided that Acquiror Parent (x) will
not, and will use reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives not to,
disclose any non-public information to such Person unless Acquiror Parent has,
or first enters into, a confidentiality agreement with such Person with
confidentiality and standstill provisions and (y) will promptly make available
to Contributor any material non-public information provided to such Person if
not previously made available to Contributor.

(c) In addition to the other obligations of Acquiror Parent set forth in this
Section 6.18, Acquiror Parent shall promptly advise Contributor, orally and in
writing, and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt, if
any proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact is received by, any information
is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be
initiated with, Acquiror Parent in respect of any Alternative Proposal, and
shall, in any such notice to Contributor, indicate the identity of the Person
making such proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact and the terms and
conditions of any proposals or offers or the nature of any inquiries or
contacts (and shall include with such notice copies of any written materials
received from or on behalf of such Person relating to such proposal, offer,
inquiry or request), and thereafter shall promptly keep Contributor informed
of all material developments affecting the status and terms of any such
proposals, offers, inquiries or requests (and Acquiror Parent shall promptly
provide Contributor with copies of any additional written materials received
by Acquiror Parent or that Acquiror Parent has delivered to any third party
making an Alternative Proposal that relate to such proposals, offers,
inquiries or requests) and of the status of any such discussions or
negotiations.



(d) Except as permitted by Section 6.18(e), Acquiror Parent Board, including

Recommendation;

(ii) fail to include the Acquiror Parent Board Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement to be prepared pursuant to Section 6.16; or

Acquisition Agreement (other than any confidentiality agreement in accordance
with Section 6.18(b)) (any action referred to in clauses (i) through (iii) of
this Section 6.18(d), an "Acquiror Parent Change of Recommendation").

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.18 to the contrary, prior to,
but not after obtaining the Stockholder Approval, in response to an Acquiror
Intervening Event or Superior Proposal, either or both of the Acquiror Parent
Board or the Special Committee may make an Acquiror Parent Change of
Recommendation; provided, however, that such an Acquiror Parent Change of
Recommendation may not be made unless and until:

(i) Acquiror Parent Board or the Special Committee determines in good faith
after consultation with its outside counsel and its financial advisors, that
an Acquiror Parent Intervening Event has occurred or that an Alternative
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal;

(ii) Acquiror Parent Board or the Special Committee determines in good faith
after consultation with its outside counsel and its financial advisors, that
the failure to effect an Acquiror Parent Change of Recommendation in response
to such Acquiror Parent Intervening Event or a Superior Proposal likely would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

(iii) Acquiror Parent provides Contributor written notice of such proposed
action and specifying in reasonable detail the reasons for making the Acquiror
Parent Change of Recommendation (including, in the case of a Superior
Proposal, a description of the material terms of such Superior Proposal, and
in the case of an Acquiror Parent Intervening Event, a description of the
material events giving rise to the Acquiror Parent Intervening Event) at least
five (5) Business Days in advance;

(iv) after giving such notice and prior to effecting such Acquiror Parent
Change of Recommendation, Acquiror Parent negotiates (and causes its officers,
employees, financial advisor and outside legal counsel to negotiate) in good
faith with Contributor (to the extent Contributor wishes to negotiate) to make
such adjustments or revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so
that the failure to effect such Acquiror Parent Change of Recommendation would
not be inconsistent with the Acquiror Parent Board's and/or the Special
Committee's (as the



case may be) fiduciary duties; provided, however, that any material amendment
to the terms of a Superior Proposal, if applicable, shall require a new notice
pursuant to this Section 6.18(e); and

(v) at the end of the five (5) Business Day period, prior to taking action to
effect an Acquiror Parent Change of Recommendation, Acquiror Parent Board
takes into account any adjustments or revisions to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Contributor in writing and any other information offered by
Contributor in response to the notice, and determines in good faith after
consultation with its with outside legal counsel and its financial advisors,
that the failure to effect an Acquiror Parent Change of Recommendation in
response to such Acquiror Parent Intervening Event or a Superior Proposal
likely would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
provided, that in the event of any material changes regarding any Acquiror
Parent Intervening Event or Superior Proposal, Acquiror Parent shall be
required to deliver a new written notice to Contributor and to comply with the
requirements of this Section 6.18(e)(v) with respect to such new written
notice; provided, further, that any such new written notice shall in no event
shorten the original five (5) Business Day notice period.

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Acquiror Parent Board
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) from making such
disclosures as the Acquiror Parent Board determines in good faith are
necessary to comply with Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act or
other applicable Securities Laws; provided that if such disclosure has the
effect of withdrawing or adversely modifying the Acquiror Parent Board
Recommendation, such disclosure shall be deemed to be an Acquiror Parent
Change of Recommendation.

Contributor shall deliver a Suspense Funds schedule to the Acquiror Parties to
reflect the Suspense Funds as of the Closing Date. From and after the Closing,
Acquiror Parties agree to cause the Company to administer all accounts and
assume all payment obligations relating to the Suspense Funds taken into
account when calculating the Adjusted Purchase Price in accordance with all
applicable Laws, rules and regulations and shall be liable for the payment
thereof to the proper parties. To the extent available, Contributor shall
provide to Acquiror Parties detailed information with respect to (a) payees of
such Suspense Funds, (b) the reason for payment of such Suspense Funds and (c)
the time period during which such Suspense Funds accrued.

cause some or all of the Basis Hedging Transactions included in the Basis
Hedging Portfolio and outstanding at Closing to be transferred by novation
from the Company Group Members to Acquiror effective as of the Closing Date,
pursuant to an agreement substantially in the form of the Novation Agreement

settlement statement (the "Preliminary Settlement Statement") setting forth
(i) Contributor's good faith estimate of the Adjusted Purchase Price for the
Company Group Interests as of the Closing Date after giving effect to all
adjustments set forth in Section 2.2; (ii) the amount of the cash portion of
the Adjusted Purchase Price less: the Defect Escrow Amount, which shall
constitute the dollar amount to be payable by Acquiror to Contributor at
Closing (the "Cash Closing Payment"), along with the wiring instructions for
all such payments and disbursements; and (iii) the Persons, who shall consist
only of Persons who own, directly or indirectly through ownership of Interests
in one or more other Persons, Interests in Contributor (such persons, the
"Contributor Designees"), and whole number of Acquiror Units that Contributor
designates and nominates to receive the Unit Purchase Price (the "Unit Closing
Payment"). Contributor shall supply to Acquiror reasonable documentation in
the possession of Contributor Group or any of their Affiliates to support the
items for which adjustments are proposed or made in the Preliminary Settlement
Statement delivered by Contributor and a reasonably detailed explanation of
any such adjustments and the reasons therefor. Within three (3) Business Days
after receipt of Contributor's draft Preliminary Settlement Statement,
Acquiror will deliver to Contributor a written report containing all changes
that Acquiror proposes to be made to the Preliminary Settlement Statement, if
any, together with a brief explanation of any such changes. The Preliminary
Settlement Statement, as agreed upon in writing by the Parties (subject to
further adjustments under Section 8.4(b), will be used to adjust the
Unadjusted Purchase Price at Closing; provided that if the Parties cannot
agree on all adjustments set forth in the Preliminary Settlement Statement
prior to the Closing, then any adjustments as set forth in the Preliminary
Settlement Statement as presented by Contributor will be used to adjust the
Unadjusted Purchase Price at Closing, subject to Section 8.4(b).

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing but not later than the
one hundred and twentieth (120th) day following the Closing Date, Contributor
shall prepare and deliver to Acquiror a draft statement setting forth the
final calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price and showing the calculation
of each adjustment under Section 2.2, based on the most recent actual figures
for each adjustment; provided, however, that for purposes of making such final
calculation, the adjustment amount made pursuant to Section 2.2(b)(x) shall be
assumed to be in the same amount as the amount used for such adjustments in
calculating the Adjusted Purchase Price in the Preliminary Settlement
Statement. Contributor shall include in such notice such reasonable
documentation as is in Contributor Group's possession to support the final
figures. As soon as reasonably practicable, but not later than the thirtieth
(30th) day following receipt of such statement from Contributor, Acquiror
shall deliver to Contributor a written report containing any changes that
Acquiror proposes be made to such statement (including without limitation
items not agreed to pursuant to the proviso of the last sentence of Section
8.4(a)), and in order to be valid, any such written report by Acquiror shall
specify in reasonable detail the dollar amount, nature and basis of any
changes so asserted. Contributor may deliver a written report to Acquiror
during this same period reflecting any changes



that Contributor proposes to be made to such statement as a result of
additional information received after the statement was prepared. If Acquiror
does not deliver such report to Contributor on or before the end of such
thirty (30) day period (or, if Contributor proposes any changes to such
statement, thirty (30) days from the date Contributor delivers written notice
thereof to Acquiror), Acquiror shall be deemed to have agreed with
Contributor's statement, and such statement shall become final and binding
upon the Parties. The Parties shall undertake to agree on the final statement
of the Adjusted Purchase Price no later than ninety (90) days after delivery
of Contributor's statement. In the event that the Parties cannot reach
agreement within such period of time, any Party may refer the items of
adjustment which are in dispute to the Houston, Texas office of Deloitte LLP,
or, if such Person is not able or willing to serve, a nationally recognized
independent accounting firm or consulting firm mutually acceptable to both
Acquiror and Contributor (the "Accounting Arbitrator"), for review and final
determination by arbitration. If Acquiror and Contributor have not agreed upon
a mutually acceptable alternate Person to serve as Accounting Arbitrator
within ten (10) Business Days of receiving notice of Deloitte LLP's
unavailability, Contributor shall, within ten (10) Business Days after the end
of such initial ten (10) Business Day period, formally apply to the Houston,
Texas office of the American Arbitration Association to choose the Accounting
Arbitrator. The Accounting Arbitrator shall conduct the arbitration
proceedings in Houston, Texas in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not
conflict with the terms of this Section 8.4(b). The Accounting Arbitrator's
determination shall be made within forty-five (45) days after submission of
the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding on all Parties, without
right of appeal. In determining the proper amount of any adjustment to the
Adjusted Purchase Price, the Accounting Arbitrator shall be bound by the terms
of Article 2 and may not increase the Adjusted Purchase Price more than the
increase proposed by Contributor nor decrease the Adjusted Purchase Price more
than the decrease proposed by Acquiror, as applicable. The Accounting
Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the
specific disputed aspects of adjustments submitted by any Party and may not
award damages, interest or penalties to any Party with respect to any matter.
Contributor and Acquiror shall each bear their own legal fees and other costs
of presenting its case. Contributor shall bear one‑half and Acquiror shall
bear one‑half of the costs and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator.

(c) Any difference in the Adjusted Purchase Price as determined pursuant to
Section 8.4(a) and the finally determined Adjusted Purchase Price as
determined pursuant to Section 8.4(b) shall be paid in cash by the owing Party
to the owed Party within five (5) Business Days after the earlier of (i) the
expiration of Acquiror's thirty (30) day review period (including any
extensions provided for above) without delivery of any written report, (ii)
the date on which the Parties agree in writing as to the final Adjusted
Purchase Price, or (c) the date on which the Accounting Arbitrator finally
determines the Adjusted Purchase Price.

(d) Acquiror shall assist Contributor in preparation of the final statement of
the Adjusted Purchase Price under Section 8.4(b) by furnishing invoices,
receipts, and providing reasonable access to personnel and such other
assistance as may be requested by Contributor to facilitate such process post-

bank and account as may be specified by Contributor or Acquiror in writing.

(f) Following the adjustments made under Section 8.4(b), (i) no further
adjustments shall be made to the Adjusted Purchase Price and (ii) such
adjustments shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price and
Allocated Value for all Tax purposes.

ARTICLE 9 
TAX MATTERS

9.1 Straddle Period Tax Proration.

(a) For purposes of determining the allocations of Asset Taxes imposed on any
member of the Company Group for any Straddle Period that are attributable to
the portion of such Straddle Period ending prior to the Effective Date: (i)
Asset Taxes that are attributable to the severance, production or sale of
Hydrocarbons shall be allocated to the portion of such Straddle Period in
which the severance or production giving rise to such Asset Taxes occurred,
(ii) Asset Taxes that are (A) imposed in connection with any sale or other
transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible)
or (B) imposed on specific transactions shall be allocated to the portion of
such Straddle Period in which the transaction giving rise to such Taxes
occurred, and (iii) Asset Taxes that are ad valorem, property or other Asset
Taxes imposed on a periodic basis pertaining to a Straddle Period shall be
allocated between the portion of such Straddle Period ending prior to the
Effective Date and the portion of such Straddle Period beginning on the
Effective Date by prorating each such Asset Tax based on the number of days in
the applicable Straddle Period that occur before the Effective Date, on the
one hand, and the number of days in such Straddle Period that occur on or
after the Effective Date, on the other hand; provided however, that
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis
(including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated
between the period ending prior to the Effective Date and the period beginning
on or after the Effective Date in proportion to the number of days in each
period.

(b) For purposes of determining the allocations of Income Taxes imposed on any
member of the Company Group for any Straddle Period that are attributable to
the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, such Income
Taxes shall be determined by means of an interim closing of the books as of
the end of the day on the Closing Date.

(c) For purposes of determining the allocations of Other Taxes imposed on any
member of the Company Group for any Straddle Period that are attributable to
the portion of such Straddle Period ending before the Effective Date, such
Other Taxes shall be allocated to the portion of such Straddle Period in which
the transaction or event giving rise to such Taxes occurred.

(d) Regardless of which Party is responsible, Contributor shall make payment
to the appropriate Governmental Authority of all Taxes which are required to
be paid on or prior to the Closing Date, and the Company shall make payment to
the appropriate Governmental Authority of all Taxes required to be paid after
the Closing Date; provided, that Acquiror shall reimburse Contributor for any
Asset Taxes, Income Taxes and Other Taxes paid by Contributor that are not



Contributor Taxes, except to the extent such Asset Taxes, Income Taxes and
Other Taxes caused an increase in the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to
Section 2.2(b)(xv), no later than ten (10) days following the written request
of Contributor therefor.

9.2 Tax Returns.

(a) Contributor shall be responsible for filing with the applicable taxing
authorities each Tax Return of any member of the Company Group that is
required to be filed on or before the Closing Date.

(b) Acquiror shall be responsible for filing with the applicable taxing
authorities each Tax Return of the Company Group that is required to be filed
after the Closing Date. With respect to any Tax Return of the Company Group
with respect to Taxes for which Contributor would reasonably be expected to
provide indemnification hereunder, Acquiror shall provide a copy of such Tax
Return to Contributor no later than twenty (20) days before the due date of
such Tax Return for Contributor's comments and approval and shall not file
such Tax Return without the Contributor's consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Acquiror shall timely file such
Tax Return (after incorporating the comments from Contributor to the extent
consistent with applicable Law) before the due date of such Tax Return.

9.3 Tax Contests. Contributor, on the one hand, and Acquiror Parties, on the
other hand, shall promptly notify each other upon receipt by such party of
written notice of any inquiries, claims, assessments, audits, proceedings or
similar events with respect to Asset Taxes relating to Pre-Effective Date
Periods and Straddle Periods and Income Taxes related to Pre-Closing Tax
Periods and Straddle Periods (any such inquiry, claim, assessment, audit,
proceeding or similar event, a "Tax Contest"). Provided Contributor
acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify the Acquiror, Contributor,
at its sole cost and expense, shall have the sole right to control any Tax
Contest relating to Asset Taxes for any Pre-Effective Date Period and Income
Taxes related to Pre-Closing Tax Periods; provided, however, that Contributor
shall have no authority to resolve such Tax Contest in a manner that has any
adverse effect on the Acquiror in a subsequent Tax period without the
Acquiror's written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed. Contributor shall reimburse the Acquiror for any expense and cost
incurred in connection with any such Tax Contest. With respect to any Tax
Consents relating to a Straddle Period, Acquiror shall have the sole right to
control any such Tax Contest; provided however, the Acquiror shall not resolve
any such Tax Contest in a manner that would require indemnity by the
Contributor without the Contributor's written consent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

9.4 Transfer Taxes. To the extent that any sales, purchase, transfer, stamp,
documentary stamp, registration, use or similar taxes are payable by reason of
the sale of the Company Group Interests under this Agreement ("Transfer
Taxes"), such Transfer Taxes shall be borne and timely paid by Acquiror.
Acquiror and Contributor shall reasonably cooperate in good faith to minimize,
to the extent permissible under applicable Law, the amount of any such
Transfer Taxes.

9.5 Tax Cooperation. The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns and any audit, litigation, Tax Contest, or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes imposed on or with respect to the Company.



Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon another Party's
request) the provision of records and information that are relevant to any
such Tax Return or audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided under this Agreement. Contributor and
Acquiror agree to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Company relating to any taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations of the
respective taxable periods and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any Governmental Authority.

9.6 Purchase Price Allocation. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Closing, to the extent Contributor is treated as receiving consideration in
exchange for the Company Interests in connection with the purchase and sale
described in Section 2.1, the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to prepare
and agree to a statement reflecting a valuation of all of the assets of the
Company in accordance with the principles of Sections 741, 755 or other
applicable provisions of the Code and consistent with the Allocated Values
pursuant to Section 3.4 (the "Tax Allocation Statement"). The Parties agree to
(a) be bound by the Tax Allocation Statement (if agreed), (b) amend the Tax
Allocation Statement as required, including in connection with the final
determination of the Adjusted Purchase Price under Section 8.4(b) and (c) act
in accordance with the Tax Allocation Statement (if agreed) in the
preparation, filing and audit of any Tax Return. Neither Party shall be
required to participate in a Tax Contest relating to any proposed deficiencies
or adjustment by any Governmental Authority arising from the Tax Allocation
Statement.

9.7 Tax Treatment. Except as required by applicable Law, the Parties agree
that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (a) Acquiror Units received by
Contributor in exchange for Company Group Interests shall not be treated as a
taxable exchange pursuant to Section 721 of the Code, (b) the Cash Purchase
Price and any other amounts treated as taxable consideration shall be treated
as received in exchange for partnership interests in a transaction described
in Section 741 of the Code, and (c) in connection with any adjustment to the
Cash Purchase Price, the value of the Company Group Interests as of the
Closing will be redetermined such that the contributed Company Interests are
increased or decreased, as the case may be, to be equivalent to the Unit
Purchase Price. For the avoidance of doubt, except as required by applicable
Law, the Parties shall not treat at Closing the right of Contributor to have
its Acquiror Units redeemed or exchanged for Class A Common Stock pursuant to
the LLC Agreement, as received in a taxable exchange. The Parties shall (A)
prepare and file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with this Section 9.7,
and (B) take no position inconsistent with this Section 9.7 for any Tax
purpose, including the preparation and filing of any Tax Return, the defense
of any Tax-related Proceeding or otherwise, absent a determination within the
meaning of Section 1313 of the Code to the contrary.

9.8 Section 704(c) Method. The Parties agree that, with respect to any book-
tax disparity with respect to the Company Interests as of the Closing, the
Acquiror shall use the "traditional method with curative allocations," with
the curative allocations applied only to sale gain, under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-3(c), or such other method or methods determined by the Acquiror
Parent to be appropriate and in accordance with the applicable Treasury
Regulations.



9.9 754 Elections. Contributor shall, prior to the Closing, cause the Company
to have in effect a valid election under Section 754 of the Code and for
similar provisions of state, local or foreign Law) for any taxable year that
includes the Closing Date.

for the amount of any imputed underpayment (as described in Section 6225 of
the Code as amended by Section 1101 of Title XI (Revenue Provisions Related to
Tax Compliance) of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, H.R. 1314, Public Law
Number 114-74, as may be amended from time to time) imposed on the Company
Group and allocable to the Contributor or attributable to the Company
Interests during any taxable years, or portions thereof, when the Contributor
owned the Company Interests, or any other Income Tax assessment imposed on the
Company Group for any such period under any similar provision of applicable
state or local Law; provided, however, that the Parties agree that the Company
shall not make, nor shall the Acquiror cause the Company to make, an election
under Section 6226(a) of the Code with respect to any imputed underpayment (as
determined pursuant to Section 6225 of the Code) arising with respect to any
such taxable year, or portion thereof, for which Contributor (a) fully
complies with the procedures of Section 6225(c)(2)(A) or (B) of the Code, or
(b) pays to the Company the Contributor's entire allocable share of such
imputed underpayment, which in either event shall be completed within forty
(40) days after the notice of final partnership adjustments.

9.11 Tax Classification of Sabalo Energy. From and after the Closing Date,
Acquiror shall not (a) dissolve, liquidate or otherwise terminate Sabalo
Energy, (b) take any action that would, or would reasonably be expected to,
cause Sabalo Energy (or any successor) to be classified as other than an
association taxable as a corporation, including the merger of Sabalo Energy
with and into a limited liability company or partnership or the conversion of
Sabalo Energy into a limited liability company or partnership, (c) cause the
Company to be classified as other than a partnership for U.S. federal Income
Tax purposes, in each case without the consent of Contributor (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), or (d) take any action that
would, or would reasonably be expected to, cause Sabalo Energy's ownership
interest in the Company, including Sabalo Energy's entitlement to
distributions and allocations of the Company pursuant to the Company LLC
Agreement, to fall below .01%.

9.12 Extraordinary Transactions. After the Closing of the transactions
contemplated herein and the Shad Permian Letter Agreement and the actions
related to such transactions, Acquiror shall not cause the Company Group to
close any other transaction, or take any other action, after the Closing on
the Closing Date, that is outside the ordinary course of business other than
the closing of the transaction contemplated in the Shad Permian Letter
Agreement and the actions related to such transaction, without the consent of
Contributor, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

ARTICLE 10 
TERMINATION

10.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
Closing:

(a) by the mutual prior written consent of Contributor and the Acquiror
Parties;



(b) by either Contributor or the Acquiror Parties if:

(i) the Closing has not occurred on or before 5:00 p.m. local time in Houston,
Texas on February 14, 2019 (the "End Date"); provided, the End Date shall
automatically be extended for forty-five (45) days in the event the first
mailing of the Proxy Statement to Acquiror Parent Stockholders shall have
occurred on or before February 14, 2019 and the Stockholders Meeting shall
have not been held on or before February 8, 2019. However, no Party shall be
entitled to terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.1(b)(i), if the
Closing has failed to occur as a result of such Party's breach of any
representations or warranties set forth herein or such Party's failure to
perform or observe such Party's covenants and agreements hereunder (including
the failure to perform the obligations of such Party with respect to Closing
the transactions contemplated hereunder if and when required) in each case in
a manner that causes the conditions of the other Party in Article 7 not to be
satisfied (a "Material Breach"); provided, however, that if the Closing has
not occurred or this Agreement has not otherwise been terminated by April 1,
2019, and the Acquiror Parties have not initiated any action for specific
performance of Contributor's obligations to consummate the Transactions (or at
any time after such an action has been initiated, the Acquiror Parties fail to
use reasonable best efforts to pursue such action), then, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary to this Section 10.1(b)(i), Contributor shall be
entitled to terminate this Agreement by delivering written notice to the
Acquiror Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
this Agreement may not be extended beyond April 1, 2019 without the mutual
written consent of the Acquiror Parent and Contributor;

(ii) an injunction, order or award restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall have been issued and remain in force, and shall have become
final and nonappealable; provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 10.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to a Party if such
injunction, order or award was due to the failure of such Party to perform any
of its obligations or observe in any material respect its covenants or
agreements hereunder; or

(iii) if the Stockholder Meeting shall have concluded and the Stockholder
Approval shall not have been obtained; or

(c) by Contributor, if an Acquiror Parent Change of Recommendation under
Section 6.19 shall have occurred.

10.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 10.1, this Agreement shall become void and of no further force or
effect (except for the provisions of Section 1.2, this Article 10, Sections
4.8, 5.11, 6.3, 6.5, and Article 12, all of which shall continue in full force
and effect).

10.3 Damages for Failure to Close.

(a) In the event that (i) (A) Contributor is entitled to terminate this
Agreement under (A) Section 10.1(b)(i) because the conditions precedent to the
obligations of Contributor set forth in Section 7.1 are not satisfied as of
the date set forth in Section 10.1(b)(i) solely as a result of the breach or
failure of Acquiror Parties' representations, warranties, or covenants
hereunder,



including, if and when required, Acquiror Parties' obligations to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereunder at Closing, and (B) all conditions
precedent to the obligations of Acquiror Parties set forth in Section 7.2 have
been satisfied or waived in writing by Acquiror Parties (except for those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at Closing, all of which
Contributor stands ready, willing and able to satisfy), or (ii) Contributor is
entitled to terminate this Agreement under Section 10.1(c), then Contributor
shall be entitled, to either (x) terminate this Agreement and receive the
Termination Fee as liquidated damages and as its sole remedy hereunder, or (y)
seek specific performance of this Agreement provided that (i) the Acquiror
Parties shall have received sufficient funds in closing the Financing to pay
the Cash Closing Payment, and (ii) Contributor has advised Acquiror within
five (5) days of failure of the conditions precedent in Section 10.3(a)(i) of
the election by the Contributor to seek specific performance. Contributor and
Acquiror acknowledge and agree that (1) Contributor's actual damages upon the
event of such a termination described in this Section 10.3(a) are difficult to
ascertain with any certainty, (2) the Termination Fee is a fair and reasonable
estimate by the Parties of such aggregate actual damages of Contributor, and
(3) such liquidated damages do not constitute a penalty.

(b) Notwithstanding any language in this Agreement to the contrary, in the
event that Contributor terminates this Agreement under Section 10.1(b)(iii),
then within two (2) Business Days of termination of this Agreement, Acquiror
shall reimburse Contributor for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred by Contributor (including those costs and expenses
more particularly described on Schedule 10.3) not to exceed an amount, in
cash, equal to Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000) (the
"Expense Reimbursement").

(c) In no event shall Contributor be entitled to receive both the Termination
Fee and the Expense Reimbursement.

(d) In the event that (%4) all conditions precedent to the obligations of
Contributor set forth in Section 7.1 have been satisfied or waived in writing
by Contributor (except for those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at Closing, all of which Acquiror Parties stand ready, willing and
able to satisfy) and (%4) Acquiror Parties are entitled to terminate this
Agreement under Section 10.1(b) because the conditions precedent to the
obligations of Acquiror Parties set forth in Section 7.2 are not satisfied as
of the date set forth in Section 10.1(b)(i) solely as a result of the breach
or failure of Contributor's representations, warranties, or covenants
hereunder, including, if and when required, Contributor's obligations to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder at Closing, then Acquiror
shall be entitled to elect, in its sole discretion, to either (x) seek
specific performance of this Agreement, or (y) terminate this Agreement, in
which event Acquiror shall be entitled to receive from Contributor the
Termination Fee. Acquiror and Contributor acknowledge and agree that (1)
Acquiror's actual damages upon the event of such a termination described in
this Section 10.3(d) are difficult to ascertain with any certainty, (2) the
Termination Fee is a fair and reasonable estimate by the Parties of such
aggregate actual damages of Acquiror, and (3) such liquidated damages do not
constitute a penalty.

11.2 Indemnification Actions. All claims for indemnification under Section
11.1 shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) For purposes of this Article 11, the term "Indemnifying Person" when used
in connection with particular Damages shall mean the Person having an
obligation to indemnify another Person or Persons with respect to such Damages
pursuant to this Article 11, and the term "Indemnified Person" when used in
connection with particular Damages shall mean a Person having the right to be
indemnified with respect to such Damages pursuant to this Article 11
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, those Persons identified in Section
11.2(h)).

(b) To make a claim for indemnification under Section 11.1, an Indemnified
Person shall notify the Indemnifying Person of its claim, including the
specific details of and specific basis under this Agreement for its claim (the
"Claim Notice"). In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon
a claim by a third Person against the Indemnified Person (a "Claim"), the
Indemnified Person shall provide its Claim Notice promptly after the
Indemnified Person has actual knowledge of the Claim and shall enclose a
complete copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to the Claim;
provided that the failure of any Indemnified Person to give notice of a Claim
as provided in this Section 11.2 shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of
its obligations under Section 11.1, except to the extent such failure results
in insufficient time being available to permit the Indemnifying Person to
effectively defend against the Claim or otherwise prejudices the Indemnifying
Person's ability to defend against the Claim. In the event that the claim for
indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a representation,
warranty, covenant, or agreement, the Claim Notice shall specify the
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that was inaccurate or
breached and the reasonably specific details of, and specific basis for, such
asserted inaccuracy or breach.

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim
Notice to notify the Indemnified Person whether it admits or denies its
obligation to defend the Indemnified Person against such Claim under this
Article 11. If the Indemnifying Person does not notify the Indemnified Person
within such thirty (30) day period regarding whether the Indemnifying Person
admits or denies its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person, it shall be
deemed to have denied its obligation to provide such indemnification
hereunder. The Indemnified Person is authorized, prior to and during such
thirty (30) day period, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it
shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the
Indemnifying Person and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Person.

(d) If the Indemnifying Person admits its obligation, it shall have the right
and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Claim.
The Indemnifying Person shall have full control of such defense and
proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof. If requested by
the Indemnifying Person, the Indemnified Person agrees to cooperate in
contesting any Claim which the Indemnifying Person elects to contest
(provided, however, that the Indemnified Person shall not be required to bring
any counterclaim or cross-complaint against any Person). The Indemnified
Person may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any
Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Person pursuant to this Section 11.2(d).
Such Claims



shall be defended jointly by the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying
Person. An Indemnifying Person shall not, without the written consent of the
Indemnified Person, settle any Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment
with respect thereto that (i) does not result in a final, non-appealable,
resolution of the Indemnified Person's liability with respect to the Claim
(including, in the case of a settlement, an unconditional written release of
the Indemnified Person from all further liability in respect of such Claim) or
(ii) may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Person (other than as
a result of money damages covered by the indemnity).

(e) If the Indemnifying Person does not admit its obligation or admits its
obligation but fails to diligently defend or settle the Claim, then the
Indemnified Person shall have the right to defend against the Claim (at the
sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Person, if the Indemnified Person is
entitled to indemnification hereunder), with counsel of the Indemnified
Person's choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Person to admit
its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Person and assume the defense of
the Claim at any time prior to settlement or final, non-appealable
determination thereof. If the Indemnifying Person has not yet admitted its
obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Person, the Indemnified Person shall
send written notice to the Indemnifying Person of any proposed settlement and
the Indemnifying Person shall have the option for ten (10) days following
receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing its obligation for
indemnification with respect to such Claim and (ii) if its obligation is so
admitted, assume the defense of the Claim, including the power to reject the
proposed settlement. If the Indemnified Person settles any Claim over the
objection of the Indemnifying Person after the Indemnifying Person has timely
admitted its obligation for indemnification in writing and assumed the defense
of the Claim, the Indemnified Person shall be deemed to have waived any right
to indemnity therefor.

(f) If a Party would be required to defend a Claim as provided in this Section
11.2, which Claim is unliquidated in amount, but for the assertion that the
other Party would not be entitled to indemnification for any liability, loss,
cost, expense, claim, award, judgment, or other Damages incurred or suffered
by such Party due solely to the limitations set forth in Section 11.3(c) with
respect to the amount of such Claim, such Party shall nevertheless have the
right and obligation to defend against such Claim as set forth in Section
11.2(d), subject to the indemnification obligations of such Party set forth in
this Article 11; provided, however, that if, upon final, non-appealable
liquidation of the amount of such Claim, the Party defending such Claim
pursuant to this Section 11.2(f) would not have had the obligation to defend
such Claim under Section 11.3(c) due solely to the limitations set forth in
Section 11.3(c) with respect to the amount of such Claim, the Party defending
such Claim shall be entitled to reimbursement of all reasonable costs and
expenses incurred with respect to the defense of such Claim.

(g) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim
Notice to (i) cure the Damages complained of, (ii) admit its obligation to
provide indemnification with respect to such Damages or (iii) dispute the
claim for such Damages. If the Indemnifying Person does not notify the
Indemnified Person within such thirty (30) day period that it has cured the
Damages or that it disputes the claim for such Damages, the Indemnifying
Person shall be conclusively deemed to have disputed the claim for
indemnification hereunder.



(h) Any claim for indemnity under Section 11.1 by any Affiliate, director,
officer, employee or agent must be brought and administered by the applicable
Party to this Agreement. No Indemnified Person other than Contributor and
Acquiror Parties shall have any rights against either Contributor or Acquiror
Parties under the terms of Section 11.1 except as may be exercised on its
behalf by Acquiror Parties or Contributor, as applicable, pursuant to this
Section 11.2(h). Each of Contributor and Acquiror Parties may elect to
exercise or not exercise indemnification rights under this Section 11.2 on
behalf of the other Indemnified Persons affiliated with it in its sole
discretion and shall have no liability to any such other Indemnified Person
for any action or inaction under this Section 11.2.

11.3 Limitation on Actions.

(a) The Acquiror Party Fundamental Representations, Contributor Group
Fundamental Representations, the Special Warranty of Title, the covenants of
Contributor in this Agreement to be performed at or prior to Closing, and the
corresponding representations, warranties, agreements, covenants and
affirmations given in the certificate delivered at Closing pursuant to
Sections 8.2(c) and 8.3(f), shall terminate on the date that is twenty-four
(24) months after the Closing Date. The representations, warranties,
agreements and covenants provided in Sections 4.3, 4.25, 5.20, 9.1, 9.3, 9.4,
9.5, 9.6, 9.7, 9.10, and 9.12 shall terminate upon the expiration of any
applicable statute of limitations relating thereto (giving effect to any
waiver, mitigation or extension thereof) plus sixty (60) days. All other
representations and warranties of Contributor in this Agreement, and the
corresponding representations, warranties, and affirmations given in the
certificates delivered at Closing pursuant to Sections 8.2(c) and 8.3(f),
shall terminate on the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date.
The representations and warranties of Acquiror Parties in Article 5 (excluding
the Acquiror Party Fundamental Representations) and the covenants of the
Acquiror Parties in this Agreement to be performed at or prior to Closing, and
the corresponding representations, warranties, and affirmations given in the
certificates delivered at Closing pursuant to Sections 8.2(c) and 8.3(f),
shall survive the Closing for a period of twenty-four (24) months after the
Closing Date. Except as otherwise provided above, the covenants and agreements
of the Parties to be performed after Closing shall survive Closing as
reasonably necessary to perform the same, subject to the limitations set forth
in this Section 11.3, but in no event shall survive for a period greater than
twenty-four (24) months after the Closing Date (other than (i) the covenants
and agreements of the Parties in Sections 11.1(a) and 11.1(b) which shall
survive as set forth in this Section 11.3, and (ii) the covenants and
agreements requiring forbearance of the Parties after Closing which in no
event shall survive for a period greater than twenty-four (24) months after
the Closing Date, unless such covenant or agreement specifies a shorter period
of time for which forbearance is required). Representations, warranties,
covenants, and agreements shall be of no further force and effect after the
date of their expiration, provided that there shall be no termination of any
bona fide claim asserted pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such a
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement prior to its expiration date.

(b) The indemnities in Sections 11.1(a)(i), 11.1(a)(ii), 11.1(b)(ii) and
11.1(b)(iii) shall terminate as of the termination date of each respective
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement that is subject to
indemnification, except in each case as to matters for which a specific
written claim for indemnity has been delivered to the Indemnifying Person on
or before such



termination date. The indemnities in Section 11.1(b)(i) shall terminate on the
date that is twenty-four (24) months after the Closing Date; provided,
however, the indemnities in Section 11.1(b)(i)(C) shall terminate on the
expiration of any applicable statute of limitations relating thereto (giving
effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof) plus sixty (60) days.

(c) No Party shall have any liability for any indemnification under Section
11.1(a)(ii) or Section 11.1(b)(iii), as applicable, for an individual matter
until and unless the amount of the liability for Damages with respect to which
such Party admits (or it is otherwise finally determined) that such Party has
an obligation to indemnify the other Party pursuant to the terms of Section
11.1 exceeds One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) (the "Individual
Indemnity Threshold"). Without limiting the foregoing, no Party shall have any
liability for any indemnification under Section 11.1(a)(ii) or Section
11.1(b)(iii), as applicable, until and unless the aggregate amount of the
liability for all Damages (i) for which Claim Notices are delivered by the
other Party, (ii) with respect to which such Party admits (or it is otherwise
finally determined) that such Party has an obligation to indemnify the other
Party pursuant to the terms of Article 11, and (iii) which exceed the
Individual Indemnity Threshold, exceeds one and three-quarters percent (1.75%)
of the Unadjusted Purchase Price, and then only to the extent such Damages
exceed one and three-quarters percent (1.75%) of the Unadjusted Purchase
Price; provided, however, that this Section 11.3(c) shall not limit
indemnification for breaches of Contributor Fundamental Representations,
breaches of the Special Warranty of Title, breaches of the representations,
warranties and covenants in Section 4.3, Section 4.25, Section 5.20, Section
9.1, Section 9.3, Section 9.4, Section 9.5, Section 9.6, Section 9.7, Section
9.10, and Section 9.12, or the indemnities of Section 11.1(b)(i)(C) and
breaches of the Acquiror Party Fundamental Representations. For the purposes
of determining failure of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
set forth in this Agreement to be true and correct, and calculating the
Damages under this Article 11 resulting therefrom, any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement which is qualified by materiality, Company
Group Material Adverse Effect or Acquiror Material Adverse Effect shall be
deemed not to be so qualified.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this
Agreement, other than in respect of any Damages resulting from actual fraud
(and not on any theory of constructive fraud) by Contributor, Contributor
shall not be required to indemnify Acquiror under this Article 11 for Damages
in excess of fifteen percent (15%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price; provided,
however, that this Section 11.3(d) shall not limit indemnification for breach
of the Contributor Group Fundamental Representations or Section 4.24.

(e) The amount of any Damages for which an Indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnity under this Article 11 shall be reduced by the amount of insurance
proceeds realized by the Indemnified Person or its Affiliates with respect to
such Damages (net of any collection costs, and excluding the proceeds of any
insurance policy issued or underwritten by the Indemnified Person or its
Affiliates); provided, however, that no Party shall be required to seek
recovery under any policy of insurance as a condition to indemnification
hereunder.

(f) As used in this Agreement, the term "Damages" means the amount of any
actual liability, loss, cost, expense, claim, award, or judgment incurred or
suffered by any



Indemnified Person arising out of or resulting from the indemnified matter or
any breach of this Agreement, whether attributable to personal injury or
death, property damage, contract claims, torts, or otherwise, including
reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys, consultants, accountants, or other
agents and experts reasonably incident to matters indemnified against, and the
costs of investigation and/or monitoring of such matters, and the costs of
enforcement of the indemnity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Acquiror Parties nor Contributor shall be entitled to indemnification under
this Article 11 for, and Damages shall not include, (i) consequential,
special, or punitive damages suffered by the Party claiming indemnification
(other than consequential, special, or punitive damages suffered by third
Persons for which responsibility is allocated among the Parties), and (ii) any
increase in liability, loss, cost, expense, claim, award or judgment to the
extent such increase is caused by the actions or omissions of any Indemnified
Person after the Closing Date.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, a
claim for indemnity may be made by a Party under this Article 11 in respect of
any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant set forth in this
Agreement despite the fact that such Party obtained knowledge prior to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or prior to the Closing of the breach
of such representation, warranty or covenant. In furtherance of the foregoing,
each of Acquiror Parties and Contributor are entitled to rely upon, and shall
be deemed to have relied upon, all representations, warranties and covenants
of the other Party set forth in this Agreement which are made in favor of
Acquiror Parties or Contributor, as applicable, and the rights of the members
of Acquiror Family and Contributor Family who are entitled to indemnification
under this Article 11 shall not be affected, notwithstanding (i) the making of
this Agreement, (ii) any investigation or examination conducted by or on
behalf of a Party with respect thereto, or (iii) the Closing hereunder.

ARTICLE 12 
MISCELLANEOUS

12.3 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all expenses
incurred by Contributor in connection with or related to the authorization,
preparation or execution of this Agreement, and the Exhibits and Schedules
hereto and thereto, and all other matters related to the Closing, including
all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants and financial advisers employed
by Contributor, shall be borne solely and entirely by Contributor, and all
such expenses incurred by Acquiror Parties shall be borne solely and entirely
by Acquiror Parties.

12.4 Governing Law. This Agreement and the legal relations between the Parties
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Texas, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws that would direct the
application of the laws of another jurisdiction.

12.5 Dispute Resolution. Each Party consents to personal jurisdiction in any
action brought in the United States federal courts located in the State of
Texas with respect to any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or in
relation to or in connection with this Agreement, and each of the Parties
agrees that any action instituted by it against the other with respect to any
such dispute, controversy or claim (except to the extent a dispute,
controversy, or claim arising out of or in relation to or in connection with
title matters pursuant to Section 3.10, or the determination of adjustments to
the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section 8.4(b) is referred to an
expert pursuant to those Sections) will be instituted exclusively in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. Each Party
(a) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (b)
waives any objection to laying venue in any such action or proceeding in such
courts, (c) waives any objection that such courts are an inconvenient forum or
do not have jurisdiction over it, and (d) agrees that service of process upon
it may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered mail (or any
substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to it at its address
specified in Section 12.2. The foregoing consents to jurisdiction and service
of process shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the
State of Texas for any purpose except as provided herein and shall not be
deemed to confer any rights on any Person other than the Parties to this
Agreement. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY AGAINST ANOTHER IN ANY MATTER WHATSOEVER
ARISING OUT OF OR IN RELATION TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT.
FURTHER, NOTHING HEREIN SHALL DIVEST A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION OF THE
RIGHT AND POWER TO GRANT A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER, TO GRANT TEMPORARY
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, OR TO COMPEL SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OF ANY DECISION OF AN
ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL MADE PURSUANT TO THIS PROVISION.

12.6 Captions. The captions in this Agreement are for convenience only and
shall not be considered a part of or affect the construction or interpretation
of any provision of this Agreement.

12.7 Waivers. Any failure by any Party to comply with any of its obligations,
agreements or conditions herein contained may be waived by the Party to whom
such compliance is owed by



an instrument signed by the Party to whom compliance is owed and expressly
identified as a waiver, but not in any other manner. No waiver of, or consent
to a change in, any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or
shall constitute a waiver of, or consent to a change in, other provisions
hereof (whether or not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing
waiver unless otherwise expressly provided. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
requirement that the Stockholder Approval include the vote of a Majority of
the Disinterested in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby may not be waived.

12.8 Assignment. No Party shall assign or otherwise transfer all or any part
of this Agreement, nor shall any Party delegate any of its rights or duties
hereunder (including by change of control, merger, consolidation, or stock
purchase), without the prior written consent of the other Party and any
transfer or delegation made without such consent shall be void. Subject to the
foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Acquiror may, by providing written notice to Contributor, but
without Contributor's consent, assign its rights and delegate its duties
hereunder in whole (but not in part) to an Affiliate of Acquiror; provided,
however, such assignment shall not be permitted if it would reasonably be
anticipated to increase the liability of any Contributor Group Member with
respect to Taxes.

12.9 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the documents to be executed
hereunder and the Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto constitute the entire
agreement among the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and
supersede all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions,
whether oral or written, of the Parties pertaining to the subject matter
hereof. In entering into this Agreement, neither Party has relied on any
statement, representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement of the other Party
or its representatives other than those expressly contained in this Agreement.

12.10 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by an
agreement in writing signed by Contributor and the Acquiror Parties and
expressly identified as an amendment or modification; provided, however, that
this Section 12.10, Section 12.11 and Section 12.18 (and any other provision
of this Agreement to the extent an amendment, supplement, waiver or other
modification of such provision would modify the substance of such Sections)
may not be amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified in any manner
that impacts or is otherwise adverse in any respect to the Financing Sources
without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

12.11 No Third-Person Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement shall entitle
any Person other than the Acquiror Parties and Contributor to any claim, cause
of action, remedy or right of any kind, except the rights expressly provided
to the Persons described in Section 6.5 and Section 11.2(h) and provided that
the Financing Sources shall be express third-party beneficiaries of, and shall
be entitled to rely upon Section 12.10, this Section 12.11 and Section 12.18.

12.12 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement, or any application
thereof, is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any
Law, this Agreement shall be reformed to the extent necessary to conform, in
each case consistent with the intention of the Parties, to such Law, and, to
the extent such provision cannot be so reformed, then such provision (or the
invalid, illegal or unenforceable application thereof) shall be deemed deleted
from (or prohibited under)



this Agreement, as the case may be, and the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein (and any other
application of such provision) shall not in any way be affected or impaired
thereby.

12.13 Time of the Essence. Time is of the essence in this Agreement. If the
date specified in this Agreement for giving any notice or taking any action is
not a Business Day (or if the period during which any notice is required to be
given or any action taken expires on a date which is not a Business Day), then
the date for giving such notice or taking such action (and the expiration of
such period during which notice is required to be given or action taken) shall
be the next day which is a Business Day.

12.14 References. In this Agreement: (a) references to any gender includes a
reference to all other genders; (b) references to the singular includes the
plural, and vice versa; (c) reference to any Article or Section means an
Article or Section of this Agreement; (d) reference to any Exhibit or Schedule
means an Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement, all of which are incorporated
into and made a part of this Agreement; (e) unless expressly provided to the
contrary, "hereunder", "hereof", "herein" and words of similar import are
references to this Agreement as a whole and not any particular Section or
other provision of this Agreement; (f) references to "$" or "dollars" means
United States Dollars; and (g) "include" and "including" mean include or
including without limiting the generality of the description preceding such
term.

12.15 Construction. Acquiror is capable of making such investigation,
inspection, review and evaluation of the Company Group Interests as a prudent
purchaser would deem appropriate under the circumstances, including with
respect to all matters relating to the Company Group Interests, their value,
operation and suitability. Contributor and Acquiror Parties have had the
opportunity to exercise business discretion in relation to the negotiation of
the details of the transaction contemplated hereby. This Agreement is the
result of arm's-length negotiations from equal bargaining positions. It is
expressly agreed that this Agreement shall not be construed against any Party,
and no consideration shall be given or presumption made, on the basis of who
drafted this Agreement or any particular provision thereof.

12.16 Limitation on Damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, none of the Acquiror Parties, Contributor, or any of their
respective Affiliates shall be entitled to consequential, special, or punitive
damages in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (other than consequential, special, or punitive damages suffered by
third Persons for which responsibility is allocated between the Parties in
this Agreement) and each of the Acquiror Parties and Contributor, for itself
and on behalf of its Affiliates, hereby expressly waives any right to
consequential, special, or punitive damages in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby (other than consequential, special,
or punitive damages suffered by third Persons for which responsibility is
allocated between the Parties in this Agreement).

12.17 Recourse Only Against Parties. All claims, obligations, liabilities, or
causes of action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or
granted by statute) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or
by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement, or
the negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement
to, this Agreement),



may be made only against (and are expressly limited to) the entities that are
expressly identified as parties in the preamble to this Agreement or any
successor or permitted assign of any such Parties ("Contracting Parties"). No
Person who is not a Contracting Party, including without limitation any
director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, or representative of, and any
financial advisor or lender to, any Contracting Party, or any director,
officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder,
Affiliate, agent, attorney, or representative of, and any financial advisor or
lender to, any of the foregoing ("Nonparty Affiliates"), shall have any
liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by
statute) for any claims, causes of action, obligations, or liabilities arising
under, out of, in connection with, or related in any manner to this Agreement
or based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation,
execution, performance, or breach; and, to the maximum extent permitted by
law, each Contracting Party hereby waives and releases all such liabilities,
claims, causes of action, and obligations against any such Nonparty
Affiliates. Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by
law, (a) each Contracting Party hereby waives and releases any and all rights,
claims, demands, or causes of action that may otherwise be available at law or
in equity, or granted by statute, to avoid or disregard the entity form of a
Contracting Party or otherwise impose liability of a Contracting Party on any
Nonparty Affiliate, whether granted by statute or based on theories of equity,
agency, control, instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single business
enterprise, piercing the veil, unfairness, undercapitalization, or otherwise;
and (b) each Contracting Party disclaims any reliance upon any Nonparty
Affiliates with respect to the performance of this Agreement or any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to
this Agreement.

12.18 No Liability of Financing Sources.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Contributor
agrees that none of the Financing Sources, lenders participating in the
Financing or any of their respective former, current or future general or
limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, agents, representatives,
Affiliates, successors or assigns (collectively, the "Finance Related
Parties") will have any liability to the Contributor, or its former, current
or future officers, directors, managers, employees, members, partners, agents
or other Representatives and Affiliates (collectively, the "Contributor
Related Parties") relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Financing, whether at law, or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, in
each case, whether arising, in whole or in part, out of comparative,
contributory or sole negligence by any Finance Related Party, and no
Contributor Related Party will have any rights or claims against any of the
Finance Related Parties hereunder or thereunder.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) no
amendment or modification to this Section 12.18 (or amendment or modification
with respect to any related definitions as they affect this Section 12.18)
shall be effective without the prior written consent of each Financing Source
or Finance Related Party and (ii) each Financing Source and Finance Related
Party shall be an express third-party beneficiary of, and shall have the right
to enforce, this Section 12.18.



(c) Each of the Parties hereto agrees that, Section 12.4 notwithstanding, any
claim, controversy or dispute of any kind or nature (whether based upon
contract, tort or otherwise) involving a Finance Related Party that is in any
way related to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including but not limited to any dispute arising out of or relating
in any way to the Financing, shall be governed by the Laws of the State of New
York without regard to the conflict of Laws provisions thereof that would
cause the laws of another state to apply.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere herein
(including Section 12.4), the Parties hereby further agree that no Party will
bring any legal action or proceeding against any Finance Related Party in any
way relating to this Agreement, the Financing, or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Financing Commitment Letter or any other letter or
agreement related to any of the Financing, the Financing Commitment Letter or
the performance thereof, in any forum other than any New York State court
sitting in the borough of Manhattan, or, if, under applicable Law, exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof) and each
of the Parties hereto consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts
(and of the appropriate appellate courts) in any such action or proceeding and
waives any objection to venue laid therein. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY AGAINST ANY FINANCE RELATED PARTY OR BY ANY FINANCE
RELATED PARTY AGAINST ANY PARTY IN ANY MATTER WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR IN
RELATION TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE FINANCING OR ANY OF THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY OR ANY FINANCE RELATED
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY OR SUCH
FINANCE RELATED PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER, AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND, TO THE BEST OF ITS
KNOWLEDGE, THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO AND THE FINANCE RELATED PARTIES HAVE BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE FINANCING COMMITMENT LETTER (IF
IT IS A PARTY THERETO) BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 12.18.

(e) This Section 12.18 is intended to benefit and may be enforced by the
Financing Sources and the Finance Related Parties.

12.19 Contributor Marks. Contributor is not conveying ownership rights or
granting Acquiror nor any Affiliate of Acquiror (including after the Closing,
Sabalo Energy and the Company) a license or other right to use any of the
trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos or domain names of Contributor
(including any trade name, trademark, service mark, logo or domain name
incorporating the names "Sabalo," or "Sabalo Energy") (collectively, the
"Contributor Marks") and, after the Closing, Acquiror shall not permit the
Company Group or any Affiliate of the Acquiror



to use in any manner the Contributor Marks or any name or mark that is a
variation thereof of confusingly similar thereto. As promptly as practicable,
and in any event no later than sixty (60) days after the termination of the
Transition Services Agreement, Acquiror shall take all necessary action to (i)
remove from all of the Company Group's publicly distributed or publicly
accessible letterhead, envelopes, invoices, supplies, labels, web site
publications, promotional materials, marketing collateral, advertisements, and
other communications media of any kind, all references to the Contributor
Marks, and shall cease any and all use of the Contributor Marks as trade name,
trademark, service mark, logo or domain name, and (ii) cause the corporate
name of each of Sabalo and Sabalo Energy to be changed to a name that does not
include any Contributor Mark or any other name or mark that is a variation
thereof or confusingly similar thereto; provided, however, that Acquiror shall
have until the date that is ninety (90) days after the termination of the
Transition Services Agreement to remove any and all Contributor Marks from the
Company's physical assets (e.g., signage). From and after the Closing, neither
Acquiror nor any Affiliate of Acquiror (including, after the Closing, the
Company) shall challenge the validity, enforceability or ownership of any of
the Contributor Marks. If Acquiror or any Affiliate of Acquiror (including,
after the Closing, Sabalo Energy and the Company) violates any of its
obligations under this Section 12.19, Contributor may proceed against it in
law or in equity for such damages or other relief as a court may deem
appropriate. Acquiror acknowledges that a violation of this Section 12.19 may
cause Contributor and its Affiliates irreparable harm, which may not be
adequately compensated for by money damages. Acquiror therefore agrees that in
the event of any actual or threatened violation of this Section 12.19,
Contributor shall be entitled, in addition to other remedies that it may have,
to a temporary restraining order and to preliminary and final injunctive
relief against Acquiror or any applicable Affiliate of Acquiror (including,
after the termination of the Transition Services Agreement, Sabalo Energy or
the Company) to prevent any violations of this Section 12.19.





IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been signed by each of the Parties as
of the date first above written.
