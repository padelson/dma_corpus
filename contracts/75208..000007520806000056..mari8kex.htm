<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Capital Stock of Sub.</U>  Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock.</U>  Each share of Company Common Stock that is directly owned by the Company, Parent or Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Conversion of Company Common Stock.</U>  Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section&nbsp;2.01(b) and the Appraisal Shares), together with the Rights associated therewith, shall be converted into the right to receive $37.50 in cash, without interest (the &quot;<U>Merger Consideration</U>&quot;).  At the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock and associated Rights shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a &quot;<U>Certificate</U>&quot;) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration.  The right of any holder of a Certificate to receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding that is required under applicable tax law.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Appraisal Rights.</U>  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares (the &quot;<U>Appraisal Shares</U>&quot;) of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section&nbsp;262 of the DGCL (&quot;<U>Section&nbsp;262</U>&quot;) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section&nbsp;2.01(c), but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section&nbsp;262.  At the Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section&nbsp;262.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section&nbsp;262, or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section&nbsp;262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's Appraisal Shares under Section&nbsp;262 shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section&nbsp;2.01(c).  The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.</P>
<P><A NAME="_Toc146111169">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 2.02.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Exchange of Certificates.</U>  (a)  <U>Paying Agent.</U>  Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent, which shall be a nationally recognized financial institution or other person that routinely acts in such capacity, to act as paying agent (the &quot;<U>Paying Agent</U>&quot;) for the payment of the Merger Consideration.  At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.01(c) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the &quot;<U>Exchange Fund</U>&quot;).</A></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Exchange Procedures.</U>  As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i)&nbsp;a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii)&nbsp;instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration.  Each holder of record of a Certificate shall, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash which the number of shares of Company Common Stock (together with the associated Rights) previously represented by such Certificate shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.01(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.  In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such taxes have been paid or are not applicable.  Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section&nbsp;2.02(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration which the holder thereof has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant to this Article&nbsp;II.  No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article&nbsp;II.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock.</U>  All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article&nbsp;II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock (together with the associated Rights) formerly represented by such Certificates.  At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.  If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, it shall be canceled against delivery of cash to the holder thereof as provided in this Article&nbsp;II.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Termination of the Exchange Fund.</U>  Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article&nbsp;II shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>No Liability.</U>  None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.  If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to two years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Investment of Exchange Fund.</U>  The Paying Agent shall invest the cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent.  Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid from time to time to Parent, upon request.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Lost Certificates.</U>  If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect thereto.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Withholding Rights.</U>  Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &quot;<U>Code</U>&quot;), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law.  To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.</P>

<P><A NAME="_Toc146111175">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 4.02.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>No Solicitation.</U>  (a)  The Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers or employees or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other advisor, agent or representative (collectively, &quot;<U>Representatives</U>&quot;) retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly through another person, (i)&nbsp;solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or take any other action designed to, or which would reasonably be expected to, facilitate, any Takeover Proposal or (ii)&nbsp;enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any information, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any Takeover Proposal.  The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any person conducted heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal and request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and which Takeover Proposal was not solicited after the date hereof and was made after the date hereof and did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section&nbsp;4.02(a), the Company may, if its Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable law, and subject to compliance with Section&nbsp;4.02(c), (x)&nbsp;furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement (which (A) need not restrict such person from making any unsolicited Takeover Proposal and (B) shall permit the Company to comply with the terms of Section 4.02(c)) not less restrictive of such person than the Confidentiality Agreement; <U>provided</U> that all such information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such person, and (y)&nbsp;participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal.</A></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term &quot;<U>Takeover Proposal</U>&quot; means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person (other than Parent) relating to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of transactions, of assets or businesses that constitute 15% or more of the revenues, net income or the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person (other than Parent) beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, binding share exchange or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to which any person (other than Parent) or the stockholders of any person (other than Parent) would own 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or of any resulting parent company of the Company, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term &quot;<U>Superior Proposal</U>&quot; means any bona fide Takeover Proposal made by a third party that if consummated would result in such person (or its stockholders) owning, directly or indirectly, more than 80% of the shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding (or of the surviving entity in a merger or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or more than 80% of the assets of the Company, which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be (i)&nbsp;more favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the Merger (taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the financial terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such offer or otherwise)) and (ii)&nbsp;reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A)&nbsp;withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors or any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B)&nbsp;recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause&nbsp;(i) being referred to as a &quot;<U>Company Adverse Recommendation Change</U>&quot;) or&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement constituting or related to, or that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section&nbsp;4.02(a)) (an &quot;<U>Acquisition Agreement</U>&quot;).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company may, if such Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable law, (x) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or (y)&nbsp;in response to a Superior Proposal that was not solicited after the date hereof and was made after the date hereof and did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 4.02, cause the Company to terminate this Agreement (and concurrently with such termination enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal); <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that (1) no Company Adverse Recommendation Change may be made and (2)&nbsp;no such termination of this Agreement by the Company may be made, in each case until after the third&nbsp;business day following Parent's receipt of written notice from the Company advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section&nbsp;4.02(b). Such notice from the Company to Parent shall specify the reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the Board of Directors (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new written notice by the Company and a new three business day period).  In determining whether to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 4.02(b), the Board of Directors of the Company shall take into account any changes to the financial terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to any such written notice by the Company or otherwise.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs&nbsp;(a) and (b)&nbsp;of this Section&nbsp;4.02, the Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of any Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Takeover Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the person making any such Takeover Proposal.  The Company shall (i)&nbsp;keep Parent fully informed of the status and details (including any change to the terms thereof) of any such Takeover Proposal and any discussions and negotiations concerning the material terms and conditions thereof and (ii)&nbsp;provide to Parent any written proposals, term sheets, amendments, drafts of agreements and similar written documents exchanged between the Company or any of its officers, directors, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors, on the one hand, and the party making a Takeover Proposal or any of its officers, directors, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors, on the other hand, as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt or delivery thereof; <U>provided</U> that, in the case of this clause&nbsp;(ii), (x)&nbsp;such documents are readily available to the Company or its outside counsel and (y)&nbsp;the provision of such documents would not in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Company impose a material administrative burden on the Company.</P>

Such reasonable best efforts and cooperation will include causing its counsel (i) to promptly inform the other of any oral communication with, and provide copies of written communications with, any Governmental Entity regarding any such filings or applications or any such transaction, (ii) to communicate with each other regarding the content of any communication with and response to personnel of such Governmental Entity, including the content of any written or oral presentation or submission to any Governmental Entity and (iii) to comply promptly with any inquiries or requests for additional information from any such Governmental Entity, unless otherwise agreed to by the other party, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld. None of Parent, the Company nor any of their respective Subsidiaries will independently participate in any meeting or discussion with any Governmental Entity in respect of any such filings, applications, investigation or other inquiry without giving, in the case of Parent and its Subsidiaries, the Company, and in the case of the Company and its Subsidiaries, Parent, prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by the relevant Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend and participate (which, at the request of Parent or Company, as applicable, will be limited to outside antitrust counsel only).  Parent agrees to take any and all reasonable steps within its control and necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any applicable antitrust or competition law that any Governmental Entity asserts so as to enable the parties to expeditiously close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger). None of Parent, Sub or the Company shall take any action that would reasonably be expected to hinder or delay in any material respect the obtaining of clearance or the expiration of the required waiting period under the HSR Act and regulations or any Other Antitrust Laws. Parent and its Subsidiaries will be obligated to contest, administratively or in court, any ruling, order or other action of any Governmental Entity respecting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to any applicable antitrust or competition law, except to the extent that Parent determines, in its reasonable good faith judgment, that there is no reasonable legal basis for contesting such ruling, order or other action or no reasonable prospect of a favorable determination thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent to agree to, or proffer to, (x) divest or hold separate any assets or any portion of any business of, or modify or accept conditions with respect to the business operations of, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (not including the Company following the Effective Time), or (y) divest or hold separate any significant assets or any significant portion of any business of, or modify or accept conditions with respect to any significant portion of the business operations of, the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Company and its Board of Directors shall (1) take all action necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (2) if any state takeover statute or similar statute becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.</P>

</U><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>FIRST</U>:  The name of the corporation (hereinafter called the &quot;<U>Corporation</U>&quot;) is Maritrans Inc.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>SECOND</U>:  The address, including street, number, city and county, of the registered office of the Corporation in the State of Delaware is Corporate Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19801, County of New Castle; and the name of the registered agent of the Corporation in the State of Delaware at such address is The Corporation Trust Company.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>THIRD</U>:  The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>FOURTH</U>:  The aggregate number of shares which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is 1,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>FIFTH</U>:  In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board of Directors of the Corporation is expressly authorized to adopt, amend or repeal the By-laws of the Corporation.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>SIXTH</U>:  To the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as it now exists and as it may hereafter be amended, no director or officer of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or any of its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that nothing contained in this Article SIXTH shall eliminate or limit the liability of a director or officer (i) for any breach of the director's or officer's duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) pursuant to Section&nbsp;174 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or (iv) for any transaction from which the director or officer derived an improper personal benefit.  No amendment to or repeal of this Article SIXTH shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any director or officer of the Corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such director or officer occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>SEVENTH</U>:  The Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Section&nbsp;145 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same may be amended and supplemented, indemnify any and all persons whom it shall have power to indemnify under said Section from and against any and all of the expenses, liabilities or other matters referred to in or covered by said Section.  Such indemnification shall be mandatory and not discretionary.  The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under any by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.  Any repeal or modification of this Article SEVENTH shall not adversely affect any right to indemnification of any persons existing at the time of such repeal or modification with respect to any matter occurring prior to such repeal or modification.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation shall to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware advance all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by any director or officer within 15&nbsp;days of the presentation of same to the Corporation, with respect to any one or more actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, so long as the Corporation receives from the director or officer an unsecured undertaking to repay such expenses if it shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Such obligation to advance costs and expenses shall be mandatory, and not discretionary, and shall include, without limitation, costs and expenses incurred in asserting affirmative defenses, counterclaims and cross claims.  Such undertaking to repay may, if first requested in writing by the applicable director or officer, be on behalf of (rather than by) such director or officer, <U>provided</U> that in such case the Corporation shall have the right to approve the party making such undertaking.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>EIGHTH</U>: Unless and except to the extent that the By-laws of the Corporation shall so require, the election of directors of the Corporation need not be by written ballot.</P>
