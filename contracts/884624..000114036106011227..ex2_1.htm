**ARTICLE  III**

 

 

**CONVERSION  OF SECURITIES;**

 

**WORKING  CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT**

 

 

**Section  3.1 ****Merger  Consideration**.  Subject  to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue  of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the  Company or the
Shareholders:

 

 

(a) Subject  to the provisions of this _Article  III_   and  other
applicable provisions, each share of Company Common Stock issued and 
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any
Dissenting  Shares) automatically shall be cancelled, shall cease to exist
and shall no  longer be outstanding and shall be converted into the right to
receive an amount  of cash equal to the Per Share Consideration, payable upon
surrender, in the  manner provided in _Section  3.5_ ,  of the 
certificate that formerly evidenced such share of Company Common Stock. Each 
share of Company Common Stock issued with respect to options to acquire
Company  Common Stock that have been exercised prior to the Effective Time
shall be  treated for purposes of this Agreement as issued and outstanding
prior to the  Effective Time.

 

 

(b) The  " _Per  Share Consideration_ " shall  equal the quotient of (i)
the Total Closing Calculation Amount divided by  (ii) the sum of (A) the
number of outstanding shares of Company Common  Stock as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time and (B) the aggregate number  of shares of Company
Common Stock issuable pursuant to outstanding Vested Stock  Options that are
In the Money and directly or indirectly convertible into or  exercisable or
exchangeable for shares of Company Common Stock as of immediately  prior to
the Effective Time ((A) and (B) collectively, the " _Fully  Diluted In the
Money Total_ ").  The " _Total  Closing Calculation Amount_ " shall 
equal $333,000,000 (A) _plus_   the  Aggregate Exercise Price, (B) _plus_  
the  Aggregate Exercise Proceeds, (C) _plus_ ,  if the  Estimated August 31
Working Capital is greater than $23,000,000, the difference  between the
Estimated August 31 Working Capital and $23,000,000 and (D)  _minus_   the
sum  of (i) the amount of any Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary
of  the Company as of the end of the day on August 31, 2006, (ii) the 
Distributor Trust Fund Amount, and (iii) if the Estimated August 31 Working 
Capital is less than $23,000,000, the difference between $23,000,000 and the 
Estimated August 31 Working Capital. The " _Merger  Consideration_ " shall 
equal the amount of the Total Closing Calculation Amount minus the Aggregate 
Exercise Price. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, 
at  Closing, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required to pay any
amounts  in  excess of the sum of (x) $333,000,000 _plus_   (y) the
Aggregate Exercise Proceeds _plus_   (z) the amount, if any, by which the
Estimated August 31 Working Capital is  greater than $23,000,000, in the
aggregate upon the conversion pursuant to  the  Merger of all shares of
Company Common Stock and In the Money Vested Stock  Options.

 

 

(c) A  " _Stock  Option_ " is  any  option, warrant, right or other
security or instrument (including the Warrants  but excluding the Convertible
Notes) that is directly or indirectly convertible  into or exchangeable or
exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock. A " _Vested  Stock Option_
" is  any  Stock Option that is vested as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time.  An " _Unvested  Stock Option_ " is  any  Stock Option
that is not vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.  A  Stock
Option is " _In  the  Money_ " for  purposes herein if the exercise or
conversion or exchange price per share of  Company Common Stock issuable upon
exercise or conversion or exchange of such  Stock Option is less than (i) the
Per Share Consideration reduced by  (ii) both the Escrow Per Share Amount and
the Equityholders' Representative  Per Share Expense Amount. The "
_Aggregate  Exercise Price_ " means  the aggregate exercise price of all In
the Money Vested Stock Options  outstanding as of the Effective Time and
which are exercisable upon the payment  of cash (e.g., all vested stock
options and warrants (whether or not exercisable  via a cashless exercise
provision) that are In the Money). The " _Aggregate  Exercise Proceeds_
" means  the aggregate cash proceeds actually received by the Company from
the exercise  of Vested Stock Options during the period beginning on the date
of this  Agreement and ending on the Effective Time.

**Section  3.2 ****[** **Intentionally  Omitted]**

 

 

**Section  3.3 ****Stock  Options**.

 

 

(a) At  the  Effective Time, each In the Money Vested Stock Option
outstanding immediately  prior to the Effective Time, including Vested Stock
Options outstanding and  issued under the Stock Option Plan (the "
_Employee  Options_ "),  and  not exercised, shall be cancelled,
extinguished and terminated  and  converted into and become a right
following the Closing Date to receive an  amount of cash, without interest
thereon and less any required withholding  taxes, equal to (x) the Per Share
Consideration _minus_   (y) the exercise or conversion or exchange price per
share of such Vested  Stock Option (such amount payable in respect of any
share of Company Common  Stock into which a Vested Stock Option is
convertible or exercisable, the " _Option  Consideration_ "),  _multiplied_
_by_   the  number of shares of Company Common Stock into which such Vested
Stock Option  is  convertible or exercisable or exchangeable immediately
prior to the Effective  Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as soon as
practicable after the Effective  Time, and subject to and in accordance with
the provisions of _Article  IX_ ,  Parent  or the Company (as applicable)
shall pay to the Escrow Agent, for deposit into  the Escrow Fund (in respect
of the aggregate Escrow Amount) and the  Equityholders' Representative
Expense Fund, as applicable, on behalf of each  holder of In the Money Vested
Stock Options in respect of each share of Company  Common Stock underlying
such Vested Stock Options as of immediately prior to  the  Effective Time,
(i) a portion of the Per Share Consideration otherwise payable  in respect of
such Company Common Stock underlying such Vested Stock Options  to  such
Optionholder by virtue of the Merger equal to the Escrow Per Share Amount 
for each such share and (ii) the Equityholders' Representative Per Share
Expense  Amount, which in each case shall be held by the Escrow Agent as
nominee for  the  holders of In the Money Vested Stock Options converted
pursuant to this  _Section 3.3(a)_.  In the  event that, at the Effective
Time, the exercise price of any Stock Option  (whether vested or unvested) is
equal to or greater than the Per Share  Consideration reduced by both the
Escrow Per Share Amount and the Equityholders' Representative Per Share
Expense Amount, such Stock Option shall be cancelled  and terminated without
payment therefor and have no further force or effect.  Immediately prior to
the Effective Time, all Unvested Stock Options shall be  cancelled and
terminated without payment therefor and have no further force  or  effect.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) As  soon  as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall (i)  take  all actions necessary to cause thirty percent (30%)
of all Stock Options that  are unvested as of the date of this Agreement to
vest effective immediately  prior to the Effective Time, and to give the
holders of such Stock Options  the  right to exercise such Stock Options
effective immediately prior to the  Effective Time; (ii) notify each holder
of Stock Options that are unvested  as of  the date of this Agreement of
such vesting and such right to exercise; and  (iii)  use its Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to obtain the written consent  contemplated by _Section 
6.17_   in the  form attached hereto as _Exhibit  7.2(r)_   of each  such
holder of Stock Options that are unvested as of the date of this Agreement; 
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  any vesting of Stock Options and related
right to exercise such vested Stock  Options pursuant to this _Section 
3.3(b)_   shall be  conditioned on (A) receipt of a written consent as
contemplated by _Section  6.17_   in the  form attached hereto as
_Exhibit  7.2(l)_   by the  holder of such Stock Option and (B) the
occurrence of the Effective Time (i.e.,  consummation of the Merger). For the
avoidance of doubt, the accelerated vesting  described in subsection (i) of
this _Section  3.3(b)_   shall  occur on a _pro  rata_   basis  with
respect to each holder of unvested Stock Options, such that 30% of the  Stock
Options granted to each such holder on any grant date prior to the date  of 
this Agreement that are unvested as of the date of this Agreement shall
become  conditionally vested as described in this _Section  3.3(b)_ _._

 

 

(c) Prior  to  the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to, effective  as of the Effective Time, terminate the Stock Option
Plan so that on and after  the Effective Time no employee or other service
provider of the Company or  any  of its Subsidiaries or any participant
under the Stock Option Plan shall have  any Employee Option to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock or any other  equity interest in the Company
(in each case, without the creation of any  additional liability of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries).

 

 

**Section  3.4 ****Capital  Stock of Merger Sub**.  Each  share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (" _Merger  Sub Common Stock_
")  issued  and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
automatically  converted into and become 80 validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable  share(s) of Class A Common Stock, no par value per share, of
the Surviving  Corporation and 190 validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share(s) of  Class B Common Stock, no par value per share, of
the Surviving Corporation  and  shall thereafter constitute all of the
issued and outstanding capital stock  of  the Surviving Corporation. Each
stock certificate representing any shares of  Merger Sub Common Stock shall
continue after the Effective Time to represent  ownership of such shares of
capital stock of the Surviving  Corporation.

 

 

**Section  3.5 ****Surrender  and Exchange of Certificates**.

 

 

(a) _Paying  Agent_.  Prior  to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate
a bank or trust company reasonably  acceptable to the Company to act as the
paying agent in the Merger (the " _Paying  Agent_ ").

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) _Parent  to Provide Per Share Consideration_.  On or  before the
Closing Date, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent cash  necessary to
pay all holders of shares of the Company Common Stock (other than  Dissenting
Shares) the Per Share Consideration less the sum of (x) the Escrow  Per Share
Amount to be deposited into an escrow fund (the " _Escrow  Fund_ ")  for 
each such share and (y) the Equityholders' Representative Per Share Expense 
Amount to be deposited into an escrow fund (the " _Equityholders ' 
Representative Expense Fund_")  for  each such share, in each case pursuant
to the requirements of subsection (c)  hereof and _Article  IX_.  At any 
time following twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, all cash
deposited  with the Paying Agent pursuant to this _Section  3.5(b)_ , 
excluding the Escrow Fund and the Equityholders' Representative Expense
Fund,  which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates
representing  shares of Company Common Stock, shall be delivered to Parent
upon demand, and  thereafter such holders of unexchanged shares of Company
Common Stock shall  be  entitled to look only to Parent (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or  other  similar Laws) only as general
creditors thereof with respect to the Merger  Consideration for payment upon
due surrender of their Certificates.

 

 

(c) _Exchange  Procedures_.  Prior  to the Closing, the Company shall cause
to be mailed or delivered to each holder  of record of a certificate or
certificates (the " _Certificates_ ")  that  will represent as of the
Effective Time the outstanding shares of Company Common  Stock to be
exchanged pursuant to _Section  3.1_ ,  a  letter of transmittal in a form
reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent  (the " _Transmittal 
Letter_ "),  which  shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to  the  Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying  Agent at or after the Effective Time and
shall contain instructions for use  in  effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the payment of  the  Per Share Consideration
therefor. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Paying  Agent, together with
a Transmittal Letter, duly completed and validly executed  in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may  be  required
pursuant to the instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate  shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor payment of the Per Share 
Consideration which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to 
_Section 3.1_  (less  the amount, if any, of the Per Share Consideration to
be deposited in the Escrow  Fund and the Equityholders' Representative
Expense Fund pursuant to _Article  IX_ ),  after  giving effect to any
required withholdings, and the Certificate so surrendered  shall forthwith be
cancelled. Promptly after the Closing, the Surviving  Corporation shall cause
to be mailed or delivered to each holder of record  of a  Certificate
representing outstanding shares of Company Common Stock as of the  Effective
Time a Transmittal Letter if reasonably requested by such holder  or by  the
Equityholders' Representative. On or before the Closing Date, and subject to 
and in accordance with the provisions of _Article  IX_ ,  Parent  shall pay
to the Escrow Agent (as defined in _Article  IX_ ),  for  deposit into the
Escrow Fund and the Equityholders' Representative Expense Fund  in respect of
each share of Company Common Stock held by such Shareholder  immediately
prior to the Effective Time, a portion of the Per Share  Consideration
otherwise payable to such Shareholder by virtue of the Merger  equal to the
Escrow Per Share Amount plus the Equityholders' Representative Per  Share
Expense Amount applicable to each such share. The Escrow Fund and the 
Equityholders' Representative Expense Fund shall be held in escrow and, as 
provided in _Article  IX_ ,  shall  be available, in the case of the Escrow
Fund, to compensate Parent Indemnified  Persons and, in the case of the
Equityholders' Representative Expense Fund, to  reimburse the Equityholders'
Representative and shall otherwise be distributed  pursuant to _Section 
9.5_   to the  holders of Certificates and In the Money Vested Stock Options
cancelled pursuant  to _Article III_.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) _Escrow  Amount_.  The " _Escrow  Per Share Amount_ " shall  be
equal to the quotient of (x) $49,950,000 _divided_   by (y)  the Fully
Diluted In the Money Total. The " _Escrow  Amount_ " shall  initially be
$49,950,000, and shall be reduced from time to time in accordance  with
_Article  IX_ ,  and  shall be increased from time to time by the amount of
any interest, dividends,  earnings and other income on such amount. The "
_Equityholders '  Representative Expense Amount_" shall  be $250,000, and
shall be increased from time to time by the amount of any  interest,
dividends, earnings and other income on such amount. The  Equityholders'
Representative Per Share Expense Amount is defined in  _Annex  I_   hereto.

 

 

(e) _Payment  to Registered Holders_.  If any  portion of the Merger
Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the  Person in whose name
the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is  registered, it will be a
condition to such payment that (i) the Certificate  so surrendered will be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for  transfer, and (ii) the
Person requesting such exchange will have paid any  transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of such payment in a name other  than  the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered or established to the  satisfaction of
Parent, or any agent designated by Parent, that such Tax has  been paid or is
not applicable.

 

 

(f) _No  Liability_.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, none of the Paying  Agent, Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation (or any Affiliate  thereof) shall be liable to a holder of a
Certificate for any amount delivered  to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat  or  similar Law. If any Certificate
has not been surrendered prior to five (5)  years  after the Effective Time
(or immediately prior to such earlier date on which  the  Per Share
Consideration in respect of the shares represented by such Certificate  would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental  Authority),
any Per Share Consideration or other shares, cash, dividends,  distributions
or other things of value in respect of the shares represented  by  such
Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the 
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interests  of any Person, whether previously entitled thereto or not.

 

 

(g) _Withholding  of Tax_.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Parent or the Paying  Agent will be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise  payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any Equity Holder such amounts as Parent  (or any Affiliate thereof) or
the Paying Agent shall determine in good faith  they are required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such  payment under the Code, or
any provision of state, local or foreign Laws  relating to Taxes. Such
withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of  this Agreement as
having been paid to the Equity Holders in respect of which  such deduction
and withholding was made by Parent or Paying Agent. In the event  that such
withheld amounts are determined to be greater than the amount that  Parent
(or any Affiliate thereof) or the Paying Agent, as applicable, was  required
to withhold, the withholding party shall promptly pay to Equity Holders  any
such excess withheld amounts.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8  

 

 

 

 

 

 

**Section  3.6 ****Further  Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock**. 
The  Per  Share Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates in  accordance with the terms of this _Article  III_  
(including the per share amounts paid into the Escrow Fund and
Equityholders' Representative Expense Fund pursuant to this _Article  III_
  and  _Article  IX_ )  shall  be in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Company Common Stock  (including any rights to receive
accumulated but undeclared dividends on such  Company Common Stock, if any).
At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books  of the Company shall be
closed, and thereafter there shall be no further  registration of transfers
of shares of Company Common Stock on the records  of  the Surviving
Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of  Certificates
representing ownership of shares of Company Common Stock  outstanding shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of  Company Common Stock
(including any rights to receive accumulated but undeclared  dividends on
such Company Common Stock, if any) except as otherwise provided  for 
herein. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Parent  or the Surviving Corporation (or any Affiliate thereof) for any
reason, they  shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article
III_. 

 

 

**Section  3.7 ****Lost,  Stolen or Destroyed Certificates**.  In  the 
event any Certificates representing Company Common Stock shall have been
lost,  stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall pay in exchange for such
lost,  stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an acceptable
affidavit  of  that fact by the holder thereof and the delivery of such
other documents  reasonably requested by the Paying Agent, the applicable Per
Share Consideration  (less the amount, if any, of the Per Share Consideration
to be deposited in  the  Escrow Fund and the Equityholders' Representative
Expense Fund pursuant to  _Article  IX_ );  _provided_ , ___however_ _,_  
that  Parent may, in its sole discretion and as a condition precedent to the
payment  thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificates  (i) to execute and deliver an indemnity agreement with respect
to such  Certificate in the form reasonably specified by Parent, and that is
reasonably  acceptable to the Company, prior to the Effective Time, and (ii)
in the  case of any such Certificate representing more than $50,000 of
Company Common  Stock, to post a bond in such reasonable amount and on such
customary terms  as  Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against Parent  or the Paying Agent with respect to such
Certificate.

 

 

**Section  3.8 ****Working  Capital Adjustment.** ****

 

 

(a) Not  later  than the earlier of (i) September 15, 2006 or (ii) three (3)
Business Days  prior  to the scheduled Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver to Parent a schedule  (the " _Estimated  Working Capital Schedule_
")  summarizing the Company's good faith estimate of the Working Capital,
reduced by  the amount of the Aggregate Exercise Proceeds, of the Company and
its  Subsidiaries as of the end of the day on August 31, 2006 (such estimated
Working  Capital, reduced by the amount of the Aggregate Exercise Proceeds,
being the  " _Estimated  August 31 Working Capital_ ").  The  Company
shall prepare the Estimated Working Capital Schedule using the same 
accounting policies, methodologies, practices and assumptions as used in the 
preparation of the Statement of Working Capital as of June 30, 2006 attached 
hereto as _Exhibit  3.8(a)_   (the " _June  30 Statement of Working
Capital_ "),  which  the Company (after reasonable consultation with Parent
or its designee) is  delivering to Parent concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this  Agreement. The Company shall provide Parent with such
information as Parent  may  reasonably request to verify the Estimated
Working Capital Schedule. The Total  Closing Calculation Amount shall be
adjusted pursuant to the definition of  Total  Closing Calculation Amount in
_Section  3.1(b)_   either  (x) upward by the amount the Estimated August
31 Working Capital is greater  than  $$23,000,000, or (y) downward by the
amount the Estimated August 31 Working  Capital is less than $23,000,000
(such adjustment being the " _Estimated  Working Capital Adjustment_ "). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) As  promptly as practicable, and in any event within 60 days, following
the  Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the Equityholders'
Representative a  schedule (the " _Final  Working Capital Schedule_ ") 
with  reasonable supporting detail summarizing Parent's calculation of the
Working  Capital of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the end of the day
on August  31, 2006 (such Working Capital, subject to potential adjustments
in accordance  with _Section  3.8(c)_   and as  reduced by the amount of
the Aggregate Exercise Proceeds, being the " _Final  August 31 Working
Capital_ ").  Parent shall prepare the Final Working Capital Schedule using
the same  accounting policies, methodologies, practices and assumptions as
used in the  preparation of the June 30 Statement of Working Capital. Parent
shall provide  the Equityholders' Representative with such information as the
Equityholders' Representative may reasonably request to verify the Final
Working Capital  Schedule.

 

 

(c) The  Equityholders' Representative may dispute any amounts reflected on
the Final  Working Capital Schedule, but only on the basis that the Final
Working Capital  Schedule has not been prepared using the same accounting
policies,  methodologies, practices (including correct mathematical
practices) and  assumptions as used in preparing the June 30 Statement of
Working Capital;  _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the Equityholders'
Representative shall have notified Parent in writing of each  disputed item,
specifying the amount thereof in dispute and setting forth,  in  reasonable
detail, the basis for such dispute, within thirty (30) days of  Parent's
delivery of the Final Working Capital Schedule to the
Equityholders' Representative. (For the avoidance of doubt, the
Equityholders' Representative  may dispute any amounts reflected on the Final
Working Capital Schedule on  the  basis that the Final Working Capital
Schedule contains mathematical errors  that  were not contained on the June
30 Statement of Working Capital.) In the event  of  such a dispute, the
Equityholders' Representative and Parent shall attempt to  reconcile their
differences, and any resolution by them as to any disputed  amounts shall be
final, binding and conclusive on the Equityholders' Representative and
Parent. If the Equityholders' Representative and Parent are  unable to reach
a resolution with such effect within fifteen (15) business  days  after
receipt by Parent of the Equityholders' Representative's written notice of 
dispute, either the Equityholders' Representative or Parent shall have the 
right, upon delivery of written notice to the other Party, to submit the
items  remaining in dispute for resolution by a Qualified Accountant, which
shall,  within thirty (30) days after such submission, deliver a report to
Parent and  the Equityholders' Representative setting forth the resolution of
such disputed  items and the adjustment, if any, to be made to the Final
August 31 Working  Capital, and such report shall be final, binding and
conclusive on the  Equityholders' Representative and Parent, absent fraud or
willful misconduct.  The Equityholders' Representative shall pay any fees and
expenses of the  Qualified Accountant, provided, however, that if the Final
August 31 Working  Capital determined by the Qualified Accountant in any
examination conducted  pursuant to this _Section  3.8(c)_   is more  than
$100,000 greater than Parent's calculation of the Final August 31 Working 
Capital as set forth on the Final Working Capital Schedule, Parent shall pay 
all  of the fees and expenses of the Qualified Accountant incurred in
connection  with  such examination. In acting under this Agreement, the
Qualified Accountant  shall  be entitled to the privileges and immunities of
arbitrators.

(d) If  the  Final August 31 Working Capital is less than the Estimated
August 31 Working  Capital, the amount of the difference between the
Estimated August 31 Working  Capital and the Final August 31 Working Capital
shall be subject to  indemnification by the Equity Holders from the Escrow
Fund as provided in  _Section  9.5_. **** If  the  Final August 31 Working
Capital is greater than the Estimated August 31 Working  Capital, the amount
of the difference between the Final August 31 Working  Capital and the
Estimated August 31 Working Capital shall be paid by Parent  to  the
Equityholders' Representative on behalf of the Equity Holders within five 
(5) business days of the final determination of the Final August 31 Working 
Capital to be distributed to each Equity Holder by the
Equityholders' Representative in an amount equal to the product of (i) the
quotient of (x)  such difference divided by (y) the Fully Diluted In the
Money Total _multiplied_ _by_   (ii) the sum of (A) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock exchanged  and converted by such Equity Holder pursuant
to _Section  3.5(c)_   and (B)  the number of In the Money Vested Stock
Options held by such Equity Holder  immediately prior to the Effective Time
and cancelled pursuant to _Section  3.3(a)_.

 

 

**Section  3.9 ****Equity  Holder (other than Principal Shareholders)
Approval**. By  virtue  of the Shareholder Approval and receipt of and right
to receive the Per Share  Consideration or Option Consideration, as the case
may be, by any Equity Holder  other than the Principal Shareholders, the
Equity Holders, other than the  Principal Shareholders, (i) are deemed to
have agreed to be bound by and  subject to all provisions of this Agreement
applicable to the Company Common  Stock and Stock Options, as the case may
be, and the Equity Holders, including  without limitation the approval of the
Equityholders' Representative, the Escrow  Amount, the Escrow Per Share
Amount, the Per Share Consideration, the  Equityholders' Representative Per
Share Expense Amount and the disposition  pursuant to this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement of the funds from the Escrow  Fund and from the
Equityholders' Representative Expense Fund and the Option  Consideration,
(ii) consent to this Agreement, the Merger and the other  transactions
contemplated hereby and (iii) in the case of Optionholders,  hereby release
the Company, Parent and the Surviving Corporation from any  liability arising
from any Claim or allegation by such Optionholder that after  the Effective
Time any Stock Option entitles such Optionholder to anything  other  than
the Option Consideration.

operate its properties and to carry on its business  as it is now being

validly existing  and in good standing under the laws of its respective
jurisdiction of  incorporation or organization and has all the requisite

the Company is in possession  of  all Approvals necessary to own, lease and
operate its properties and to carry  on  its business as it is now being
conducted, except where the failure to possess  any such Approval would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or  in  the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Subsidiary. Each Subsidiary  is  duly

and each of its Subsidiaries are in full force and effect, and  no  other
organizational documents are applicable to or binding upon the Company  or 
its Subsidiaries. None of such Charter or Bylaws or equivalent
organizational  documents prohibits the holders of Company Common Stock from
validly acting  by  written consent in lieu of a meeting.

 

 

**Section  4.3 ****Capitalization**.

 

 

(a) The  authorized stock of the Company consists of 27,000,000 shares of
Company Common  Stock, of which 8,000,000 shares have been designated Class A
Common Stock,  and  19,000,000 shares have been designated Class B Common
Stock. The Board of  Directors of the Company has taken all action necessary
to rescind any board  resolution or action that would be inconsistent with
the prior sentence. As  of  the date hereof, (i) 7,743,065.55 shares of
Class A Common Stock were  issued and outstanding, (ii) 3,908,561 shares of
Class B Common Stock were  issued and outstanding and 2,299,950 shares of
Class B Common Stock were duly  reserved for future issuance pursuant to
Stock Options outstanding as of the  date hereof (the " _Outstanding  Stock
Options_ "),  and  (iii) no shares of Company Common Stock were owned
beneficially or of  record by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
_Section  4.3(a)_   of the  Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
correct and complete list of the name  and address of each holder of Class A
Common Stock and Class B Common Stock  and  the number of shares of each
such Class held by such holder. Assuming all shares  of Class A Common Stock
that are exchangeable for shares of Class B Common  Stock  pursuant to
rights granted or purported to be granted pursuant to resolutions  of  the
Board of Directors of the Company dated January 1, 2001, 7,639,888 shares 
of  Class B Common Stock would be issued as a result of such exchange and
76,398.88  shares of Class A Common Stock would be cancelled as a result of
such exchange.  _Section  4.3(a)_   of the  Company Disclosure Schedule
identifies by issuance date and Board resolution  the  shares of Class A
Common Stock that are exchangeable pursuant to such rights  and  the number
and holder of all such shares. None of the outstanding shares of  Company
Common Stock are subject to, nor were they issued in violation of,  any 
purchase option, call option, right of first refusal or offer, voting trust 
or  similar arrangement, preemptive right, subscription right or any similar
right.  Except as set forth above, no shares of voting or non-voting capital
stock,  other equity interests, or other voting securities of the Company are
issued,  reserved for issuance or outstanding. All Employee Options
outstanding as of  the  date hereof were granted in accordance with the
Stock Option Plan. _Section  4.3(a)_   of the  Company Disclosure Schedule

option, warrant or right, the extent to which such option, warrant or 
right  is vested and/or exercisable, the date of grant or issuance, the
exercise price  (and, in the case of Employee Options, whether such option is
a non-qualified  stock option or an incentive stock option), and the
expiration date of each  such  option, warrant and right, and the total
number of such options, warrants and  rights. There are no Stock Options for
any class of Company Common Stock other  than Class B Common Stock. Other
than Option Consideration, no Vested Stock  Option shall entitle the holder
thereof to receive anything after the Merger  in  respect of such Stock
Option. No Unvested Stock Option shall entitle the holder  thereof to receive
any consideration at or at any time after the Effective  Time  in respect of
such Unvested Stock Option. All outstanding shares of Company  Common Stock
are, and all shares which may be issued upon the exercise of Stock  Options
will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable  and
not subject to any purchase option, call option, right of first refusal  or 
offer, voting trust or similar arrangement, preemptive right, subscription 
right  or similar right. The Warrants are duly authorized and validly issued.
Except  for the Company Common Stock, there are no bonds, debentures, notes,
other  Indebtedness or any other securities of the Company with voting rights
(or  convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities with voting rights) on
any  matters on which Shareholders may vote. All  recapitalizations, stock
splits, stock combinations and the like (including  the  stock splits
identified in _Section  4.3(a)_   of the  Company Disclosure Schedule) of

to, and were not issued in violation of, any  purchase option, call option,
right of first refusal or offer, preemptive right,  subscription right or any
similar right, and are owned, of record and  beneficially, by the Company or
one of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries,  free  and clear of all Liens
whatsoever. There are no restrictions of any kind which  prevent the payment
of dividends or distributions by any of the Company's  Subsidiaries, and

other value based on the revenues, earnings or financial performance, stock 
price performance or other attribute of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries  or any of their businesses or assets or calculated in
accordance therewith  (other than ordinary course payments or commissions to
sales representatives  or  distributors of the Company based upon revenues
generated by them without  augmentation as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby) (collectively,  " _Stock-Based  Rights_ ")  or to 
cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to file a registration
statement  under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities

Principal Shareholders,  of the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the
occurrence or  non-occurrence of which results in any representation or
warranty contained  in  this Agreement being untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect (or, in the  case of any representation or warranty

condition or  effect that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse  Effect on the Company, and (iii) any of their
representations or warranties  contained herein failing to be true and
correct in all material respects (or,  in  the case of any representation or
warranty qualified by its terms by materiality  (including the words

agrees to cooperate  therewith as reasonably requested), to limit the adverse
effect upon the Company  and Parent, their respective Subsidiaries and

such claims have been  resolved or any such portion of such amounts is
determined pursuant to  _Section 9.9_  to be no  longer necessary to

(c) _Indemnification  of Equityholders ' Representative_.  The 
Equityholders' Representative shall incur no liability to the Equity Holders
or  the Escrow Agent with respect to any action taken or suffered by it in
reliance  upon any note, direction, instruction, consent, statement or other
documents  reasonably believed by the Equityholders' Representative to be
genuinely and  duly authorized by at least a majority in interest of the
Equity Holders  (determined on the basis of each Equity Holder's ownership of
Company Common  Stock or In the Money Stock Options, as the case may be,
immediately prior  to  the Effective Time (assuming the exercise or
conversion of all In the Money  Stock Options outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time)) (the " _Majority  in Interest_ "),  nor  for other
action or inaction taken or omitted in good faith in connection  herewith or
with the Escrow Agreement, in any case except for liability to  the  Equity
Holders for the Equityholders' Representative's own fraud or willful 
misconduct. The Equityholders' Representative shall be indemnified for and
shall  be held harmless by the Equity Holders (but not out of the Escrow
Fund) against  any loss, liability or expense incurred by the Equityholders'
Representative or  any of its Affiliates and any of their respective
partners, directors, officers,  employees, agents, stockholders, consultants,
attorneys, accountants, advisors,  brokers, representatives or controlling
persons, in each case relating to the  Equityholders' Representative's
conduct as Equityholders' Representative, other  than such losses,
liabilities or expenses resulting from the Equityholders' Representative's
fraud or willful misconduct in connection with its performance  under this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement or any other Related Agreement.  This
indemnification shall survive the termination of this Agreement. The costs 
of such indemnification (including the costs and expenses of enforcing this 
right of indemnification) shall be paid from the Equityholders'
Representative  Expense Fund, and thereafter and otherwise shall be the
responsibility of the  Equity Holders. Neither Parent, nor any of its
Affiliates (including after  the  Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation)
shall have any liability therefor.  The Equityholders' Representative may, in
all questions arising under this  Agreement, rely on the advice of counsel
and for anything done, omitted or  suffered in good faith by the
Equityholders' Representative in accordance with  such advice, the
Equityholders' Representative shall not be liable to the Equity  Holders or
the Escrow Agent. In no event shall the Equityholders' Representative  be
liable under this _Section  9.6(c)_   for any  indirect, punitive, special
or consequential damages.

 

 

(d) _Access  to Information_.  Subject  to applicable privileges, Parent
shall provide the Equityholders' Representative  reasonable access, subject
to appropriate confidentiality restrictions, to  information of and
concerning any Parent Indemnity Claim which is in the  possession or control
of Parent and the reasonable assistance of the Surviving  Corporation's
officers and employees for purposes of performing the  Equityholders'
Representative's duties under this Agreement or the Escrow  Agreement and
exercising its rights under this Agreement and the Escrow  Agreement,
including for the purpose of evaluating any Parent Indemnity Claim  by 
Parent; _provided_ ,  that,  the Equityholders' Representative shall treat
confidentially and not, except as  reasonably necessary in connection with
enforcing its rights or the rights  of  the Equity Holders hereunder or
under the Escrow Agreement, disclose any  nonpublic information from or
concerning any Parent Indemnity Claim to anyone  (except to the
Equityholders' Representative's attorneys, accountants or other  advisers, to
Equity Holders and on a need-to-know basis to other individuals  who  agree
to keep such information confidential; _provided_ ,  that,  in each such
case the Equityholders' Representative shall be responsible for any 
disclosure by any of the foregoing).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

78  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) _Reasonable  Reliance_.  In the  performance of his duties hereunder,
the Equityholders' Representative shall be  entitled to rely upon any
document or instrument reasonably believed by him  to  be genuine, accurate
as to content and signed by any Equity Holder or by Parent  or the Escrow
Agent. The Equityholders' Representative may assume that any  Person
purporting to give any notice in accordance with the provisions hereof  has
been duly authorized to do so.

 

 

(f) _Attorney-in-Fact_.

 

 

(i) The  Equityholders' Representative is hereby appointed and constituted
the true and  lawful attorney-in-fact of each Equity Holder, with full power
in his, her  or  its name and on his, her or its behalf to act according to
the terms of this  Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and any other Related
Agreement in the  absolute discretion of the Equityholders' Representative;
and in general to do  all things and to perform all acts including, without
limitation, executing  and  delivering the Escrow Agreement and any other
agreements, certificates,  receipts, instructions, notices or instruments
contemplated by or deemed  advisable in connection with the Escrow Agreement.

 

 

(ii) This  power of attorney and all authority hereby conferred is granted
and shall be  irrevocable and shall not be terminated by any act of any
Equity Holder, by  operation of law, whether by such Shareholder's death,
disability protective  supervision or any other event. Without limitation to
the foregoing, this power  of attorney is to ensure the performance of a
special obligation and,  accordingly, each Equity Holder hereby renounces
its, his or her right to  renounce this power of attorney unilaterally any
time before the sixth  (6th)  anniversary of the Effective Time and the
complete distribution of the Escrow  Fund.

 

 

(iii) Each  Equity Holder hereby waives any and all defenses which may be
available to  contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the Equityholders'
Representative  taken in good faith under the Escrow Agreement.

 

 

(iv) Notwithstanding  the power of attorney granted in this _Section  9.6_
,  no  agreement, instrument, acknowledgement or other act or document shall
be  ineffective by reason only of the holders of a Majority in Interest
having  signed or given such directly instead of the
Equityholders' Representative.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

79  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(g) _Liability_.  If the  Equityholders' Representative is required by the
terms of the Escrow Agreement  to determine the occurrence of any event or
contingency, the Equityholders' Representative shall, in making such
determination, be liable to the Equity  Holders only for his proven bad faith
as determined in light of all the  circumstances, including the time and
facilities available to him in the  ordinary conduct of business. In
determining the occurrence of any such event  or  contingency, the
Equityholders' Representative may request from any of the  Equity Holders
such reasonable additional evidence as the Equityholders' Representative in
his sole discretion may deem necessary to determine any fact  relating to the
occurrence of such event or contingency, and may at any time  inquire of and
consult with others, including any of the Equity Holders, and  the 
Equityholders' Representative shall not be liable to any Equity Holder for
any  damages resulting from his delay in acting hereunder pending his receipt
and  examination of additional evidence requested by him.

 

 

(h) _Orders_.  The  Equityholders' Representative is authorized, in his sole
discretion, to comply  with final, nonappealable Orders or decisions issued
or process entered by  any  Court or arbitrator with respect to the Escrow
Fund. If any portion of the  Escrow Fund is disbursed to the Equityholders'
Representative and is at any time  attached, garnished or levied upon under
any Order, or in case the payment,  assignment, transfer, conveyance or
delivery of any such property shall be  stayed or enjoined by any Order, or
in case any Order shall be made or entered  by any Court affecting such
property or any part thereof, then and in any such  event, the Equityholders'
Representative is authorized, in his sole discretion,  but in good faith, to
rely upon and comply with any such Order which he is  advised by legal
counsel selected by him is binding upon him without the need  for appeal or
other action; and if the Equityholders' Representative complies  with any
such Order, he shall not be liable to any Equity Holder by reason  of  such
compliance even though such Order may be subsequently reversed, modified, 
annulled, set aside or vacated.

 

 

(i) _Removal  of Equityholders ' Representative; Authority of Successor
Equityholders' Representative_.  Equity  Holders who in the aggregate hold
at least a Majority in Interest shall have  the  right at any time during
the term of the Escrow Agreement to remove the  then-acting Equityholders'
Representative and to appoint a successor  Equityholders' Representative;
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  neither such removal of the then acting
Equityholders' Representative nor such  appointment of a successor
Equityholders' Representative shall be effective  until the delivery to the
Escrow Agent (so long as the Escrow Fund remains)  of  executed counterparts
of a writing signed by each such Equity Holder holding  a  Majority in
Interest with respect to such removal and appointment, together  with  an
acknowledgment signed by the successor Equityholders' Representative 
appointed in such writing that he or she accepts the responsibility of
successor  Equityholders' Representative and agrees to perform and be bound
by all of the  provisions of this Agreement applicable to the Equityholders'
Representative.  Each successor Equityholders' Representative shall have all
of the power,  authority, rights and privileges conferred by this Agreement
upon the original  Equityholders' Representative, and the term "
_Equityholders '  Representative_" as  used  herein and in the Escrow
Agreement shall be deemed to include any interim or  successor Equityholders'
Representative.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

80  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(j) _Expenses  of the Equityholders ' Representative_.  The  Equityholders'
Representative shall be entitled to withdraw cash amounts held in  the
Equityholders' Representative Expense Fund in reimbursement for  out-of-
pocket fees and expenses (including legal, accounting and other
advisors' fees and expenses, if applicable) incurred by the Equityholders'
Representative  in performing under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.
Any amounts in  the  Equityholders' Representative Expense Fund, if any,
shall be released on the  Escrow Termination Date to the Equity Holders based
on each Equity Holder's  Sharing Percentage.

 

 

(k) _Actions  of Equityholders ' Representative_.  Any  action taken by the
Equityholders' Representative pursuant to the authority  granted in this
_Section  9.6_   shall be  effective and absolutely binding on each Equity
Holder notwithstanding any  contrary action of, or direction from, any Equity
Holder, except for actions  taken by the Equityholders' Representative which
are in bad faith.

 

 

(l) _Parent 's  Reliance_.  Parent  and its Affiliates shall not be obliged
to inquire into the authority of the  Equityholders' Representative, and
Parent and its Affiliates shall be fully  protected in dealing with the
Equityholders' Representative in good  faith.

 

 

(m) _Binding  Appointment_.  The  provisions of this Agreement, including
without limitation _Article  IX_   hereof,  shall be binding upon each
Equity Holder and the executors, heirs, legal  representatives and successors
of each Equity Holder, and any references in  this  Agreement to an Equity
Holder or the Equity Holders shall mean and include  the  successors to the
Equity Holders' rights hereunder, whether pursuant to  testamentary
disposition, the laws of descent and distribution or  otherwise.

behalf of such other  Parent Indemnified Person) shall attempt in good faith

Parent  Indemnified Person's intent to seek indemnification other than
against amounts  in the Escrow Fund (a " _Non-Escrow  Claim Notice_ "), 
such  Parent Indemnified Person affirmatively elects not to control the
defense of  such Third Party Claim (such notice, the " _Non-Defense 
Election_ "),  such  Parent Indemnified Person will defend, contest,
negotiate or settle such Third  Party Claim through counsel of its own
selection (who shall be reasonably  acceptable to the Equityholders'
Representative), at the expense and for the  account of the Equity Holders,
and the Equityholders' Representative shall  cooperate with and assist such
Parent Indemnified Person in the defense of  such  claim or demand;
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  (i) the Equityholders' Representative
shall be entitled to participate in  such defense, at his own expense, with
counsel of his choosing and such Parent  Indemnified Person and its counsel
shall cooperate with the Equityholders' Representative in doing so, and (ii)
such Parent Indemnified Person will  not  settle, compromise, or offer to
settle or compromise any such Third Party Claim  unless (A) the
Equityholders' Representative provides prior written consent,  which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed so long as such  settlement or
compromise releases the Equity Holders completely in connection  with such
Third Party Claim, with no statement as to or an admission of fault  by  or
on behalf of the Equity Holders and no monetary or nonmonetary relief
granted  by or imposed upon the Equity Holders  or (B)  no indemnification
under this _Article  IX_   is  sought by any Parent Indemnified Person in
connection with the Third Party  Claim  covered by the settlement. If the
Parent Indemnified Person delivers a  Non-Defense Election to the
Equityholders' Representative within thirty (30)  days after giving the
Equityholders' Representative the applicable Escrow Claim  Notice or Non-
Escrow Claim Notice in respect of such Third Party Claim, the  Equityholders'
Representative at his own expense shall be entitled to defend,  contest,
negotiate or settle such Third Party Claim if the
Equityholders' Representative provides written notice to the Parent
Indemnified Persons within  forty five (45) days after receiving the
applicable Escrow Claim Notice or  Non-Escrow Claim Notice in respect of such
Third Party Claim that the  Equityholders' Representative elects to control
the defense of such Third Party  Claim (such notice, an " _Equityholders ' 
Representative's Defense Election_"),  and  in the event of such an
Equityholders' Representative's Defense Election, the  Parent Indemnified
Persons shall cooperate with and assist the Equityholders' Representative in
the defense of such Third Party Claim. In the event that  the 
Equityholders' Representative has assumed the defense of any Third Party
Claim,  the Equityholders' Representative will not settle, compromise, or
offer to  settle or compromise any such Third Party Claim without the prior
written  consent of Parent (or its designee), which consent will not be
unreasonably  withheld or delayed so long as such settlement or compromise
releases the Parent  Indemnified Persons completely in connection with such
Third Party Claim, with  no statement as to or an admission of fault by or on
behalf of the Parent  Indemnified Persons and no monetary or nonmonetary
relief granted by or imposed  upon the Parent Indemnified Persons. If the
Parent Indemnified Person delivers  the Non-Defense Election to the
Equityholders' Representative within thirty (30)  days after giving the
Equityholders' Representative the applicable Escrow Claim  Notice or Non-
Escrow Claim Notice in respect of such Third Party Claim, and  the 
Equityholders' Representative does not deliver an
Equityholders' Representative's Defense Election within forty five (45) days
after receiving  the applicable Escrow Claim Notice or Non-Escrow Claim
Notice in respect of  such  Third Party Claim, then the Parent Indemnified
Persons shall have complete  authority to control the defense of such Third
Party Claim and to settle,  compromise, or offer to settle or compromise such
Third Party Claim, and the  Equityholders' Representative and the Equity
Holders shall have no power or  authority to object under _Section 9.8_  or
any  other provision of this _Article IX_  to any  claim by the Parent
Indemnified Persons against the Escrow Fund for amounts  payable in respect
of any such settlement or compromise.

**Section  9.11 ****Claims  other than Upon Escrow Fund**.  As  provided
in and subject to _Sections  9.2(c)_   and  _(d)_   hereof,  upon the
exhaustion or unavailability of the Escrow Fund, the Parent Indemnified 
Persons may pursue their right to indemnification against the Principal 
Shareholders under and subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of 
this  Agreement by seeking recourse against the Principal Shareholders
individually.  In the event any Parent Indemnified Person wishes to pursue
its, his or her  rights to indemnification hereunder against the Principal
Shareholders, other  than by making claims against the Escrow Fund in
accordance with _Section  9.7_   and  other applicable provisions of this
Agreement, if the matter does not involve  a  third-party claim under
_Section  9.10_   hereof,  the Parent Indemnified Person will give written
notice thereof to the  Equityholders' Representative stating that an
indemnification claim or claims  pursuant to _Section  9.2(a)_   or any 
other provision of this Agreement is being made and specifying in reasonable 
detail the Losses in respect of the claim (provided that Parent shall not be 
bound by any estimate of Losses contained in such description). Within ten 
(10)  days from the receipt of such notice, the Equityholders' Representative
shall  provide a written notice to such Parent Indemnified Person indicating
whether  the Equityholders' Representative objects to the claim and
describing the basis  for any objection with reasonable specificity. If no
such objection notice  is  received by such Parent Indemnified Person within
such ten (10) day period,  such  Parent Indemnified Person may assume that
the Principal Shareholders acknowledge  their indemnification responsibility
for the claim pursuant to this Agreement.  If such notice of objection is
provided within such period, the Equityholders' Representative and the Parent
Indemnified Person or its, his or her  representative(s) shall then meet in
an attempt to agree upon a resolution  of  such claim. If no such resolution
can be reached after good faith negotiation,  such Parent Indemnified Person
may institute proceedings in a court of competent  jurisdiction (in
accordance with _Section  11.8_ )  to  resolve any such dispute, and each
such Parent Indemnified Person and the  Equityholders' Representative shall
seek to resolve such dispute in as  expeditious a manner as practicable.

 

 

**Section  9.12 ****Other  Matters**.

 

 

(a) For  purposes of this Agreement, a Claim that involves continuing
behavior or a  series of events, accidents or occurrences shall be deemed to
"occur" on the  first day of any alleged event, circumstance, or omission ("
_EC andO_"),  so  long as any subsequent alleged ECandO is substantially similar
in nature or  directly related to or an unambiguous result of the first ECandO.
Any other  ECandO shall constitute a new ECandO.

 

 

(b) The  indemnification obligations of this _Article  IX_   shall  apply
to any successor in interest, legal representative, heir, devisee or  legatee
of the Equity Holder to the same extent that they would have applied  to 
the Equity Holder were he alive.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

84  

 

 

 

 

 

 

**Section  9.13 ****Remedy**.  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary
herein, the existence of this _Article IX_  and of  the rights and
restrictions set forth herein do not limit any legal or other  remedy against
the Parties hereto for Claims based on fraud or willful  misconduct. In
addition, nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit any  right or
remedy that any Party may have against any other Party under any  Related
Agreement.

 

 

**ARTICLE  X**

 

 

**MISCELLANEOUS**

 

 

**Section  10.1 ****Tax  Allocation**.  In  the  case of Taxes that are
payable with respect to a taxable period that begins  before the date of the
Effective Time and ends after the date of the Effective  Time, the portion of
any such Tax that is allocable to the portion of the period  ending on the
date of the Effective Time shall be:

 

 

(a) in  the  case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or related to
income or receipts,  or (y) imposed in connection with any sale or other
transfer or assignment  of  property (real or personal, tangible or
intangible) (other than conveyances  pursuant to this Agreement), deemed
equal to the amount which would be payable  if the taxable year ended with
the date of the Effective Time (except that,  solely for purposes of
determining the marginal tax rate applicable to income  or  receipts during
such period in a jurisdiction in which such tax rate depends  upon the level
of income or receipts, annualized income or receipts may be  taken  into
account if appropriate for an equitable sharing of such Taxes); and 

 

 

(b) in  the  case of Taxes not described in subparagraph (i) that are
imposed on a  periodic basis and measured by the level of any item, deemed to
be the amount  of  such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such
Taxes determined  on an  arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the
immediately preceding period)  multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of calendar days  in the period ending on the date of the
Effective Time and the denominator  of  which is the number of calendar days
in the entire period (not taking into  account any adjustment in the amount
of Tax as a result of the Merger). 

 

 

**Section  10.2 ****Returns  and Payments**.

 

 

(a) The  Principal Shareholders shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries
to, and  the  Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, prepare and
file in a timely  manner all Tax returns, reports and forms (" _Returns_ ") 
relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries that are due on or before the
date  of the Effective Time. The Principal Shareholders shall cause the
Company and  its Subsidiaries to, and the Company shall and shall cause its
Subsidiaries  to,  pay in a timely manner all Taxes that are due on or
before the date of the  Effective Time. Such Returns shall be prepared, and
each item thereon treated,  in a manner consistent with past practices
employed with respect to the Company  and its Subsidiaries and shall utilize
accounting methods, elections and  conventions that do not have the effect of
distorting the allocation of income  or expense between the Tax periods
covered by such Returns and subsequent Tax  periods. Parent shall have the
right to review such Returns for thirty (30)  days  prior to the filing of
such Returns, and the Equityholders' Representative and  the Company agree to
discuss with Parent in good faith the items reflected  on  such Return and
any adjustments reasonably requested by Parent.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

85  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) The  Surviving Corporation shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared
and filed  in a timely manner all Returns relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries  that  are due after the date of the Effective Time with
respect to Tax periods  beginning before the date of the Effective Time ("
_Pre-Effective  Time Returns_ ").  Pre-Effective Time Returns shall be
prepared, and each item thereon treated,  in  a manner consistent with past
practices employed with respect to the Company  and  its Subsidiaries
(except to the extent counsel for the Company determines there  is no
reasonable basis in law therefore or determines that a Return cannot  be so 
prepared and filed or an item so reported without being subject to
penalties)  and shall utilize accounting methods, elections and conventions
that do not  have  the effect of distorting the allocation of income or
expense between the Tax  periods covered by such Returns and subsequent Tax
periods. With respect to  any  Pre-Effective Time Return, the Equityholders'
Representative shall have the  right to review such Return for thirty (30)
days prior to the filing of such  Return, and the Company agrees to discuss
in good faith the items reflected  on  such Return and any adjustments
reasonably requested by the Equityholders' Representative.

 

 

(c) Any  Tax  deduction arising from the exercise of Stock Options on or
before the Effective  Time shall be allocable to the appropriate Tax period
(or portion thereof)  ending on or before the date of the Effective Time. For
the avoidance of doubt,  the federal income tax period of the Company shall
be considered for this  purpose to end as of the end of the day of the date
of the Effective Time.  The  Pre-Effective Time Returns for the federal
income tax period ending with (or  if  applicable, including) the Effective
Time shall claim the deductions arising  from the exercise of Stock Options
in the taxable year that includes the  Effective Time and any unused
deductions or loss that are not used in the  taxable year of the Company that
includes the Effective Time shall be carried  back to prior taxable years, to
the extent permissible under law. If, and to  the  extent that, the Tax
deductions arising from the exercise of Stock Options  on or  before the
Effective Time would result in a net operating loss for federal,  state or
local income tax purposes that could be carried back to prior taxable  years
of the Company ending prior to the year ending or before the date of  the 
Effective Time for purposes of claiming a refund, the Surviving Corporation 
shall promptly prepare and file a claim for a refund for such Taxes, which 
claims for refunds (i) in the case of federal income taxes, shall be made
using  the procedures for a tentative refund provided for in Section 6411 of
the Code  and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, to the extent such
procedures are  applicable, and (ii) shall be subject to the review and
comment of the Equityholders'  Representative in the manner contemplated in
the last sentence of Section  10.2(b). The  Equity Holders shall be entitled
to the benefit of any Tax refunds for taxable  periods of the Company
commencing prior to the Effective Time resulting directly  from the
deductions attributable to the exercise of Stock Options, with such  benefit
to be paid in accordance with Section 10.2(d) below. If for any state  or 
local income or franchise tax purposes the taxable year that includes the 
Effective Time does not end as of the end of the day of the Effective Time, 
then  in addition to the Tax refund in accordance with Section 10.2(d),
Parent shall  pay to the Equity Holders the amount of any actual state or
local tax savings  realized by the Company or members of its consolidated or
combined group for  such taxable year that includes the Effective Time to the
extent such deductions  offset income allocable to the portion of such
taxable year after the Effective  Time pursuant to Section 10.1(b) and such
deductions could have otherwise been  claimed as a refund if the taxable year
had ended on the day of the Effective  Time. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Equity Holders shall not be entitled  to  (i) any benefit of the deductions
arising from the exercise of Stock Options  on  or before the Effective Time
to the extent that such deductions do not result  in  a refund of Taxes
with  respect to taxable periods of the Company commencing prior to the
Effective  Time  (it  being the intent of the parties that any reduction in
Taxes for periods  commencing after the Effective Time as a result of a
carryforward of such  deductions or losses attributable thereto shall be
solely for the benefit of  Parent), or (ii) any refund of Taxes with respect
to a period commencing prior  to the Effective Time to the extent that such
refund is attributable to  deductions, losses, credits or adjustments other
than the deductions arising  from the exercise of Stock Options on or before
the Effective Time shall be  solely for the benefit of Parent (with the
deductions arising from the exercise  of Stock Options on or before the
Effective Time being considered for this  purposes to give rise to a refund
of Taxes with respect to taxable periods  of  the Company commencing prior
to the Effective Time only if, and to the extent  that, the refund of Taxes
for such period(s) exceeds the refund of Taxes that  would have been received
had such deductions not been claimed).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

86  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Any  Tax  refund (including any interest with respect thereto) relating
to the Company  or  any of its Subsidiaries for any taxable period ending on
or before the date  of  the Effective Time or otherwise allocable to a
portion of the taxable period  ending on the date of the Effective Time using
the appropriate allocation method  set forth in _Section  10.1_   that is 
attributable to the  deductions arising from the exercise of Stock Options on
or before the Effective  Time  (determined taking into account the last
sentence of Section 10.2(c)) shall  be  the property of the Equity Holders,
and if received by Parent or the Surviving  Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be payable promptly to the  Equityholders' Representative
on behalf of the Equity Holders to be distributed  to the Equity Holders by
the Equityholders' Representative based on each Equity  Holder's Sharing
Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence: (i) any Tax  refund (or
equivalent benefit to the Equity Holders through a reduction in  Tax 
liability) for a period before the date of the Effective Time arising out of 
the  carryback of a loss or credit incurred by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries  in a taxable year ending after the date of the Effective Time
that is  attributable to a period after the Effective Date using the
appropriate  allocation method set forth in _Section  10.1_ ,  as 
applicable, shall be the property of Parent and, if received by the Equity 
Holders, shall be payable promptly to Parent; and (ii) if, as of such time, 
if  any, as Parent shall receive a refund that would be the property of the
Equity  Holders and payable to the Equity Holders under Section 10.2(c)
and/or the  foregoing sentence, Taxes have been asserted in writing that
would be required  to be indemnified by the Equity Holder hereunder, all or
part of such refund  up  to an amount equal to 120% of such asserted Taxes
shall, at the option of  Parent, be deposited into the Escrow Fund for
satisfaction of any amounts  indemnifiable under _Section  9.2(a)(xvii)_  
that  have been asserted or subsequently are asserted, until the time set
forth in  _Section  10.4_   hereof  or until the matter has been resolved,
whichever is earlier.


 

 

 

 

 

 

87  

 

 

 

 

 

 

**Section  10.3 ****Contests**.

 

 

(a) After  the  date of the Effective Time, Parent shall promptly notify the
Equityholders' Representative in writing of any written notice of a proposed
adjustment or  claim in an audit or administrative or judicial proceeding
involving Parent  or  the Company or its Subsidiaries which, if determined
adversely to the taxpayer,  would be grounds for indemnification under
_Article  IX_ ;  _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that a  failure to give such
notice will not affect Parent\'s right to indemnification  thereunder except
to the extent, if any, that, but for such failure, the Equity  Holders could
have avoided the Tax liability in question.

 

 

(b) In  the  case of an audit or administrative or judicial proceeding that
relates to  taxable periods ending on or before the date of the Effective
Time, _provided_   that the  Equityholders' Representative on behalf of all
Equity Holders acknowledges in  writing the Equity Holders' liability under
this Agreement to hold Parent and  the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries harmless against the full amount  of any adjustment that may be
made as a result of such audit or proceeding,  and  _provided  further_  
that  such audit or proceeding relates solely to a potential adjustment for
which  the  Equityholders' Representative has acknowledged the Equity
Holders' liability and  the issue underlying the proposed adjustment if
resolved would not materially  prejudice the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries from taking a contrary  position for any period ending after the
date of the Effective Time with respect  to such recurring issue, the
Equityholders' Representative shall have the right  at the Equity Holders'
expense to participate in and control the conduct of such  audit or
proceeding. The Equityholders' Representative shall keep Parent  informed of
the progress of any such audit or proceeding, and Parent also may 
participate in any such audit or proceeding at its expense. If the 
Equityholders' Representative does not assume the defense of any such audit
or  proceeding, Parent may defend the same in such manner as it may deem
appropriate  at its expense, including, but not limited to, settling such
audit or  proceeding.

 

 

(c) With  respect to an audit or proceeding that relates to a potential
adjustment for  which the Equity Holders are liable and as to which the
second _proviso _ set  forth  in _Section  10.3(b)_   is not  satisfied,
(i) the Equityholders' Representative may participate in the audit or 
proceeding at its expense provided that the first _proviso_   set  forth in
Section 10.3(b) is satisfied, and (ii) the audit or proceeding shall  be 
controlled by Parent.

 

 

**Section  10.4 ****Time  of Payment**.  Payment  by the Equity Holders
of any amounts due under _Section  9.2_   in  respect of Taxes shall be
made (i) at least three business days before the  due  date of the
applicable estimated or final tax Return required to be filed by  Parent or
the Company with respect to any Tax period beginning prior to the  date  of
the Effective Time for which the Equity Holders are responsible under 
_Sections  9.2(a)(xvii)(A)_   or  _9.2(a)(xvii)(B)_   without  regard to
whether the Return shows overall net income or loss for such period,  and
(ii) within three (3) Business Days following an agreement between the 
Equity Holders and Parent that an indemnity amount is payable, an assessment 
of  a Tax by a taxing authority, or a "determination" as defined in Section
1313(a)  of the Code. If liability under _Section  9.2_   relates  to a
Tax claim or liability but is in respect of costs or expenses other than 
Taxes, payment by the Equity Holders of any amounts due under _Section  9.2_
  shall be  made within five (5) Business Days after the date when the
Equity Holders have  been notified by Parent that the Equity Holders have a
liability for a  determinable amount under _Section  9.2_   and is 
provided with calculations or other materials supporting such liability. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

88  

 

 

 

 

 

 

**Section  10.5 ****Cooperation  and Exchange of Information**.   The 
Equityholders' Representative, the Company and Parent will each provide the 
others with such cooperation and information as any of them reasonably may 
request of the others in filing any Return, amended Return or claim for
refund,  determining a liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes,
participating  in or conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of
Taxes or making  representations to or furnishing information to parties
subsequently desiring  to  purchase either of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or a part of the business  from Parent. Such cooperation and
information shall include providing copies  of  relevant Returns or portions
thereof, together with accompanying schedules,  related work papers and
documents relating to rulings or other determinations  by  Tax authorities.
The Equityholders' Representative and Parent shall (and Parent  after the
Effective Time will cause the Surviving Corporation and its  Subsidiaries to)
retain all Returns, schedules and work papers, records and  other documents
in their possession relating to Tax matters of the Surviving  Corporation and
its Subsidiaries for the taxable period first ending after  the  date of the
Effective Time and for all prior taxable periods until the later  of  (i)
the expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to  which
such Returns and other documents relate, or (ii) six (6) years  following the
due date (without extension) for such Returns. Any information  obtained
under this _Section  10.5_   shall be  kept confidential except as may be
otherwise necessary in connection with the  filing of Returns or claims for
refund or in conducting an audit or other  proceeding.

 

 

**Section  10.6 ****Characterization  of Payments**.   Parent  and the
Equity Holders agree to treat all payments made by any of them to or  for 
the benefit of the others (including any payments to the Company or its 
Subsidiaries) under _Article  IX_   or other  indemnity provisions of this
Agreement and for any misrepresentations or breach  of warranties or
covenants as adjustments to the purchase price or as capital  contributions
for Tax purposes and that such treatment shall govern for purposes  hereof
except to the extent that the Laws of a particular jurisdiction provide 
otherwise, in which case such payments shall be made in an amount sufficient 
to  indemnify the relevant party on an after-Tax basis.

 

 

**Section  10.7 ****Transfer  Taxes**.  All  transfer, documentary, sales,
use, registration and any other such Taxes and  related fees (including any
penalties, interest and additions to Tax)  (" _Transfer  Taxes_ ")  arising
out of or incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be borne  by  the
Equity Holders. The Party that is legally required to file a Tax Return 
relating to Transfer Taxes shall be responsible for preparing and timely
filing  such Tax Return.

 

 

**MISCELLANEOUS**

 

 

**Section  11.1 ****Fees  and Expenses**.  Except  as  specifically
provided to the contrary in this Agreement, all costs and expenses  incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated  hereby
shall be paid by the Party incurring such expenses, whether or not the 
Merger is consummated; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  Parent shall pay
all out-of-pocket fees and expenses payable in connection  with  regulatory
filings, including under the HSR Act and any applicable Foreign  Competition
Laws (but excluding the fees of the Company's counsel related to  filings
under the HSR Act)

**Section  11.3 ****Reformation/Severability**.

 

 

(a) If  any  restriction contained in _Sections  6.14_   or  _6.15_   or
in  any definition related to such Sections shall be determined by any Court
of  competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable by reason of its extending for
too  great a period of time or over too great a geographical area or by
reason of  its  being too extensive in any other respect, then the Parties
hereto agree that  the  Court shall modify and reform such restriction so
that it is effective for  the  maximum period of time for which it may be
enforceable and over the maximum  geographical area as to which it may be
enforceable and to the maximum extent  in  all other respects as to which it
may be enforceable. If such restriction is  not  capable of being reformed,
then the Parties hereto agree that it shall be  severed from the Agreement
consistent with subsection (b) below, and all  remaining restrictions shall
continue to be enforceable according to their  respective terms.

 

 

(b) If  any  term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal
or incapable  of  being enforced by any rule of Law, or public policy, all
other conditions and  provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain
in full force and effect  so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated  hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to
any Party. Upon such  determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable  of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this  Agreement so as to effect the original intent
of the Parties as closely as  possible in an acceptable manner to the end
that transactions contemplated  hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.
