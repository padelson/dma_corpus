timely decisions regarding required disclosure and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Parent&#146;s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to Parent&#146;s
