iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 7, 2008 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is among Willis Group Holdings Limited, a Bermuda exempted
company (" _Parent_ "), Hermes Acquisition Corp., a Virginia corporation and a
direct, wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Hilb Rogal and
Hobbs Company, a Virginia corporation (the " _Company_ "). Certain terms used
in this Agreement are used as defined in _Section 8.11_.

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Company and Merger Sub
have adopted and declared advisable, and the Board of Directors of Parent has
approved, this Agreement and the merger of the Company with and into Merger
Sub (the " _Merger_ "), on the terms and subject to the conditions provided
for in this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder and for an exception to the general rule
of Section 367(a)(1) of the Code, and that this Agreement constitutes a plan
of reorganization.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as
follows:

ARTICLE I

_THE MERGER _

SECTION 1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Virginia Stock
Corporation Act (the " _VSCA_ "), at the Effective Time, the Company shall be
merged with and into Merger Sub, and the separate corporate existence of the
Company shall thereupon cease. Merger Sub shall continue as the surviving
corporation and as a direct, wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent and to be
governed by the VSCA (as such, the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

SECTION 1.2. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on a date to be specified by the
parties (the " _Closing Date_ "), which date shall be no later than the
second (2nd) Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
those conditions at such time), at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP,
767 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10153, unless another time, date or place
is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. SECTION 1.3. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall (a) file
articles of merger, in customary form (the " _Articles of Merger_ "), together
with the related plan of merger meeting the requirements of Section 13.1716
of the VSCA, substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the "
_Plan_ "), with the State Corporation Commission of the Commonwealth of
Virginia (the " _SCC_ ") and (b) duly make all other filings and recordings
required by the VSCA in order to effectuate the Merger. The Merger shall
become effective upon the issuance of a certificate of merger by the SCC or at
such later time as may be agreed to by Parent and the Company in writing and
specified in the Articles of Merger (the date and time that the Merger becomes
effective is referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

SECTION 1.4. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and Section 13.1721 of the VSCA. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all
the properties, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the
Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

SECTION 1.5. _Articles of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation_. The articles of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the articles of
incorporation and bylaws, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation,
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

SECTION 1.6. _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

(a) Each of the parties hereto shall take all necessary action to cause the
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective
Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with
the articles of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors
are duly appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation and by-laws of
the Surviving Corporation.



 

2 ARTICLE II

_EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE_

_CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES; COMPANY_

_STOCK OPTIONS_

SECTION 2.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_.

(a) At the Effective Time, subject to the provisions of  _Article I_ and this
_Article II_ , each share of common stock of the Company, having no par value
(" _Company Common Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or
the Company or any of their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries which for
purposes of clarity shall not include any shares of Company Common Stock held
in a trust established by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
be converted into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive the
following consideration (collectively, the " _Merger Consideration_ "):

(i) each Stock Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive the
number of Parent Common Shares equal to the Exchange Ratio (the " _Per Share
Stock Consideration_ "), subject to adjustment in accordance with this
_Section 2.1(a)_ and _Section 2.1(c)_;

(ii) each Cash Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration in cash, without interest, subject to adjustment
in accordance with this _Section 2.1(a)_ and _Section 2.1(c)_; and

(iii) each No Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Stock Consideration and/or the Per Share Cash Consideration in cash,
without interest, as provided in this _Section 2.1(a)_ below, subject to
adjustment in accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_.

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if:

(1) the product of (A) the Cash Election Shares and (B) the Per Share Cash
Consideration (such product being the " _Elected Cash Consideration_ ") that
would be paid upon conversion of the Cash Election Shares in the Merger
exceeds the Available Cash Consideration, then:

(A) all Stock Election Shares and all No Election Shares shall be converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration; and

(B) all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive (i)
an amount of cash (without interest) equal to  



 

3  the product of (w) the Per Share Cash Consideration multiplied by (x) a
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Available Cash
Consideration and the denominator of which shall be the Elected Cash
Consideration (the fraction described in this clause (x) being referred to as
the " _Cash Fraction_ ") and (ii) a number of Parent Common Shares equal to
the product of (y) the Exchange Ratio multiplied by (z) one (1) minus the
Cash Fraction; or

(2) the Elected Cash Consideration is less than the Available Cash
Consideration, then:

(A) each Cash Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration; and

(B) if the product of (i) the number of No Election Shares and (ii) the Per
Share Cash Consideration (the " _No Election Value_ ") equals or exceeds the
difference between the Available Cash Amount and the Elected Cash
Consideration (the " _Cash Shortfall_ "), then: 

(i) a number of No Election Shares equal to the Cash Shortfall divided by the
Per Share Cash Consideration shall be converted into the Per Share Cash
Consideration, with the remainder of the No Election Shares converted into the
Per Share Stock Consideration; and

(ii) each Stock Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive
the Per Share Stock Consideration, or, alternatively;

(C) if the No Election Value is less than the Cash Shortfall, then

(i) each No Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration; and

(ii) each Stock Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive
(i) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to (x) the difference between
the Cash Shortfall and the No Election Value divided by (y) the number of
Stock Election Shares and (ii) a number of Parent Common Shares equal to the
product of (x) the Exchange Ratio and (y) one (1) minus the fraction
determined by dividing the amount of cash determined pursuant to the preceding
clause (i) by the Per Share Cash Consideration.



 

4 (3) the Elected Cash Consideration equals the Available Cash Consideration,
then: 

(A) each Cash Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration; and 

(B) each Stock Election Share and No Election Share shall be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration.

(v) Notwithstanding the definition of Available Cash Consideration, Parent
shall have the option, in its sole discretion, to increase the amount of the
Available Cash Consideration to any amount up to and including the amount of
the Elected Cash Consideration plus the product of (A) the No Election Shares
and (B) the Per Share Cash Consideration; _provided_ that Parent may not
increase the Available Cash Consideration to an amount that, in the reasonable
opinion of counsel to Parent and counsel to the Company, would cause such
counsel to be unable to render the opinions described in _Section 6.2(c)_
and _Section 6.3(c)_, respectively.

(vi) If the aggregate number of Parent Common Shares to be issued pursuant to
this _Section 2.1(a)_ would exceed 19.9% of the Parent Common Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Maximum Share
Amount_ "), then appropriate adjustments shall be made to the Merger
Consideration to be paid or issued pursuant thereto such that (1) the
aggregate number of Parent Common Shares included in the Merger Consideration
is reduced to the extent required such that the aggregate number of Parent
Common Shares to be so issued does not exceed the Maximum Share Amount and (2)
the aggregate amount of cash consideration included in the Merger
Consideration is increased by an amount equal to the Average Parent Share
Price multiplied by the number of Parent Common Shares so reduced (the "
_Additional Cash Consideration_ "), _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Additional Cash Consideration shall not exceed the amount that would, in
the reasonable opinion of counsel to Parent and counsel to the Company, cause
such counsel to be unable to render the opinions described in _Section
6.2(c)_ and _Section 6.3(c)_, respectively.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Company Common Stock converted into
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_ shall no longer remain
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate previously representing any such Company Common
Stock or shares of Company Common Stock that are in non-certificated book-
entry form (either case being referred to in this Agreement, to the extent
applicable, as a " _Certificate_ ") shall thereafter cease to have any rights
with respect to such securities, except the right to receive (i) the
consideration to which such holder may be entitled pursuant to this _Section
2.1_, (ii) any dividends and other distributions in accordance with _Section
2.3(f)_ and (iii) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional Parent
Common Share in accordance with _Section 2.4_.



 

5 (c) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding common stock of Parent or
the outstanding common stock of the Company shall occur by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange,
merger, consolidation or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend
thereon with a record date during such period, or any similar transaction or
event, the Exchange Ratio, the Per Share Stock Consideration, the Per Share
Cash Consideration and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may
be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of Company Common
Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event.

(d) At the Effective Time, (i) all shares of Company Common Stock that are
owned by Parent or the Company (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall be
automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist and no Securities of Parent,
cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefore and (ii)
all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by any wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent or the Company shall be converted into the right
to receive a number of Parent Common Shares equal to the Exchange Ratio.

SECTION 2.2. _Election Procedures_.

(a) Not less than thirty (30) days prior to the anticipated Effective Time
(the " _Mailing Date_ "), an election form in such form as Parent shall
specify (the " _Election Form_ ") shall be mailed to each holder of record of
shares of Company Common Stock as of five (5) Business Days prior to the
Mailing Date (the " _Election Form Record Date_ "). 

(b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the Beneficial Owner
through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions), to specify
(i) the number of shares of such holders Company Common Stock with respect to
which such holder elects to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration (the "
_Stock Election Shares_ "), (ii) the number of shares of such holders
Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration (the " _Cash Election Shares_ ") or (iii) that
such holder makes no election with respect to such holders Company Common
Stock (the " _No Election Shares_ "). Any Company Common Stock with respect to
which the Exchange Agent does not receive an effective, properly completed
Election Form during the period from the Mailing Date to the Election
Deadline (the " _Election Period_ ") shall be deemed to be No Election Shares.
Parent shall publicly announce the anticipated Election Deadline at least five
(5) Business Days prior to the anticipated Effective Time. If the Effective
Time is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election Deadline shall be similarly
delayed to a subsequent date, and Parent shall promptly announce any such
delay and, when determined, the rescheduled Election Deadline. 

(c) Parent shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably
be requested from time to time by all Persons who become holders (or  



 

6  Beneficial Owners) of Company Common Stock during the Election Period, and
the Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information
reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified herein.

(d) Any election made pursuant to this _Section 2.2_ shall have been
properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a
properly completed Election Form during the Election Period. Any Election Form
may be revoked or changed by the Person submitting such Election Form, by
written notice received by the Exchange Agent during the Election Period. In
the event an Election Form is revoked during the Election Period, the shares
of Company Common Stock represented by such Election Form shall become No
Election Shares, except to the extent (if any) a subsequent election is
properly made during the Election Period with respect to any or all of such
shares of Company Common Stock. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of
the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to
determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or
timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any
good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be
binding and conclusive. None of Parent or the Company or the Exchange Agent
shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an
Election Form.

SECTION 2.3. _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) Prior to the Mailing Date, Parent shall appoint an exchange agent
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the
purpose of exchanging Certificates for the Merger Consideration. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more than
five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent will send, or will
cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record of shares of
Company Common Stock as of the Effective Time (and, to the extent
commercially practicable, to make available for collection by hand if so
elected by such holder of record), whose shares of Company Common Stock were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.1_ and  _Section 2.2_, a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or effective affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent) in such form as the Company
and Parent may reasonably agree, including instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) to the Exchange Agent in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be deposited with
the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of the
Company Common Stock, Parent Common Shares (which shall be in non-certificated
book-entry form) and an amount of cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to be issued
and paid pursuant to _Section 2.1_,  _Section 2.2_ and _Section 2.4_,
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_.
Following the Effective Time, Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange
Agent, from time to time as needed, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay any
 



 

7  dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section 2.3(f)_. All cash
and book-entry shares representing Parent Common Shares deposited with
the Exchange Agent shall be referred to in this Agreement as the " _Exchange
Fund_." The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions,
deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued pursuant to 
_Section 2.1_, _Section 2.2_ and _Section 2.4_ out of the Exchange Fund.
The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Agent
shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent;
_provided_ that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger
Consideration payable to holders of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to
receive such consideration or cash in lieu of fractional interests and
Parent shall promptly cause to be provided additional funds to the Exchange
Agent for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to
receive such consideration in the amount of any such losses. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be the property of, and
paid to, Parent.

(c) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon surrender to the
Exchange Agent of a Certificate (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof), together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly
executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, will be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) the number of Parent Common
Shares (which shall be in non-certificated book-entry form unless a physical
certificate is requested) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of
Parent Common Shares, if any, that such holder has the right to receive and/or
(ii) a check in the amount, if any, that such holder has the right to
receive, including cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
_Section 2.4_ and dividends and other distributions payable pursuant to
_Section 2.3(f)_ (less any required Tax withholding), pursuant to _Section
2.1_, _Section 2.2_ and this _Article II_. The Merger Consideration shall be
paid as promptly as practicable (by mail or, to the extent commercially
practicable, made available for collection by hand if so elected by the
surrendering holder of a Certificate) after receipt by the Exchange Agent of
the Certificate and letter of transmittal in accordance with the foregoing. No
interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu
of fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to
holders of Certificates. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall,
after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to
receive such Merger Consideration.

(d) If any cash payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be
a condition of such payment that the Person requesting such payment shall pay
any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the making of such
cash payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the surrendered
Certificate or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such Tax has been paid or is not payable. If any portion of the Merger
Consideration is to be registered in the name of a Person other than the
Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it
shall be a  



 

8  condition to the registration thereof that the surrendered Certificate shall
be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that
the Person requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration shall pay to
the Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result of
such registration in the name of a Person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent, they shall
be cancelled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Article II_.

(f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Shares
issued in the Merger shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificates until such Certificates are surrendered as provided in this
_Section 2.3_. Following such surrender, subject to the effect of escheat,
Tax or other applicable Law, there shall be paid, without interest, to the
record holder of the Parent Common Shares, if any, issued in exchange therefor
(i) at the time of such surrender, all dividends and other distributions
payable in respect of any such Parent Common Shares with a record date after
the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of such
surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such Parent
Common Shares with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment
date subsequent to such surrender. For purposes of dividends or
other distributions in respect of Parent Common Shares, all Parent Common
Shares to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if issued and outstanding as
of the Effective Time. 

SECTION 2.4. _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing
fractional Parent Common Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), no
dividends or other distributions of Parent shall relate to such fractional
share interests, including any fractional share interests resulting
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_, and such fractional share interests will not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a shareholder of Parent.
In lieu of such fractional share interests, Parent shall pay to each holder of
a Certificate (upon surrender thereof as provided in this _Article II_ ) an
amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the fractional
share interest to which such holder (after taking into account all shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by Certificates) would otherwise be
entitled by (y) the Average Parent Share Price.



 

9 SECTION 2.5. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in
such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of the Company
Common Stock represented by such Certificates as contemplated by this _Article
II_.

SECTION 2.6.  _Termination of Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock one (1)
year after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and
any such holder who has not exchanged his or her shares of Company Common
Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Article II_ prior
to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of the Merger
Consideration in respect of such holders shares of Company Common Stock.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Company
shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property Laws. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by holders of
shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

SECTION 2.7. _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Parent Common
Shares (or dividends or other distributions with respect thereto) or cash in
lieu of any fractional Parent Common Shares or cash from the Exchange
Fund, in each case delivered to a public official pursuant to and in
accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

SECTION 2.8. _Withholding Taxes_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and
withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant
hereto, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and
paid over to the applicable Governmental Authority, such deducted or withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. 



 

10 SECTION 2.9. _Company Equity Awards._

(a) _Company Stock Options_. Effective as of the Effective Time, all options
to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Hilb Rogal and
Hamilton Company 2000 Stock Incentive Plan, Hilb Rogal and Hobbs Company 2007
Stock Incentive Plan and Hilb Rogal and Hobbs Company Non-Employee Directors
Stock Incentive Plan (collectively, the " _Company Stock Plans_ ") that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Company Stock Options_
") shall, if unvested, vest in full and become exercisable, and shall be
converted into an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under the Company Stock Option (taking into account accelerated
vesting), the number of Parent Common Shares (rounded down to the nearest
whole share) determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to each such Company Stock Option by the Exchange Ratio,
at a price per share of Parent Common Shares equal to (A) the aggregate
exercise price for the shares of Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable
pursuant to each such Company Stock Option divided by (B) the aggregate
number of Parent Common Shares deemed purchasable pursuant to each such
Company Stock Option (each, as so adjusted, an " _Adjusted Option_ ");
_provided_ _that_ such exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest
whole cent and the adjustments provided herein with respect to any Company
Stock Options that are "incentive stock options" as defined in Section 422 of
the Code shall be and are intended to be effected in a manner which is
consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code.

(b) _Company Restricted Shares_. As of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each restricted share of Company Common Stock granted to any employee or
director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under a Company Stock Plan
that is outstanding as of such time (collectively, the " _Company Restricted
Shares_ ") shall vest in full and the restrictions thereon shall lapse (with
any performance goals to be deemed achieved at the maximum level), and, as of
the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock that was formerly a
Company Restricted Share shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
determined in accordance with _Section 2.1_ based on the holders election in
accordance with _Section 2.2_; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, upon the
lapsing of restrictions with respect to each such Company Restricted Share,
the Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold such amounts as may be
required to be deducted and withheld under the Code and any applicable state
or local tax law with respect to the lapsing of such restrictions.

(c) _Company Deferred Units_. At the Effective Time, each right under the
Company Plans (other than the Company 401(k) Plan) of any kind, contingent or
accrued, to acquire or receive Company Common Stock or benefits measured by
the value of Company Common Stock (other than Company Stock Options and
Company Restricted Shares), including, the deferred Company share units held
in the accounts under the Companys Executive Voluntary Deferral Plan and the
Companys Outside Directors Deferral Plan (the " _Deferred
Compensation Plans_ ") (such rights collectively referred to herein as the "
_Company Deferred Units_ ") shall, at the election of the holder of such
right, be converted into an obligation to pay or provide, at the time
specified in the applicable plan, agreement or arrangement, either (x) shares
determined based on a  



 

11  notional investment account denominated in a number of Parent Common Shares
equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Deferred Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time, times
(ii) the Exchange Ratio (" _Adjusted Deferred Units_ ") or (y) an amount of
cash equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Deferred Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time times
(ii) the Per Share Cash Consideration. In either case, such obligation shall
be payable or distributable in accordance with the terms of the agreement,
plan or arrangement relating to such Company Deferred Units (or, if earlier,
on the death of the holder thereof) and, prior to the time of distribution,
such amounts shall be permitted to be deemed invested in the investment
options available under the applicable Company Plan as in effect as of the
date hereof, as elected by each holder. Any holder who does not submit an
election will be deemed to have elected to convert the applicable Company
Deferred Units into Adjusted Deferred Units.

(d) Before the Closing, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if
appropriate, any committee of the Board of Directors of the Company
administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions to
effectuate the treatment of the Company Stock Options, Company Restricted
Shares and Company Deferred Units set forth in _Sections 2.9(a)_ through
_(c)_.

(e) No later than the Closing Date, by virtue of the Merger and without the
need of any further corporate action, Parent shall assume the Company
Stock Plans and the Company Plans under which the Company Deferred Units are
provided, with the result that all obligations of the Company under the
Company Stock Plans and the Company Plans under which the Company Deferred
Units are provided, including with respect to Company Stock Options
outstanding at the Effective Time (adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.9(a)_) and
Company Deferred Units (adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.9(c)_), shall be
obligations of Parent following the Effective Time.

(f) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall prepare and
file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or another appropriate form) registering a
number of Parent Common Shares equal to the number of Parent Common Shares
subject to the Adjusted Options and, if applicable, the Adjusted Deferred
Units. Such registration statement shall be kept effective (and the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses required thereby shall be maintained)
at least for so long as any Adjusted Options or any unsettled awards granted
under the Company Stock Plans or the Company Plans under which the Company
Deferred Units are provided remain outstanding after the Effective Time.

(g) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to
the holders of Adjusted Options and, if applicable, the Adjusted Deferred
Units. appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the
Company Stock Plans and the agreements evidencing the grants of such Company
Stock Options and, if applicable, the Company Plans under which the Company
Deferred Units are provided, after giving effect to the Merger and
the adjustments required by this _Section 2.9_.



 

12 (h) Except as otherwise contemplated by this _Section 2.9_ and except to the
extent required under the respective terms of the Company Stock Options, all
restrictions or limitations on transfer and vesting with respect to Company
Stock Options awarded under the Company Stock Plans or any other plan, program
or arrangement of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to the extent that
such restrictions or limitations shall not have already lapsed, shall remain
in full force and effect with respect to such Company Stock Options after
giving effect to the Merger and the assumption by Parent as set forth above.

looking in nature) or in a letter (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ")
delivered to Parent by the Company prior to the execution of this Agreement
(the disclosure in any Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall apply
only to the indicated section of this Agreement except to the extent that it
is readily apparent that such disclosure is relevant to another Section of

Merger Sub, on the date hereof and as of the Closing Date (except to the

properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted and as currently proposed by its management to be conducted. Each of
the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do business
and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,

Approval, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions have been
duly authorized and  



 

15  approved, and the Agreement (including the Plan) has been duly adopted, by
the Board of Directors of the Company. Subject to obtaining the
Company Shareholder Approval, no other corporate action on the part of the
Company is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
Transactions. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Company and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the
other parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except
that such enforceability (i) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of
general application affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors

including the Merger, and (ii) resolved to recommend that the shareholders of

violate any provision of the Company Charter Documents or any of the
Subsidiary Documents or (ii) assuming that the authorizations, consents and

credit agreement, debenture, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust,
license, lease, contract or other agreement, instrument or obligation (each, a
" _Contract_ ") or Permit, to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party, or by which they or any of their respective properties or assets
may be bound or affected except, in the case of clause (B), for such
violations, conflicts, losses, defaults, terminations, cancellations,
accelerations or Liens as, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

requirements of, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ "), and the
rules of the NYSE, (ii) the filing of the Articles of Merger with the SCC
pursuant to the VSCA, (iii) filings required under, and compliance with other
applicable requirements of, the HSR Act and (iv) filings required under, and

the European Community, as amended (the " _EC Merger Regulation_ ")
(collectively, " _Foreign Antitrust Laws_ "), no consents or approvals of, or
filings, declarations or registrations with, any Governmental Authority are
necessary for the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
the Company and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions, other
than such other consents, approvals, filings, declarations or registrations
that, if not obtained, made or given, could not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse impact on
Parent or the Company or impair in any material respect the ability of Parent
or the Company to perform its obligations hereunder, or prevent or materially
impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the Transactions.

SECTION 3.5. _Company SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_. 

(a) The Company has filed and furnished all required reports, schedules,
forms, certifications, prospectuses and registration, proxy and other
statements with the SEC since January 1, 2005 (collectively, and together with
all exhibits and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference
therein, the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). None of the Companys Subsidiaries
is required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange
Act. As of their respective effective dates (in the case of Company SEC
Documents that are registration statements filed pursuant to the requirements
of the Securities Act) and as of their respective SEC filing dates (in the
case of all other Company SEC Documents) or, if amended or superseded by a
subsequent filing made prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such
amendment or superseding filing, the Company SEC Documents complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities
Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, applicable to such Company
SEC Documents, and none of the Company SEC Documents as of such respective
dates contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.



 

17 (b) The consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the
Company SEC Documents (i) comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
(except, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated in the
notes thereto) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and (iii) fairly present in
all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and
its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated
results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended
(subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end
audit adjustments, none of which has been or will be, individually or in the
aggregate, material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole).
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such financial statements
and other financial information included in the Company SEC Documents fairly
present (within the meaning of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) in all material
respects the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as
of, and for, the periods presented in such Company SEC Documents.

(c) The Company has established and maintains internal controls over financial
reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined
in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act). Such disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information
relating to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to
be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Companys principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in SEC rules and forms. The Companys principal executive officer
and its principal financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent
evaluation, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company (i) all significant deficiencies in the design or
operation of internal controls that could adversely affect the Companys
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and have
identified for the Companys auditors any material weaknesses in internal
controls and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal
controls. The principal executive officer and the principal financial officer
of the Company have made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, the Exchange Act and any related rules and regulations promulgated by
the SEC with respect to the Company SEC Documents, and the statements
contained in such certifications are complete and correct. The management of
the Company has completed its assessment of the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended
December 31, 2007, and such assessment concluded that such controls were
effective. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no facts or

engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction within the meaning of Section
4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA which would reasonably be expected to
result in any material liability to the Company or the Company Plans. The

operated in good faith compliance in all material respects with the applicable

compensatory arrangement, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under
any Company Plan, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or
vesting of any such benefits under any Company Plan, or (iv) require any
contributions or payments to fund any obligations under any Company Plan.

(i) The Company does not have any contract, whether legally binding or not, to
create any additional Company Plan or to materially modify any existing
Company Plan.

material part of the assets of any Company Plan.

(k) Except for noncompliance that would not reasonably be expected to cause
material liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries, any individual

any of its Subsidiaries entered into any collective bargaining agreement or
union contract recognizing any labor organization as the bargaining agent of

complete copies of each Material Contract in existence as of the date hereof,
together with any and all amendments and supplements thereto and material
"side letters" and similar documentation relating thereto.



 

29 (b) Each of the Material Contracts is valid, binding and in full force and
effect and is enforceable in accordance with its terms by the Company and its
Subsidiaries party thereto, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception,
except in each case as, individually or in the aggregate, is not, or could not
reasonably be expected to be, material to the Company. Except as identified
in Section 3.13(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, or as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be, or reasonably be expected to be,
material to the Company, no approval, consent or waiver of any Person is
needed in order that any Material Contract continue in full force and effect
following the consummation of the Transactions. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries is in default under any Material Contract or other Contract
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (collectively, the
" _Company Contracts_ "), nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, does any
condition exist that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default thereunder by the Company and its Subsidiaries party thereto, except
for such defaults as, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and could
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
To the Knowledge of the Company, no other party to any Company Contract is in
default thereunder nor does any condition exist that with notice or lapse of
time or both would constitute a default by any such other party thereunder,
except for such defaults as, individually or in the aggregate, have not had
and could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice
of termination or cancellation under any Material Contract, received any
notice of breach or default, in any material respect, under any Material
Contract, which breach has not been cured, or granted to any third party any
rights, adverse or otherwise, that would constitute a breach of any Material
Contract. 

SECTION 3.14. _Title to Properties_. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries

individually or in the aggregate, material to the Companys business or
financial condition on a consolidated basis (except for properties sold or
otherwise disposed of since the date thereof in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice and not in violation of this
Agreement), free and clear of all Liens except (the following, " _Permitted
Liens_ ") (i) statutory liens securing payments not yet due, (ii) security
interests, mortgages and pledges that are disclosed in the Filed Company SEC
Documents that secure indebtedness that is reflected in the most recent

reasonably be expected to materially affect the use of the properties or
assets subject thereto or otherwise materially impair business operations as
presently conducted or as currently proposed by the Companys management to be
conducted, and  



 

30  (b) is the lessee or sublessee of all leasehold estates and leasehold
interests reflected in the Filed Company SEC Documents (or acquired after the

the Company aware of facts or circumstances that would form the basis for any
such claim against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of infringement,
misappropriation, unauthorized use, or violation of any Intellectual Property
Rights of any third Person, or challenging the ownership, use, validity or
enforceability of any material Company Intellectual Property or Company
Technology.



 

33 (f) To the Knowledge of the Company, no third Person (including employees and
former employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) is infringing,
violating, misappropriating or otherwise misusing any material Company
Intellectual Property or Company Technology, and neither the Company nor any

(including employees and former employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, is there any reasonable
basis for such a claim.

(g) The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonably adequate measures,
consistent with commercially reasonable practices in the industry in
which the Company and the Subsidiaries operate, to (i) protect and preserve
the Company Intellectual Property, including all material Trade Secrets and
confidential information included therein, and (ii) protect the
confidentiality, integrity and security of their systems, databases, and
websites (and all information, transactions and content stored or contained
therein or transmitted thereby) against any unauthorized use, access,
interruption, modification or corruption. The Company and its Subsidiaries
have executed valid written agreements with all of their past and present
employees, consultants, and independent contractors who have contributed to,
or been retained in connection with, the development of Technology
and Intellectual Property pursuant to which such employees, consultants, and
independent contractors have assigned to the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries all their rights in and to all Technology and Intellectual
Property and agreed to hold all Trade Secrets and confidential information of
the Company and its Subsidiaries in confidence both during and after their

businesses of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as presently conducted
have been authorized to be disclosed, or have been actually disclosed, by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any employee or any third Person
other than pursuant to a written confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice
from any current or prior officer, employee, consultant, or contractor of the
Company or any of its Subsidiary claiming any ownership interest in any
Company Owned Intellectual Property as a result of having been involved in the
development of such property while employed by or performing services for the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

or otherwise bound, (2) containing a covenant not to compete or any other
limit on the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries ability to use or exploit

or (3) containing an agreement to indemnify any other Person against any

_License Agreements_ "). To the Knowledge of the Company, (a) the License
Agreements are valid and enforceable in  



 

34  accordance with their terms, and, (b) there exists no event or condition
which will result in a material violation or breach of, or constitute a
default by, any party under such License Agreement. Except pursuant to the
License Agreements, no material royalties, honoraria, or other fees (other
than fees relating to filing, maintenance, and/or registration) are payable to
any third parties for the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries use of or
right to use any Company Intellectual Property.

(i) Following the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will have the right to
exercise all of the Companys and its Subsidiaries current rights under
agreements granting rights to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to Intellectual Property Rights, Software and other Technology of a
third Person to the same extent and in the same manner they would have been
able to had the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not occurred, and
without the payment of any additional consideration as a result of such
transactions and without the necessity of any third Person consent as a result
of such transactions, except as has not resulted in and would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

(j) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is obligated to disclose
or distribute the source code for proprietary Software pursuant to an "open
source" or public library software agreement, such as, without limitation, the
GNU public license. The Company and its Subsidiaries own, lease or license all
Company Systems that are necessary for the operations of the Companys and
its Subsidiaries businesses. The Company Systems are reasonably secure
against attack or unauthorized intrusion, and are adequate for the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted. In the past two (2)
years, the Company Systems have not suffered any failures or security breaches
that have resulted in a third Person obtaining access to any confidential
information of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their customers or
suppliers, except as has not resulted in and would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company.

SECTION 3.16. _Insurance_. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries maintain
insurance policies that, to the Knowledge of the Company, are upon terms that
are reasonable and customary in the industry in which the Company and its
Subsidiaries operate. All material insurance policies maintained by the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof (or summaries thereof) have
been provided or made available to Parent or Merger Sub. Except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company, (a) all such policies are in full
force and effect and (b) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
in breach or default, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no event has
occurred which, with notice or the lapse of time, would constitute such a
breach or default, or permit termination or modification under any policy.
The consummation of the Transactions will not, in and of itself, cause the
revocation, cancellation or termination of any insurance policy of the Company
or its Subsidiaries.



 

35 SECTION 3.17. _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Board of Directors of the
Company has received the opinion of Sandler ONeill + Partners, L.P., dated

Transactions, based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. The Company has heretofore delivered to Parent a
correct and complete copy of the Companys engagement letter with Sandler

Directors of the Company have taken all action required to be taken by them to
exempt this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby from the requirements of any "moratorium," "control share," "fair

authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Company, constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub,
enforceable against each of them in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

approvals collectively, the " _FSA Approval_ "), the United Kingdom Financial

Authority are necessary for the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Parent and Merger Sub or the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
Transactions, other than such other consents, approvals, filings, declarations
or registrations that, if not obtained, made or given, could not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to impair in any
material respect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform its
obligations hereunder, or prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder
or delay the consummation of the Transactions.

SECTION 4.5. _Parent SEC Documents_.

(a) Parent has filed and furnished all required reports, schedules, forms,
prospectuses and registration, proxy and other statements with the SEC
since January 1, 2006 (collectively, and in each case including all exhibits
and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein, the "
_Parent SEC Documents_ "). None of the Parents Subsidiaries is required
to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act. As of
their respective effective dates (in the case of Parent SEC Documents that are
registration statements filed pursuant to the requirements of the Securities
Act) and as of their respective SEC filing dates (in the case of all other
Parent SEC Documents) or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing made
prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such amendment or superseding
filing, the Parent SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act or the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, as the case may be, applicable to such Parent SEC Documents, and none of
the Parent SEC Documents as of such respective dates contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(b) The consolidated financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC
Documents comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
(except, in the case of unaudited statements, as indicated in the notes
thereto) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as
may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments, none of which has
been or will be, individually or in  



 

39  the aggregate, material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such financial
statements and other financial information included in the Company SEC
Documents fairly present (within the meaning of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) in all
material respects the financial condition and results of operations of the
Company as of, and for, the periods presented in such Company SEC Documents.

(c) Parent has established and maintains internal controls over financial
reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined
in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act). Such disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information
relating to Parent, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be
disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to Parents principal executive officer
and its principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and
forms. Parents principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to
Parents auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors of Parent
(i) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
controls that could adversely affect Parents ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data and have identified for Parents auditors
any material weaknesses in internal controls and (ii) any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in Parents internal controls. The principal executive
officer and the principal financial officer of Parent have made all
certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act and any
related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect to Parent
SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications are
complete and correct. The management of Parent has completed its assessment of
the effectiveness of Parents internal control over financial reporting
in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
for the year ended December 31, 2007, and such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective. To the Knowledge of Parent, there are no facts
or circumstances that would prevent its chief executive officer and chief
financial officer from giving the certifications and attestations required
pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

(d) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the provisions
of Section 13(b) of the Exchange Act.

(e) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise, whether known or unknown) whether or not required, if known, to be
reflected or reserved against on a consolidated balance sheet of Parent
prepared in accordance with GAAP or the notes thereto, except liabilities (i)
as and to the extent reflected or reserved against on the balance sheet of
Parent and its Subsidiaries as of the Balance Sheet Date (including the  



 

40  notes thereto) included in the Parent SEC Documents filed by the Company and
publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Filed Parent
SEC Documents_ "), (ii) incurred after the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice or (iii) that, individually
or in the aggregate, have not had and could not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

SECTION 4.6. _Compliance With Laws; Permits_.

(a) Except as has not had or could not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole: (i) Parent and its Subsidiaries are (and
since January 1, 2006 have been) in compliance with all Laws applicable to
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, any of their properties or other assets or
any of their businesses or operations, (ii) Parent and each of its
Subsidiaries hold all licenses, franchises, permits, certificates, approvals
and authorizations from Governmental Authorities, or required by Governmental
Authorities to be obtained, in each case necessary for the lawful conduct of
their respective businesses (collectively, " _Parent Permits_ ") and (iii)
Parent and its Subsidiaries are (and since January 1, 2006 have been) in
compliance with the terms of all Parent Permits.

(b) Except as has not had or could not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, since January 1, 2006, neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries has received written notice to the effect that a
Governmental Authority (i) claimed or alleged that Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries was not in compliance with all Laws applicable to Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, any of their properties or other assets or any of their
businesses or operations or (ii) was considering the amendment,
termination, revocation or cancellation of any Parent Permit. The
consummation of the Merger, in and of itself, will not cause the revocation or
cancellation of any Parent Permit, except for such revocations or
cancellations that could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole.

SECTION 4.7.  _Information Supplied_. Subject to the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Section 3.9_,
none of the information supplied (or to be supplied) in writing by or on
behalf of Parent or Merger Sub specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in (a) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 or any amendments
or supplements thereto are filed with the SEC or at the time it becomes
effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, and (b) the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will, on the date it is first mailed to shareholders of
the Company and at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material

statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not  



 

41  misleading. The Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will comply as
to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent and Merger Sub make no representation or warranty with respect to any
information supplied by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in any of the foregoing documents.

SECTION 4.8. _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since the Balance Sheet
Date, there have not been any events, changes, occurrences or state of facts
that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Since the Balance Sheet
Date through the date of this Agreement (a) Parent and its Subsidiaries have
carried on and operated their respective businesses in all material respects
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and (b)
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action described in
_Section 5.3_ that if taken after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time without the prior written consent of the Company would violate such
provision.

SECTION 4.9. _Legal Proceedings_. Except insofar as not, and as could not
reasonably expected to be, individually in the aggregate, material to the
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, there is no pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened, legal, administrative, arbitral or other
proceeding, claim, suit or action against, or governmental or regulatory
investigation of, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, nor is there any
injunction, order, judgment, ruling or decree imposed (or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, threatened to be imposed) upon Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or the
assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, by or before any Governmental
Authority.

SECTION 4.10. _Ownership and Operations of Merger Sub_. Parent

SECTION 4.11. _Brokers and Other Advisors_. Except for Banc of America
Securities LLC, the fees and expenses of which will be paid by Parent, no
broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other Person is entitled to
any brokers, finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or commission
in connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on
behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

SECTION 4.12. _Reorganization Treatment_. Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any
other Affiliate of Parent has taken or agreed to take any action or knows of
any facts or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to (i) prevent
the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code, (ii) cause the shareholders of the Company to recognize
gain pursuant to Section 367(a)(1) of the Code other than any such shareholder
that would be a "five-percent transferee shareholder" of Parent (within the
meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii)) following the
Merger that does not enter into a five-year gain recognition agreement in the
form provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-8(b), or (iii) prevent
or impede the ability of counsel to render the opinions described in _Sections
6.2(c)_ and _6.3(c)_ of this Agreement.



 

42 SECTION 4.13. _Ownership of Company Common Stock_. Neither Parent nor any of
its Affiliates is the Beneficial Owner of any shares of capital stock of the
Company.

SECTION 4.14. _Financing_. Parent has the financial capacity to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to cause Merger Sub to perform its
obligations under this Agreement. Parent has or will have, and will cause
Merger Sub to have, prior to the Effective Time, sufficient funds to pay the
Available Cash Consideration in the Merger.

SECTION 4.15. _Parent Material Contracts_. Except as has not had or could not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (i) each
agreement, commitment, arrangement and plan filed as an exhibit to a Parent
SEC Document (each, a " _Parent Material Contract_ ") is a valid and binding
agreement of Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent, as the case may be, and is in
full force and effect, (ii) none of Parent, any Subsidiary of Parent or, to
the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto is in default or breach
under the terms of any such Parent Material Contract and (iii) no event has
occurred, which, after the giving of notice, with lapse of time, or otherwise,
would constitute a default by Parent or any Subsidiary or Parent or, to the
knowledge of Parent, any other party under such Parent Material Contract.

released or waived any material right under any such Parent Material
Contract, other than in the ordinary course of business.

SECTION 4.16. _Title to Properties_. Except as has not had or could not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, each of Parent
and its Subsidiaries (a) has good and valid title to all properties and other
assets which are reflected on the most recent consolidated balance sheet of
Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents as being owned by Parent or one of
its Subsidiaries (or acquired after the date thereof) (except for properties
sold or otherwise disposed of since the date thereof in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice and not in violation of this
Agreement), free and clear of all Liens except (i) statutory liens securing
payments not yet due, (ii) security interests, mortgages and pledges that
secure indebtedness that is reflected in the most recent consolidated
financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents and (iii)
such other imperfections or irregularities of title or other Liens that,
individually or in the aggregate, do not and could not reasonably be expected
to materially affect the use of the properties or assets subject thereto or
otherwise materially impair business operations as presently conducted or as
currently proposed by the Companys management to be conducted, and (b) is the
lessee or sublessee of all leasehold estates and leasehold interests reflected
in the Parent SEC Documents (or acquired after the date thereof) which are,
individually or in the aggregate, material to Parents business or financial
condition on a consolidated basis (other than any such  



 

43  leaseholds whose scheduled terms have expired subsequent to the date of such
Parent SEC Documents). Parent and its Subsidiaries enjoy peaceful
and undisturbed possession under all such leases, except as has not had or
could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, (a) all such policies are in full force
and effect and (b) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is in breach or
default, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred which, with
notice or the lapse of time, would constitute such a breach or default, or
permit termination or modification under any policy. The consummation of the
Transactions will not, in and of itself, cause the revocation, cancellation or
termination of any insurance policy of Parent or its Subsidiaries, except as
would not have, or reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent.

of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A) withdraw
or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent, the Company Board Recommendation or the approval or declaration of
advisability by such Board of Directors of this Agreement and the
Transactions (including the Merger) or (B) approve or recommend, or propose
publicly to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal (any action described
in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly
to approve or recommend, or cause or authorize the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
memorandum of understanding, merger, acquisition, purchase or joint venture
agreement or other agreement related to any Takeover Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement in accordance with _Section 5.4(a)_) (each, a "
_Company Acquisition Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing (provided
that the Company has not breached this _Section 5.4_ in any material
respect), (x) the Board of Directors of the Company may effect a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal, if it
determines, in good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Companys shareholders under applicable Law or (y) if the Board of Directors
of the Company receives a Takeover Proposal that such Board determines
constitutes a Superior  



 

51  Proposal, the Company or its Subsidiaries may enter into a Company
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal if such Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Companys shareholders under applicable Law and the Company shall have
concurrently with entering into such Company Acquisition Agreement terminated
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_; _provided_ that in the case
of clauses (x) and (y) above, no such action may be taken until after the
fifth (5th) Business Day following Parents receipt of written notice from the
Company (a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Notice_ ") advising Parent that
the Company or its Board of Directors intends to take such action and
specifying the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that during any such five (5) Business Day period, the
Company shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and that any amendment to
the financial terms or other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new Company Adverse Recommendation Notice and a new five (5)
Business Day period). In determining whether to take the action contemplated
by clause (x) or clause (y) above, the Board of Directors of the Company shall
take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent (in response to a Company Adverse Recommendation Notice or otherwise)
in determining whether such third party Takeover Proposal still constitutes a
Superior Proposal.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement:

" _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person
or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), other than
Parent and its Subsidiaries, relating to any (i) direct or indirect
acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions) of assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including
securities of Subsidiaries) equal to fifteen percent (15%) or more of the
Companys consolidated assets or to which fifteen percent (15%) or more of the
Companys revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable, (ii)
direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of
related transactions) of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Section
13 under the Exchange Act) of fifteen percent (15%) or more of any class of
equity securities of the Company, (iii) tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d)
of the Exchange Act) beneficially owning fifteen percent (15%) or more of any
class of equity securities of the Company or (iv) merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; in each
case, other than the Transactions; _provided_ that the term "Takeover
Proposal" shall not include the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written offer, obtained after the
date hereof and not in breach of this Agreement or any standstill agreement,
to acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration consisting of cash
and/or securities, more than 50% of the equity securities of the Company or
all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
on a consolidated basis, made by a third party, which is not  



 

52  subject to a financing contingency and which is otherwise on terms and
conditions which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in its good
faith and reasonable judgment (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of national reputation) to be more favorable to the
Companys shareholders from a financial point of view than the Merger and the
other Transactions, taking into account at the time of determination any
changes to the terms of this Agreement that as of that time had been proposed
by Parent in writing and the ability of the Person making such proposal to
consummate the transactions contemplated by such proposal (based upon, among
other things, the availability of financing and the expectation of obtaining
required approvals).

(e) Nothing in this _Section 5.4_ shall prohibit the Board of Directors of
the Company from taking and disclosing to the Companys shareholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act if such Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to so
disclose such position would constitute a violation of applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company or its Board of
Directors or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any
action prohibited by _Section 5.4(c)_.

SECTION 5.5. _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
parties hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts
to promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to
be done, all things, necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to
Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable and to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
Transactions, including preparing and filing promptly and fully all
documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements,
registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents
(including any required or recommended filings under applicable Antitrust
Laws and in connection with the FSA Approval), and (ii) obtain all approvals,
consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions. For purposes
hereof, " _Antitrust Laws_ " means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton
Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended,
all applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws and all other applicable Laws issued by
a Governmental Authority that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict
or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or
restraint of trade or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto
agrees to (i) make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly as
practicable and in any event within ten (10) Business Days of the date hereof
and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,  



 

53  all other actions consistent with this _Section 5.5_ necessary to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
as soon as practicable; (ii) Parent agrees to file with the European
Commission as promptly as reasonably practicable the Form CO, if any, required
for the Transactions pursuant to the EC Merger Regulation and the Company
agrees to provide Parent as promptly as practicable with such assistance as
Parent reasonably requests for the purposes of filing such Form CO and, if
such a filing is made, each party agrees to supply as promptly as practical
any additional information and documentary material that may be required or
requested by the European Commission and use its reasonable best efforts to
take or cause to be taken all other actions consistent with this _Section
5.5_ necessary to obtain a decision from the European Commission declaring
the Transactions compatible with the EC Common Market; (iii) the Company and
Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (A) take all action
necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar Law is or
becomes applicable to any of the Transactions and (B) if any state takeover
statute or similar Law becomes applicable to any of the Transactions, take all
action necessary to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise minimize the effect of such Law on the Transactions; and (iv) each
party agrees to promptly make any pre-merger filing with respect to the
Transaction that is necessary to comply with any Foreign Antitrust Law, and
to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to such Law by the
relevant Governmental Authority.

(c) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions
and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a
Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, including any proceeding
initiated by a private party, and (ii) keep the other party informed in all
material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any material
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the
Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice, the European Commission or any other Governmental Authority and of
any material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding
by a private party, in each case regarding any of the Transactions. Subject
to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information (including, but not
limited to, any Antitrust Law), each of the parties hereto shall have the
right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult
the other on, all the information relating to the other parties and their
respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions. Parent and the
Company shall not permit any of their respective representatives to
participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in connection with
the Transactions unless the other party is given reasonable opportunity to
attend and participate thereat.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the
parties contained in this _Section 5.5_, each of the parties hereto shall
use its reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted by a Governmental Authority or other Person with respect to the
Transactions. 



 

54 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
the Company shall not, without Parents prior written consent, commit to any
divestiture transaction or agree to any restriction on its business, and
nothing in this _Section 5.5_ shall (i) limit any applicable rights a party
may have to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_ so long as
such party has up to then complied in all material respects with its
obligations under this _Section 5.5_ or (ii) require Parent to offer, accept
or agree to (A) dispose or hold separate any part of its or the Companys
businesses, operations, assets or product lines (or a combination of Parents
and the Companys respective businesses, operations, assets or product lines),
and/or (B) not compete in any geographic area or line of business, and/or (C)
restrict the manner in which, or whether, Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates may carry on business in any part of
the world, if, with respect to clauses (A), (B) or (C) above, such action(s)
or undertaking(s) would reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse
effect on the business, results of operations or financial condition of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, individually or in the aggregate.

SECTION 5.6. _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect
to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Thereafter, neither the
Company nor Parent shall issue or cause the publication of any press release
or other public announcement (to the extent not previously issued or made in
accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or
the other Transactions without the prior consent of the other party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except
as may be required by Law or by any applicable listing agreement with a
national securities exchange as determined in the good faith judgment of the
party proposing to make such release (in which case such party shall not
issue or cause the publication of such press release or other public
announcement without prior consultation with the other party).

SECTION 5.7. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information (including, but not limited to,
any Antitrust Law), each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the other party and its representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours to all of its and
its Subsidiaries properties, commitments, books, Contracts, records and
correspondence (in each case, whether in physical or electronic form),
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
Representatives and each of the Company and Parent shall furnish promptly to
the other (i) a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed or
submitted by it pursuant to the requirements of Federal or state securities
Laws (other than any public filing with the SEC made via the SECs Edgar
filing system) and a copy of any communication (including "comment letters")
received by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, from the SEC concerning
compliance with securities Laws and (ii) all other information  



 

55  concerning its and its Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as
Parent or the Company, as the case may be, may reasonably request. Except
for disclosures permitted by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement,
dated as of May 23, 2008, between Parent and the Company (as it may be amended
from time to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), Parent and the
Company and each of their Representatives shall hold information received
from the other pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ in confidence in accordance
with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. No investigation, or
information received, pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ will modify any of the
representations and warranties of the Company or Parent. Neither Company nor
Parent, nor any of their Subsidiaries, shall be required to provide access to
or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would, based on
the advice of counsel, cause the attorney-client privilege of such party or
its Subsidiaries to be inapplicable or violate, in any material respect, any
law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree or binding agreement entered
into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties shall make appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

SECTION 5.8. _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of
such party to obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, (b) any actions, suits, claims,
investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partys Knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party
or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the Transactions, (c) the discovery
of any fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any
event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would cause any
representation or warranty made by such party contained in this Agreement (i)
that is qualified as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect to be untrue
and (ii) that is not so qualified to be untrue in any material respect, and
(d) any material failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided_ ,
_however __,_ that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.8_
shall not (x) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other provision
of this Agreement or (y) limit the remedies available to the party receiving
such notice; _provided_ , _further_ , that a failure to comply with this
_Section 5.8_ shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or the failure
of any condition set forth in  _Article VI_ to be satisfied unless the
underlying fact, circumstance or failure would independently result in the
failure of a condition set forth in _Article VI_ to be satisfied.

SECTION 5.9. _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Parent and the Surviving Corporation agree that all rights to exculpation,
advancement of expenses, and indemnification with respect to acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including any matters arising in
 



 

56  connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, existing in
favor of the current or former directors and officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") by virtue of any provision
of the Companys articles of incorporation, by-laws or comparable
organizational documents of its Subsidiaries or any indemnification or other
agreement shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect
following the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall (i) maintain in effect (A) the current provisions
regarding exculpation, advancement of expenses, and indemnification of
officers and directors contained in the Companys articles of incorporation,
by-laws or other comparable organizational documents, and (B) any
indemnification agreements of the Company with any of its directors, officers
and employees existing as of the date hereof, and (ii) jointly and severally
indemnify the Indemnitees to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law.

(b) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall maintain directors and officers liability and fiduciary liability
insurance policies (" _D and O Insurance_") with respect to acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each person now covered by
the Companys D and O Insurance with terms with respect to coverage and amount
no less favorable than those of such policy(ies) in effect on the date hereof;
_provided_ that Parent may substitute therefor policy(ies) with terms with
respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such
policy(ies) in effect on the date hereof (subject to providing prior written
notice to the Indemnitees describing such policy(ies) in reasonable detail and
receipt of a legal opinion that such insurance meets the requirements of this
_Section 5.9(b)_), and _provided_ , that in no event shall Parent be required
to expend per year of coverage more than 300% of the amount currently expended
by the Company per year of coverage as of the date of this Agreement (the "
_Maximum Amount_ ") to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto.
If, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts to do so, Parent is
unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this paragraph,
Parent shall promptly obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for
the Maximum Amount. If necessary to obtain such insurance, one or more of the
Indemnitees may be required to make reasonable application and provide
reasonable and customary representations and warranties to applicable
insurance carriers. The provisions of this paragraph shall be deemed to have
been satisfied if, prior to the Effective Time, six- (6-) year prepaid "tail"
policies for the D and O Insurance shall have been obtained with respect to acts
or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each person now
covered by the Companys D and O Insurance with terms with respect to coverage
and amount no less favorable than those of such policy(ies) in effect on the
date hereof, and the Company shall be permitted to purchase such prepaid
"tail" policies prior to the Effective Time, so long as the cost for
such policies does not exceed the total aggregate amount that Parent might
otherwise have been required to expend under this paragraph. If such prepaid
"tail" policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain such polices in full force and effect to
their full term, and continue to honor obligations thereunder.



 

57 (c) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 5.9_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 5.9_. The provisions of this _Section 5.9_
are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and his or her heirs.
Following the Effective Time, the obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under this  _Section 5.9_ shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnitee to whom this _Section
5.9_ applies without the consent of each such affected Indemnitee.

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 5.9_.

SECTION 5.10. _Securityholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any securityholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the
Transactions, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

SECTION 5.11. _Fees and Expenses_. Except (a) for fees and expenses incurred
in connection with the printing and mailing of the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, all filing and other fees paid to the SEC, and
all fees associated with the HSR Act, each of which shall be borne equally
between Parent and the Company and (b) as provided in _Section 7.3_, all fees
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the
Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses,
whether or not the Merger is consummated.

SECTION 5.12. _Reorganization Treatment_. Prior to the Effective Time, none of
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub shall take or cause to be taken, or fail to
take or cause to be taken, any action, which action or failure to act could
reasonably be expected to (i) prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, (ii) cause
the shareholders of the Company to recognize gain pursuant to Section
367(a)(1) of the Code other than any such shareholder that would be a "five-
percent transferee shareholder" of Parent (within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii)) following the Merger that does not
enter into a five-year gain recognition agreement in the form provided in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-8(b), or (iii) prevent or impede
the ability of counsel to render the opinions described in _Section 6.2(c)_
and _Section 6.3(c)_.

SECTION 5.13.  _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take such steps as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance with that certain No-
Action Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC regarding such
matters.



 

58 SECTION 5.14. _Employee Benefit Matters_.

(a) For a period of one year following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Company Employee_ "), to
the extent they remain employed during such period (i) compensation (including
base salary or wages and incentive compensation opportunities) that
is substantially comparable to the compensation provided to such Company
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits
that are, in the aggregate, substantially comparable to the benefits provided
to the Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent
shall provide each Company Employee whose employment is involuntarily
terminated by Parent or the Surviving Corporation during the period from the
Effective Time through the first anniversary thereof with severance pay equal
to one week of base salary or wages per full year of service (including years
of service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries before the Effective
Time).

(b) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its
Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective
Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be credited with his
or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and predecessor
employers before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company
Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service
under any corresponding Company Plans, except for purposes of benefit accrual
under any final average pay defined benefit plan. In addition, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a
Company Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before
the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "); and (ii)
for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be
waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, and Parent shall
cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be
taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 

(c) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall adopt such resolutions or take such
other actions as may be required to provide that with respect to the Amended
and Restated Hilb Rogal and Hobbs Employee Stock Purchase Plan (" _Employee
Stock Purchase Plan_ "),  



 

59  (i) participants may not increase their payroll deductions or purchase
elections from those in effect on the date of this Agreement; (ii) the
last purchase period under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan shall end no
later than five Business Days prior to the Effective Time, and on such date
all amounts allocated to each participants account under the Employee Stock
Purchase Plan as of such date shall thereupon be used to purchase from the
Company whole shares of Company Common Stock at the applicable price for such
purchase period (taking into account any Company matching contribution), and
(iii) the Employee Stock Purchase Plan shall terminate effective immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company shall
adopt such resolutions to (i) terminate the Companys 401(k) plan (the "
_Company 401(k) Plan_ ") effective as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (ii) fully vest the participants in their account balances under the
Company 401(k) Plan effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Prior to the Effective Time and thereafter (as applicable), the Company and
Parent shall take any and all action as may be required, including
amendments to the Company 401(k) Plan and/or the tax-qualified defined
contribution retirement plan designated by Parent (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_
") to (i) permit each Company Employee to make rollover contributions of
"eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31)
of the Code, including of loans) in cash, shares of Parent Common Stock or
notes (in the case of loans) in an amount equal to the full account balance
distributed to such Company Employee from the Company 401(k) Plan to the
Parent 401(k) Plan or other "eligible retirement plan" (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) and (ii) obtain from the IRS a favorable
determination letter on termination for the Company 401(k) Plan. In the case
of a Company Employee with an outstanding loan balance under the Company
401(k) Plan, the Company and Parent shall take any and all necessary action,
to the extent allowable by Law, to permit the Company Employee to rollover
such outstanding loan balance to the Parent 401(k) Plan; provided however,
that the Company Employee may transfer such loan only if such Company Employee
elects to rollover his or her entire account balance under the Company 401(k)
Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan. Effective as of the Effective Time, the
Company Employees shall be entitled to commence participation in the Parent
401(k) Plan, and Parent shall take all commercially reasonable action
necessary to ensure that such participation commences as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Effective Time; provided, however, that in the event
that the Company Employees are not able to commence participation in the
Parent 401(k) Plan as of the Effective Time, Parent shall amend the Parent
401(k) Plan, to the extent necessary to make the contribution referred to
below and to the extent permitted under applicable Law, to provide (and shall
provide) each Company Employee who enrolls in the Parent 401(k) Plan an
additional matching contribution (or other employer contribution) equal to the
amount of matching contribution such Company Employee would have received if
he or she were able to participate in the Parent 401(k) Plan on the Effective
Time (based on such Company Employees actual deferral election under the
Parent 401(k) Plan as of the date his or her participation does commence).



 

60 (e) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, take all action necessary to effectuate the agreements set
forth in Section 5.14(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

SECTION 5.15.  _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of Parent
and Company shall coordinate with the other regarding the declaration of any
dividends in respect of Parent Common Shares and Company Common Stock and the
record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of
the parties that holders of Company Common Stock shall not receive two
dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, for any quarter with respect to
their shares of Company Common Stock and any Parent Common Shares any such
holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.

SECTION 5.16. _Assistance with Financing_. The Company will, and will cause
its Subsidiaries to, and each shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its Representatives to, provide such co-operation to Parent as Parent
may reasonably request in connection with the arrangements by Parent to
obtain debt financing in connection with the Transactions and related matters
(provided that such request is made on reasonable notice and reasonably in
advance of the Effective Time, and provided such co-operation does not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries), including as so requested: (a) participating in a reasonable
number of meetings, drafting sessions, presentations, road shows, due
diligence sessions and sessions with the lenders and rating agencies, (b)
cooperating with Parent in connection with applications to obtain such
consents, approvals or authorizations which may be reasonably necessary or
desirable in connection with such debt financing, (c) using commercially
reasonable efforts to seek to take advantage of the Companys existing lending
relationships, including encouraging the Companys existing lenders to
participate in any syndicate organized by the lenders, (d)
reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts of Parent and the lenders
for any debt being raised by Parent to complete the Transactions, including
participating in presentations by or to the lenders and by facilitating direct

63  Closing Date, as though made on and as of the Closing Date (except to the
extent in either case that such representations and warranties speak as of

or Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in _Section

such failure was caused by such partys failure to use its reasonable best
efforts to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions.

terminate this Agreement under this _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ shall not be

(i) if Parent shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement (or if any of the representations or warranties of Parent set forth

and (ii) is incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by Parent within
thirty (30) days following receipt of written notice from the Company of such

definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, a transaction
contemplated by any  



 

67  Takeover Proposal, in each case, within twelve (12) months of the date this

2 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this
Plan of Merger (this "Plan") and in Section 13.1721 of the Virginal Stock
Corporation Act (as amended, the " _VCSA_ "). Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the
properties, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the
Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

3 _Articles of Incorporation_. The articles of incorporation of Merger Sub, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the articles
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

4 _By-laws_. The by-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.



 

A - 1 5 _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly
elected or appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation and by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation.

6 _Officers_. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their
respective successors are duly appointed and qualified or their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation and
by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

7 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

(a) At the Effective Time, subject to the provisions of this Plan, each share
of common stock of the Company, having no par value (" _Company Common Stock_
"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or the Company or any of their
respective wholly-owned subsidiaries which for purposes of clarity shall not
include any shares of Company Common Stock held in a trust established by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries), shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and
shall thereafter represent the right to receive the following consideration
(collectively, the " _Merger Consideration_ "):

(i) each Stock Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive the
number of Parent Common Shares equal to the Exchange Ratio (the " _Per Share
Stock Consideration_ "), subject to adjustment in accordance with this
_Section 7(a)_ and _Section 7(c)_;

(ii) each Cash Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration in cash, without interest, subject to adjustment
in accordance with this _Section 7(a)_ and _Section 7(c)_; and

(iii) each No Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Stock Consideration and/or the Per Share Cash Consideration in cash,
without interest, as provided in this Section 7(a) below, subject to
adjustment in accordance with Section 7(c).

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if:

(1) the product of (A) the Cash Election Shares and (B) the Per Share Cash
Consideration (such product being the " _Elected Cash Consideration_ ") that
would be paid upon conversion of the Cash Election Shares in the Merger
exceeds the Available Cash Consideration, then:

(A) all Stock Election Shares and all No Election Shares shall be converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration; and



 

A - 2 (B) all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive (i)
an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the product of (w) the Per
Share Cash Consideration multiplied by (x) a fraction, the numerator of which
shall be the Available Cash Consideration and the denominator of which shall
be the Elected Cash Consideration (the fraction described in this clause (x)
being referred to as the " _Cash Fraction_ ") and (ii) a number of Parent
Common Shares equal to the product of (y) the Exchange Ratio multiplied
by (z) one (1) minus the Cash Fraction; or

(2) the Elected Cash Consideration is less than the Available
Cash Consideration, then:

(A) each Cash Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration; and

(B) if the product of (i) the number of No Election Shares and (ii) the Per
Share Cash Consideration (the "No Election Value") equals or exceeds the
difference between the Available Cash Amount and the Elected Cash
Consideration (the " _Cash Shortfall_ "), then:

(i) a number of No Election Shares equal to the Cash Shortfall divided by the
Per Share Cash Consideration shall be converted into the Per Share Cash
Consideration, with the remainder of the No Election Shares converted into the
Per Share Stock Consideration; and

(ii) each Stock Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive
the Per Share Stock Consideration, or, alternatively;

(C) if the No Election Value is less than the Cash Shortfall, then

(i) each No Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration; and

(ii) each Stock Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive
(i) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to (x) the difference between
the Cash Shortfall and  



 

A - 3  the No Election Value divided by (y) the number of Stock Election Shares and
(ii) a number of Parent Common Shares equal to the product of (x) the
Exchange Ratio and (y) one (1) minus the fraction determined by dividing the
amount of cash determined pursuant to the preceding clause (i) by the Per
Share Cash Consideration.

(3) the Elected Cash Consideration equals the Available Cash Consideration,
then:

(A) each Cash Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration; and

(B) each Stock Election Share and No Election Share shall be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration. 

(v) Notwithstanding the definition of Available Cash Consideration, Parent
shall have the option, in its sole discretion, to increase the amount of the
Available Cash Consideration to any amount up to and including the amount of
the Elected Cash Consideration plus the product of (A) the No Election Shares
and (B) the Per Share Cash Consideration; provided that Parent may not
increase the Available Cash Consideration to an amount that, in the reasonable
opinion of counsel to Parent and counsel to the Company, would cause such
counsel to be unable to render the opinions described in Section 6.2(c) and
Section 6.3(c) respectively of the Merger Agreement.

(vi) If the aggregate number of Parent Common Shares to be issued pursuant to
this Section 2.1(a) would exceed 19.9% of the Parent Common Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Maximum Share Amount_ "), then
appropriate adjustments shall be made to the Merger Consideration to be paid
or issued pursuant thereto such that (1) the aggregate number of Parent Common
Shares included in the Merger Consideration is reduced to the extent required
such that the aggregate number of Parent Common Shares to be so issued does
not exceed the Maximum Share Amount and (2) the aggregate amount of cash
consideration included in the Merger Consideration is increased by an amount
equal to the Average Parent Share Price multiplied by the number of
Parent Common Shares so reduced (the " _Additional Cash Consideration_ "),
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Additional Cash Consideration shall not
exceed the amount that would, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to Parent
and counsel to the Company, cause such counsel to be unable to render the
opinions described in Section 6.2(c) and Section 6.3(c), respectively

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Company Common Stock converted into
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Plan shall no longer remain
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and each holder  



 

A - 4  of a certificate previously representing any such Company Common Stock or
shares of Company Common Stock that are in non-certificated book-entry form
(either case being referred to in this Agreement, to the extent applicable,
as a " _Certificate_ ") shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect
to such securities, except the right to receive (i) the consideration to which
such holder may be entitled pursuant to this _Section 7_, (ii) any dividends
and other distributions in accordance with _Section 9(f)_ and (iii) any cash
to be paid in lieu of any fractional Parent Common Share in accordance with
_Section 10_.

(c) If at any time during the period between the date of the Merger Agreement
and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding common stock of Parent
or the outstanding common stock of the Company shall occur by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange,
merger, consolidation or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend
thereon with a record date during such period, or any similar transaction or
event, the Exchange Ratio, the Per Share Stock Consideration, the Per Share
Cash Consideration and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may
be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of Company Common
Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event.

(d) At the Effective Time, (i) all shares of Company Common Stock that are
owned by Parent or the Company (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall be
automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist and no Securities of Parent,
cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefore and (ii)
all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by any wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent or the Company shall be converted into the right
to receive a number of Parent Common Shares equal to the Exchange Ratio.

8 _Election Procedures_.

(a) Not less than thirty (30) days prior to the anticipated Effective Time
(the " _Mailing Date_ "), an election form in such form as Parent shall
specify (the " _Election Form_ ") shall be mailed to each holder of record of
shares of Company Common Stock as of five (5) Business Days prior to the
Mailing Date (the " _Election Form Record Date_ "). 

(b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the Beneficial Owner
through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions), to specify
(i) the number of shares of such holders Company Common Stock with respect to
which such holder elects to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration (the "
_Stock Election Shares_ "), (ii) the number of shares of such holders
Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration (the " _Cash Election Shares_ ") or (iii) that
such holder makes no election with respect to such holders Company Common
Stock (the " _No Election Shares_ "). Any Company Common Stock with respect to
which the Exchange Agent does not receive an effective, properly completed
Election Form during the period from the Mailing Date to the Election
Deadline (the " _Election Period_ ") shall be deemed to be No Election Shares.
Parent shall  



 

A - 5  publicly announce the anticipated Election Deadline at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the anticipated Effective Time. If the Effective Time
is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election Deadline shall be similarly
delayed to a subsequent date, and Parent shall promptly announce any such
delay and, when determined, the rescheduled Election Deadline.

(c) Parent shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably
be requested from time to time by all Persons who become holders
(or Beneficial Owners) of Company Common Stock during the Election Period,
and the Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably
necessary for it to perform as specified herein.

(d) Any election made pursuant to this _Section 8_ shall have been properly
made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly
completed Election Form during the Election Period. Any Election Form may be
revoked or changed by the Person submitting such Election Form, by written
notice received by the Exchange Agent during the Election Period. In the event
an Election Form is revoked during the Election Period, the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Election Form shall become No Election
Shares, except to the extent (if any) a subsequent election is properly made
during the Election Period with respect to any or all of such shares of
Company Common Stock. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the
Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to
determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or
timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any
good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be
binding and conclusive. None of Parent or the Company or the Exchange Agent
shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an
Election Form.

9 _Exchange of Certificate_ s.

(a) Prior to the Mailing Date, Parent shall appoint an exchange agent
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for
the purpose of exchanging Certificates for the Merger Consideration. As soon
as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more than
five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent will send, or will
cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record of shares of
Company Common Stock as of the Effective Time (and, to the extent commercially
practicable, to make available for collection by hand if so elected by such
holder of record), whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 7_ and
_Section 8_, a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that the delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
to the Exchange Agent) in such form as the Company and Parent may reasonably
agree, including instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange
Agent in exchange for the Merger Consideration.



 

A - 6 (b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be deposited with
the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of the
Company Common Stock, Parent Common Shares (which shall be in non-certificated
book-entry form) and an amount of cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to be issued
and paid pursuant to  _Section 7_, _Section 8_ and _Section 10_, payable
upon due surrender of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) pursuant to the provisions of this Plan. Following the Effective
Time, Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to
time as needed, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay any dividends and other
distributions pursuant to _Section 9(f)_. All cash and book-entry shares
representing Parent Common Shares deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Exchange Agent
shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration
contemplated to be issued pursuant to _Section 7_, _Section 8_ and _Section
10_ out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the
Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that no such investment or
losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to holders of
shares of Company Common Stock entitled to receive such consideration or cash
in lieu of fractional interests and Parent shall promptly cause to be
provided additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of holders of
shares of Company Common Stock entitled to receive such consideration in the
amount of any such losses. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be the property of, and paid to, Parent.

(c) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon surrender to the
Exchange Agent of a Certificate (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof), together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly
executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, will be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) the number of Parent Common
Shares (which shall be in non-certificated book-entry form unless a physical
certificate is requested) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of
Parent Common Shares, if any, that such holder has the right to receive and/or
(ii) a check in the amount, if any, that such holder has the right to
receive, including cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
_Section 10_ and dividends and other distributions payable pursuant to
_Section 9(f)_ (less any required Tax withholding), pursuant to _Section
7_, _Section 8_ and this Plan. The Merger Consideration shall be paid as
promptly as practicable (by mail or, to the extent commercially practicable,
made available for collection by hand if so elected by the surrendering
holder of a Certificate) after receipt by the Exchange Agent of the
Certificate and letter of transmittal in accordance with the foregoing. No
interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of
fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to
holders of Certificates. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall,
after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive
such Merger Consideration. 



 

A - 7 (d) If any cash payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be
a condition of such payment that the Person requesting such payment shall pay
any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the making of such
cash payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the surrendered
Certificate or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such Tax has been paid or is not payable. If any portion of the Merger
Consideration is to be registered in the name of a Person other than the
Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it
shall be a condition to the registration thereof that the surrendered
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery of the Merger
Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar
Taxes required as a result of such registration in the name of a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance
with the procedures set forth in this Plan.

(f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Shares
issued in the Merger shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificates until such Certificates are surrendered as provided in this 
_Section 9_. Following such surrender, subject to the effect of escheat, Tax
or other applicable Law, there shall be paid, without interest, to the record
holder of the Parent Common Shares, if any, issued in exchange therefor (i)
at the time of such surrender, all dividends and other distributions payable
in respect of any such Parent Common Shares with a record date after the
Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender
and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such Parent Common
Shares with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date
subsequent to such surrender. For purposes of dividends or other
distributions in respect of Parent Common Shares, all Parent Common Shares to
be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence as if issued and outstanding as of
the Effective Time.

10 _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
Parent Common Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), no dividends
or other distributions of Parent shall relate to such fractional share
interests, including any fractional share interests resulting pursuant to 
_Section 7(a)_, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of
such  



 

A - 8  fractional share interests, Parent shall pay to each holder of a Certificate
(upon surrender thereof as provided in this Plan) an amount in cash equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (x) the fractional share interest to
which such holder (after taking into account all shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by Certificates) would otherwise be entitled by (y)
the Average Parent Share Price.

11 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of the Company Common
Stock represented by such Certificates as contemplated by this Plan.

12 _Termination of Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock one (1)
year after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and
any such holder who has not exchanged his or her shares of Company Common
Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Plan prior to that
time shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of the Merger
Consideration in respect of such holders shares of Company Common Stock.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Company
shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property Laws. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by holders of
shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

13 _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation
or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Parent
Common Shares (or dividends or other distributions with respect thereto) or
cash in lieu of any fractional Parent Common Shares or cash from the Exchange
Fund, in each case delivered to a public official pursuant to and in
accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

14 _Withholding Taxes_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from
the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant hereto, such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to
the applicable Governmental Authority, such deducted or withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.



 

A - 9 15 _Company Equity Awards_.

(a) _Company Stock Options_. Effective as of the Effective Time, all options
to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock
Plans that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time ("
_Company Stock Options_ ") shall, if unvested, vest in full and become
exercisable, and shall be converted into an option to acquire, on the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under the Company Stock
Option (taking into account accelerated vesting), the number of Parent Common
Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole share) determined by multiplying the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each such Company Stock
Option by the Exchange Ratio, at a price per share of Parent Common Shares
equal to (A) the aggregate exercise price for the shares of Company Common
Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to each such Company Stock Option divided
by (B) the aggregate number of Parent Common Shares deemed purchasable
pursuant to each such Company Stock Option (each, as so adjusted, an "
_Adjusted Option_ "), _provided that_ such exercise price shall be rounded up
to the nearest whole cent and the adjustments provided herein with respect to
any Company Stock Options that are "incentive stock options" as defined in

Restricted Shares_ ") shall vest in full and the restrictions thereon shall
lapse (with any performance goals to be deemed achieved at the maximum level),
and, as of the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock that was
formerly a Company Restricted Share shall be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration determined in accordance with _Section 7_ based on the holders
election in accordance with _Section 8_; _provided_ , _however_ , that, upon
the lapsing of restrictions with respect to each such Company Restricted
Share, the Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold such amounts as
may be required to be deducted and withheld under the Code and any applicable
state or local tax law with respect to the lapsing of such restrictions.

(c) _Company Deferred Units_. At the Effective Time, each right under the
Company Plans (other than the Company 401(k) Plan) of any kind, contingent or
accrued, to acquire or receive Company Common Stock or benefits measured by
the value of Company Common Stock (other than Company Stock Options and
Company Restricted Shares), including, the deferred Company share units held
in the accounts under the Companys Executive Voluntary Deferral Plan and the
Companys Outside Directors Deferral Plan (the " _Deferred Compensation Plans_
") (such rights collectively referred to herein as the " _Company Deferred
Units_ ") shall, at the election of the holder of such right, be converted
into an obligation to pay or provide, at the time specified in the  



 

A - 10  applicable plan, agreement or arrangement, either (x) shares determined
based on a notional investment account denominated in a number of Parent
Common Shares equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Deferred Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time,
times (ii) the Exchange Ratio (" _Adjusted Deferred Units_ ") or (y)
an amount of cash equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Deferred Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time
times (ii) the Per Share Cash Consideration. In either case, such obligation
shall be payable or distributable in accordance with the terms of the
agreement, plan or arrangement relating to such Company Deferred Units (or, if
earlier, on the death of the holder thereof) and, prior to the time of
distribution, such amounts shall be permitted to be deemed invested in the
investment options available under the applicable Company Plan as in effect as
of the date hereof, as elected by each holder. Any holder who does not submit
an election will be deemed to have elected to convert the applicable Company
Deferred Units into Adjusted Deferred Units.

(d) No later than the Closing Date, by virtue of the Merger and without the
need of any further corporate action, Parent shall assume the Company Stock
Plans and the Company Plans under which the Company Deferred Units are
provided, with the result that all obligations of the Company under the
Company Stock Plans and the Company Plans under which the Company Deferred
Units are provided, including with respect to Company Stock Options
outstanding at the Effective Time (adjusted pursuant to _Section 15(a)_) and
Company Deferred Units (adjusted pursuant to _Section 15(c)_), shall be
obligations of Parent following the Effective Time.

(e) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall prepare and
file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement on
Form S-8 (or another appropriate form) registering a number of Parent Common
Shares equal to the number of Parent Common Shares subject to the Adjusted
Options and, if applicable, the Adjusted Deferred Units. Such registration
statement shall be kept effective (and the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses required thereby shall be maintained) at least for so long as
any Adjusted Options or any unsettled awards granted under the Company Stock
Plans or the Company Plans under which the Company Deferred Units are provided
remain outstanding after the Effective Time.

(f) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to
the holders of Adjusted Options and, if applicable, the Adjusted
Deferred Units, appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights
pursuant to the Company Stock Plans and the agreements evidencing the grants
of such Company Stock Options and, if applicable, the Company Plans under
which the Company Deferred Units are provided, after giving effect to the
Merger and the adjustments required by this _Section 15_.

amended by written agreement of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, by action
