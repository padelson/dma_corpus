    ** NBP MEMBERS/JBS S.A. MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT   **  MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT    INTRODUCTION**    This MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " **Agreement** ") is entered into as of February 29, 2008, by and among JBS S.A., a Brazilian sociedade anonima (" **Buyer** "), National Beef Packing Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" **National** "), and (i) U.S. Premium Beef, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" **USPB** "); (ii) French Basin Land and Cattle Co., LLC, a Utah limited liability company (" **French Basin** "); (iii) TKK Investments, LLC, a Missouri limited liability company (" **TKK** "); (iv) S-B Enterprises V, LLC, a Utah limited liability company (" **S-B** "); (v) TMKCo, LLC, a Missouri limited liability company (" **TMK** "); (vi) John R. Miller, an individual (" **Miller** "); (vii) Timothy M. Klein, an individual (" **Klein** "); and (viii) NBPCO Holdings, LLC, a South Dakota limited liability company (" **NBPCO** "). USPB, French Basin, TKK, S-B, TMK, Miller, Klein, and NBPCO are each at times referred to herein as a " **Seller** ," and collectively as the " **Sellers**." Buyer, National and Sellers are referred to individually as a " **Party** " and collectively herein as the " **Parties**." Unless defined herein, capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in **Exhibit A**.  **  RECITALS **   WHEREAS, Sellers in the aggregate own all of the outstanding membership interests in National; and   WHEREAS, this Agreement contemplates a transaction between Buyer and Sellers, in which Sellers will sell to Buyer all of the outstanding membership interests in National in return for cash and Buyer Stock (the " **Sale** ").   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the Recitals, the mutual representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and conditions contained in this Agreement, and in order to set forth the terms and conditions of the Sale of National Interests and the mode of carrying the same into effect, the Parties agree as follows:  **  ARTICLE I   THE PURCHASE AND SALE**    **1.1 Basic Transaction**. On and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer agrees to purchase from each of the Sellers, and each of the Sellers agrees to sell to Buyer, his or its National Interests listed in **Exhibit B** for the consideration specified below in this _Article I_.   **1.2 Purchase Price**. Buyer agrees to pay to each Seller at the Closing the purchase price of the National Interests to be sold by each Seller based on an aggregate value of $560,000,000 for all of the issued and outstanding National Interests at the time of Closing. (The aggregate amount payable to all Sellers hereunder is referred to as the " **Purchase Price** "; the    **SIGNATURE COPY**   1   

    ** NBP MEMBERS/JBS S.A. MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT   amount payable to each Seller is sometimes referred to herein as each " **Seller\'s Purchase Price**.") Buyer and Sellers acknowledge and agree that certain Sellers other than USPB, NBPCO, TMK, TKK, and Klein, will sell all of their National Interests for cash in which case the amount in **Exhibit B** is the cash amount to be paid to those Sellers at Closing. NBPCO, USPB, TMK, TKK and Klein each will sell their National Interests to Buyer for the Seller\'s Purchase Price in  **Exhibit B** to be paid in cash and Buyer Stock in proportion of 80% to be paid in cash and 20% to be paid in Buyer Stock as provided in _Section 1.3_ ; provided, however, NBPCO and Buyer anticipate entering into a separate unrelated transaction at or about the time of execution of this Agreement pursuant to which Buyer will agree that NBPCO will receive all cash and no Buyer Stock for NBPCO\'s National Interests.   **1.3 Buyer Stock**. The amount of Buyer Stock to be issued to Sellers under  _Section 1.2_ will be determined as provided in this _Section 1.3_. The total U.S. Dollar value of the Buyer Stock to be issued to Sellers from **Exhibit B** is $94,964,869 (referred to as the " **JBS Stock Payment Amount** "). The " **JBS Stock Price** " shall be the volume weighted average of the closing per share price of Buyer Stock at the end of each trading day for Buyer Stock on the BOVESPA Exchange for the 20 most recent trading days prior to the Closing, with the share price each trading day, before averaging, adjusted to U.S. Dollars by the United States - Brazil currency exchange rate, as quoted by the average buy/sell rate for Dollars/Reais published by the Central Bank of Brazil on its SISBACEN under PTAX 800, Option 5 the same day closest to the end of the trading day, subject to Buyer\'s covenant in _Section 5.21_. The total number of shares of Buyer Stock that will be issued to Sellers at the Closing (the " **Sellers JBS Stock** ") shall be obtained by dividing the JBS Stock Payment Amount by the JBS Stock Price. Each Seller will receive a number of shares of JBS Stock equal to the Sellers JBS Stock multiplied by the dollar amount of such Seller\'s JBS Stock set forth on **Exhibit B** and divided by the JBS Stock Payment Amount. Any fractional shares resulting from the calculation of the Sellers JBS Stock under this  _Section 1.3_ shall be rounded up to the next whole share. Buyer shall deliver the Sellers JBS Stock in compliance with _Section 4.7_ at the Closing, through delivery to the custodian bank of the Buyer Stock the relevant Order of Transfer Stocks ("Ordem de Transfer encia de Acoes" or "OTA") duly executed by its legal representatives evidencing the Order to Transfer the Sellers JBS Stock to each of the Sellers receiving Buyer Stock as provided in **Exhibit B** , all of which is to effect the registration and ownership of the Sellers JBS Stock in the names and ownership of the applicable Sellers listed in **Exhibit B** on an unencumbered and freely tradable basis at the consummation of the Closing. If Buyer is unable to deliver Sellers JBS Stock to Sellers at Closing as provided in this _Section_   _1.3_ , the Sellers entitled to receive Buyers Stock may demand to close provided the other conditions to Closing are met and be paid the JBS Stock Payment Amount in cash.   **1.4 Time and Place of Closing**. Unless otherwise agreed to by Buyer and Sellers, the Closing will occur at 9:00 a.m. local time on the eleventh Business Day after the date on which the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 6.1_  (insofar as _Section 6.1_ relates to the Antitrust Laws of the United States of America and applicable foreign jurisdictions) is satisfied or waived by the Party entitled to do so (the " **Clearance Date** "); provided, that if on such date, all conditions to the Closing (other than conditions the fulfillment of which are to occur at the Closing) capable of satisfaction prior to the Closing are not then satisfied or waived by the Party entitled to do so (it being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing),    **SIGNATURE COPY**   2

In determining  whether an Indemnified National Party is entitled to indemnification under  this _Section 5.8(a)_ , if requested by the Indemnified National Party, the  determination shall be made by special, independent counsel selected by  National and approved by the Indemnified National Party (which approval  shall not be unreasonably withheld) and who has not otherwise performed  services for National or its Affiliates within the last three years (other  than in connection with such matters).   (b) _Fees and Assistance._ Without limiting the foregoing, in the event  of any claim for indemnification, Buyer and National shall, jointly and  severally;   (i) periodically advance reasonable fees and expenses (including  attorneys\' and other professionals\' fees and expenses) with respect to  the foregoing and pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel  selected by each Indemnified National Party, promptly after statements  therefor are received, provided that the Indemnified National Party to  whom fees and expenses are advanced or for which fees and expenses of  counsel are paid provides an undertaking to repay such advances and  payments if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified National  Party is not entitled to indemnification; and   (ii) vigorously assist each Indemnified National Party in such  defense, and subject to the terms of this _Section 5.8_ , shall cooperate  in the defense of any matter.

The Buyer and National shall have the right  to retain legal counsel of their choosing to represent an Indemnified  National Party (subject to the approval of such Indemnified National Party  which consent is not to be unreasonably withheld by the Indemnified  National Party). If Buyer or National retains legal counsel as provided  above, the Buyer and National will have no liability for any separate legal  counsel chosen by the Indemnified National Party. If the Buyer and  National, or either of them, assumes such defense, the Indemnified National  Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof, it being  understood that the Buyer and National shall control such defense, and in  any such action or proceeding, the Indemnified National Party shall have  the right to retain its own legal counsel, but the fees and expenses of  such legal counsel shall be at its own expense unless (i) the Buyer and  National and the Indemnified National Party mutually agree to the retention  of such legal counsel, or (ii) the named Parties to any such suit, action  or proceeding (including any impleaded Parties) include both the Buyer or  National and the Indemnified National Party, and in the opinion of  recognized outside legal counsel to National, representation of the Buyer  or National and the Indemnified National Party by the same legal counsel  would result in a conflict of interest between Buyer or National, and the  Indemnified National Party. Buyer and National shall be liable only for any  settlement of any claim against an Indemnified National Party made with  Buyer\'s written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,  conditioned, or delayed. Buyer and National shall not, without the prior  written consent of an Indemnified National Party, settle or compromise any  claim, or permit a default or consent to the entry of any    **SIGNATURE COPY**   31   

    ** NBP MEMBERS/JBS S.A. MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT    judgment in respect thereof, unless the settlement, compromise, or consent  includes, as an unconditional term thereof, the giving by the claimant to  the Indemnified National Party of an unconditional release from all  liability and obligations in respect of the claim.   (d) _D and O Liability Insurance_. For a period of three years after the  Closing Date, National shall cause to be maintained in effect the current  policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance and fiduciary  liability insurance maintained by National and its Subsidiaries (provided  that National may substitute therefor policies with one or more reputable  unaffiliated third-party insurers of at least the same coverage and amounts  containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the  insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred  at or before the Closing Time.   (e) _Successors and Assigns_. If Buyer or National or any of their  successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person  and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such  consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially  all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, to  the extent not assumed by operation of law, proper provision shall be made  so that the successors and assigns of Buyer or National, as the case may  be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.8_.   (f) _Survival_. All rights to indemnification and/or advancement of  expenses contained in any agreement with any Indemnified National Party as  in effect on the date of this Agreement with respect to matters occurring  on or prior to the Closing Time (including the contemplated transactions)  shall survive the Closing and continue in full force and effect. Buyer and  National shall indemnify any Indemnified National Party against all  reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys\' and other  professionals\' fees and expenses), the amount to be payable in advance upon  request as provided in _Section 5.8_ , relating to the enforcement of the  Indemnified National Party\'s rights under this _Section 5.8_ or under any  charter, bylaw, operating, or company agreement other governing document or  other agreement, provided that the Indemnified National Party provides an  undertaking to repay any advances of costs and expenses if it is ultimately  determined that the Indemnified National Party is not entitled to  indemnification under these documents.   (g) _No Impairment of Insurance Claims_. Nothing in this Agreement is  intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any  rights to directors\' and officers\' insurance claims under any policy that  is or has been in existence with respect to National or any of its  officers, directors or employees, it being understood and agreed that the  indemnification provided for in this _Section 5.8_ is not prior to or in  substitution for any such claims under such policies.   (h) _Binding on Successors_. The provisions of this _Section 5.8_ shall  survive the Closing and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be  enforceable by, each of the Indemnified National Parties identified in  _Section 5.8(a)_ , their heirs and their personal representatives and shall be  binding on all successors and assigns of Buyer and National and may not be  terminated or amended in any manner adverse to such Indemnified National  Parties without their prior written consent.    **SIGNATURE COPY**   32

(c) _Cooperation._ With respect to each of the above filings, and any  other requests from Governmental Entities the Parties shall diligently and  expeditiously prosecute and use best efforts to obtain any clearance under  the Antitrust Laws for the Sale and to resolve any objections as may be  asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the sale, and cooperate  fully with each other in the prosecution of, such matters including,  subject to Applicable Law, by permitting counsel for the other Party to  review in advance (to the extent possible), and consider in good faith the  views of the other Party in connection with, any such filing or any  proposed or oral written communication with any Governmental Entity and by  providing counsel for the other Party with copies of all filings and  submissions made by such Party and all correspondence between such Party  (and its advisors) with any Governmental Entity and any other information  supplied by such Party and such Party\'s Subsidiaries to a Governmental  Entity or received from such a Governmental Entity in connection with the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Any competitively sensitive  information that is disclosed pursuant to this _Section 5.10(c)_ will be  limited to each of Buyer\'s and National\'s respective outside counsel and  economists pursuant to a separate customary Confidentiality Agreement. Each  of Buyer and National shall furnish to the other such necessary information  and reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection  with its preparation of any such filing or submission.   (d) _Status._ Buyer and National shall keep each other apprised of the  status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for  additional information from, the FTC, the DOJ, any other Governmental  Entity or any third Party with respect to the Sale.

    ** NBP MEMBERS/JBS S.A. MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT     proceeding brought by a private entity or individual, if such suit or  proceeding is likely to impede the Closing.   (e) _Strategy._ Buyer shall not require National or National\'s parent,  USPB, to, and National or National\'s parent, USPB shall not be required to,  take any action with respect to satisfying any Antitrust Laws that would  bind National or its Subsidiaries in the event the Closing does not occur.   (f) _Avoidance of Injunctions._ In addition, Buyer shall use its best  efforts to take all action to resolve any actual or threatened suit brought  by any Governmental Entity and resist any actual suit brought by any other  Person, challenging or threatening to challenge the transaction as  violative of the Antitrust Laws, in the form of a settlement, undertaking,  consent decree, stipulation, or the like, or compliance with any order of  any federal or state court in the United States or any foreign court or  tribunal, in order to avoid the entry of any preliminary injunction or  other order which has the effect of preventing the consummation of the  transaction prior to the Termination Date or delaying consummation beyond  the Termination Date, and in the event that any preliminary injunction or  other order is entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in  any proceeding that would make consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful  or that would prevent or delay consummation of the contemplated  transactions, Buyer shall use its best efforts to promptly, take any and  all steps necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or order  so as to permit such consummation prior to the Termination Date.

If Buyer  fails to take any actions required under the preceding sentence, Buyer  shall pay or cause to be paid to Sellers, as Sellers\' sole and exclusive  remedy for such failure, the Termination Fee on the fifth Business Day  following the date of termination of this Agreement, with the Termination  Fee to be allocated among Sellers in proportion to their respective  holdings of National Interests as set forth on **Exhibit B**. For the avoidance  of doubt, Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to Sellers the Termination  Fee if Buyer does not take any and all actions necessary in order to ensure  that (i) no requirement for a waiver, consent or approval of the FTC, the  DOJ, any state attorney general or other Governmental Entity, or expiration  or termination of any waiting period; (ii) no decree, judgment, injunction,  temporary restraining order or any other order in any suit or proceeding,  involving such Governmental Entity and (iii) no other matter relating to  any antitrust or competition law or regulation would preclude consummation  of the Sale by the Termination Date.

(f) _By Buyer: Act of God._ If an Act of God occurs after execution of  the agreement and before Closing that causes a Material Adverse Effect on  National or its Subsidiaries and is not fully covered and indemnified by  insurance (subject to customary deductibles) under which National or  Subsidiaries are the covered beneficiaries, then Buyer may terminate this  Agreement by written notice to National and Sellers within 10 days of  notice of the act of god;   (g) _Either Party; failure of member/shareholder approval._    Buyer or Sellers may terminate this Agreement if:   (i) the members of USPB do not approve the transactions  contemplated under this Agreement by 30 days after execution of this  Agreement; or   (ii) the shareholders of JBS fail to approve the transactions  contemplated under this Agreement by 30 days after execution of this  Agreement.

    ** NBP MEMBERS/JBS S.A. MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT    (c) _Definitions._ As used in this _Section 8.1_ , the term " **Losses** " means:   (i) all losses, damages, costs and expenses, including interest  from the date of any such loss to the time of payment, and penalties;  and   (ii) any and all out-of-pocket costs including without limitation  reasonable expenses of investigation, reasonable attorneys\' fees (at  trial, on appeal, in connection with any petition for review and in  any agency proceedings) and reasonable consulting, expert and  accounting fees incurred in investigating, defending or prosecuting  any claim.   As used in this _Section 8.1_ , the term " **Material Losses** " means losses attributable to breaches or inaccuracies in any representation or warranty of National which in the aggregate exceed $5,000,000.   (d) _Limitations on Indemnification._ Notwithstanding the foregoing, the  maximum aggregate liability of Sellers under _Section 8.1(a)_ shall be  limited to $100,000,000. Any representation, warranty or schedule that is a  misrepresentation or omission by National constituting actual and knowing  fraud by National in the context in which it was given shall not be subject  to any limitation on liability in _Sections 8.1(c) and 8.1(d)_.   (e) _Seller\'s Obligations._ The obligations of the various Sellers under  this Agreement shall be several and not joint. The maximum amount of each  Seller\'s obligation to indemnify Buyer under _Section 8.1(a)_ is limited to  Seller\'s Portion of the total amount payable to Buyer under _Section 8.1(a)_.  If a Seller is responsible for a breach of a representation and warranty  under _Section 8.1(b)_ that breaching Seller is obligated to indemnify Buyer  under _Section 8.1(b)_.

A  claim for indemnification by Buyer must be made in the appropriate Claim  Period and a claim for indemnification by Buyer from Sellers outside of the  appropriate Claim Period is not valid.

Within 15 Business Days following the end of the 60 day  review period specified above, either each Seller shall pay Buyer the  applicable Seller\'s obligation amount, or Sellers shall reject Buyer\'s  claim for indemnification hereunder. In the event of such a rejection,  Buyer shall have all rights and remedies under law to pursue the claim  subject to the limitations on liability in this Agreement.   (g) _Sole Remedy._ Except for any representation, warranty, or schedule  that is a misrepresentation or omission by National constituting actual and  knowing fraud by National in the context it was given, the Parties  acknowledge and agree that, the sole and exclusive remedy for any breach or  inaccuracy, or alleged breach or inaccuracy, of any representation or    **SIGNATURE COPY**   47

Miller Enterprises III, LLC,  Miller and National regarding aircraft use, expense and reimbursement) and  National and Klein at the date this Agreement is entered into. The  indemnification by Sellers to Buyer under this _Section 8.1(h)_ shall be on a  dollar for dollar basis for each dollar of obligation determined to be owed  by National to Miller or Klein. If Miller or Klein make such a claim to  National, National shall notify Sellers in writing within ten days of  receipt of the claim and the Sellers (other than Miller or Klein to the  extent they made the claim) shall be allowed to participate in the defense  of the claim and must consent to any settlement of the claim.  **  8.2 Limited Survival of Representations, Warranties.**    (a) _Sellers._ Sellers representations, warranties and any certificate  delivered by Sellers pursuant to this Agreement are made as of the  execution of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date, and shall terminate  180 days after the Closing Date or upon the termination of this Agreement  pursuant to _Section 7.1_ , whichever is earlier.

MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT**   afforded to either Party under this Agreement shall be cumulative and in addition to, and not in limitation of, any rights and remedies which the Party may otherwise have under Applicable Law, including any applicable Uniform Commercial Code. The exercise or partial exercise of any right or remedy of either Party under this Agreement or under applicable law shall not preclude or prejudice the further exercise of that right or remedy or the exercise of any other right or remedy of the Party.

Shall have no obligation to purchase force majeure cattle unless the logistics and financial components of purchasing such cattle (such as delivering to another plant within a reasonable distance to the plant affected by the force majeure event) would be substantially the same to Beef Co. as they would have been without the occurrence of the force majeure event. Beef Co. shall notify USPB in writing if Beef Co. will not purchase Force Majeure Cattle and must offer to purchase the force majeure cattle with the pricing adjustments to compensate Beef Co. for the actual additional costs incurred over the purchase without the Force Majeure Event.   **10.
